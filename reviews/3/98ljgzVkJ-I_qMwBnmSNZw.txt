I grew up in a small, Central Wisconsin city where for years the battle for the top Mexican restaurant in town was waged between Taco John's and Taco Bell. In 1991, I left for college in Madison with the opinion that Taco John's had the best Mexican food, ever. Then I stepped into Pasqual's for the first time. The tacos, burritos and especially the enchiladas, were a true awakening. They helped turn this small-town boy into a cosmopolitan man. I changed that day, but unfortunately Pasqual's, too, has changed over the years. 

Maybe it's because so many authentic restaurants, owned by real Mexicans, have opened over the years and changed my expectations (probably). Maybe it's because Paqual's isn't what it once was (perhaps). Maybe it's because I'm more cosmopolitan than ever (hell no). Whatever it is, I now find Pasqual's to be good, not great. 

It's close. It's clean. It's convenient. The atmo is authentic; I feel like I'm just a few blocks from Santa Fe. The chili cheese dip is the best thing ever and their salsa is rad. The burgers are better than the Southwestern entrees. I love the sauce on the chorizo burger. The brunch is better than the Southwestern entrees. The huevos rancheros kick ass and the blue corn pancakes make me happy. The chili verde is great on a cool, damp day. The salads are fresh. The beans and rice are too salty. I don't like the pulled chicken filling for a reason I can't quite pinpoint; not a huge fan of the beef either but it beats the chicken. My wife loves the quesadilla. I don't. I blame the chicken. 

Overall, there's enough that's good to eat. I'm glad Pasqual's is back in Verona and we go there quite often.
