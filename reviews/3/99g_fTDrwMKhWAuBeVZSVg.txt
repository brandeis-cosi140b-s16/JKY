Had an early dinner here earlier today. The food was good as always. That burrito was as big as my head! I had the Barbacoa with extra rice and beans with everything but guac. Crazy yummy! 

The reason why I'm writing this review is because I found this Chipotle to be more dirtier than the other locations I've been to. Most of the tables haven't been wiped down and had bits of cheese and salsa on the (ew) and the soda station had a stack of napkins on it where an employee tried to fill the napkin holder, gave up and then just left a stack of napkins on top of the holder and napkins were all over the station and ground. It was like that when we got there and it wasn't until we were about to leave that they were even cleaned up. 

I used the restroom and that was dirty too! With hair and toilet paper everywhere and a very dirty mirror. I was like.. WTF?! The south side location is waaay cleaner than this one!! So much for Chandler being the "good side of town" - well... atlease in comparison to the South Side. lol. I unno, the food was great (as are all Chipotles) but the whole place was unclean. 

To my yelpers, if you're in that area - especially the mall, Chipotle is prolly your safest bet for a good place to eat. But be sure to bring some wet naps so you can wipe down your table, you'll thank me later!
