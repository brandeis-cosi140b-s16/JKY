Food: 2 stars
Service: 5 stars

Mom is visiting from out of town and loves mexican food. We didin't have time to hit our usual spots last Tuesday night so I suggested Top Shelf. We live close, it was close to our utlimate destination so we went. I already knew what to expect from Yelp reviews and speaking with friends. 

The food: Nothing was "bad", it just wasn't great. The salsa was good, not spicy enough for my taste but it was really good. The chips...not so good. Many of them tasted kind of burnt? 
Mom had a chimichanga and I had grilled mahimahi fish tacos. The chimi was ok. The tacos were ok as well. Small pieces of fish and they were absolutely loaded with shredded lettuce. The rice was bland but the beans were good. They don't use lard so that is a plus for me. 

The service was great. Our server, Penny was fast, attentive and friendly. She kept our glasses full and promptly brought more salsa for us.
