I saw the menu before heading over and thought the price was for a smaller size burrito. But when I bought 4 of them and tried them at home, they only had one ingredient wrapped in tortilla. I thought they would have at least cheese in them. I feel like these were getting close to those dollar burritos. Not a type of burrito that I was thinking about and won't be craving them anytime soon. And they close very early.
