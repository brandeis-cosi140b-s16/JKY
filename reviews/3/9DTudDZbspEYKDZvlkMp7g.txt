I'm always up for trying new places and my boyfriend loves Mexican so we thought we would venture out of our norm and try some place new.

This place has a huge menu and the prices range along with it. Their lunch prices are what you would expect but if you don't find what you want there you'll pay a premium for their dinner prices. They have Mexican, Honduras and other south/central American food.

The food was very good. Had great presentation, great flavor, and huge portions.

The staff was friendly but the food took a long time. I probably wouldn't have noticed if we had chips and salsa to munch on. Our drinks were never refilled even though they sat empty half way through our meal.

The highlight to any Mexican meal is the chips and salsa. Theirs ended up being very good but we didn't think they served any until we saw a near by table get some. At that point we already had our meals!
