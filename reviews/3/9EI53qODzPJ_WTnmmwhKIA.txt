Pretty cool truck. 

Charlotte tends to have this "hip and trendy" factor that drives business. I'm glad Maki hasn't resorted to flashy paint schemes and marketing propaganda to lure victims. Keepin' the truck design simple, classic and cool like the OG Kogi truck and relying on their food to run their show. 

I applaud them for staying true. That's a real hipster right there. 

The downside of all that is if you're food is crap, well...

The bulgogi tacos are by far the best thing I ate. That is worth a trip to the truck. 
The bang bang shrimp though - simply sloppy and that sauce...well..can we say Thousand Island?

Spicy chicken was just that. Tasty, but nothing special. Hibachi chicken in a tortilla.

Still, I enjoyed the show and I'm glad to have another food truck option. 

Stay true Charlotte.
