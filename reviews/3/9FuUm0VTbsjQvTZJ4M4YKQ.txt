Came here about a week ago, and it was pretty good.  I believe the place just opened up, so they didn't have alcohol available yet, but they were working on acquiring a liquor license. 

The place is very neat and also very spacious. I believe they are adding in a patio area as well. 
The owners/employees are very attentive and very nice. 

Come check this place out if you want good and authentic mexican food, in a quiet and nice part of town.
