I have been coming to this place since the mid 90's probably around the time that some of these other reviewers were in diapers so I know what I'm talking about with this place.  We once challenged our good friend to eat 10 brain tacos and he took the challenge.  My other friend eats the lengua and that's the taco that tastes you back my friend, 

I eat the bean and rice burrito and can say that it's good,  the salsa bar is nice with the little cups and I do recommend the red sauce.  The neighborhood is typical east side so nothing to worry about, years back there was a guy that just sat in the booth and sold bootleg Spanish cassette tapes of Mexican corridas music 

You can her horchata and it's a great place because it's 24 hours
