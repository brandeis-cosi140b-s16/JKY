So yes the lady that cooks is really good at cooking real Mexican home made meals the only thing i asked to use the restroom and as i was walking to the back where its at and i got very scared and disgusted that that kitchen was so dirty and i can only imagine where my food was cooked so as i was grabbing a toilet seat cover i came across a big cockroach it was so scary and ran out of the restroom and didn't finish my food i don't think i will ever go back they need to deep clean that back kitchen its so gross ... Even tho the lady does know how to cook with great taste she needs to get them workers  cleaning because its not worth loosing ur business for not keeping it clean i mean it is a restaurant just saying ....
