Had lunch here.

Service was pretty good. They were very good about ensuring we had enough chips and salsa.

(Providing chips and salsa should be a mandatory thing for mexican food places, but I've actually been to some that don't.

I haven't been back.)

Ordered a green chile burrito, enchilada style, and split it with my girlfriend.

Honestly, for the price, I was expecting something more.

A teaspoonful of refriend beans, and perhaps an ounce of rice, accompanied a burrito that couldn't have been more than maybe 6 or 8 ounces.

The flavor was good, and the food was delicious, but the value was certainly lacking.

It's not likely that I'll return. Which is unfortunate for them and me, given I work just a few blocks away.
