Went for dinner - ordered deep fried burro - dripping in sour cream and totally tasteless. I thought it came with rice and beans but nothing but a spoonful of lettuce and tomatoes.  My son had the combination plate of tamale, taco rice and beans and he said it was very good.  I just won't order the burro next time.  I think a little overpriced - $10 for a burro!  Nice atmosphere and friendly staff; quick service. Don't know abut the tv - we didn't go in the bar.  Good parking. ther review said mild and spicy salsa?  We only got mild.
