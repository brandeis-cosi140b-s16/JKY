Enjoyed this small restaurant. Taste was authentic and prices were average. Easy parking and access. I ordered a soda and it was a can. They needed a fountain soda instead. The three carne asada tacos were good and filling while the convo plates were more than enough food. Loved the cheeses used but some items were different. Enchiladas looked like a flat taco. Cheese crisp was deep fried. I'd come back with a coupon.
