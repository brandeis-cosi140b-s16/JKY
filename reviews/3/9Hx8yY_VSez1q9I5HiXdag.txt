We flew into Phoenix and had to drive up to Sedona, but first: lunch. Gallo Blanco was a quick detour off of the 17 via the 10, and it's easy to find if you have a smartphone or a GPS, but it would be hard to find just with eyeballs and a compass.  We sat in the shade on the patio. Our friend said he'd just have a coke, but instead ordered two tacos - he went insane that night, and in retrospect his waffling on tacos vs. coke may have foreshadowed what was to come. I had three tacos - pork and tuna, my wife had a couple of tacos and a salad, and I had a side of guac. The waiter warned me that the side of guac didn't come with chips, but then another waiter brought out chips anyway, so it all worked out. A note about the pork tacos in Phoenix: they are fruity. There's pineapple in the al pastor, like more than I'm used to, so be aware of that if you're coming from a city where you've grown used to not-too-pineapply al pastor. Overall everything was delicious and it's worth seeking this place out if you're in Phoenix.
