This will be a quickie. I stopped in last night with a friend to see if this place was any good and worth checking out again. We had already eaten, so we just had chips and salsa and a margarita. I plan on returning to sample the menu, but until then I'm giving this a pass fail sort of review.

It passed.

Service was good and the place is nice inside. The chips and salsa were okay. I wasn't blown away by the salsa, but I enjoyed it. That's more than I can say for most places. The house margarita was merely okay as well. Nothing special. It was served in a stupid shaped glass which was annoying, but I drank it and can't complain.

I'll return sometime soon for a full meal, but I'm not going to bank on this place topping my list of great Mexican food. The search continues.
