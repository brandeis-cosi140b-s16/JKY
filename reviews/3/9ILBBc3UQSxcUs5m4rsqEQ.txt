We came on a Friday night and ordered 
1. Friday Special, 13.95
2. Seafood enchilada, 13.95
for 22.05 (50% off one item with the Casino Guide Coupon) 

- Inside Tuscany casino. We were seated immediately. 
- Service was fast. There were only other diners, other than us. 
- As we waited for our food, we received complimentary bean dip and salsa with chips. Chips and salsa were fresh. Chips were crispy and warm. Bean dip was delicious and the salsa had chunks of ripe tomatoes. 
- As we ate, awkwardly a guitarist and lady singer started playing in front of us. The duet was pleasant, but at least introduce to us what's about to happen! haha. Literally, we were talking and then they started doing their act. LOL. No "Hello, How's dinner, we're going to play a couple songs." Just BAM. SING. 
- Friday special included a sirloin steak and salmon with 2 sides, a soup, and warm tortillas. I ordered the steak medium, and it came out well-done. They took it back and it came less well-done. haha. Salmon was a bit over-cooked as well. 
- Seafood enchilada was delicious. I recommend this over the special. 
- Overall, the food is not much an upgrade from something like Robertos. I prefer Casa Don Juan in downtown more, but for convenience, this can do.
