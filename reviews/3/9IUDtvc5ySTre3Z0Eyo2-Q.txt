We have dined here a few times during happy hour, and it's always busy. The service is decent, the food is very affordable (there is nothing on the menu over $8.00!), and they have a full bar with decent specials. The salsa bar is fantastic! The food is pretty bland, but for the price I can't complain. The dining area is pretty small; not a place you want to go with a large group of people. There are TVs so you can catch the game while enjoying a drink with friends. They are open everyday for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Overall, it's an okay place, very close to home.
