A friend and I were visiting from San Diego and decided to get some burritos. This was the first place we spotted on the side of the road. Maybe Arizona Mexican food is different than California Mexican food but the burritos were not great at all. I got the chile reano burrito and it had nothing but the chile and guacamole in it. I was expecting maybe beans and cheese too but nope. My friend got the carne asada and it had nothing but meat in it. We also had to wait a really long time in the drive through when there was no one ahead of us or in the actual restaurant. It was 2 am and I feel like I shouldn't have to wait that long. Won't be a go to spot next time I'm in the area.
