I pass by this corner about once a week right about lunch time and while there are several interesting looking options on the Southwest corner they are hard to get in to traveling West.  I will on occasion stop at the Burger King on the Northwest corner.  A discount coupon popped up last week for this place and while I did not buy the coupon I took note of where it was and went looking for it today.

The address places it on Indian School when in fact it is unit 1 in a meandering strip mall and it actually faces 43rd Ave.  Parking right in front is crowded so it is better to park in the big open area by Payless shoes and walk up.

Getting there just after 11 the place was almost full and there was a steady stream of customers the whole time I was there.

I got the Mexicana torta which had grilled steak, onions, bell pepper along with cheese and a generous amount of avocado. I also had the soup of the day which was mostly shredded, seasoned chicken in a broth.  Both were pretty good.  I washed those items down with a pretty good Horchata.  

It helps to be able to count to 100 in Spanish here or you may miss when your number is called, the majority of the customers were Hispanic.  Everybody I dealt with was friendly.  They open at 8 for breakfast.  It seems they also offer baked goods for sale here.  Both the food and the location are good enough, I will be back to try out some other items.
