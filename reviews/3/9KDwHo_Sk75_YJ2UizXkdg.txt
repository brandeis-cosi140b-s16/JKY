After having some Baja Fresh at the San Diego Airport on a recent trip, I was in the mood to have it again, so I stopped by this location.  After browsing the menu, I decided to try something new and ordered a Nacho Burrito (Chicken, Jack & Cheddar cheese, Pinto Beans, Rice, Smoky Queso Fundido, Jalapenos, Salsa, $6.79).

While I was waiting for my food, I got some of the Spicy Salsa from the Salsa Bar.

The Nacho Burrito was OK, not great.  I wasn't too impressed with it.  It has a lot of potential, but just didn't seem to be as tasty as I had imagined.  The Salsa, which was supposed to be Spicy, was mild....bummer.

Overall, it was an average visit for Baja Fresh.
