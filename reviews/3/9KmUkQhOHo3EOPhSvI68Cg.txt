Welcome to Moe's!

Since I moved from south Charlotte some years ago, my random Moe's cravings would only be satisfied while on one of my few and far between jaunts through Dilworth.  And even those were sometimes handicapped with the shootings that closed it from time to time.

So when I saw last week that they were opening one at the Epicentre (GO SIT IN THE CORNER!), I knew I was going to venture over for lunchtime goodness.

The place is still new and there was a line around almost the entire interior of the restaurant.  This lead to about a 15 minute wait for me to place my order for a Joey Bag of Donuts (I usually go with a Homewrecker).  I think my order was transformed to a Homewrecker since the only real difference is the cost of sour cream and guacamole.

It was just as tasty as I remembered.  Fresh-ish ingredients, good amount of steak, slightest tinge of spice to their guac.

It was a semi-register friendly meal, too.  With a side of queso and a drink only ran me a touch over eight pesos, making it one of my cheaper lunchtime, uptown meals. 

There IS a bottleneck after check out though.  This revolutionary soda machine is baffling to some.  Boasting 100 flavor combinations, its an all in one Coke machine.  With only one spout.  So if someone is perplexed by the five different flavored Coke combos, you can get a logjam, quick.  I went with a regular Coke, raspberry Coke, cherry Coke combo that wasn't too shabby, and the future diabetics of Charlotte would look back on such a drink fondly.

Seating is an okay mix of two tops, four tops, booths and bar along the windows.  Once the excitement of being new wears off, this will be easier to deal with...
