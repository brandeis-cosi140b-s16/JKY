I hadn't been to Pedro's in years, since I lived in the area. It was never one of my favorite places in Madison, but I did enjoy it occasionally. I'm generally underwhelmed by the Americanized Mexican places that dot maps of most towns.

Having just returned from a trip to Seattle and wanting to sit down in an air conditioned building and have some okay food, my dad recommended Pedro's. It seemed like a fine option at the time. Not terribly adventurous, but I just had my adventure and I had to accommodate my dad's less-than-thrill-seeking palette.

The salsa was actually better yesterday than I ever remember it being in the past. It was very thick and tomato-ey, with just a tiny hint of kick. I'd have preferred it to be a bit hotter, myself, but again, being with the parental unit meant keeping to something a bit more tame.

I had the asada burrito, and my dad had the chili burrito. Mine was fine; long strips of pepper and onion mixed in with some cubed steak (actually, I would recommend cutting the veggies to about half their length...they're too easy to pull completely out of the tortilla when you go to get a bite). I had a side of refried beans and rice; these were obviously simple sizes for the cooks because they were clearly just microwaved. It was easy to tell because the rice was pretty dry. The chili burrito was exactly what my dad was hoping for, so there's that.

All in all, if you know what you're in for it's very standard American-Mexican fare. 

As an aside, the previous time I was here a few years ago they had this fantastically gay waiter named Jimmy. He was outrageously friendly and chatty and actually sat down at our booth with us to chat about Plan B and the LGBT scene in Madison. It was a fun time!
