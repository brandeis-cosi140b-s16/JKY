Gotta love the dbacks special... Every time they score 6 runs,  its 3 free tacos with a drink the next day... And thats the only reason I come here.   The meat is tasty and seasoned well,  but I can't help but think I could make better tacos at home.  OK,  so It's probably cheaper and deffently easier to get the Dbacks special,  so I'll be back to Taco Bell the next time the Dbacks score 6 runs.  Average food for a way better than average price,  what more can you ask for?
