Went here while I was on vacation in Vegas. I have allergies so I prefer to go to Chipotle when it isn't to crowded and they are able to change gloves and take precautions. During my five days I was there I tried come in around 3:00pm two different days and the line was out the door. Usually this is the prime time for me to go, but not at this location. Finally I tried going at 11:00am one day and the line was quite a bit shorter. The employees changed gloves and handled my order fine, the only issue I had was my rice was under cooked which was disappointing, because this rarely happens at Chipotle. They also made my bowl relatively small compared to most locations I visit.
