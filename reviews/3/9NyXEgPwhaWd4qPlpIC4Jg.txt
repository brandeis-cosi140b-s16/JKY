I like this Taco Bell! It was completely renovated about 4-5 years ago after burning down so it's nice inside. Great flavor in the steak cantina bowl, $5, but I almost asked for more rice and lettuce cause they didn't really fill up the bowl. Love the new salsa verde packets!!!! They're by the hot sauce. Will be back of course.
