we went here because of a groupon deal. we had to go twice because we didn't see that the day we chose the first time was excluded (oops). margaritas were good, food was good, portions were large enough to take home for left overs. they have a super delicious dulce de leche cake.

they have this cute little upstairs seating area that you get to via spiral staircase. i want to try sitting up there sometime but the location is too far from us to go regularly.
