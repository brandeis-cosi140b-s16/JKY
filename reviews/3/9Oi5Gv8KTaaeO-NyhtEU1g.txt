I've eaten here a couple of times...not really because it's that great of a restaurant but because they always offer Buy 1 Get 1 coupons. I know that sounds awful; I'm compromising the quality of meal for price but it's a great deal if I am craving sit down Mexican food and don't have a ton of money to spend. The food isn't bad, it's just nothing special. But their cheese enchilada is good and their rice is pretty good. Chips and salsa are good. I no longer eat meat but their shredded beef taco was also pretty tasty. The service is usually okay, no one goes over the top to be super friendly but it's satisfactory. This seems like a pretty big restaurant but I've only seen one part of the dining room, which usually isn't very full. Overall, if you're not looking for a meal to change your life, just want some Mexican food to satisfy a craving and you want something easy on your wallet, this is a pretty good choice.
