This is a great place to grab lunch at UNLV.  The tacos are homemade, which is nice! The only downside is you may have to wait 5-10 minutes before your order is ready. It's worth the wait. 

What I love about this place is you cannot get a traditional taco. The unique options are crafted so deliciously that I often forget I am eating a taco. My go-to choices are the Bombay, Sicilian, and the veggie (the no tofu one) tacos. 

The best way to take advantage of the special is to order the 4 tacos, 2 sides, and drink special. When you present your UNLV card, you automatically get $1 - $1.50 off. I still haven't figured out how the discount is taken. I have a "usual" and sometimes my total is $6 and sometimes it's $7. 

I am a bit disappointed in the side dishes. I've tried the fries, the black beans, the quinoa salad, and the guacamole. The sides are passable, but I generally order a double of the garden salad. It's probably better to eat a lighter side dish, since the tacos are very filling.
