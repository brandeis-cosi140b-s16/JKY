Great outdoor beach atomsphere.  Unfortunately the beer was very warm and soda flat.  Service was good and friendly waitstaff.  The crowd was college all the way to grandparents.  A lot of fake boobs, almost too many....  But overall an ok place and if the beer was cold, I would give this place a 4 star.  Music after 10 was great, old and new hip hop.  I will definitely go back in search of some colder beer.  Oh yeah, plenty of nice HDTV's to watch sports.
