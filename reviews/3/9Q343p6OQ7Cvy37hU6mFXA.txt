located in the back of the grand canal in venetian.  a little quieter than the main piazza de san marco area.  from the patio seating, you can watch gondolas making u's at the end of the grand canal and gondoliers singing serenade. we had a yummy pork chop and shrimp enchilada, but other menu looked as enticing.
