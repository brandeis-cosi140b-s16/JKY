The place has great Margaritas IF you can go on the days that they drink specials. But in my opinion, a basic margarita should not cost $8. As much as I want to like the food, it's just not that great. Growing up in Texas, I know what good Tex-Mex is and this place just doesn't cut it. The staff is wonderful and friendly and the atmosphere is pretty cool also but the food is just not up to my standards.
