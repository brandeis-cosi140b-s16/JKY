Really good fast food. They have great service. Willing to give you extras and make you feel like your not overpaying. But at a 1.50 surcharge for guacamole they aren't fooling anyone. I cant dock them for the freshness- meat is always top notch and unlike Taco Bell- doesn't give you explosive diarrhea.
