This is a higher-end restaurant for mexican food. So the food may be a bit pricey. We came after happy hour which end at 6:30pm. When I walked in, I was pretty impressed with the design with low-light setting. Only thing is that if a table next to you order anything-grill, you'll be overwhelmed by the smokey smell. 

We end up ordering Combination Fajita and Fish tacos. I was kind of disappointed in the food. I think there was only 3 tortilla wraps that come with it, in which we end up having to order extra wraps. Also, the wraps is kind  of small to fill up all the meats I want in it. The taste was kind of bland, not much taste unless you dip in the salsa sauce that comes with the tortilla chips. Same with the fish tacos, it was crispy but the fish meat is very bland. 

As for the service, it was good, we had a friendly waiter guy who's friendly and attentive.

One thing that stand out is that they serve Margarita in a big margarita cup
