Yummy, delivered Mexican food- what else can you ask for? They do have a $20 minimum with a $3 delivery charge, but that's expected for quick door service. We ordered the cheese enchilada plate, carne asada burrito, rolled tacos with cheese and guac, and a side of chips and salsa. My two complaints had to do with the dryness of the burrito (stuffed with meat and rice) and the beans with the combination dinner. We had no issue receiving out food within the 45 minute window and the driver was extremely nice. I would recommend them if you're in the delivery area.
