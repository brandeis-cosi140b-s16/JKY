Flicka's was quiet, not many people. Flicka was there interacting with guests which was great. Coronas are always 2.50 which was great. Fridays you get a free buffet dinner with the purchase of 2 drinks...we bought two cheap Coronas and got a plate of decent food. It was a steal for sure. 

The salsa here is awesome, I loved it! Too bad it wasn't free chips and salsa. The food wasn't bad, it wasn't anything super awesome. Pretty basic. I would come again on some random Friday. The atmosphere was  chill and the patio was enjoyable.
