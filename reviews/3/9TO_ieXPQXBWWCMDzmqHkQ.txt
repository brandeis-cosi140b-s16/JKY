Mexican food on a Saturday night!

We ordered delivery through the eat-cu service because they had a couple of coupons available for Don Juan.

The ordering website was a little tricky to work especially trying to apply the coupons but after we got all that figured out it was fairly easy and our food was delivered in a very speedy ~45 minutes.

I got steak fajitas with rice and black beans while my roommate opted for a steak burrito with rice and refried beans. They also included some chips and salsa with our order too!

The chips looked pretty good but they were a little greasy and kind of flakey in consistency. Probably would have been much better if they were warm but its hard to expect that from delivery. The salsa was not very good, kind of watery and generally lacking.

We were able to choose 2 sides with our orders and we both chose rice and black/refried beans, respectively. Since I got the fajitas though, one of the side options was tortilla shells. This was kind of weird because if I actually wanted to make fajitas I'd have to give up one of my other side selections just to get the shells. But this didn't really bother me because I would have rather had 2 sides and no tortillas anyway. Just a heads up though to all you fajita connoisseurs! The steak meat itself wasn't bad, it mixed well with the peppers and onions but still wasn't anything to really write home about. We both agreed the rice was very bland. My favorite part of the meal had to be the black beans; they were thick, kind of creamy and delicious!

Overall, it was average. I can't complain about the price because we did get a fairly good deal with the coupon even including tip and delivery fee. Without the coupon though, I'd say it's probably overpriced. Still a much better experience than the food I got from Torticas/Burrito King a couple months ago, that stuff was really awful!

Perhaps I should try something else or maybe eat in the restaurant next time.
