We have ate her twice in the last 4  months, both times were prior to a D back and Suns game. It is a great spot to stop and satisy your hunger with thier mexican food. Food is good and portions are fair. On both separate occasions, I have to say that their service was extra fast. Both times, we only had enough time to go to the restroom and when we returned, food was at our table. It was the quickest service, which is a huge plus when your trying to get to a game!
