The food here comes in large portions and everything tastes pretty good.  I wouldn't call it authentic, but I enjoy the eclectic look and feel of the place, the friendly staff and that the food is made to order.

I've  tried the chicken burrito and the chicken quesadilla.  Both were huge.  Each is enough for two girls to split as a meal.  I like that they give sour cream on the side with their quesadilla.  Mmmm, more fat to ladle onto my cheesy fat pie.  

Their salsa bar is pretty standard, not always the freshest looking pico de gallo, but a solid place to drop by, fill up and feel satisfied.
