I really wanted to like this place because of all the raving reviews. I came here on a Thursday evening for happy hour. The bar area was pretty busy and we found seats at the hi-top table. We ordered the crab guacamole, sushi rolls, shishito peppers, and the bacon wrapped dates. The only dish I would come back for is the guac.... But for the price I'd rather go elsewhere. The sushi was okay buy nothing to come back for. 
Would I come back here you ask?? Sorry, sumo you wouldn't be my first choice.
