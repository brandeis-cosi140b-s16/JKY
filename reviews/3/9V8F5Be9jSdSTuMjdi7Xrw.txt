Not too bad, been here dozens of times before. 

Got here at 12:30 on a Sunday, were seated immediately on the patio. First of all, I was somewhat embarrassed that I've been here so many times and never knew they served breakfast! I guess it's because I always came for dinner. (They stop serving breakfast at 2, in case you were wondering) Couldn't decide what to get on the lunch menu, so I resorted to breakfast. I had the Gringo Breakfast, which is a pretty basic breakfast plate. It was tasty, a little bit on the smaller side when it comes to portions.

The only reason I give it three stars instead of four is because the food took a long time to get out. I understand that things happen and there may be a million other tables, but it was pretty slow today and didn't seem like there was much going on. Our waitress, Michelle, was very friendly about it though, so not a big deal. Not too bad, I will for sure come back, as I always do.
