This is the closet to Roberto's I'll get in my neck of the woods. It is what it is but what it is is different, but then again I think a lot of jumbo burrito places like this have all changed just a little from what they use to be in their glory days. 

I remember driving home at 4 in the morning after a long night of partying and stopping by the 24hours taco shop to get these amazing fat I mean FAT burritos and carne Asada tacos withe tons of flavor and now they are all just meh. Enough to sad tidy your craving but not what it use to be.

This place is just like that. Like other locations the carne Asada is never crispy and a little on the salty side like I like then and the Asada fries....I am forming a sad face now the fries no matter how many times I ask them to fry the fries just so it's more crispy it still comes out soggy when they serve it, with now taste. I think they should salt the fries a little before adding the topping. 

Anyhow the chimichanga is good like everything else they serve it's all good just not amazing. I come here a lot because I so like them although the size of the burrito seems more mans more smaller them Roberto's. 

I wish they would be consistent!
