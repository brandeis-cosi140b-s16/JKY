My wife and I used to eat at Chipotle all the time until we visited this location. Now she won't eat it at all anymore and I am on the fence. I keep getting hard gristle in my steak and it feels like I am always in a short line for a long time. Other Chipotles move a lot quicker. Also, the layout of this location is terrible. You walk through the front door and the register is straight ahead so you have to weave through the dining area to get to the other end of the counter where you order. Also, the dining area is not family-friendly so this place is only good for takeout.
