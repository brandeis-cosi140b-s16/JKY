Taco John's is far from being authentic or gourmet, but for a fast-food gringo taco chain I really don't think it's too bad. It seems to be something like what people say Taco Bell was in the '70s and '80s: greasy and filling without being too artificial-tasting.

I didn't really find the place to be especially dirty, or the server to be any less polite than I'd have expected. I guess the table-service aspect could be making people pay more attention to politeness/impoliteness than they would otherwise.
