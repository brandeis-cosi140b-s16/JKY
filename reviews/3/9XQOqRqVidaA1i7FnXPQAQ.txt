This restaurant location used to be El Mas Sabroso. Sadly, El Mas Sabroso is permanently closed. This is the new Mexican joint there now.  They cleaned it up a bit and redecorated/remodeled. Kinda like Filiberto's, but nicer and more modern inside. I think they were going for the Chipotle's look. Their food is good and the pricing is about the same. Carnitas was really dry which is odd. Rice is outstanding.

Like Filiberto's, the burritos come with pure meat. Wanna add rice or beans? It'll cost ya! Wait... they have to remove meat to fit the rice/beans. Rice and beans are cheaper than meat! Why on earth would anyone charge more money when they are saving money??!?  Senseless.
