All I can say is "meh".

I have been here on several occasions and I'm never impressed.  However...the environment is cool...the food and service leave a lot to be desired!  

I should probably mention that I do not eat here...strictly a happy hour place.  I had a HORRIBLE experience at one of their other locations a few years ago...one so bad that even after several years, I refuse to eat the food.
