I eat on the run a lot, so I depend on joints like Taco Bell to keep my hunger on standby.  I've been to this one a few times.  They're fast, accurate, and put a little extra ingredients in the Burritos.  My normal order:

7 Layer Burrito - $1.99
Cheesy Beans & Rice Burrito - $1.59

It's a Taco Bell...earning more than 3 Stars would take a lot.
