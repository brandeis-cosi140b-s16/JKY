If there was ever a place that deserved a 3.5 star rating Apache Taco Shop would be it. I'd have to say that their salsa bar is easily the stand out at Apache. They make a mean tomatillo sauce with a whallop of flavor and just enough heat to get the nose running. As for the rest, nothing spectacular.

After trying their carne asade I'd have to say I'm not a fan. It's just flat out bland compared to the other meats they have. I'd personally stick with the chicken. The chicken is heavily seasoned and goes well with the sauces they offer and their style of burrito.

Their burritos are not made like your average run of the mill burritos. The only ingredients that they put in their burritos are the meat of your choice, beans, rice, and pico de gallo. No cheese, lettuce, sour cream, or guacamole. For an additional charge you can add those extras on. But sitting at under five dollars a burrito, you can't really complain much.

Not a bad spot to grab a burrito during your lunch break but don't expect to have your mind blown.
