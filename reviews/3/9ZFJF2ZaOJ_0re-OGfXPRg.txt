Went there on a groupon for dinner and the comedy show.  The food was respectable but nothing great.  Think your basic Mexican joint with the standard burrito/taco/chimichangas.  Service was good even thought the server looked like she was going to be overbooked in the comedy room she did a great job of handling everyone.  The comedy itself was pretty bland but that's a different review.
