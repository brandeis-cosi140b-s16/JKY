Just regular Mexican tacos with the usual meats replaced with Korean meats

Beef Bulgogi Tacos with Kimchi
- dry bulgogi, kimchi had a weak flavor

Pork Belly Tacos with Kimchi
- dry pork belly, I preferred the beef ones

Pork Bulgogi Chimichanga
- topped with pico and the insides were like a regular burrito except with asian marinated meat, also dry

I like where they were going with this idea, however I expected a little more fusion like places in SF or NYC (adding gochujang sauce or incorporating banchan).  This could easily be a 4 star if the food was a little more juicier.
