The first time I ate here was when a friend of mine recommended it to me for their pupusas. That day I was surprised, it was very good. The second time back, months later, it was not good at all. The pupusas were very flat & cheaper out, the flavor wasn't there.

Tasteless slaw & salsa with flat pupusas? 
Boring. 

Going back to looking for a new pupusas spot y'all !
