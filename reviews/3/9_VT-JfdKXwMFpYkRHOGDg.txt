This place left me scratching my head. Came here for lunch on Taco Tuesday and it was understandably very busy. I don't really understand the hype for this place. Overpriced all around. If it wasn't Taco Tuesday I would have been mad for spending full price. The guac was most disappointing to me - it was way too mild for my taste and pretty expensive. 

The decor is awesome though! Definitley no major complaints but also wouldn't be dying to come back any time soon. Way too many other great spots in town for good tacos.
