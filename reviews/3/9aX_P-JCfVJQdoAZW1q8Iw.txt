Located in a colorful Small Shack on side of the road in a sadly depressed industrial area of Mesa. You may see people pushing a cart with their belongings or scrap metals at a slow pace while humming a cosmic tune or talking to an invisible companion from outside this realm.

Inside this small wonder they offer an assortment of tasty Tacos, Burritos, Tortas, Quesadillas, and Sonoran Hot dogs. Fresh Salsas are made daily and displayed along with pickled red onions, radishes, and other yummies at the Salsa bar.

I had to try the bacon wrapped Sonoran Hot dogs loaded with everything and some Tacos al Pastor on the side just to see if I was missing anything. I really liked the Mexican style hot dog bun that was used. It was sweeter than your normal grocery bun. Very simple and tasty. Don't forget a trip to the salsa bar to dress up you dog or tacos which helps kick the flavors up a notch. Service was friendly and quick and inside was clean and tidy.

Definitively A-OK and then some. Worth the drive when you need a Mexican Style Hot Dog. CASH ONLY. Delicioso!
