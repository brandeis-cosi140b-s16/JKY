Ordered 2 items. 

Best thing to come out was the chips and salsa that were comp w the meal. Crispy and delicious but doable at home. 

Jim's Bulgogi Fried Rice - very large serving. Fried in sesame oil which I like. Very good but not necessarily unique or hard to find. 

Pork belly Fusion Taco - Disappointing. 
Pork belly = Meat and Fat
Hot pork belly fat is heaven on the roof of your mouth. After it cools and congeals a bit it heads south in taste and texture. That's how the fat part was in my taco. Had to spit out a few nuggets. 
The meat part was like marinated jerky bits. Very chewy though flavorful.  

Probably won't be back. Mainly because I'm from Hawaii and there are a lot of places I'd like to try in Vegas so you gotta hit hard on your first try for me to come back. 

Oh and there's nothing free w Yelp checkin.
