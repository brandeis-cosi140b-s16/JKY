Small place that hasn't redecorated in years (see the Phoenix Cardinals banners), but the food was still ok, but not everything outstanding. This would be your standard mom and pop place and it had a good crowd about 6pm on Saturday night, but only a short 5 minute wait.

They have no white meat chicken - really? 
The beef that was in my taco tasted a bit off, not seasoned or anything.
The $7.95 guacamole cheese crisp was the highlight off the appetizer menu
The sweet green corn tamale was the highlight of combo 1
The red enchilada sauce was very tasty
Free chips and two kids of salsa - both had little heat
Old School - pay at register
Some waitresses chewing gum which is a turn off for me
Shady area, so get in and get home after dark

Might return for a happy Hour if in area, otherwise just another Mexican restaurant.
