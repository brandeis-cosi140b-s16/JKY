food was great!  I came for 'spicy' and that's exactly what I got.  

server was cold and not personable.   took my order and never came back around to check on me.  during the two brief interactions with her (ordering and paying) I couldn't even get a simple fake smile from her.  

It costs nothing to smile and be friendly to make people feel welcome.  It cost her a couple extra bucks in tip money for her lack of, however.
