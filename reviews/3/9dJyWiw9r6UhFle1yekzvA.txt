I was definitely was imagining making sheimp tacos last night..and voila! We decided to have Rubios for lunch today and what do you know... Shrimp tacos.

I usually just order the original fish tacos which are $1.50 on Tuesdays after 2:30!! And my favorite is the Atlantic Salmon burrito (blackened)

But today I got one salsa shrimp taco and the original fish taco on a plate with chips and beans... 

Fish taco was good as usual.. I add the green onion cilantro with tomatillo salsa with it for a burst of flavor... Oh yea..the limes that they gave uswere dry... Literally squeeezed it so hard for one drop pf lime juice.

Salsa verde shrimp tacos were pretty good but there were only 4 tiny pieces of shrimp...def not what it looked like in the picture lol... And they put too much onion (but nothing the extra tomatillo salsa can fix :)) and the avocado added creamyness to it.

Overall 3.5 for this experience!
