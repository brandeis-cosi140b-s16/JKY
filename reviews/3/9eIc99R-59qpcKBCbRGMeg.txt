Phew, it's pricey. $3.50 for a mini taco. Atmosphere is good,  staff is. .. hipster. Chips were a bit stale and my drink was not the best. It cost my husband and I $50 for the 3 mini tacos,  nachos and a drink a piece. The have a really good outdoor area and is great for the young professional but if you go the to eat and not socialize, best to go someplace out.
