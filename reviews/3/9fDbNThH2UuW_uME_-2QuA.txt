We decided to check out Gallo Blanco last Saturday night.

I sure like the casual, funky vibe.  We sat in the dining area near the bar and had fun watching all the people come and go from the hotel's pool area just off the lobby.

I had their house margarita on the rocks to start.  It was perfect.

We also ordered the guacamole, carne asada torta and tacos for dinner.  The guacamole is pretty good but I think I'd prefer a more traditional recipe.

The carne asada and tacos were good but not great.

Service was a little rushed.  Our server asked us if we'd like dessert while we were still eating our meal.  I told her I hadn't thought about it yet.  She came back a little later while we were still eating and asked if there was anything else we'd like to order.

Just let me relax and enjoy my meal!
