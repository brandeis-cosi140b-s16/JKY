For a fast food chain, you can't go wrong picking up some of their breakfast taco's. I love the Carnitas egg taco's. 

The egg is just scrabbled, nothing fancy about that, but the Carnitas are a little bit of spice, and they put on pico de gallo and chopped cilantro and onions all  wrapped with a corn tortilla,  very good start for the day.

This is cheap, fast and flavorable!
