Not your regular Hawaiian BBQ joint; don't come here expecting a Mixed Plate/Masubi/Macaroni Salad because you won't find them here. This place is more of a Chipotle-esque assembly line of food, your choice of meat and fixings in a burrito/bowl/tacos. The meats were very flavorful, the grilled veggies were disappointingly bland. Originally wanted the fish but they were out at the time. :(
