I first learned about Wahoos in Southern California, it was pretty much my everyday lunch during my summers spent in Huntington Beach and during the winter months I would go to the one across the street from my job in Valencia. To say the least, I love this place. So I figured I'd share my love for this place with my girlfriend - we'd been saying we were going to visit this one since we moved out here a year ago because she has never been.  Finally we were on our way to Target and hungry, so it was perfect timing.  I've been hyping this place up so much you'd think I had shares in Wahoo stocks or something.

We both got burritos and she also got the tortilla soup. To my disappointment, the soup was bland. Very bland. Like less flavor than Campbell's soup. It was literally chicken broth with an overload of canned veggies and a couple chunks of chicken. Needless to say she didn't finish it. After about 20 minutes of waiting for our burritos, we're discussing about just leaving and getting out money back due to the lengthy wait and lack of patrons. It didn't make sense. 

In the midst of waiting we had the pleasure of seeing the place robbed. Literally. Some guy stole the cash drop from the cashier and ran out of there. Quite the scene, if you ask me. Not that it was the restaurants fault for that, but after seeing that, our appetites were lost. Got a refund and quickly left with our money, just like the guy who robbed the place, but legally.

Maybe next time Wahoos!
