Ok, 3 stars because it was good AND I didn't get sick this time.  I had the Fajita plate.  It is always some decent Mexican food (for Fast Food style Mexican) but it always seems to get me in the stomach after I eat it.  This time, no problems.  It is still hard for me to go into this location and look around because I really did love that Cravings place (Mexican too) much better and I wish it had not gone out of business.  What's funny is I had not even intended on eating here.  I wanted to hit up Sushi Creek for the first time, but I didn't know it was closed on Monday (sigh) so I headed next door.  So at best, this was the next best thing.  hahah
