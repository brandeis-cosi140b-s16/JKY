Right smack on the Strip! Perfect for after a night of clubbing & drinking. We actually came for dinner before the club. There was a hugeass line. Each line serves a different kinda meat. I enjoyed the tripas and the spicy pork! Very tasty tacos but......... I ended up having food poisoning afterwards and yacking everything out. =( The tacos did tasted good though so I will return next time to give it another chance.
