It makes me sad to say, that I did not love this place. I really wanted to. 
The atmosphere was awesome, and the concept of Asian and Mexican fusion is one that I generally can rally around. However, the items that we ate last night were just... Meh. 

I had the coconut cocktail which was the standout item. It was AWESOME. 

My boyfriend had the jalape√±o monk to drink which was just... Odd. Not good. He sent it back. 

To eat, we had the hamachi and shishito rolls. Both were lackluster. Not bad, but not especially flavorful. 

We also had the ahi tuna tostada. This was actually really delicious.

The last thing we got was the Korean beef tacos. Another bland item. 

For $100, I really do expect to be impressed. Call me old fashioned. Sumo Maya, you just didn't do it for me.
