I went to eat here with some old coworkers for lunch & came away pretty happy with the whole experience. 1900 Mexican is tucked away in a nice shopping center off Park Road so it's a little tough to spot unless you know about it.

The place was pretty packed for lunch, but we didn't have to wait at all for a table of 7. The inside seems very cluttered though, with lots of tables & booths very close together. Maybe this is one of the ways they seat the lunch crowd so quickly. They also have a nice patio area that seemed pretty popular when we rolled up. Other than the cluttered feeling, the atmosphere is typical of most Mexican restaurants, from the decor on the walls to the spicy colors throughout the place. They also have some good tvs throughout the place so catching a mid day sporting event during your meal is quite easy.

The food was nothing too special & the lunch menu prices were right around the average for similar Mexican places. I had the burrito & taco combination lunch & can't complain. You won't get as big a portion as some of the other Mexican joints, but you still get quite a good amount of food for the price. And everyone at the table seemed to enjoy their meal, so I'd say that the food is quite good, but nothing special.

While 1900 Mexican isn't anything special, it does serve good food for a good price just like your similar Mexican restaurants. I'd definitely agree that there are better Mexican places in Charlotte to eat at, but this is a good choice if you want Mexican & you're close by.
