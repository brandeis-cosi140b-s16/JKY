The food is AMAZING; however, the service is one of the worst I have ever witnessed. On my last visit, we saw our waitress 4 times and it took 30 minutes to get our food. My wife and I a regulars do we expect subpar service but it is getting worse. If they did something about the service to make it even average, this would be a five star... The food is that good. Go check it out but be ready for bad service and wait times.
