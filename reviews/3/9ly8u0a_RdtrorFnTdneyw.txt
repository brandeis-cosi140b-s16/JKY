Their burrito is very large and they have really good tortillas.   The protein is not always as hot as I would like it.  They are a bit impersonal which I don't care for.  The straw dispenser looks like it has never been washed.  At least that is what I remember but it may be from the one on Mineral Point road.    They beat out Qdoba for us. 
Clean and smile.

Then you've gone the extra mile. :-)
