It's been quite a while since my first review and I feel the need to upgrade them a bit. They are still not my favorite place in town. The flavors just aren't dynamic enough and sometimes the food is a tad bit bland, but they are solid and have relatively reasonable prices for the portions they serve.

The meats are well-cooked but a little under seasoned. I like the pastor and lamb. They are a little heavy handed with the onion, so if that's not your thing ask for it on the side.
