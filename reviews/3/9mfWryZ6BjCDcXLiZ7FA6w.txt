Oh gosh...El Norteno is so ultra-ghetto!
The building is a little sketchy, but it's the only Mexican joint I know that has green  tamales. I can't find it anywhere! 
It's not dreadful enough that I don't want to consume food here, though. 
I usually order two vegetarian tamales and the only thing I can really eat at this hole in a wall. 
It's very low-priced ($1.80 per tamale) and the pieces are....well, let's just say that after a whole day of eating almost nothing, I still could not finish my grub.
