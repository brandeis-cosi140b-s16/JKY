I'm not quite sure how I earned the Maverick badge for checking in here. It wasn't very memorable or anything to write home about. 
I seriously don't think anyone is searching out reviews to decide whether or not to grab last minute grub. But then again, maybe someone is.
On day one in Phoenix, I had awesome Mexican food, so I thought it came with the territory, not exactly so. 
I ordered chicken nachos, you can't really go terribly wrong there, right? Service was slow for what we ordered and the fact that they weren't crowded. 
All in all, it beats the snacks and sandwiches on the plane.
