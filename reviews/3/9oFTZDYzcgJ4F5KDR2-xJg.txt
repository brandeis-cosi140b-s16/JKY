Where is the real Mexican food in Pittsburgh? I came here because its in my neighborhood and someone posted a pic of the carne asada fries and I knew those had my name written all over them. I had the diablo shrimp burrito. Surprise! Tomatoes in your burrito! I'm not a fan of raw tomatoes and I could have done without that surprise. The shrimp was so so spicy but on a whole the burrito was bland. I also ordered the carne asada fries which are great in theory but lacked seasoning. Would I come back? Sure, you gotta support neighborhood businesses. But next time I'll try the tacos.
