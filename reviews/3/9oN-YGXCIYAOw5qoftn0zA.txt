If you make the drive out to San Felipe's on a weekend night you should be aware of something: you're no longer in Scottsdale or Phoenix. You are in Cougarville, USA. 

It can be a little off putting for a guy who just wants to have a conversation with a friend over a Corona or two when someone who could be his mom keeps using his shoulder to get up and down from the bar to dance on top of it. Not that that's ever happened to me. 

And the food here is not good. If you are at DC Ranch swing by Blue Wasabi or somewhere like that and go to drink at San Felipe's. There are some good beer and margarita specials some nights but the vibe gets so convoluted it's hard to drink in peace. 

It's a good place to get over the top wasted, if you have a ride home, of course, because the super loud music lends itself to booty shakin and obnoxious behavior. 

I've had fun here before but more often than not it's just kinda weird. Check it out for yourself though, and if you catch it on the right night you might find it to be a great spot.
