Go for the drinks, stay for the tacos... Just as long as they're the chorizo tacos and you're drink is the Gingerolla, because DAMN are they good!

Extra points go to this place because they have a fabulous back garden and bistro tables out front in addition to the funky bar they serve drinks from. I'm a total sucker for a little al fresco drinking and dining. However, I'm deducting a couple of stars because the service, to put it delicately, is rude. 

It's a cute space -- funky, gritty, definitely of the hipster genre. Prices are decent and, as I mentioned, so are the drinks. It seemed to get a little clubby later on a Saturday night, but if you're up for a chill time, hit 'em up earlier in the evening and on the weeknights. Don't forget the Gingerolla!
