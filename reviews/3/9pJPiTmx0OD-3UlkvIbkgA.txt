Top Shelf has decent mexican food but they are a bit more expensive and don't offer the same value as say Garcia's.  I have been there at least 3-5 times over the years and I have always left happy but I am about not having to spend too much money if I don't have to especially If I can get the same food and service ( Garcia's ) for a little cheaper.

If you live in the area give Top Shelf a try.  They have good food and service.  They are just not my favorite.
