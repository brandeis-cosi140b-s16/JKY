My husband and I grabbed a bite here for the first time the other night.  We had previously eaten at locations in NYC.  The tacos were good, with tasty ingredients, but they were barely lukewarm, which detracted from the taste.  They need to figure out how to serve up tacos that stay warm between leaving the serving line and getting to a nearby table!
