Moes is a burrito place with pretty much all custom orders.  Although I have experienced better, I did enjoy my veggie burrito and Negro Modelo.  They play the Grateful Dead and all sorts of Allman Brothers here, and some of the locations have crafty little quotes by these musicians.  The service wasn't shabby, but the people could have been a little bit more enthused, they must be getting minimum wage.
