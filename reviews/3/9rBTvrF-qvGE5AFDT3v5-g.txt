Only three stars because I think the prices are a tad high.
The Mahi Mahi taco I had and shared a picture of was tasty Iwould order this again and recommend it too, but the price seems kinda high for just one taco.  The Salmon taco, another pic was loaded, tasted fishy which is NOT ideal.  Son had a burrito and since he was opposed to dining here he is not giving it a fair review.  He said "it was food".
Paying almost $4.00 for a single taco wouldn't you think they would give you chips?  Nope, gotta charge for those too.   
We rarely come here simply because there are so many other Mexican food options within a couple miles proximity to us.
