I recently had breakfast at Rosita's.  I had a pork-filled omelette, enchilada style with green sauce.  It was good.  Something different, much better than a free grand-slam from Denny's.  They serve the meal with corn bread and a sweet glaze, along with warm flour tortillas.   I paid about 9 bucks for breakfast.  I would like to go back and try out the rest of the breakfast menu.  They have a "gringo" menu that includes pancakes, etc.
