I don't get all the hype. It's a good restaurant with good food but it's in no way earth-shattering. I was happy with service and the availability of cheap margaritas (el cheapo for $5), but it was loud and the wait was an hour.  So it's a nice place to go if you want casual atmosphere and if the line isn't too long.
