For those who say this is like Chipotles, that's not entirely accurate. The setup is but the flavor of the food is vastly different. The meats here are in a gravy, which is not our preference. They only have white rice, which we didn't try. Their chips are blue corn.  Tasty but not like Chipotles with the hint of lime. Their Queso was very good and not something that Chipotles offers. The tortillas were freshly made and quite tasty. We would probably come back to try a quesadilla and/or chips n queso, but we would not come back for the meat dishes because we didn't prefer the flavor. Service was good but nothing outstanding.
