I am giving this place 3 stars but this is one of those just average places and deservers 2.5 stars... I can't say it is "A-ok" but it is better than 2 stars.....

This place is quite the chic cantina.  The design and decor is swanky!  They had a chandelier made from about 500 Cazadores Bottles.  

The service was excellent.

They had some decent happy hour offerings and the happy hour starts at 4 and goes through closing.

The menu offering and food was basically for gringos and gringas.  It tasted okay though.  Not authentic mexican food.

So - nice place, good service, happy hour offerings... the food was just okay!
