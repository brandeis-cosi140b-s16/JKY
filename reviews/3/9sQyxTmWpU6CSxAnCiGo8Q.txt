If you love Chipotle and love almost authentic Hispanic food, then this is the place for you.

So I wanted to give this place a two because I read the reviews and was excited to try the place. I drive past it daily on my commute to and from work, so it was inevitable that I would try this place.

What anyone failed to me is that is a Mexican version of chipotle. So I am telling you. Yes, they have a salsa bar, yes they have more meat options. 

I tried the al pastor bowl and it was decent. I was slightly disappointed because it had mozzarella cheese instead of authentic Mexican cheese. 

We also tried a chicken burrito and it was good, solid eats. But nothing to rave about.

If you are in the mood for Mexican, then definitely try this place out. You just might love it. I just expected something else.

I probably would have been better off if I stuck with the tacos. I would go back just to try that but not sure anything else.
