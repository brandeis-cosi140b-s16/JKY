I think this place is good for that quick take out on the way home from work. I will say the food was good and fresh and at a reasonable price. This is a newer location with a large open window to look into the kitchen as your food is being prepared. 

Now here is the bad part and the reason behind the loss of stars. The prep cook was dicing tomatoes all the while he had a phone between he shoulder and ear. Ding ding Health code violation and on that note the new regulations state that no employee can prepare food with bare hands. Well not one employee had gloves on. This is a big NO-NO as I am in the restaurant business. 

For now I will go to the Roberto's on Blue Diamond as i have never seen them break this many health code violations.
