My husband and I are a HUGE fan of the food and margaritas at Mexicasa.....I think I should explain why I only rate this restraurant 3 stars....lack of consistency. We would rate their food and margaritas 5 stars when the restraurant is not busy. However, when it is busy, the food is just ok and the margaritas don't have ANY tequila in them. The staff is always very grateful for our business and that's what keeps us going back....we do only go during non-peak hours now and that will guarentee a great experience for us.
