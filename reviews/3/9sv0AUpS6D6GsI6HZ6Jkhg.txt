Overall, you need to give it a try.  Our first attempt was not Frontera Grill, but I saw small sparkles of it shining through some small mistakes.  

So far, ok.  My hubby and I tried Ciliantro for lunch this past weekend.  We tried the queso fundido, tacos with steak, and the guacamole.  I was expecting beautiful gelatinous goo covered in churizo, but unfortunately it felt like melted mozzerella with greasy meat on top.

The steak was good, but the chile marinade was bland . . . a heavy pan and high heat could have created a stellar crust to allow the meat to shine.  It came with the guacamole and a beautiful roasted tomato salsa.

The guacamole was fresh, creamy and chunky.  I would have preferred a bit of spice, but overall lovely.

The fresh corn tortillas and corn chips were made fresh.  Grainy and perfectly seasoned; they redeemed the meal.

Service was slightly confusing . . . not sure who our service was, one of three who served us, but overall good and pleasant.

We plan of giving Cilantro another try, probably for dinner.  I think they have many emerging qualities that were untapped during our visit.  I especially want to try the cilantro mango margarita and possible the lamb for dinner.
