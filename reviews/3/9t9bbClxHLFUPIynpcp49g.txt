Still on the search for Tripa and tongue taco perfection and decided to give this place a try.  I sauntered into here with my daughter on our weekly date and we found that we had the place to ourselves. The waiter was very efficient and may have checked on us, a tad too much but I think too much is better than not enough.  She ordered steak, I ordered, tripa, cabeza and lengua tacos with a side of hot sauce and we got complimentary chips and salsa.  They definitely didn't give you enough salsa for the amount of chips so you may have to ask for a bit more.  
Now on to the tacos. Well, they were just okay.  Not the best, wouldn't travel far to get them.  The tripa tasted, well....muddy and the others just weren't bursting with flavor.  I asked for hot sauce and of the two presented, neither was really spicy.  They were generous on the meat, cilantro and onion and love the chips and salsa freebie but it was just okay in my eyes.  I'm still searching for that amazing taco experience with really spicy salsa and a place that serves the pickled peppers, carrots and onion mixture on the side.  Maybe this was just a Maryland thing and is not common here and I hate to keep making comparisons because I see all of these other rave reviews but I have to be honest for what I have had and the standard I hold all tacos to.  I will say that I will give it another try because sometimes there are off days at businesses and reading the other reviews, I'm thinking I might be missing something.  When I do, I will update my review.
That is all!
