I really want to like this place...it's convenient, fast, and a great lunch spot. Nice outdoor seating, and at lunch time on a Thursday, there was plenty of room inside.

I got a vegetarian salad with fajita veggies, sweet potatoes, corn, black beans and chipotle ranch dressing. The food was good quality, but lacked taste. I love that they have sweet potatoes and regular potatoes as an option for a different texture, but again, they lacked flavor. I found myself hunting for salt or something. Even the dressing, which I was sure would have some punch, was just creamy in texture, not really flavorful.

Another weird thing...the glass that separates you from the food in the ordering line makes it very very hard to hear the staff. Even though the girl that made my salad was speaking very clearly, it was muffled and I had to ask her to repeat things multiple times. This is not the best design.

In theory this place is very similar to Chipotle, but in practice I think they can make some major seasoning improvements to their veggies.
