It seems that this place gives false advertising.  By looking at the menu outside with the pictures I saw some street tacos that I decided to order.  But when I placed my order the lady seemed like she didn't know what I was talking about. When I got my order, they were just regular tacos.  I was disappointed, but when I ate them they were pretty good.  It's not authentic Mexican food.  But if you're on the go, on a budget, and need a decent meal, this is a good place.
