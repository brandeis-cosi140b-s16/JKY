I have been eating here for years only to eat one thing. BABY BANDITOS. They are like little chimichangas filled with cheese and they give you this jalapeno cream cheese sauce that's to die for. I wouldn't recommend anything else on the menu unless you don't mind having a meal that is just ok. The taco's are nothing special and the beans are bland. I love me some good beans!
