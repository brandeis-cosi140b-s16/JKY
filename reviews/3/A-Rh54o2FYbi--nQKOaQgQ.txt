I was looking for a good "taco salad." My old place had failed me on several occasions with a taco shell that was less than fresh. Filibertos was close-by and they had a drive thru, so I asked if they had a taco salad. Yep! I ordered one with extra sour cream & extra guacamole. Salsa on the side.

It was great!  . . . but it was not a salad. There were a few shreds of iceberg lettuce on top . . . a very few.  But, don't get me wrong, it was filled with pintos, chicken, rice, and cheese. It was tasty . . . and heavy.  The shell was fresh, but quickly became soggy from the beans & rice.  Salad wouldn't have done that so quickly. There was definitely extra sour cream; but a minimal amount of guacamole. I think I paid for extra of both?

All I can say at this point is that I will go back again and give them another try. This "salad" was excellent, although not really a salad. It was a combo plate in a shell. Enough food for a football player. It took me three meals to finish it all. Use the coupon on their website - $3.99.

The one real disappointment with the drive-thru was the service. The attendant was less than happy that day. Maybe it was just one of those days that we all have? Perhaps I will go inside next time.
