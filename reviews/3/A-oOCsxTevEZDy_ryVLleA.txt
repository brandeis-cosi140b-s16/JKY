For unknowing drivers that visit this bar..Please take a cab or have a driver when going here?  Peoria PD motorcycle units love hanging out just west of this location, you have been warned :)
As for the grill it is not,  it is more bar than grill....So as long as you came here for drinks, hanging out, maybe dancing then its a great stop....Fish tacos, carne tacos, and beer.  Bar nachos and drinks sums it up.  
I do remember visiting here when it first opened up and they required guys to tuck in shirts?!  Not the case anymore, but it did seem over populated with bouncers at first.  I think it has calmed down since then and the staff seem friendly now.
