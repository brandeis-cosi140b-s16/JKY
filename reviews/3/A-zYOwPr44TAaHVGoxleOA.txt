I was looking for a quick thing to eat that was inexpensive and not overly filling. We walked over here because even a hot dog was outrageously priced inside the casino. That, and del taco isn't available where we live, so we wanted to try something new.

Price was reasonable, the food court seemed good for tourists who also didn't want to pay casino prices, most of the businesses were 24 hours. 

I can't help comparing it to taco bell. Price and taste, it felt similar, but del taco might have been more bland. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but also wouldn't object if someone else wanted it.
