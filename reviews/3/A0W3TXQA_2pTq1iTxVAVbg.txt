Ironically, I did not order the tacos, even though that is my staple choice at a new Mexican restaurant. Instead, I opted for a chicken, bean and rice burrito. It wasn't half bad! I added lots of the hot sauce and thought the overall consistency was great. The chicken was tender and flavors tasted fresh. My gf was not overjoyed with her Chimichanga meal, which was rather sloppy and wet. It had some crispy parts, but just wasn't up to her standards. She agreed the burrito was much better.

Our carry out order included several chips (6-7) and sauces. We ate some of the spicy carrots while we waited, which were ok. For being a hole in the wall Mexican place with a funny name, I liked it.
