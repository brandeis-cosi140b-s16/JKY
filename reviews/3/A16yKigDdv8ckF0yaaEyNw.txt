Interesting reviews.  Let's remember that this is Mexican food - in an airport.  It's not even a real airport, it's Sky Harbor in Phoenix, so it is basically a small step over white collar prison.  

1.  LOCATION.  It is one of the two A terminals (again, it's PHX) between gates 20 and 22.

2.  FOOD.  It serves Mexican food.  You can buy it from one side as take out, or you can sit on the other side, pay the same amount and have someone bring it to you AND be able to buy alcohol.  Option 2 seems like the easy choice.

3.  QUESADILLAS.  I got the blue corn quesadillas and they were pretty good.  It is hard to mess up such an easy meal, but it was good.  The guacamole was actually fresh.

4.  MARGARITA.  It was 10 AM.  I'd been traveling for 4 hours already, and it tasted pretty good.  The bar was low, but that's okay.

I liked it.  I'll go back.
