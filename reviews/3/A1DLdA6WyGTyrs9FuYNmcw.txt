Was cruising for a spot to grab a late night drink in the outer areas of Phoenix. Most places close up by 10 or so - I managed to walk into Arriba for a last call and ordered a frozen margarita.

As late as I was, there was no rushing to get me out and the staff was great about bringing chips and salsa too. The margarita was OK - had better, had worse. Hope to stop in again there to check out the food.
