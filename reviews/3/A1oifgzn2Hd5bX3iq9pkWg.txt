This location is a nice little spot, for when I really want a chicken bowl. Located near the Golds gym I see many protein needing people in here often, but theres always a few things that bother me here. The chicken bowl, its really really good...But the problem is, that its pricey. At about $10 a meal for something that might or might not fill you up, it might be a better bet to head to a more authentic Mexican place in the area.
