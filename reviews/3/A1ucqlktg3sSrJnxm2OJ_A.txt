Stopped by with a group on a Sunday evening and was pleasantly surprised. I only recognized one of the bartenders, so maybe they have cleared out some staff since my last visit. This time around our server was on her A-game and the food was what it always should have been. I'm happy to say Vida Vida has somewhat redeemed itself from a handful of poor experiences.
