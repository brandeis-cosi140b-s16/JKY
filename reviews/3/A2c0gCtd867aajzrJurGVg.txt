Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but the prices are outrageous for what you're getting  and it isn't exactly what I would call Mexican food. It's just too expensive to eat here especially considering that the taco salad is the best thing on the menu but its not really something that would make a good leftover. The decor is cute, and it's a fun atmosphere. The staff is friendly and the drink choices are excellent, but until they're going to either turn it into a nicer restaurant or lower the prices a bit, I'll just stick to a different restaurant.
