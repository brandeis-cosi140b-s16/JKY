I think Roberto's is hit or miss by location. There's 1 I would give 0 stars while another one I would give 5! This place is in the middle hence the 3 stars. 

Service was quick and I didn't hear anyone with issues despite it being lunch and packed. No problem with my order (carne asada nachos no sour cream no beans and Jamaica juice) but I did try to get a refill on the drink and they wanted to charge $1!? I'll just get a FREE refill of fruit punch then thank you. The other locations I go to it's not guarded and charged so that was weird. 

It was pretty messy in there too. Yes it's lunch hour but you could wipe down the tables in between customers.
