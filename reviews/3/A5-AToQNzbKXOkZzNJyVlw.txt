Another fast food Mexican joint in the spirit of Chipotle or Qdoba. But, Panchero's does have two things that definitely stand out. 

1. The fresh tortilla. 
It's pressed and cooked in front of you. And when you finally take a bite out of your burrito, you can really taste the difference. 

2. Mixing the ingredients. 
Unlike Chipotle, Panchero's does one extra step before folding your burrito. The rice, beans, meat, etc, all get mixed and you get a fairly equal amount in each bite. 

The problem. All those ingredients (other than the fresh tortilla) aren't quite as good as the other places. The price is about the same and they nickel and dime you for every extra, too.  I would never say no to Panchero's, I just wouldn't pick it over anywhere else.
