This was my first time visiting an On the Border and I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but a gift card brought us in for lunch.  Our waitress was sweet and she started us off with the customary chips and salsa which had just the right amount of spice.  I ordered the fish tacos and I thought they were pretty tasty.  This was my first time trying fish tacos so I'm not sure if they compare to other restaurants but I thought they were great.  The only thing I wasn't happy with was my side of grilled veggies.  They were covered in some kind of seasoning that just ruined the flavor for me.  This made me sad because the zucchini and red peppers looked amazing but after a couple bites I just couldn't eat any more.

The one thing that put a damper on the meal was when the waitress and manager couldn't figure out how to process our gift card.  The waitress was totally baffled and tried to tell us that we had a zero balance on the card when we'd only used half of the card value.  We had to ask for a manager and the manager was so confused she had to call another store to figure out what was going on.  The manager figured everything out eventually and we walked away with half the balance left on our card.  Even with the gift card mix up I would still come back just for the fish tacos.
