A tasty reasonably priced lunch.

Today was my first visit to Ricardo's Mexican Food Restaurant.  As you enter Ricardo's your greeted by friendly staff who advise you of all the specials.

The dining area was clearly clean, maintained, and well-staffed. My lunch companion and I ordered the Thuraday lunch special, a shredded beef taco, three shredded beef rolled tacos, and a cheese enchilada . 

I didn't care for the enchilada, it was somewhat soggy and lacked taste. However, the tacos and rolled tacos were quite good. The shells were crispy on the outside but soft enough to not fall apart.  The shredded beef was moist, tender, and seasoned as to not overpower the toppings of lettuce, cheddar cheese,  and tomato. 

If your looking for inexpensive Mexican food and great service give  Ricardo's a try.
