I really like this place because they have some authentic dishes. I especially like the tacos. I have to take a couple of stars off though because if you go and they are approaching busy there is quite a bit of congestion at the door, the salsa bar, and the register. It really is a fire code violation. The seating could be updated and depending on your luck you could get a lopsided booth or table. Lastly pray you are lucky and have a salt shaker and napkins at your table. Food is top notch, the overall experience leaves something to be desired.
