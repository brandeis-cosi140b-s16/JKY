Strange atmosphere. Ok tacos. 

This old Spanish style church is filled with Spanish style tables, chairs, etc. They also have a strange renaissance painting near the ceiling. The staff are youngish hipsters and they have live music that is hipsterish too. 

The food well plated. They provide you with chips and salsa and water when you initially sit down.  The Peking taco is the opposite of what it says. It's full of beef with a few duck strips on it. Also, the tacos are not nearly as good as a taco truck at 2.95 a taco not worth the money.

No plans to go back.
