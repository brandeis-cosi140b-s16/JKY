In the Queen Creek/San Tan Valley area there just are not too many place to get quality or even good fast food.  I find my self at Filibertos quite often as the food is descent, though not spectacular.  Portion sizes are large but not cheap for what you get in my opinion (pretty easy to spend 8+ dollars on what is essentially fast food (but high quality fast food).

I often get a half order of their super nachos but was hungry yesterday and ordered a full order.  To my disappointment it really was no bigger than the half order I usually get.  My tip for you is, if your are after the nachos get the half order, pay less and eat just as well!
