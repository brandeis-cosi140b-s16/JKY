We have returned twice since the fire.  On the first visit, our waitress was a gem.  On the second... we were not so impressed...

Superficially, she seemed nice.  She did not ever refill our drinks (despite there being several empty tables at 6:00 p.m. on a Saturday night).  For some reason, she assumed that we (2 couples) would all be on one check.  Given, it is our fault for not specifying that and assuming she'd know but when we asked her to split the check, she acted terribly put out.  She took the ticket from us without saying a word and when she returned and we thanked her, she said nothing and walked away.  This was after being relatively talkative with us in the beginning.

Overall, we really like the food so we'll be back.  I do think it's a bit overpriced but you don't leave hungry or regretful.
