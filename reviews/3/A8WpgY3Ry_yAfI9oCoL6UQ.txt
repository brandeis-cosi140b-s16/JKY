My first visit here was ok. The food is just alright. My chicken tacos seemed a little dry. My friends tried the battered fish tacos and they said they were good, but the tater sauce was a little too spicy for their taste. The service was very good. They came back and filled our drinks without us asking which was nice. And our server had to go on break towards the end of our meal, but she let us know that someone would be taking care of us. I loved that because I've been to places and our server would just leave and not let us know. So great service here, but food was just ok.
