This review is for the new location on Indian Trail Road. The restaurant was very clean, the service was good and everyone was quite friendly, but the food could use some work. The salsa and bean dip were both very bland. I ordered pollo con queso, and it wasn't terrible, but it had way too much pepper in it. I don't think we would come back unless they made some changes, especially with La Unica being so close.
