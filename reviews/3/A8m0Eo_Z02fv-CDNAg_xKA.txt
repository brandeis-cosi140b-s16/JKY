Came to Abuelo's, this location, while mom was in town visiting.  First impressions were good.  The aesthetics of the place were top notch.  The table and area around it was clean.  Our server, though I can't remember her name, was very pleasant.  The food, left a little to be desired, but it wasn't bad by any means.  The beans were dry, but they can get a pass, they're beans...  The stuffed chile was an odd mix of chewy and mush.  So I wasn't a fan of it.  The rest of the food, was good; not great, but good.  I'll agree with other reviewers that call it pricey.  For the food being offered, it is on the pricier side.  

Overall the place is good to visit once in a while.
