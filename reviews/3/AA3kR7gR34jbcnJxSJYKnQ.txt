The atmosphere is great! The bartender was nice. The food was not too good. We just got nachos. The main ingrediant for nachos is cheese and it was horrible. It seemed like cheese whiz, yuk. It is very pricey, which we are ok with but not for cheese whiz. We ate at the bar and I did tell bartender i wash't happy with it. I complimented the shredded beef and guac. She didn't even offer to take a few dollars off b/c we weren't happy with the food. We love outside bars so much!! but sadly we probably won't go back. Just not good customer service. If I am paying 14.00 for nachos and don't like it and they don't care....equates to not going back.
