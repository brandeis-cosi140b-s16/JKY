La Condesa is in a rather unassuming location in Phoenix.  But has a nice atmosphere when you get inside.  The first thing I noticed was their huge salsa bar.  We sat down and were brought menus and chips.  I tried most of their salsas.  They all had their own very unique flavor.  the peanut salsa was really interesting.  My favorite was their tomatillo salsa.  

I ordered the Oaxaca Mole taco and a carne asada taco.  The mole was excellent with great flavor.  The carne asada was bland and flavorless...huh?  I dumped salsa on the carne asada taco and when finished was rather disappointed in that particular offering.

Also ordered their calabacitas.  They were seasoned well and tasted great.  

I had a bite of my partner's pork taco and it was amazing.  

I am glad we found La Condesa and I will definitely visit again to try some more of their menu offerings.
