I used to love going to Albuquerque Tortilla Company on 15th Ave. and Hatcher and I miss it, but today for lunch some coworkers and I tried the new restaurant to take it's place: La 15 Y Salsas. As you might imagine... they offer at least 15 salsas to top your burritos or tacos. I tried at least seven of them between dipping the complimentary chips made in-house from house-made tortillas (the owner owns a tortillaria too) and topping my breakfast burrito. My breakfast burrito was HUGE (See pictures) and was only $3.99... That was the regular! I can't imagine what the "mega" ($5.49) looks like!! 2 things about this place: 1.) If your going to go to an order-a-burrito-at-a-counter place, this place fits the bill and it's locally owned an operated with homemade salsas and fresh tortillas handmade with your order! 2.) They use a lot of black pepper here. If you don't like black pepper, I'm pretty sure you won't like it; but, I like black pepper and I look forward to trying the chicken tacos sometime...
