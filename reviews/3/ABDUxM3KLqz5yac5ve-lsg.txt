Rubio's is the definition of three star A-Ok.  The Food is decent, but not all that memorable or flavorful.  The prices are also decent.  The cost runs about the same as Chipotle, but this place is no Chipotle.

I do love that not only does Rubio's serve fish tacos, there are grilled options.  Not only is it healthier, but I personally am not a fried fish guy.  The price for a Pacific Mahi Mahi Taco plate (two tacos, chips, and beans) is a little north of $8.  Not bad for a fairly filling meal.  The fish it self is good.  The toppings are good.  Everything tastes surprising fresh for quick service.  But the sauce is extremely lacking, and when it comes to fish tacos, it's pretty much all about the sauce.  The beans were fine.  The chips were nothing special.  I wasn't a big fan of any of the salsa options.

If you are looking for cheap, quick, and not greasy Mexican food, Rubio's is a doable eatery.
