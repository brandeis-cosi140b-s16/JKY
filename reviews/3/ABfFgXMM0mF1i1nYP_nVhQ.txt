This is one of the newest additions in the south west. Chile Addiction is a New Mexico restaurant with an emphasis on green and red chile. I ordered the sopaipilla with adovada. The meat was nicely cooked with a very good flavor. The chile tends to be a bit spicy. The dish comes with two sides. I picked the calabacitas and the Spanish rice. Both sides were pretty disappointing, they were plain and lacked flavor. I had the chance to try the tostada compuesta which is pretty much a taco salad. The were some good parts of the dish and some others that were just average. Although the customer service was very good the food took a while to be delivered. Unfortunately, I dont think I would come back.
