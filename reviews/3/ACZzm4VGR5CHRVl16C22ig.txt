Oh the joys of airport food. Generally most of it is (1) really expensive and (2) unfit for human consumption. 

The Blue Burrito Grille is the best of a bunch of bad options in terminal C. Burrito was made fresh, reasonably warm, and didn't taste terrible. I was a little concerned when the cashier didn't know what cilantro was, but the end result was ok. 

It wasn't cheap though. One burrito, one rice bowl, a snapple and a coke does not = $23 value to me. But from what I've read elsewhere on Yelp, it's far less than we would have paid next door and a lot better. 

So it's only moderately expensive and is fit for human consumption. And for airport food, that equals three stars.
