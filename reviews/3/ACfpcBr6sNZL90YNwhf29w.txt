Tried this place for the first time the other day! Not bad however los tacos de tripa were kinda soggy =( they taste better crispy. We had a big order for to go asada, tripa, cabeza and al pastor tacos were flavorful my favorite were los tacos de al pastor. Se les olvido hecharle la salsa!! But that's ok next time. I'd go back my husband and children were satisfied.
