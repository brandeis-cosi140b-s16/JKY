My best friends and I had dinner here on my last evening in Las Vegas. I was thinking, hmmm, Mexican. Not my favorite cuisine but I was willing  and it's all we could think of last minute. None of us were in the mood for anything else. No sushi, no Mediterranean, no Korean, no Greek... so we settled on Mexican.

The servers name, and I'm not kidding, was Pancho Villa. He knew that was good for a laugh. Since my friend Joe speaks Spanish we got extra good treatment. Joe had a Margarita and Deb, a beer. There I sat with my water, casually mentioning to Joe that I prefer the frozen style Margarita. He rattled something off to the server and the next thing I knew, I had a frozen Margarita in front of me. Though I don't drink much anymore, I really appreciated that one and it was very well made.

The chips were really good. Not sure if they make them on the premises but they tasted like they sure could have. I love the chips and salsa thing, even though it tends to destroy your appetite and then you have to fight to get your dinner down.

Great atmosphere, service and the food was good. It was pretty typical Americanized Mexican fare but overall, it was pretty good. It didn't feel like a chain and I'm not even sure if it is. No matter, it was good and in the end, that's all that really matters.
