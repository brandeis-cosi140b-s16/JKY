The one guy didn't know how to roll a burrito. That would be like a nascar driver who can't drive. Because of that, the line was super long. I got a chicken bowl after seeing the guy roll the burrito in front of me. Chicken was good. My wife's steak bowl was bad. Beet had a ton of fat and was chewy.
