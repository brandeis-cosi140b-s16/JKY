God I'm a cheap date.  My choice for dinner.  I had eaten at another restaurant in the same location quite a few years ago.  The decor was pretty horrendous, but the food was okay.  

We arrived on a Friday night to an empty parking lot, but wait, there was one truck on the side.  Arguing over whether it was actually open (where would all the employees be parked?), I marched my lazy ass to the door, and yep, they were open.  My first thought was, "I actually didn't think this place could go downhill in appearances, I was wrong."  From the outdoor wire tables serving as pub tables in the bar, to the same giant fake tree that has stood there as long as the Redwoods, to tile that must have been installed the year tile was invented, to the tables all with chairs up indicating they weren't really expecting customers (and we were it as a matter of fact), two things were clear.  I was either going to get a food-borne illness or a pretty good meal.  I got the latter.

Although there were quite a few seafood dinners, we went the safe route and both got burritos...his a carne asada, mine carnitas.  His without enchilada sauce was toasted.  Mine enchilada style with a pretty good sauce.  Not much I can say.  Burritos were good.  They had Mexican Coke in a bottle.  I left happy.  

Would I go again?  Maybe.  I like a good hole-in-the-wall, but this was like the hole in the hole-in-the wall.  It also felt a little strange with no other customers.  I even saw the cook peek into the restaurant, perhaps wondering who had actually come in.  The only other people there were a a few sitting at the bar, obviously friends or relatives.
