I grew up eating here at La Perla. The place is a westside institution and has been open over 50 years. As a kid I used to love the video arcade while waiting for dinner or while my family would sit around talking after dinner. They do a great mariachi band on friday and saturday nights in the big band room ... these seats are at a premium, and require advance reservations. This is one of the only places on the westside I can remember that would serve green chilis that were not out of a can. The service was always great, and the food, though a standard menu, was delicious. 

+1 for being a fun/family oriented place with good food +1 for great live entertainment on the weekends.
