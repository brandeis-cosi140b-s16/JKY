Ok... I can't say I have been waiting anxiously for this new restaurant to open, as it opened extremely quickly (and with little time between it and the last tenant of this space). I can say that when I heard a new taco place was opening near me, I was excited and came to try it as soon as I could. The husband and I came here after a Yelp event last night to get a couple drinks and have a (very small) sampling of the food. 

The drinks: 

Blackberry agave bramble- delicious. Not too boozy and a nice subtle level of sweetness mixed with a very 'fresh' taste. Would order again. 

Cadillac Marg- a frozen margarita... also good, but less interesting. It wasn't just a plain old marg, don't get me wrong, it had more citrus notes in it (Orange I think?) anyway, it was solid,  but a classic. 

The food:

Chips and salsas- this was legit. The chips were warm. The red salsa was surprisingly spicy (which I liked) and the green had a good mild-medium spice level, but more of a fresh flavor. I liked them both. 

Tacos- here is where this place took a nose dive. This is a taco shop, right? We tried the carnitas and the pork belly. Both were WAY too fatty.... I'm talking extreme fat (I know, I know, pork belly is fatty, but you can skim some of the melted fat off after cooking, you know? Also, the pork belly was supposedly rendered and then fried... maybe it being fried added even more unnecessary fat... I dunno).... the grease ran off the tacos... and not the good orange -y kind of grease that is mixed with some kind of sauce or something... no, just white pure fat grease. It was like an oil slick in your mouth. The toppings on both tacos were good... I think they just need to work the kinks out of their meats. With so many delicious and innovative taco places popping up in town (read: santos, etc), this just didn't stand up, but it does have potential and, with some time and adjustments, could be a great taco place (with a great location).
