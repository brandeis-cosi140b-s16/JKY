It's hard to compete with Gallo Blanco (my wife's favorite restaurant in Phoenix) and Otro, the sister restaurant, doesn't quite live up to its predecessor. But it's still a solid choice and a good substitute if you live in the north central area like us. 

So far I've had the carne tacos, carne torta and chicken enchiladas. The first  two feature very tasty and well-cooked carne, and I especially liked the torta. The torta comes with onions, guac (more of straight up avocado really), and a killer aji aioli. Simple and perfectly executed.  They also have very good chips and guac. Again the guac is more chunky with solid avocado pieces but I don't mind that at all. The margaritas hit the spot and I would expect nothing less from the Gallo Blanco's "Other." 

More recently I tried the enchiladas. After I ordered, my wife reminded me that she had gotten them before and wasn't a fan. I have to say that I must agree. There's no cheese on top, which perhaps is the more sophisticated way to go, but I could barely taste the cheese on the inside. The tortilla itself was kind of soggy. The sauce is more of a salsa, somewhat spicy and fairly tasty, but nothing to write home about. The side of black beans was my favorite part. They were very good, but the beans should never be the best part of an entree in my humble opinion (Latin Americans, including my wife, may take offense to that though).

Otro doesn't have the funky charm that Gallo does, but it's coming along. There's a mural on the outside wall of the adjacent building. I noticed on this last trip that they added booths, which makes it feel more put together. 

Overall, a good place to get some good, fresh Mexican food and a well-made margarita.
