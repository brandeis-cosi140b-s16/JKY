I was looking for a place for a place to eat on here and saw that people reviewed it, giving it fairly good reviews. So, I went and grabbed take out from here. I ordered the carnitas from here. The carnitas were good and a hearty portion. I do wish that there was a bit more heat or kick to them and their salsa, but it was good. I was gonna go with a burger or, because it was early enough, I was going to get something like waffles, but I was curious to see how their Mexican food was. The place is a cute little place with, as people have said, an eclectic menu. They had good service with an attentive staff. I think next time I'll go back and try their burgers or breakfast food.
