This little restaurant is a little bit out of the way for me but since we were meeting friends who live off Rea Rd. this was the perfect place to meet up. I have been here just one time before and both times the food and the drinks were excellent. Although Senor Tequila is located in a strip mall, they have recently expanded and the space inside is beautiful and spacious. Sitting outside on the tiny sidewalk still feels a little bit odd, however. 

Sometimes, I can be swayed to love a Mexican food place even if the food is a little bit lackluster, IF they serve amazing chips and salsa. Unfortunately, the chips at Senor Tequila are light, crispy, and freshly made but they are not salted. I hate that. Thankfully, my food has been so delicious both times that I have eaten there that I will overlook the chip issue.  

My second favorite part about a Mexican restaurant is, of course, the margarita! Senor Tequila does not disappoint. They are a nice size and have great flavor. The four of us all had a drink and an entree and our total bill came to just under $90 - for the taste and quality of the food, I'm ok with that. If you find yourself near Piper Glen, head over to Senor Tequila!
