Normally this place is pretty good. My last couple experiences have been horrible. The idiot server dropped my drink all over me while breaking the glass on the table. Then it took 40minutes to get out food, and it wasn't very busy. Once we got out food I ordered a chicken burro with green sauce, I got a beef with red sauce. I told the lovely waitress and I got the response no thats what you ordered. Rude.
