When I first went to Verde - it was definitely a 5-star rating. The food was legit, better than a lot of Mexican restaurants in even Austin. I was super excited to have this so nearby to provide me comfort when I was missing good Mexican.

The drinks are excellent, true margaritas made with 100% agave tequilas and *real* triple-sec (Cointreau) - not sour mix or whatever the hell gets marketed as triple-sec that is just like orange flavoring in a plastic jug in the US.

In the last few months, though, something changed with the food. The taco menu offers only a single vegetarian option, where it used to have like 3. They started charging for salsa. Want a salsa refill? Another $3. What? Could you imagine being charged $3 for ketchup with your fries? This is ridiculous. 

The salsa is tastey, but has way too much fresh garlic in it. You'll taste garlic for 24 hours. I mean, I like garlic, and I like spicy food, but I also want balanced flavor. Perhaps the garlic should be roasted first or something to make it less... astringent and sulfurous. Don't eat here on a date.

I was burping up enchilada and bean dip for like 4 hours after eating. 

The tacos are a bit pricey, but hey, its cheaper than a trip to Mexico or Texas.

Overall, I'd still pick here over, say, Patron (its not even fair to put that in the same category), but it could use some improving and maybe a bit of a review of the pricing.
