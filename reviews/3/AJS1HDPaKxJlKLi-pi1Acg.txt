Food is good, prices are reasonable. The variety of beers on draught are amazing. The menu is also vegetarian/ vegan friendly so there end up being a lot of food options- you aren't stuck ordering the same dish every time. I just wish this place was a little less loud- you can barely hear your friends when you are sitting at the bar or eating dinner.
