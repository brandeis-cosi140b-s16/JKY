I would give this place 3.5 stars...

The food is very good. At least everything I've had as well as the people I went with. However I love good salsa and I don't think they have mastered this there. The chips are good but need a better salsa to go with. Also I'm not big on the atmosphere. Smelled of smoke or something last time I went in and the servers aren't the best. However I will return, there is not that much to chose from within a few miles of my house!
