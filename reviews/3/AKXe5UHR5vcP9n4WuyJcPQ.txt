Food was decent.  Not incredible, but decent.  We were there for eats during a bachelor party week.  It took four times to request doing something cool for the bachelors.  They were supposed to do a bar top dance and pour tequila into their mouths but instead got watermelon shots that were supposedly on the house.  Overall we were looking for something cooler but it was  adequate.  I'd relate it to the hard rock.  Cool atmosphere with potential but only moderate tasting food with average service.
