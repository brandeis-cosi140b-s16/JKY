A quick lunch with a friend and this place wasn't bad.  I was surprised that it was very empty on a Monday shortly after 12 for the lunch rush?  I did my Usual which was Fish Taco's that were very good.   My Friend had the Maria Maria Burrito which was enough for two! 

The meal started with Fresh chips and Three different Salsa offerings.  This was mice since you usually only get one!  Service was good and the place was clean
