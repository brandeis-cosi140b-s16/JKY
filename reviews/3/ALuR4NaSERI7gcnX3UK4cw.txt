This place was highly recommended by several friends. While it was good I dont think that it lived up to the hype. I ordered steak and chicken tacos. The steak had good flavor and they did pack as much meat as they could into the tiny tortillas. I need more time to sample and explore the salsa bar but the creamy green jalepeno salsa was good. The chicken tacos lacked flavor and were a little dry. Prices were a bit higher than I expected. I paid $8 flat for 3 small tacos and a coke in a bottle. The place was tiny and it was difficult to get to the salsa and back to my table. I was there during lunch on a Friday so that is to be expected. Service was average. The tables were clean and the place appeared well kept. Great story of how the place was started, good food but just did not live up the hype.
