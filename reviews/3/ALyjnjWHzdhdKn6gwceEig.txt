Solid Mexican food restaurant, definitely better than Macayo's or Garcia's! 
It's next to the movie theater, nice big parking lot, & it's much larger inside than it looks from the outside. Good atmosphere, nicely decorated, comfortable seating, very polite staff. Our waiter was very attentive, but did not hover. We went early, around 4 pm & didn't have to wait to be seated. 

Food was good. My friend & I had the Fajitas for 2: chicken, steak & shrimp. They should rename it to Fajitas for 4, possibly 6 OR Fajitas for 2 hungry guys, lol. The house cabernet wine wasn't bad at all, so we each had 2 glasses :D 

Walked by later that night on my way out of the theater & I swear I saw disco lights in there, lol. Maybe later at night the bar turns into a mini disco?
