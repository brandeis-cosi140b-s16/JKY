La Parilla Suiza was decent. We sat at the bar and split the trio fajitas. They were good, but fajitas are pretty standard so I can't say they were amazing.. 

I do like how they bring the 3 salsas for the chips and they were accommodating when I asked them to mute the TV. 

The one drawback was the service, they were incredibly slow. Painfully slow at the end. Luckily I had great company and didn't mind the wait. If I was in the area I'd go again, but I wouldn't seek it out.
