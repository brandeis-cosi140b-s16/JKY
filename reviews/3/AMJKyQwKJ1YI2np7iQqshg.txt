Had a "get $20 worth of food for $10" offer online, so I wanted to try this place.

Gonna have to give this place a big ole' "Meh."

Compared to Playa Hermosa, this joint is definitely a  3 to their 5.

I had the Molcajete Mariscos (which I also had a Playa) to compare the two.  Playa's version is MUCH tastier and has more food in it.  Less "gloppy."

The service was a little disjointed (for which I don't reduce stars unless it falls into the TERRIBLE range) in that I had to ask her twice for a couple of things, and she was not overloaded.  My requests seemed to just fall on the backside of remembrance.

The $2 Happy Hour Maggies were decent tasting, although small-ish when you consider the total quantity of fluid.  They were well-spiked though, as I did get a little buzz from having just two of them.

The salsa and chips were above-average I think - the salsa both red and a little smoky and chunky.  Chips on the thick side.

I'd try them again, just to see the range of the offerings.

As people who follow my reviews will notice, I did indeed follow my rule of never giving a highly-rated place 1 or 2 stars after  just one visit.  Can't have a full knowledge of all that goes on there from just a single visit, IMHO.
