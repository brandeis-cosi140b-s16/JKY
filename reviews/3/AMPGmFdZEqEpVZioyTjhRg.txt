I happened to visit Manuel's yesterday for some lunch with some friends. I had never gone before, but thought I would give it a try.  Here's a very quick assessment of the place:

atmosphere: very 70s/80s - clearly the place has been here a while.
service: fair. nothing stellar, but not terrible either.
food: also fair, not great but not bad.
price: perhaps a bit overpriced for the quality, but not by much.
overall experience: ok.
