Wavering on what to score I will stick with 3. I want to see this place succeed. It's really too new to provide a fair judgment. I enjoyed my experience there enough to take in a few more visits and provide later updates. High scores for concept and convenience to where I live and Downtown in general. The food flavor, quality and authenticity is there. I will have to say the tortillas were good, I have had better but I have definitely had MUCH worse. 

On this trip I ordered the guacamole and Pork Chile Verde, which came with rice, beans and 2 kinds of salsa and tortilla. I also chose the fresh limeade to drink. Total came to around $13.
The guacamole is superb (as I sit at my desk finishing up the guac and salsa from last night for brunch). The freshness comes right through, from the fresh garlic, jalapenos onions, cilantro, tomatoes...chopped perfectly...about as good as I make at home (which is definitely a compliment). The salsas, tasty...the verde has to be my favorite of the two. The beans were simple and topped with queso fresco and the rice seasoned simply was also quite nice. 
Now for the chile verde, yum! Well seasoned pork simmered with green chiles was tender and shreaded with just the right amount of heat for the general crowd (maybe even a bit spicy for some but don't change it). I would take a bit of guac and a scoop of pork and add it into a piece of tortilla....mmmmm. The limeade was fresh and very sweet....they could have added a little more water to it and it would have extended their batch and it would be perfect. 
They went out of their way to make sure everything was just right. The girl at the register was young and new and admitted she was still getting a feel for the place.

 I am excited about this new addition to the neighborhood.
