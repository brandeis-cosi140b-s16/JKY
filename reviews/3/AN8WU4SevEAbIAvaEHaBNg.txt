OMFG, everybody in my office was going GaGa over free food!!  How do you cheer up a bunch of grumpy employees sweating like pigs because the A/C wasn't working in the office.  Free burritos!!!!  It was the talk of the office all day.  Hey did you get your free burrito?  "Yes, now leave me alone.  Go away"

I only came here because of the free coupon for the Burrito Especial they're promoting for the Las Vegas Film Festival.  The only other time I've eaten at a Rubio's I had the fish tacos.  I figured I would never return. But....................

Anytime, there's free food you expect the long lines and long wait for your food.  But I must commend the people running this place efficiently for being so busy.  Very well organized and they had portable vibrators so you knew when your order was ready.  

I grew up in San Francisco (Land of the Taquerias) and being a burrito snob and typically despise chains like Chipotle, Baja Fresh and Rubio's so I wasn't expecting much.  But nobody should ever go here because of "authenticy".  But as for the burrito itself eeh it was aiight.  The good was that the steak or chicken tasted straight from the grill.  The guacamole tasted fresh and not like the kind that's processed in a plastic container.  But is it $8 good?  That's debatable depending on your standards.  But the good news is I have yet to have an immediate "closed-door meeting" today!  Usually bad "mexican food" leads to a quick meeting for most people.  

With all that said, I don't see myself returning anytime soon.  I'll stick with my favorite mainstay taquerias that serve my beloved Lengua, Al Pastor and Carnitas options for authenticity.
