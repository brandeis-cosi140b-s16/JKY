Los Taquitos is good, you will like it, but it's nothing extraordinary. It's another place I don't quite understand why is on the Food Network. I like their carne asada and the way they season it, I like their beans, pretty wonderful and light, I like their salsa though it has a little too much cilantro for me, and the chorizo is pretty dynamite. The problem is that aside from the carne asada being a little more consistently good, I don't think it's any better than Filibertos. And Filibertos has the advantage of drive-thrus, quick service and basically no waiting in line. I would never discourage anyone from eating here, I totally support Los Taquitos and will eat here a bunch more times without question, I just think it's a little hyped up. Stop by if you're in the area, but don't make it a trek just because it was on TV.
