Came here for the first time after watching Guy Fieri's show! The staff were friendly and nice but the food was a little bit on the pricier side. The fish taco combo was a good size, the tacos had a lot of filling in them and the fish was fried perfectly, but lacked a bit of flavour. I asked for hot salsa, but the salsa was everything but spicy! Overall the food was good, but I wouldn't say it's the best Mexican place I've been.
