The entrees are flavorful and the horchata is decent, but I can't get over the terrible sides that come with dinner entrees. Limp iceberg "salad", sad, mealy french fries, and white rice with frozen mixed veggies drag the main entree down. The complimentary shrimp ceviche tostadas that come at the beginning of the meal is nice. The service was fairly prompt on the Sunday night when we went. Not sure if I would go back. Sides are not the main attraction but they are terrible enough to detract from the meal.
