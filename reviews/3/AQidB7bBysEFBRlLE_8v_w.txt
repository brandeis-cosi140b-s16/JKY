Better than any chain restaurant yet not great authentic Mexican food. I ordered the #18 which had an overly sweet chicken mole enchilada with hardly any flavor outside of the sugar. It also came with a really good chicken flauta not overly done with a nice cheese flavor inside, with good rice and beans. The fun interior adds to the atmosphere and the chips and salsas are yum. If you like a little heat ask for the green salsa, it is very good and homemade.
