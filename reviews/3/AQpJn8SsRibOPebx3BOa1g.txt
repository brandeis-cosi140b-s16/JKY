I wish I could give it 3.5 stars. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad either.

We had a BOGO coupon so we decided to give it a try. Overall, I find the food not to have lots of flavor. Maybe if I had chosen a different item my opinion would be different.

My husband's burrito was better tasting than mine. He got BBQ chicken and red sauce. I was afraid the red sauce would be too spicy for me so I picked the mild green one and the grilled chicken burrito.

My burrito was yummy, just not very flavorful. I love to see how they make tortillas just right in from of you and the cilantro dressing for the salad was delicious.

On the other hand, they nickle and dime for things that you get for free at other places like sour cream. 

I love Chipotle but I don't think you can compare these two restaurants. I mean, the concept's the same but the food isn't. Chipotle to me seems much more simple than Cafe Rio and they also offer meat  from animals that haven't been raised with antibiotics and stuff like that.. I like Chipotle much more and you can add more toppings without paying extra.

The restaurant decoration's cute. Very colorful! I loved it and there are lots of options for drinks not just sodas. 

The staff was nice and courteous. We didn't have a problem to use our BOGO coupon and their menu offers something called "nino quesadilla". It's just a taco tortilla with some shredded cheddar folded in half. It's free so that's good for a little kid. My daughter ate it just fine and ate some of my dinner too.

Their bathroom wasn't very clean and there was no toilet seat covers, the soap machine wasn't working... I have a 3 year old so taking her potty to a place like that kinda grosses me out.

So overall, I'm not sure we'll be back because we have better options close by. The food's not bad. It's just not great, either.
