I stopped in because I searched Yelp for "carne asada fries" and this was the closest place to my hotel.

It's not much to look at from the outside.  And really, it's not much to look at on the inside.  But we're not shooting an HGTV episode here.  I'm here for the food.

I ordered up an order of the carne asada fries along with a mexican coke.  I sat down in one of the booths to wait for my food.  The guy called out my order in short time and I went up to grab my food.

Full Disclosure:  This is only my second time trying carne asada fries.  I first them in San Diego a few months ago and just loved them.  So now I'm on the lookout for them whenever I'm west of the Mississippi.

I liked these fries.  The ingredients were a little cheaper than what I had out in SD, but it was still pretty dang tasty.  If you put french fries, guac, steak, and cheese on a plate, I'm a happy man.  The serving size was huge and I ended up taking some of it back to my hotel.

If I'm back in town, I'll definitely try to make it back!
