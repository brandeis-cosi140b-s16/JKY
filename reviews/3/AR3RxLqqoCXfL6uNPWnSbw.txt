Eaten here two time prior to yesterday; loved the food. Yesterday, I took a seat at the bar (as usual) and realized, the bartenders were not the normal. Didn't really matter considering they don't cook the food.  Problem- "I sat at the bar for ten minutes while the freakin bartender, stood across the bar socializing with two of his female friends". It's not like he didn't see me, considering there was only 6 of us at the bar.  Didn't press the issue simply took my money to the bar at TGIF. (good night, after all)!!
