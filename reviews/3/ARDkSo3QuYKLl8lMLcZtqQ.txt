The product itself deserves 5 stars, but the owner's attitude brings it down to a 3 for me. If you're up for crazy good raspados and don't mind poor customer service, come here. I'm not joking. I'd be willing to drive the 30 minutes it takes me to get out there just for a raspado if it weren't for his attitude.
