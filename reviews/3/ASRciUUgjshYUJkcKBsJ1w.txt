Fills me up!

If you're hungry this place will definitely fill you up with the large burritos and my pick the naked bowl. I like choosing my own toppings and the food is fresh. The lines seem to go by quickly as well. 

I gave it a 3 because the food isn't always consistent and a chain like this should be. Sometimes the chicken is on the dry side or the rice has been overcooked. I hope these things can be worked out because the fresh concept is a great one.
