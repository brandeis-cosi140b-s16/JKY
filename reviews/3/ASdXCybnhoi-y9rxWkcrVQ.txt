We like Javier's. We go there a lot as we stay at the Aria, A LOT. The food has it's ups and downs, but I like the bar and the atmosphere. It's always a quick and easy place to get into for lunch. 

My complaint - the chairs in the bar. I mean, they are the biggest and heaviest chairs ever. We like to sit in the bar a lot. We usually order apps and drinks so the bar is perfect for us.

I love their seafood enchilada! Yummyy :) Oh and their green salsa with the avocado, just amazing, especially of you enjoy spicy! 

All in all, it is a little overpriced food, but it's in the Aria, so we'll go again, I'm sure :)
