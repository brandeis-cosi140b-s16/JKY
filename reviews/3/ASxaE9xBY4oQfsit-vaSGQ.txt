I'm always the first to say that I love Mad Mex.  I don't care that it's Tex Mex, just give me a supersized Dance Marathon Enchilada and I'm in dance party heaven!  

What I was sad about at this location was the gauc,.  It was, how do you say....okay...it was just plain gross.  It tasted rotten!  Not the way you want your gauc to taste.  And for some reason I kept torturing myself by taking little bites to see what the heck was wrong with it!  The waitress, who was incredibly nice, took it back to see what was up with it.  She said she thought maybe it had too much lime in it.  I love lime and I don't really know how lime can make gauc taste rotten, but I was pretty bummed 

The good?  My Dance Marathaon Enchilada, as always, was a party in my mouth!  And like I said, our waitress was super friendly and a great server!  She suggested to the seasonal Apple Cider Margarita.  I excited and scared all at once!  I've been digging the ciders lately, but in a marg?  A little scary.  First sip tasted a bit like cinnamon apple sauce.  A tad weird.  A couple sips later, I was into it.  I was also into caramel/sugar lining the rim of the glass!  

Solid meal, I just missed the fresh, non weird tasting, gauc.  Until next time...practice safe Mex everyone!
