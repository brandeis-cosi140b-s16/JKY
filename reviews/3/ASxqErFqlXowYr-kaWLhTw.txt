A solid enough experience but I couldn't help comparing it to its predecessor, Revo Burrito.  They no longer have those great multicolored chips and the green salsa.  They still have the old revo burritos but are smaller and at the same price.  I understand the attraction of rebranding the place and positioning yourself so that you can offer the high end tequilas.  I don't mind this place I just wish they would have also kept Revo.
