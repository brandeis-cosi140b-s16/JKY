A-ok is exactly right - great place to stop in and have a quick full on meal. It's authentic and the ingredients are fresh. The people are cool - it's a classic hole-in-the-wall kinda place which usually are among the best. Blink and you'll miss it unless the giant skulls on the outside wall facing 7th grab your attention. Tacos de Juarez is a good place. Definitely recommended. :)
