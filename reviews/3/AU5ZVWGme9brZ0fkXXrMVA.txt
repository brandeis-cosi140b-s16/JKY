Had the Chicken Burrito with white rice, pinto beans, salsa & sour cream. Quick service in the preparation of the food. Cashier pleasant. Presented my "Free" chips & guacamole coupon with purchase. 
Burrito for $ 7.01 total with tax-NO DRINK was a small size for the cost. Chips & Quac average tasting. 
I would be happier going to Filiberto's & getting a bigger burrito without the fillers for a better price. Sorry Chipotle: I'm just not a big fan..
