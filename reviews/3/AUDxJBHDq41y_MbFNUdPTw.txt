I have been a Moreno's customer since they day they opened. 

When it opened, the restaurant was pretty very awkward. It was confusing if you were supposed to sit down, walk up and order, bus your own plates. It made the restaurant uncomfortable.

However, the food was fantastic. I used to live across the street from the restaurant and ate their a few time a week. The poritions were large and everything I ate was great. Chicken, cabeza, lengua, all fantastic. Asada was not the best, but it was still good. The salsas were good, but nothing memorable. Rice and beans were always delicious. Even the shrimp burrito was tasty.

Everything was great for the first year or so of the restaurant.

Recently they have made some refinements and it is just not as good. While they have removed the akwardness from the restaurant, they have reduced portion sizes and raised prices. 

Still a good restaurant, but not like it used to be.

Drinks are still VERY cheap at Moreno's. It was always hard for me to leave without knocking back a few Dos Equis.
