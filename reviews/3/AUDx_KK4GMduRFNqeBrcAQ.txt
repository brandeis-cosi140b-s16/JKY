Good for Sun City Mexican food. The salsa is OK buy has no heat to it. The meals are good but a little on the bland side. The real plus is the pricing.  Its pretty cheap but they only take cash which can be a hassle for those of us that only carry cards. My grandmother's favorite Mexican food but not my cup of tea.
