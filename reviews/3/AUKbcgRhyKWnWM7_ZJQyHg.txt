the food is generally pretty good for lower-priced cafe style Mexican food. I think the portions are generous and the price point is decent. I think the staff could be nicer but what do I expect from high school kids, right? super lame that you have to preordained by phone to use the drive thru.  also, the lines and wait times can be pretty extensive if you go at peak times.
