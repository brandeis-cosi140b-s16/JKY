Decent service, friendly workers, the food tasted good, but they were pretty light on the meat. I ordered 4 different things, a chicken burrito, a carnitas burrito, a chicken salad, and a steak bowl. All four of them had very little meat on them. I felt like I paid too much for mostly rice, lettuce, and beans.
