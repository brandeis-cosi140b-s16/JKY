Decided on this place after we had been out running errands on a Friday night.  Stopped in here as we wanted to try someplace new.  I'm so glad we did.  We were seated right away in a hightop table at the bar.  The service was fine, the waiter was polite, helpful, and did keep my water glass refilled (which I needed as my meal was spicy!).  The food itself was great.  It was so nice to be able to order a tamale!  I'd missed the one's my best friend's mom used to make.  All in All, I'd definitely go back, the food was very good and the atmosphere was great.
