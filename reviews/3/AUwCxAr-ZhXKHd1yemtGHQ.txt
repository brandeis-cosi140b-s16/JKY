Definitely not bad at all, its the closest stand to a taco stand in Tijuana that you're gonna get here in Vegas. The tacos al pastor had good flavoring as well as the carne asada tacos. Loved that they had a variety of salsa and accompaniments, not too many tacos places offer more than radish so the fact that they have cucumbers is great. Not to mention it was clean (BIG plus in my book).
