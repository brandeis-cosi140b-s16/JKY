**I have to lower my rating on this joint...Since they've come under new owner/mgmt, they've fired some of their best staff, including Johan who brought them SO MUCH business (that won't be coming back, including me!). They've also upped their prices-granted the menu has changed, but add'l $3-$5 per entree?! Seriously?? I've been going to other spots(reviews to follow) that are less pricey and just as delicious, if not better. 

I LOVE THEIR NACHOS!!! I should probably sample more of the food before writing a review, but who cares. Go for the nachos. The "appetizer" portion is enough to feed two people and have leftovers(unless you're some big ol hungryman type). Their mojitos and margeritas are the ish too. 
Drinks in general are good, but catch a special, even if you have money to waste, a drink special tastes much better than regular priced booze anyday!
Ask for Johan to be your server. My spicy, hot latin friend with the perfect teeth and best jiggalo accent you'll EVER here. He's awesome and the nicest guy ever. And who DOESN'T want to be served by someone beautiful that makes you think you're on vacation in S. America??(even straight guys and gay girls like me like it so ha!)
