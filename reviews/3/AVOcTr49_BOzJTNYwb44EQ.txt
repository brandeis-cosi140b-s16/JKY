I used to eat here 3 times a week (drive-thru).  The hot sauce is fantastic! It's Mexican fast food, so expect it. Open 24 hours and has a drive-thru. Don't bother eating in - the setting really leaves something to be desired - and unlike it's nearby Tempe location, it is big and rather empty, even when the drive-thru line is out to Alma School. Bean tostada, Carne Asada burrito, guac taquitos, some of our mainstays.  Enjoy!
