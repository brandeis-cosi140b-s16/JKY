Here to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. It took 45 mins for  our food to come out and then it was all wrong. It took longer for us to get silverware. Horrible service tonight. Food was good, but service was not up to par. I had a bad service experience the last time I was here too. Not sure if I will be back.
