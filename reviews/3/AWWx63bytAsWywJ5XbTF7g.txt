Ok - maybe my colleagues talked this one up a bit too much! The most I could give this place is my three star rating. 

The parking was horrible - thank God it doesn't rain here because I'd be soaking wet by the time I got to the restaurant. The selection was ok, but I didn't think it had the variety it should have. The price wasn't the highest in town, but it certainly makes you think about it, which in turn makes you believe you'd get better food and service. Though the service wasn't lousy - when you charge the big bucks - people expect the best!

Overall cleanliness was ok - but again - not the best I've seen. The portion size and the overall flavor of the meal was also good - nothing to rant and rave about.

Would I go back - I doubt it - not because it's bad, but because it's sorta out of the way and didn't measure up for my return. If they sold baseball hats with their logo and name on it - I might be enticed to return though - of course they'd probably charge 35 bucks for a generic manufactured hat!
