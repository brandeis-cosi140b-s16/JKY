Driving around this area...I found this restaurant...nice decorated. ..Saturday 1 pm.  Only two servers..running delivering food. Taking calls. And seating customers...any way  chips ok..salsa watery kind spice for me.I know they can make better for sure.  Our lunch took longer than normal..but we were satisfied, Flavor , Presentation. I'll make new stop.
