This restaurant has great New Mexican food.  The service has declined over the last year; now if you are not a regular you are treated fairly poorly.  Last night our waitress was absolutely inattentive.  We ordered drinks, and the drinks sat on the bar for a good 5 minutes as our waitress was talking to customers she knew.  Thankfully the bartender realized this after about 5 minutes and brought our drinks over.  Our drinks were not made appropriately (per Blue Adobe's own menu description).  I asked the bartender about this and she told me I was wrong.  Not wanting to argue, I just went back to my seat.  A couple of minutes later, she brought me the rest of my drink, stating that she had misunderstood my question.  The waitress also never came back to see if we wanted drink refills throughout our meal as she was too busy concentrating on regulars.  The restaurant was only about 2/3 full, and we could see that the waitress was spending lots of time at certain tables while being inattentive to others.   I was close to going back to the bar myself to order, when I was able to stop the waitress and ask for additional drinks.

The food here is great.  The experience sub-par.
