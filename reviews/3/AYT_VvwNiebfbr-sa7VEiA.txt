First off I must say the staff here is amazing! Nice, friendly, and fun to talk with. The queso dip and the nacho dishes are all must haves!

Now for my 2 big gripes about the place. 

First, the worst margaritas in Vegas. They are so incredibly sweet, it's actually undrinkable. I can't believe they claim they are voted the best in town and I am shocked they haven't changed the recipe after the feedback I've heard from other people that have had them. 

Secondly, it seems they always have the giant front roll up door open even on extremely hot days. If your going there between may and August, be ready to sweat! Not the best environment for enjoying a nice lunch or dinner. 

If you stick with the ice cold beer they offer and go either at night, or in the fall/winter, you will have a 5 star experience!
