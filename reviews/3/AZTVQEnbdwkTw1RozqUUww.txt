I came here last Saturday night for the first time.  Hey another typical Scottsdale night spot.  Full of douche bags and hot chicks.  My friend had his birthday party here so we had a cabana.  That was actually pretty sweet.  The only real reason why I had was because of the group of people I was with.  Otherwise I would totally overlook this place as an option to go to.
