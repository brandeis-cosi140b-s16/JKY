Did my usual lunch routine (get in my car and drive around until something looks interesting) and ended up here today.  Place was empty so I got to order right away.  The guy behind the counter was friendly so I asked him what was good.  He recommended the Carne Asada fries (which sounded BOMB.com but I wasn't in the mood for fries at the time), their roasted chicken, chile rellenos and chicken enchiladas and he also told me about the special of the day which was three rolled tacos for like .99 cents or something.  I decided to go with the enchiladas with a side of rice and beans to go.

The enchiladas were good, chicken was nice and tender, sauce was flavorful and they were a nice size.  Not gigantic like I was about to go on a fast for weeks but not tiny like they were trying to pass off some taquitos with sauce either.  Just two nicely sized enchiladas.  I wasn't very impressed with the rice and beans though.  The beans were too thick for my taste and didn't have a lot of flavor and the rice I didn't feel had much flavor either.  I'll definitely be back thanks to the friendly service and yummy main dish but I won't get a combo next time.
