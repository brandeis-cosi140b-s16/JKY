The food is decent for the price, and we eat here fairly often.  The chips are good, as is the salsa.  My family eats everything from burritos, tacos, to mini chimichangas, and all are flavorful.  My only real complaint is that the service isn't great.  The people who work the counter are monotone and border on rude half the time.  They are also stingy with chips when you order to go.  They give you a decent amount when you eat in, but with a to go order, they balk at giving you enough for the order.   Other than that - no real complaints and will continue to frequent for the food.
