So excited to try this Mexican Grill.  Has a very inviting exterior and the patio is comfortable and relaxed.  The service was excellent.  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with selections.  I wish I could rate it higher, however the food was just ok.  We ordered the nachos and probably would not try these again.   They were covered with a queso cheese dip  and not much else.  We would go back, but next time we will try something else and maybe I can rate it higher.
