We ordered takeout.... I think it's good for a Mexican place. However I was not blown away with the food quality or taste.

a lot of great reviews for this restaurant... I did not go in I just ordered takeout. But it wasn't that much better then a fast food Mexican place.

If you have a craving for fast Mexican food that is decent and then you can't go wrong
