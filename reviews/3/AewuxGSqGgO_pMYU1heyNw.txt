This place is where you would go for a very fast, cheap fix. I hear great things about their breakfast tacos, but the carne asada burrito can only be described as "meh." Everything about it was fine except that the meat quality is quite poor. I suppose you can't expect a pound of food for much cheaper than that. It's still better than cashing in at Taco Bell or McDonald's.

I would definitely go back to try their massive breakfast burritos. You really can't go wrong with a breakfast burrito, and everyone raves about them. Worth giving a second shot. The most redeeming quality is that this place is open 24 hours, which possibly is the only quality that matters for folks that are cranking away at saving America just a mile down the road at Nellis. ;)
