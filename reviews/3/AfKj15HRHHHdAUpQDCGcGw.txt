I will start off by saying that this review is influenced by two completely different experiences, which is represented by my middle of the road rating. (First visit: 4 star, Recent visit: 1 star)

To keep this relatively short I will just bullet point the things these two visits have taught me. 

1. El Hefe is NOT a place to take a group. All the food ordered by a single table comes out together on the same blocks (yes I mean wooden blocks), with no sense of order. Now granted going with a group of 15 people (which I did), tends to lead to some confusion at any restaurant, but this was inexcusable. If you ordered the same thing as someone on the opposite side of the table from you it would come on the same platter and it was up to the customer to yell across the table, find what they had ordered, and have it passed over to them. This becomes particularly difficult with unfamiliar specialty tacos. Everything looks similar so only order something with a noticeable ingredient to guarantee correct delivery. 

2. Having said that, this place does well with small groups, during the lunch time hours. Sit in one of the booths with the self serve beer taps at the table. It's definitely a unique and cool feature. 

3. Check your bill! Every person in our group was overcharged for a particular drink that we specifically asked about the price. The same thing occurred with an up charge on a food menu item add on. 

4. The d√©cor is cool and unique, but be prepared for an Ed Hardy-esque explosion. Just embrace it. 

5. The food is pretty delicious, but I am not a connoisseur.  Be prepared for small taco portions and tapas style entrees. 

Overall this is a place for a quick happy hour drink and delicious $3 taco or a nice light lunch.  It's growing pains are providing a temporary excuse for some of it's short comings so be patient but provide feedback. It's needed. 

P.S Don't forget to try the Bulldog Margarita (Margarita with a Corona in it)
