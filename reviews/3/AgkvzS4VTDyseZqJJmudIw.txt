If you are in West Las Vegas and are looking for a quality taco.. A place to find eats after the club... Then here is your place.

This place is very simple. There are a few chairs outside to enjoy these wonderful tacos, or you can take them to go.

**note: there's free WiFi out by these chairs as well**

No complaints about the service. It kind of reminded me of tacos that my mom makes.

I'll definitely be back for more!
