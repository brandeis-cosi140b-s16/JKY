Editable, overrated, too much for the price but good. Nothing out of the ordinary for other authentic taco shops but more expensive. Yes, i love beans, and these did come close to most beans I've eatin. Tasted a lot like bottled beans. The highlight was the lady....very nice and fun to talk too.....but she is very good at upselling...or maybe i'm just a sucker. Barbacoa was my fav....way better than the carne asada.
