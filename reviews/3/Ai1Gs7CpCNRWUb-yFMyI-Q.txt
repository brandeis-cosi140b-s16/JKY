Came again recently.  Similar experience to last time.  Long wait even with reservations.  They charge you for chips, wow.  We had a waitress that was in a bad mood just seemed unfriendly.  Outdoor patio is the best thing about this place very charming.  Food choices are strange for a Mexican place there is very few Mexican dishes.  Food was OK overall.  Probably wont try this place again for a few more years.
