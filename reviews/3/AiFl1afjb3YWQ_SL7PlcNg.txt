Warning... Lots of food. Come hungry. Not hungry like you skipped out on lunch, hungry as if you've never had a meal in your life. I'm telling you, portions or mother effing huge. Now while I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and all the food that was served, I didn't feel welcomed by my server. Sure, she provided what I needed but she was very short and spent more time with al her other tables. Perhaps because I didn't speak Spanish? No biggie. The guy at the check out counter was super friendly though. 

From all the pics I saw on Yelp and from what I stalked around me, everything seems to be cooked the same, grilled and fried. I found all the meats in my meal to be juicy with the exception of the chicken. Most places seem to always overcook chicken. Aside that, all seemed to be pretty good.
