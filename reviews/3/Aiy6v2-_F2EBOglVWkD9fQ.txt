I honestly love this place. Is the cheapest breakfast burritos or burritos in general that you can get that actually tastes great. It is quite the hole in the wall place though. If you're looking to take somebody out on a date or looking for a nice sit down restaurant. This is not the place! However if you're looking for a quick bite where the drive thru might not work sometimes, this is the place to not break your wallet! The staff is not super friendly, as they might give you weird looks as you wait for your food every now and then. Regardless of all, the food and price tags are quite worth it. If you're ever in Mesa this is the place to go. They have filibertos size burritos that are cheaper. There is also a small fee for debit cards, I think it's $0.50.
