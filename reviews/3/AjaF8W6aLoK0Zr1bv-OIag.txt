The torta cubana has a really good taste, however felt it was a bit over priced. The price for the same torta at Salsitas is around the same for a much bigger torta. Have taken my kids for the ice cream in which they enjoy eating at the location with the friendly atmosphere. Will be going again soon to try the raspados as I noticed they had several different flavors to chose from.
