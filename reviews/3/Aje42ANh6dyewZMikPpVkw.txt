Recently moved to the area and like to support local businesses versus chain restaurants so hubby and I anxious to try this local Mexican restaurant.  Hubby and I went on a Saturday night and the restaurant was busy as it is smaller inside then appears outside but we were able to get a seat quickly.  I liked the vibe and d√©cor inside though the lights were very bright.  The outside patio did not seem as inviting as it could have been for a cute lil courtyard setting but it was a nice option.   Our server was friendly though the hostess seemed uninterested and not very warm or friendly despite us telling her that it was our first time at the restaurant.   The menu was reasonably priced and service was prompt.   The homemade chips were very good.   I ordered enchiladas suiza and they were plated nicely but had bland flavor.  My husband had a shrimp burrito that was tough and he did not finish.  I really wanted to like this place and have it be our local go-to Mexican restaurant but I think we will keep searching for another spot before/if returning.
