When reviewing an eatery, I always consider the overall value.  At $1.50 a taco (carne asada and al pastor), I've gotta say I've had way better for less cost.

The carne asada lacked any unique flavor.  It merely tastes like meat.  I would have appreciated a slight lime or chile flavoring of sort.  Heck, I'd take a salty peppery taste (the easiest to achieve without messing up the taco).  

The al pastor had a nice sweetness to contrast the slight spiciness; however, the meat and the onion and pineapple mixture had all turned to mush.  The taco lacked the basic "meat" texture a taco needs to make it feel like you're eating a taco.

I also ordered a fish taco ($2.00) which was alright.  It wasn't battered and deep fried (Baja style) but grilled instead.  The fish flavor was present, but, much like the carne asada, there was no real seasoning to set this taco apart from any ol' taco place.

The tacos were standard street size (fit in the palm of your hand, double tortilla). 

The place was really clean.  The green and red salsa were GREAT with the complimentary chips I received.  

Overall, this place isn't terrible or anything.  It's just nothing to rave about.  If you're looking to get your taco fix, you can get it here (I just can't justify paying more than $1.00-1.25 per taco....yes, 25 cents makes a BIG difference, especially when ordering for a family).
