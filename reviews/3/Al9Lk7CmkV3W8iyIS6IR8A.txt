Service for the sedated seasonal sorority seeking salivating shot takers...Open late with good table side guacomole and heaping chimichangas filled erroneously with 'shrooms not found in Mexico yet tasty somehow.  
Our host was pleasant when she came to actually serve us but there was so little of that I do not want to get you excited about the service.  
I think I am giving a 3 instead of a 2 because of the generally calming effect this late night find had on my aura on the night of my visit.  Or was that some sort of weird salty mermaid...?
