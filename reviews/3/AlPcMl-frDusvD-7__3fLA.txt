What the hell happened to you today? God. What an abortion.
What a miscarriage. 

And, to be fair, I eat you a lot. You're well groomed and appreciative. You accommodate my preference for the noon time action. You call later just to make sure there were no weird flavors or odors. Usually, such a treat! Like a happy dog in the summer sun. 

Today? Today was different. Today was bad. So bad I'm forced to be honest. I HATE BEING HONEST! Today? It's like you were partying all night and hooked up with some random and afterward (without showering) felt used so you called me because you know I'm always there for you. You know, because of our history? You have a special place in my comforting, still chubby but receding, belly. 

Today it was fake. I could tell your heart wasn't in it. Once you got to me you realized that I was just a false idol. A warm body and nothing more. My name could have easily been a number. Wouldn't have been any different to you. HOW DO YOU THINK THAT MAKES ME FEEL? So you pretended to "come so fast." It only took me 13 bites to finish you. Under two minutes? Please! I know you better than that... You can't bullshit a bullshitter. You could have just told me you changed your mind. That if felt wrong. That it wasn't me, it was you. That you wanted someone who wanted a bigger burrito for you. I mean, usually my burrito gets the job done but today, for variety, mentioning that we should do it in the bowl was off-handed. I didn't mean it! I still wanted the burrito to work it's mojo. I just thought the bowl play would add a little intrigue.

Ok. Fine! You're right. It's my fault. I should have never mentioned the fucking bowl. It was a mistake. FUCK! 13 bites. 2.5 ouces of guac juice? I get it. Mr. Random last night was saving it up. You were impressed. Don't worry about my feelings. I'm good at other things. No seriously. Don't worry. GO FEED MR. RANDOM burrito. Clearly you like him better. God, I'm so worthless! 

WAH!
