How hard is it to take an order correctly?

I ordered several items for lunch today 4 of the items were correct but i question why they smother their tamales in sauce not appetizing at all....

I also ordered a combo 2 tacos with rice & beans and asked for shredded beef but instead i get 2 chicken tacos which in my opinion is very bland no flavor to it at all...

I still recommend this place for decent  grub but it sort fails at customer service
