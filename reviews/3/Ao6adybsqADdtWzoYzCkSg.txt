I thought this was a pretty decent restaurant as far as mexican restaurants go.  As soon as you sit down they serve you chips and salsa.  The tortilla chips are smoking hot and salty.  Delish.  I took my grandmother here and we sat on the patio.  The patio has a great atmosphere and a light-up waterfall that creates a great background noise.  We each ordered a margarita and rec'd a jumbo marg.  I'm not complaining, but if I were only wanting a small margarita I would have sent this one back and asked for the smaller size.  The quality of the marg was wonderful.  It wasn't over bearingly sweet and had a nice flavor of tequila.  I think they use a higher quality than your average mexican restaurant.  The guacamole was ok.  Nothing exceptionally special about it.  It could have used a little more spices and a little less raw onions.  The chips that come with the guacamole were wonderful.  They are the same fried tortillas that they use on the sopapillas (the dessert nachos).  
I had a cheese quesadilla and a chicken enchilada.  The portion of chicken used in the enchilada and my grandma's taco was fairly large.  It was all pretty good.  We had the sopapillas to finish everything off and they were delicious.  They are drizzled with a strawberry syrup and cinnamon sugar and topped with whipped cream.  Super healthy.  Overall not a bad choice.  Decent food and a great atmosphere coupled with a jumbo margarita make for a wonderful evening.
