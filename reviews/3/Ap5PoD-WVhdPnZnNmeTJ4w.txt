Found this spot while browsing through yelp, trying to find some place with really good fish tacos. Everything looked amazing in the pics and my bf and I are into trying new things. It was pretty good. Some things were more of a feast upon your eyes. It wasn't bad though. It was just alright right.  I would recommend it as a place to try if you want to try something different. Just once.
