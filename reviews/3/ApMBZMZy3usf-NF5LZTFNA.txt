Not sure why this restaurant is rated as highly as it is but I thought it was just okay. While the service was decent...the food was mediocre at best. I had the Chicken Quesadilla and the portions were definitely smaller than I thought. Not only that but the food was nothing special at all. After I was finished I decided to try a taco and while that was better, it's just not enough for me to come back to the restaurant. With so many other Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix metro area I doubt that I will be back.
