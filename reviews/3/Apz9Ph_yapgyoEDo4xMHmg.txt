In town for business and walked to this place from my hotel.  It was surprisingly good.  I had chile relllenos.  The poblanos were fresh and cooked properly.  Actually, the waiter recommended the dish.  The one downer was the margarita.  It was syrupy sweet, which I find disgusting.  It was definitely a pre-made mix.  I should have went for a corona.  Anyway, the cost was very cheap, the chips were fresh, and the meal was pleasant.
