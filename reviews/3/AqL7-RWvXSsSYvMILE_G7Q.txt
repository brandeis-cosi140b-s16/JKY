Ok so I keep coming back but, now I go later in the afternoon and usually only order a side salad and a crunchy chicken taco. They always get my order right and have my salsa in the bag as well.
The meal is always good and wishing I had more :)
They still have an issue of not having any Flan. All I can say if you NEVER have it take it off the menu.
