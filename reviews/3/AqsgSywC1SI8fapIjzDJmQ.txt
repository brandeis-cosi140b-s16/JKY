My friend and I had lunch here it was good a bit too pricey for what we ordered but thankfully the food was very good. My friend had the mexico city chicken enchiladas and I had the grilled skirt steak. We also had the chips and salsa the salsa was very good, but the chips and salsa not free like other mexican restaurants. As for the service it was good although our waiter seem to have trouble splitting our bill in half. Overall that place was good I don't think I will eat here again but will for sure get a mango margarita to go!
