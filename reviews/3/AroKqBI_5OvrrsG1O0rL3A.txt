I work close to this Qdoba in Southside Works, so I've been here relatively frequently over the last several years. I really enjoy their queso and tortilla chips, but needless to say, this isn't very healthy to eat often. I usually order a combination of soft and hard tacos which are tasty but very sloppily put together. Overall, it's an OK spot to drop by for lunch every few weeks or so... but not much more than that.
