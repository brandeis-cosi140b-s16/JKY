I started out the evening with a Spicy Seniorita which was very good.  I was surprised that the spiciness of the jalapeno and cranberry juice went well together!  The guacamole was one of the best ones that I have had in a while.  For my entrée - I had the salmon entrée which had a chipotle cauliflower puree and quinoa croquettes which I loved!  The salmon was a little undercooked for my liking in the middle but it was still good.  The atmosphere here was nice and open - but all the windows made it quite chilly on an evening where it was -4 degrees out.  I will have to try Verde again in the summer!
