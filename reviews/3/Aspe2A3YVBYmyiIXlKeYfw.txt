After moving to Buckeye from a small town with nothing but sub-par Mexican restaurants I swore I would never eat at another Mexican place again. Of course we were taken to Manuels for a "thank you" dinner from some friends. The 4 of us were immediately seated and after a short time got a hot bowl of chips. Now was my chance to try a fish taco. Nope, never had one and never wanted to spend money and not like it. This was a great  I must say!. Not battered or fried but grilled. The bummer was I chose the corn tortilla and was embarassed to try and eat the the darn thing coming apart due to steaming it. Nothing short of shoving it in my mouth made it possible to eat. I also looked like a slob because they don't give spoons so it was too messy trying to get more then 5 pieces of rice on my fork without it falling all over the place. Can't really rate the taste.  My husband and I returned for a lunch date and got there when it first opened. Kinda wierd that the chips weren't warm like the first time. Got the chicken taco salad and since I can't eat sour cream and wasn't going to eat the fried tortilla bowl I realized there's not much chicken in that dish. I got a heck of alot of lettuce though (I left a little hungry) We did have nice service both times and I did catch a cute (private) moment coming from the ladies room. One of the waiters was quietly whispering I love you to one of the waitress. They were embarassed when I tried to walk past unnoticed. Not the greatest place but I will go back as it's clean and I love the fish tacos.
