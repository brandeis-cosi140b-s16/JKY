I am debating  between 3 and 4 stars for El Nopalito.  I think it settles perfectly on 3.5 at least for right now.  

The Good:
* The tacos were very good - whether they warrant the prestigious New Times best of PHX?  I have to disagree on that.
* Service was quick, our food came fast and it was fairly busy at the time.
* Their menu has an English side for those who are less adept at differing Sopas and Sopes.
* It's CHEAP!  Two very full people left only spending a total of ten bucks.
* The salsa was SPICY.  Sometimes it seems to be tough to find places that take the risk of offending people with sensitive taste buds.

The Meh:
* Maybe it was just b/c it was Sunday, but our server didn't really seem happy that we, nor she, were in El Nopalito
* They may have been the smallest tacos I've ever had.  That being said, they were only a buck.
* El Nopalito is located so close to so many great restaurants that it'll be tough to justify skipping some of those.
* The chips for the salsa were lackluster at best.

Overall I had a good experience.  I think the description of the three-star review as being "A-OK" is perfect for El Nopalito.  I'd return, but there are a few spots that I would have to give my return business to first!
