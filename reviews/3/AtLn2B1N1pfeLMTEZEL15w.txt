I come here once a week as I work swing shift and fast food is slim pickings at around 1130pm at night in this part of Phoenix. Also since I've been frequent here for the past 2 years I've gotten to know the front cashier lady who is very nice and also found out that the best cook they have online is the one that works the late night hours. Been here at all times of day and found out that everything from taste of food and service is much better late night. I would recommend their shrimp burrito, fish tacos, carne asada burrito and their al pastor(grilled marinated pork) nachos. It's not the healthiest of choice but for the quality and quantity they give it definitely outweighs the price. So if four looking for a late night craving of Mexican food with a great selection of aguas frescas(horchata, tamarindo, pina, etc.) look no further! Btw, they have a 24hr operation and drive thru. Given 3 stars cause of location, lack of cleanliness, and lack of consistency as mentioned earlier regarding am staff versus the stellar pm staff. I know sounds like I'm asking for the stars but I should keep it in perspective it is a whole in the wall diner with great tasting food.
