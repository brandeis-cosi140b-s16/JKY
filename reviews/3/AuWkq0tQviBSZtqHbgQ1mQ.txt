Do we really need this in our lives?  Really?  REALLY????

This is the second such place I've seen - the first was over a year ago and I'd almost forgotten but I think it's over on 7th street near Dunlap.  They just closed down the Taco Bell on Central and built this here.   But really???  

Sigh... what's sad is how it makes my family happy.  I could (but don't anymore) eat Taco Bell 3-4 times a week easily and never feel like it was too much.  Girlfriend feels close to the same for Long John Silvers, especially the hush puppies, but there's never been one near our house.  Until now.  And where did they put this?  On our path between home and the gym.  Grrr.....

So we relented after a long night and figured we'd get it over with. I can't get over the smell when you walk in.  Funky.  But the interior is done nicely with lots of booths and low tables.  Best part is a large round table that can easily sit 6.  They are kinda going for a seaside Mexican seafood look.  It doesn't work so well, but it's certainly not bad.  My tacos were yummy.  She said her fish was a little greasy.  (Don't even know how she can tell.  But apparently she can.)

It's not important cuisine by any means, but it's not the worst fast food in the area.  But again, did we really need this?
