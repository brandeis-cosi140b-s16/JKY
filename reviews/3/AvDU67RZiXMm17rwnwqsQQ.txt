La Palapa.  I am sitting in a 3.5 star place, but I just can't give them four stars.  I ordered a beef quesadilla because I went to Clarion, and I know that the Clarion beef barn has some of the best beef ever.  The quesadilla was packed with meat, a little short on cheese, but came with some salsa.  I think it was $3.50.

While the quesadilla was good, I don't have any desire to go back.  I think the shortage of good Mexican food within Pittsburgh makes people over-hype places like this.  It's really just OK.  Not bad if you work in the area, but I think there are better options.
