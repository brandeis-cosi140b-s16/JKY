Within about 3 minutes of leaving this location my bag ripped from the bottom and my food splattered everywhere. Turns out the bottom of my bag was completely soaked, because I'm guessing my bowl wasn't sealed all the way so sure enough catastrophe ensued. I took a photo and my receipt back and asked if there was a manager on duty that I could speak with about how to proceed. The cashier just told the original employee that made my bowl to remake it. She did so with a surprisingly light hand, and then didn't give me a new bag of the $1 kids chips I ordered, because apparently even though the bag was soaked, it didn't actually rip so she couldn't give me another bag. Those chips are literally worth about 5Â¢ so I don't understand the big deal, I paid for them but apparently that was not enough. I didn't want to argue with her over a bag of like 12 chips so I just left. Bottom line: The chip thing should not be a big deal to me, but it unfortunately rubbed me the wrong way. The experience was infuriating and I will avoid this location in the future.
