I love chipotle but this particular location has disappointed me ! 
First they're really busy,which it's not a big deal almost all the chipotles are always busy. However their service is kinda slow,and the food seems to be running out when I was ordering(meat and veggies containers look almost empty.) I did notice that they are refilling the food when I was about to pay,just my luck I guess. 
Food is great but not the best,still way better than salsaritas though.
