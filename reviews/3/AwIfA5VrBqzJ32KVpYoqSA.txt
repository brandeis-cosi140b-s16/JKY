Hit this place on a drunken walk back to the hotel....tacos!!! Who in their right....err...drunk mind, doesn't love a taco at 3am???? or was it 4???? Wayyyyyy overpriced, 4 tacos for 12.00 just doesn't add up. Carnitas was very good, better than expected. The chili's were all good...the "Hot" one will blow your socks off...so unless you want to be hanging on the ivory throne in burning agony....don't try.
