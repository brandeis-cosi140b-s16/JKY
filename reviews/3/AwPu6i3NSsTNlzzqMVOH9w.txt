Friendly service but otherwise, pretty standard compared to other inexpensive restaurants of this type in the Charlotte area. This is the only one that I know of in Fort Mill, so there's that.

Chips were good, salsa was a little more watery than I like but otherwise tasty. I had the two burritos lunch special, my daughter had a chimichanga. Both were good portions and they were quality.

As I said, service was good. I'd return here.
