My wife and I wanted to try somewhere different for lunch.  She loves mexican food.  Well we decided to try Baja Fresh.  The food was ok.   I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.   I would rather eat rubios or chipotle to be honest.  The table was dirty and we had to ask it be cleaned.  The service was quick though.
