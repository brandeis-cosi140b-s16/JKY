This Chipotle looks like any other, serving up your fresh, stereotypical Mexican cuisine.  

Service: The workers here are a bit terse and pretty inefficient compared to the Chipotles in Chicago.  But then again, there is much higher traffic in Chicago...  Thank goodness I didn't come when school already started...!

Food: The quality here is just as good as any other Chipotle :)
