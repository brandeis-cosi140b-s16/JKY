I have driven by several times so I decided to finally try it. I will say they have very good queso and the tortillas are very good. However, they weren't busy at all and the staff seemed annoyed both with each other and with me for 'disturbing' them with my order. Also, I ordered a chicken quesadilla and even commented is that it? Because they gave 7.. Yes literally 7... Small pieces of chicken.
