Meh.  I stopped here for a quick bite to eat and after noticing the Kebab place next door, I wished I would have gone there instead.

I ordered the Five Roll Tacos with Carne Asada.  Huge portions, it's was roughly $8.  I could only eat half.  The salsa doesn't seem quite spicy at all and the whole dish needed more salt, particularly the meat.
