Rubios honestly has the potential for great fast food. The shrimp and fish tacos are pretty good by fast food standards, and the Langostino Lobster tacos are pretty tasty. However, I cannot justify spending so much on so little. The portions are very small for the money, and the fish does not taste fresh. So while I will say the food is decent - the pricing is not. 

As far as service, the staff seems friendly and helpful, as long as you don't advise them that your order is wrong. They seem confused at that point.
