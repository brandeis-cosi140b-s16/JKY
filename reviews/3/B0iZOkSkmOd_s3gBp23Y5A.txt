First of all, I love burritos. And anything that tastes authentic it's even better. 

Johnny's Burrito is always crowded. Line out the door, but there isn't really a large inside area anyways. Atmosphere is very eclectic and original. Option for your burrito are endless, all meats and add ons you could think of. the meat isn't anything to rave about, kind of bland. But their guacamole is pretty tasty. You can get everything on your burrito wrapped or in a box. However, with all the options available and on your burrito, the tortilla doesn't stay together. 

I would likely visit again as it's convenient downtown, but it wouldn't be my #1 on the list.
