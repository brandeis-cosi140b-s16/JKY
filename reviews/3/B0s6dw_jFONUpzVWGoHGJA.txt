I am a bit disappointed. This location isn't as decorative as the Don Tortaco at Eastern and Warm Spring.  I also had their version of beef nachos, very small in comparison to what i usually get at Roberto's i just hope the ones at Eastern and Warm Spring is better. Their carrot sides were also very salty.

They were quick and friendly, and a have a good menu at cheaper prices. Also anything open 24 hours is a good thing.
