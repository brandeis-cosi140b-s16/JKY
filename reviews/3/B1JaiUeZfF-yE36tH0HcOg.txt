Dine in order:
Grilled Chicken Burrito w/ guacamole added & a Mexican bottled Coke; total $10.01

Came in to a slow Tuesday evening, only one other table was being occupied. Not only was this place dead but it had no good atmosphere at all. From the young man taking the orders to one of the owners present. One could at least add some low volume music so you avoid hearing the awkward silence. This is not to say they had bad customer service just no soul / passion in the restaurant 

The chicken burrito was good but sadly the overpowering of refried beans made my burrito sloppy & unwrap-able. At the end it was a soggy mess. As for the chicken I was able to take out and actually taste it was juicy and flavorful. Tortilla was a tad bit thin but didn't bother me cause I'm not particular to thick or think flour tortillas.

For what you're purchasing this place gets a 4 out of 5 stars & for the ambiance of the restaurant I give them a 2 star rating. Overall it's a 3 out of 5. My recommendation, take your food to go
