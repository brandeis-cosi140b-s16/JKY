Went here for a late night dinner w/sister and husband. We are always in the mood for mexican food and plus we wanted some cheap eats with our food voucher from the lousy time share tours. 
Sooooo, what else should you order at a place called Quesadillas?! Thats right folks, quesadillas! One steak, one chicken, and one carnitas (pork). I must say they were all very good, hot and fresh. I love the grilled veggies in them and the chips and salsa were fresh. Not sure if the day of the week matters due to the low star count but I would go back there again. Decent prices and decent food.
