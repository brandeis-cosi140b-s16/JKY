I was starving; it was 2pm after a tough hike up Camelback Mountain.  We came here at my friends from NY suggestions. I already had doubts when New Yorkers are suggesting the Mexican food.

The menu here is quite large and it took me some time to decide on the grilled fish burrito with a whole-wheat tortilla. It was a bit pricy for just a burrito.

Before our food was ready, I discovered the chips and salsa bar. Naturally, I had to try every salsa, and with the multi colored chips I tried to get mostly blue chips, they have a neat side effect.

The salsas were fine nothing too special. The same can be said about my burrito, which I quickly devoured. It was not bad, but I am not going to make the long drive to go back just for another burrito.

If you are looking for indistinct inoffensive Mexican food this may be a good place for you.
