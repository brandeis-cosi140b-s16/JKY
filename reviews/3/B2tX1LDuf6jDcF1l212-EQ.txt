My wife and I used to come to Rubio's at least once a week.  It provided healthier options that were reasonably priced and tasted good.  The staff at this location is always amazing and helpful.

I used to love the Mango Habanero Mahi Mahi, Rubio's Street Tacos and the Balsamic & Roasted Veggie Salad.

Unfortunately, we've gotten sick the last two times we came.  The first time a seafood sampler did me in, though not nearly as bad as true food poisoning.  My wife fell victim to a vegetarian dish.  It was so bad for her that we're no longer allowed to come back to this place.

It's a shame, I did really enjoy the food, despite not being a fan of fish tacos.  I'm not sure what's going on with the quality of their food sometimes but if they ever get that back on track, I hope to be able to convince the missus to give it one more shot.
