This is a great place to go when going to Las Vegas to get good food without spending too much money. I try and make two stops here when I vacation. The people here are generally friendly and the food is relatively fresh. I did have a couple incidences though. I had my sandwich order switched from french fries to salad, and in two cases the salad wasn't very fresh at all. Also, the price of their subs went up a dollar making it $7 instead of $6. For that reason, I brought it down from a 4 rating, down to a 3. If my experiences improve from here, I'll raise it up to 4 again.
