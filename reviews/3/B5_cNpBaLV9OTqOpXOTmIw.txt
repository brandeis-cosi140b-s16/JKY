I been a customer of this place for about 10 years every year in September we go to Las Vegas and our first stop after getting our rental car is always been this place, well let me told you that this year I was very dissatisfied with the service we got, the food was very bland my wife order fish ceviche and after we all got our food the server tells my wife " oh I'm sorry the ceviche is not ready yet they making it as we speak" so she didn't get her food until we were almost finish, I'll give it another try on our next year trip I hope they improve and the owner needs to be friendly he never smiles, let me tell you owner don't take your customers for granted and you need to bring the mariachi bands on the week days again
