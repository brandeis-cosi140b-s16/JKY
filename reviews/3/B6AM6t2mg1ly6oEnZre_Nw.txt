Saw this place on Diners, Drive-ins, and dives so I had to come by this time when in Vegas.  This place is not your typical mexican food taste/flavor. They serve a bunch of  street sized tacos- which are small but I think thats a good thing because they've got so many fun flavored tacos to choose from. I had the classic pollo which was my favorite and I also had the Shanghai and the carne asada.  They were all pretty good. I got a side of pino beans but did not care for them- they needed more salt  or something. There is a good beer selection and the deco is really cool. For me, it was fun to experience but I probably wouldn't come back over and over again- maybe once more to try a few more of the other crazy tacos. I'm from San Diego so I tend to crave more of the authentic mexican flavors and a CA burrito.  Definately a fun place to try.
