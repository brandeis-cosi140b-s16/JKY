It started out as an excellent place to go then they changed the menu, then they changed the menu again! The food changed names and the pricing increased but essentially it remained the same. They are now at the point where they are charging a little much for the food they are serving. I still go here because of convenience and lightning fast service. I noticed a new manager walking over the servers shoulders seemed to make the staff feeling like they were on pins and needles.
Kids eat free on Sundays so keep that in mind!
