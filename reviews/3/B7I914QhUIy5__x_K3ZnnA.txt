One step above Taco Bell and Del Taco, but not a sit down style restaurant. When looking for cheap, greasy eats at 2am in the morning, this joint hits the spots. I am not sure what the difference is between Laurita's and Roberto's, because it all taste the same and I do not mean that in a bad way. 

The rolled tacos smothered in guacamole never fails to satisfy and for five dollars, it is affordable. Add another dollar to make it a combo with a drink. The salsas do not have a distinct flavor, but the pickled vegetables are delicious.
