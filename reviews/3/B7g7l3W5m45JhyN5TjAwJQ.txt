Maybe my expectations were too high because of the hype and press but I wasn't all that impressed. The menu is very limited, all items are a la carte, the portions are tiny and they charge for salsa. 

The signs boast the best carne asada in the valley, and while decent it was nothing spectacular. I really liked that they had iced coffee with horchata, it is one of my faves. 

It is a cute spot in a great downtown location. Hopefully the menu will expand over time.
