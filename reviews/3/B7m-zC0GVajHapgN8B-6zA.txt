Macayo's is a not-very-authentic Mexican restaurant that is great for my family who likes not-very-authentic Mexican food.  I like going here when I visit Phoenix because they have a beef taco with shredded beef instead of ground beef which is found too frequently at other restaurants.  Also one time they accidentally deep fried my whole bean burro which turned out awesome and now I order it that way every time.

I was surprised how bad their house margarita was...I always see people returning with their Macayo's margarita mugs to party the night away.  I had a stomache after finishing that off.

Many years ago we'd visit for Sunday brunch which had a breakfast buffet with a huge selection of breakfast Mexican food.
