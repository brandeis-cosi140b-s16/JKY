My family and I finally got around to eating here after driving by it for the past several years. I am hesitant to eat Mexican food at large chain restaurants because they tend to try to make it more "upscale" than it's intended to be. I am not a fan of all the sauces and frills other places use to justify overpricing a dish. My rule is keep it simple. 

First I have to say, I liked the atmosphere. The decor was fun and the place was clean. We were seated promptly and our waitress was exceptionally nice. In fact, everyone was really nice. I was pleasantly surprised when we got several bowls of chips, salsa and bean dip. The kids enjoyed it and were able to eat the salsa. It was tasty.  No fighting over one bowl like at other restaurants.

The menu was large and had some nice choices for kids. My husband had a carnitas burrito and I ordered a combination plate with a taco, enchilda, and tostada.  This is where it goes south. The food was mediocre at best. I couldn't eat the enchilada, the sauce was horrible! The taco and tostada were just ok. The hubs wasn't too thrilled with his burrito either.  

There is an upside though...dessert. We almost never order desserts, but they had fried ice cream and sopaipillas! I haven't had fried ice cream since I was a little girl and it didn't disappoint. The sopaipillas were unremarkable, not the fluffy pillow type I'm used to. With enough honey they were good enough.

All in all it was a pleasant experience. We may go back to try something else on the menu, and we will definitely go back for some ice cream!
