Decent food! Prices are cheap and quality is decent. I would give 4 stars if they put more meat in the dishes.

Hubby got the green chili beef enchilada and I got the green chili beef tostada. His dish was spicier than mine, and my tostada was very mild in spice. And I don't have a high tolerance for spice. My dish only comes with 1 tostada, but it is surprisingly filling for me (I'm petite) probably because of the refried beans.
