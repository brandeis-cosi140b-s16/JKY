We don't have good Mexican in Wisconsin.
Yeh, it's dirty.
No , they don't speak English.
But the Horchata was awesome, and the food was so so.
For me this is more about the experience than the food.
It was over 100 degrees the night I went and there were 20 sweaty laborers sitting around watching soccer. 
2 people got full for $12 - I guess I would go back.
