As a San Antonio native, I have to tell everyone: there's nothing like Tex-Mex. Sorry Vegas, you have a lot of good taquerias and all, but the nuances that make it just right aren't here. Luckily, La Gloria just opened so I can get my hometown taco and margarita fix every so often, without shelling out for  a plane ticket. 

Menu is small: about seven varieties of tacos (three to an order), two ceviches, and some small items like quesadillas, and the rest of the menu is aguas frescas and margaritas. Opted for the Alambre tacos- beef with grilled peppers and onions. So tasty, so fresh, good quality.

 But lord, I wish they hadn't opened on the Strip because prices are literally double what they should be. At $10 for three MINI tacos, it's about a buck a bite. At least give me normal sized tacos, guys! The palm-sized minis are a mean trick, even moreso when they're tearing slightly before I even get them to my mouth.
