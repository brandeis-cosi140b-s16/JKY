This place can get seriously loud but I still love the food. Baja sauce is soooo good. Mini chimi's and tamales are to die for. The drinks are excellent and the Sunset is highly recommended. The meals are a good size and healthy servings. My only complaints are the noise level can get out of hand here and  the staff can sometimes go missing, especially in the bar area.
