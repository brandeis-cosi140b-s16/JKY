My boyfriend and I ate there the other day and we thought it was  good.  We were impressed.  I like to find excellent hole-in-the-wall Mexican eateries and though I wouldn't say it was excellent, I would defiantly eat there again.

I have 2 complaints though.  They put that delicious food on Styrofoam plates and it actually melted and stuck to my food.  And bring your own fork because they use the tiniest little el'cheapo plastic forks in the world.

Also, they have a nice big screen TV for the customers, but tuned to Spanish speaking stations.
