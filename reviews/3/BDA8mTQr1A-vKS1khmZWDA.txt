Saw nasty reviews, but had to eat before a long flight and figured I would find out for myself. I think 2.5 stars would be ideal, because there isn't anything special here besides the fact that it has no competition other than Starbucks.

Sat down, was greeted cooly by the bartender (David) and I asked for a menu. Had him recommend a beer and a meal. He chose carnitas tacos and named some beers. Asked if I could get veggies or fruit instead of beans and rice, so he said he could get me chips and salsa.

Food was hot and seemed all in order, just nothing really delicious or unique. Bland and generic, so that's the 2.5 stars out of 5. The staff seem a little more concerned with hanging out than working, and you can't get breakfast for lunch (why?) after 10:30am I believe.

I suppose if you have prime real estate, you don't have to shine too brightly. I Would try to eat before security next time, but had no real issues with this place other than disappointment that a passionate company isn't setting up shop here in Terminal 3 :/
