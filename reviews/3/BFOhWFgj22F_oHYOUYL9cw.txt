We came here the other night for dinner. Our server was really good and they always have a helper, a bus boy so to speak. But, he also brings you chips and salsa,water, takes away the dishes, etc. They seem to really work as a team.
Our service was really good, we enjoyed our server Liliana,she was great.

This time however, our food was not as good as it usally is.
I can't quite place it . The salsa seemed a little different. Far too much Cilantro.
The bean dip was good and our meals were good. But, we both felt very bloated all night, Even full to the next day. That does not usally happen. 
It is a nice place and we like it but, food quality has changed, gone down a bit.
 Ever so slowly.
Lots of parking in the lot, nice atmosphere, warm inside.
Plus the coffee was fresh and really good. My girlfriend loves coffee with Mexican food and it really is the way to go. because, the one bad thing here is the water tatses like it is straight from the tap.
