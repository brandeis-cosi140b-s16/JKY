CLOSED. 

Too bad, I usually like Chevy's but this one seemed a step below those found upstate (of which only one remains, unfortunately). I don't usually lament the loss of a semi-national chain franchise, but Chevy's is getting harder and harder to find around here and IMO they're one of the few chain restaurants worth seeking out.
