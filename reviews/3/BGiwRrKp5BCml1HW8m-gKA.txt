This place seems to be one of those late night neighborhood places that everyone goes to as the place had a line of cars around the building . This being my first time here I decided to try out their claim to fame which seemed to be the tacos. Let me go on record as saying it is really hard to find a place that does this simple dish justice. Some offer cheap and over cooked pieces of meat as the filling while others offer corn tortillas so soggy they just fall apart in your hands. 

Not my idea of good eats!! Anyways after ordering a chicken and carne asada taco I headed home to try the food out. The chicken had a slightly charred flavor which was nice once I squeezed a little lime over it. The salsa they offer seemed to have no flavor at all. I would recommend keeping a bottle of your most liked brand near by. The carne asada taco was mostly disappointing as it suffered from lack of seasoning on the meat and a very soggy tortilla. 

Overall I would say my experience was split 40% good with the remaining 60% going towards a needs improvement. The lack of seasoning from dish to dish shows they are not consistent with the product they put out. Soggy tortillas and flavorless salsa means they need to focus more on the details as this is usually the thing that separates the good from the bad. While this is not the worst place in the world I will not be going back for a while.
