This trip was so so.  The service was great.  But the green salsa was watery and not as blistering hot as usual.  The carne adovads burro was VERY small.  Had as much filling as a couple enchiladas.  A burrito should be thick and round.  This was small and flat like a large enchilada.  Barely and red or green sauce on top.  Had i done this ala cart and paid 2.25 for enchilada style i would have complained. i still should have.  For the price this meal was a poor value (and they charged a buck for another serving of the red sauce).   Much better food experience at the Camelback location
