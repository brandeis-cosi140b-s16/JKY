3 stars is being nice. I really hoped everyone else was wrong and that my once fabulous La Paz did not go down-hill...but sadly they were not. 

We requested a seat in the bar area as this was a big football weekend and my boyfriend wanted to see the game. The bar area was full and so we were told to watch for a table and just sit down when once became available. Five or ten minutes later this happened, so we sat at the dirty table for about 10 minutes waiting for acknowledgement. 

Our server apologized and explained that we should have never been seated at a dirty table. We weren't "seated" at all, so this lead me to believe the hostess was just being a bit lazy by telling us to watch for people to leave and seat ourselves. I will say our service for the rest of the dinner was great. 

The salsas were very good in my opinion. I always like having a choice between red and green. We requested a small side of Guacamole as my boyfriend wasn't eating much so we didn't really need the entire $9 table-side version. Our server happily obliged and we were pleasantly surprised by the size of the side- it was more than big enough for two people and only 1/3 the price! The Guac itself needed a bit of lime but it was creamy and pretty good. 

Now here is where the food takes a big down-turn. When I use to go to the old La Paz I would order the same dish every time, the Mexican flag Enchilada trio. Well they went and changed it on me! Everything tasted the same, instead of one spinach, one red, and one cheese. The chicken was barely distinguishable! The dish itself did not appear to even be three different colors thus forming the Mexican flag..instead it was all mashed together. Despite costing roughly the same as the old, the serving size was noticeably MUCH smaller, and the quality/taste just wasn't nearly as good. I wouldn't go back and get that dish. 


Honestly, I think I would rather go to Azteca or Cantina 1511...
