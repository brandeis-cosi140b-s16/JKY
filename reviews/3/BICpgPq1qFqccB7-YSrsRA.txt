the portions were large, they arent overpriced and the server was friendly. light flaky crispy chips upon seating and 2 dips...the salsa n bean/cheese. thats the good part.
the not so good part...i ordered the "build your own combo" chkn enchilada n shredded beef burritto with a side of refried beans n rice. sad to say it all tasted like it came from a can wrapped in store bought tortillas.
i was hoping for authentic. it was more of a commercial tasting restaurant. family friendly and clean....so it wasnt horrible...just wasnt my flavor.
