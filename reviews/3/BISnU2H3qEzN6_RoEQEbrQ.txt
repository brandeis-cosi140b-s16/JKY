Waitress was fabulous. Very friendly and did a good job at her JOB. Which is always a surprise. The food was OK. I dont like shredded chicken. I had a chicken enchilada which was good. The chicken taco I did not like. They deep fry the taco shell and add a TON of shredded iceberg lettuce and cheap shredded cheese. But my 9 year old son liked it. Salsa was very mild...more like tomato sauce. My husband had carnitas and he liked it.   Margarita's/cocktails have WAY too much juice/sugar. Price are about $2 too high for what you get. Very loud inside especially for how small it is. We might go back but def wouldn't take out of town gusts there.
