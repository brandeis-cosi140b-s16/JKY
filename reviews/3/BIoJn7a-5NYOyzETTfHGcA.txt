I am writing purely on the ambience of the restaurant and the quality of the food itself. The ambience was very authentic and colorful. Plenty of hanging and wall decorations are throughout the restaurant although quite small. The food quality is average and the service is friendly. Not bad though. If I had a choice I would prefer to eat at either Fausto's or El Torito (Food quality is good but service is very slow). But nonetheless those 2 businesses are not nearby if your out on a lunch break.

What I would also like to touch on are the prices. The prices are pretty high for what you get which is ok food quality. I would have given the prices itself 2 stars but everything else about the restaurant is ok.
