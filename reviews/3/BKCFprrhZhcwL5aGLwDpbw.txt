I was initially ECSTATIC when I stepped foot into this place while waiting on a friend to arrive at the airport (CLT) and head to our gate for our flight out to Miami.
What catch my attention was the large Fiji bottle water on each table (Fiji is one of my top 3 FAV waters), besides the waters the menu had Salmon quesadilla listed and me being a pescatarian I was so excited. Typically, restaurants of this genre only have chicken, beef and port because they are cheap and quick but to see that they had salmon as an option I was in Heaven.
The MAJOR caveat to this place is that it's seat yourself and a server will be with you soon. I sat for about 10 minutes with servers just walking pass and taking care of the tables around me. I approached one server by the name of Katrina to inquire of the process and confirm that someone is assigned my table. I immediately ask if I should move to another table and she stated "No, your server will be right over".
Another 5 minutes has passed and this server name Jonathan looked at me in passing and asked "Has Katrina been with you yet" and I replied "No, she stated that someone would be with me" Jonathan proceeded to apologize and took my order immediately with a look on his face as if he was going to have a word with Katrina which I think he did in the kitchen as she came back out more RUDE and FOUL FACED looking than she already was prior.

Overall: KATRINA SUCKS she is RUDE and the WORST server EVER
The Salmon Quesadillas were awesome (I had them to HOLD the cream cheese), the top shelf Margarita was perfect and my Fiji made it's way to Miami with me via plane ; - )
Last but not least Jonathan ROCKS as he stepped up to the plate and didn't push blame off on someone else he is the reason along with my food and drink that I am giving this place 3 stars.
