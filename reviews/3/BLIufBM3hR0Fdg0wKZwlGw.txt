Not my favorite get in line, order what you like fast Mexican food. However, it almost tastes the same. If you need to use the restroom, enjoy the long and narrow walk there. This has to be the longest walk to a restroom I have experienced in a restaurant. Not complaining, but you may be able to get a semi workout doing lunges there and back.

The other place has a line of workers ready to take your order. For whatever reason, this place seemed understaffed and only 2 people were on the line. The other place I can see the cook flipping the marinated meats on the grills. However, this place did not have the cook visible making the meats. The grills that were visible were vacant. Ultimately, it seemed slow on a Tuesday dinner night. Even more as the restaurant is very open with a huge amount of seating.

The wifey and I ordered a Chicken Ranchera Burrito with guacamole and chips. The chips are made fresh daily, and they were lightly salted, which were somewhat bland. The burrito was tasty that had a nice flavor from the fajitas. Overall, A-ok food.

This may be a somewhat biased opinion based on my affinity to the other place. But my 3 stars are on the overall experience. Will I come back? Only if the wifey wants to.
