I enjoyed this neat little hole in the wall/ restaurant/dance club/kareoke bar. My only complaint was that the dance floor was SUPER SMALL, so It's makes it hard to get your Cumbia on. I like that the restaurant is open late and you can order food while you drink and dance the night away. The music is great, a mix of latin but mainly Cumbia. The crowd is mix of both young, old, and just plain creepy :b. The staff seems friendly and they were quick on the service.
