This location is getting better. Since I was in this area I stopped to pick up a grilled chicken salad and chicken taco meal. The line was much more organized and stocked. I would suggest asking for 2 cups of dressing because they are half the size here as other locations. Also if you don't like the tortilla underneath the salad as is it gets soggy, ask for it on the side.
