When I want Mexican, I don't automatically think of Macayo's.  Do I know they are there? Yes.  Do I immediately think of anything at all on their menu I'd like to eat? No, not at all.  The food just isn't very good and if it is memorable in any way it is because it isn't good.

We ended up here today because a friend wanted to meet up for drinks.  The bar was clean and our server, even though she was new, did well taking care of us.  Everyone at the table had either tap or bottled beer, except me, and had no complaints.

I had a 65th anniversary special margarita.  It was big and refreshing... It also cost $10!  Was it worth ten bucks? No! But it was far better than the $7 margarita made with crappy booze... But I only had one as I find the cost highly prohibitive.

The table shared a plate of deep fried green chili strips off the Chili Harvest menu and they were quite good.  I don't like that they were fried... I think of frying as something one does when they don't have the skills to appropriately showcase the flavor of the item... But they were still good!

The biggest complaint at the table was the fact that there was no tangible happy hour offering... They once had a happy hour food spread, but not today... They had half price appetizers off the regular menu (the seasonal menu was not included)... But no buffet... Why?  

Drinks and a happy hour buffet are why we were there, now there is little reason to return...
