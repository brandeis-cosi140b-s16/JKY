When this place first opened I was very impressed with the quality of their food, but lately I  have felt let down. I have received soggy, overly salty, and small burritos the last several times I've ordered from them. Also, the customer service is awful. I go here later at night, so I can not attest to their early morning service like some of the other reviewers. They do get some starts for their salsa bar, their carne asada fries, rolled tacos, and for being clean. I wont be going back here though. With so many Mexican food places in the area, I'm sure you can find a place with better food and service.
