I've been going to Someburros over 20 years. It's standard "Americanized" Sonoran Mexican food, but it's tasty and quick. Their salsa is ok - not spicy enough for my taste, but it's much better than anything I get in Las Vegas. At least there's a little bit of heat. It's definitely a step up from Taco Bell, but that's about it. Their carne asada street taco's are probably the best thing on the menu.
