I love Vegas!  Even after a loong night of shaking our booties, we found several joints open for late night munchies.  It was 4 a.m. and we stumbled in from partying it up at Body English across the street.  

We waited awhile before our server came over.  Apparently, there was only one server and one bartender.  Service was very slow, but she was super sweet.  We had the Nachos with Carne Asada.  It was just average but the beef was tender and the serving was huge.  Although we were trying to recover, I must admit, we were tempted by the drink specials.  

For all you SoCal people, this place resembled Chronic Cantina.
