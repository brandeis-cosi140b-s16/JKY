This is a solid place for late night food.  It is not much to look at.  The service is questionable.  The food satisfies your late night Mexican cravings.  It is also cheap.

I ordered five rolled tacos with sour cream and cheese.  Rolled tacos are taquitos in my world.  You will need four or five rolled tacos to satisfy your hunger.  I think they come in five counts.  The taste is just OK.  A little hot sauce helps a lot.  You get a lot of cheese and sour cream.

I tried a friend's quesadilla.  It was packed full.  The taste was decent.  Another item where hot sauce goes a long ways.
