I've been eating here since about 1975.  Went there again today to see what it was like in its latest incarnation.

The salsa is about as spicy as it always was.

Ordered carne assada tacos plain and a carne assada chimi.  The carne assada (in the tacos and chimi) has the texture of a meat product but not much flavor.  So the tacos weren't bad but they were bland (even plain tacos should have some sort of flavor).  As for the chimi since it came with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, cheese and guacamole, it tasted like those things.

Overall, a pretty big meh.  That being said, I'll probably go back if for no other reason than old times sake.  

I gave them a 3 (agian, old times sake) but in reality it's closer to a 2.
