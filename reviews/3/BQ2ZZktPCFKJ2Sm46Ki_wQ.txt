Came in for lunch and they do not have a lunch menu so yr left to buy any meal at dinner prices, over $11 dollars. Service is good, food is good but pricey for Mexican, portions are no very big, should include more items for that price. They tried to make it gourmet plates at high prices and that does not work for this location.
The ceviche tostadas are excellent, it's provably the only items that is worth the price, portion wise.
Mexican food is know for filling u up, this isn't French, please increase the portions or lower price.
