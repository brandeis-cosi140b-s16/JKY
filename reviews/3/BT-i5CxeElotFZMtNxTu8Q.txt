There are so many options for day drinking in Old Town. We hadn't been to Loco Patron in about 6 years so we stopped in with a couple friends from out of town. It happened to be happy hour (sweet!) so we went with a couple rounds of margaritas for the guys and skinny margaritas for us ladies at $5 each. The salty-sweet combination hit the spot and they offer unlimited baskets of tortilla chips with salsa. Our server was nice about getting them for us too. Even though we were only doing drinks she didn't give us any attitude, and checked on us frequently. 
Other than that I kind of agree with Lindsey that it's just kind of "ok". Nothing spectacular in the decor. The rowdier crowd was at the bar and the quieter side was at the tables and booths. It didn't reallly seem like a "fun" place to be, but I guess when you're with your friends it's fun anyways. 
Oh, and yes, props for staying power too.
