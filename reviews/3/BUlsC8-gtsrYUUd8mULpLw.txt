Nice change to the fast food alternative.  Had the Logostino Lobster Burrito.  Was light and tasted good.  Better than the other burrito options at fast food locations. 

I have also had a fish taco.  And also like the street tacos. 

A little more pricey than fast food of course, but a nice change.
