Solid 3.5 stars. This place combines Mexican and Salvadoran food. After a long flight to Las Vegas we decided to check out this spot.

The food was amazing. I ordered one chicken taco and a pupusa pollo con queso which is basically a thick corn tortilla filled with cheese and chicken.
This was my time trying Salvadoran food and I was really impressed. One taco may not sound like a lot but the pupusa itself was quite filling. It came with a side of cabbage salad (some kind of coleslaw) which had a kick to it.
My friend ordered the steak nachos and boy were they good. Not only was the steak very tasty but what I loved the most was the homemade tortilla chips. If you love spicy food, one thing to try is their homemade hot sauce.

The prices are reasonable about $2 for pupusas which is pretty cheap for the amount of food served. The service was not that great. It took an average of 20 minutes to get our waters refilled. Another thing, that bothered me was a $2 "miscellaneous" charge added to our check. We didn't notice it until we left the restaurant, so please check your receipt before leaving.

The food at this restaurant is good despite the 2 negatives things that I mentioned. I would probably go back whenever I return to Las Vegas.
