I came in and it was in mid day so it was completely empty.  The server was very nice and attentive.  It was a fantastic quite spot to sit down and hide out, but the food wasn't what I expected.  I honestly didn't really understand the menu and in my experience that either means the food is amazing, or just ok... It's definitely a more gourmet Mexican spot.  They have a huge tequila section I might be back for, but not the food.
