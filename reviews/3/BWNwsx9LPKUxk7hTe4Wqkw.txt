Wonderful fusion of Chinese and Hispanic food. Went with party of 6, We all tried different tacos and loved them. We had quite a few of the specialty cocktails (very good, very expensive). Service was solid, but informal/casual. A great place for lunch, but would likely go elsewhere for dinner. The suggested vegetable fried rice  was underwhelming, but the suggested dumplings were great. A solid 3 stars.
