The food is good, nothing extravagant or mind blowing.  The menudo during the weekends is always on point.  I usually get mine con pan, instead of with tortillas.  Since I've been eating here for so long I always find my self ordering the same items...  all the time.  If it's not a breakfast burrito (ham, egg and beans), then it's menudo.  Sometimes I get crazy and order the chile rellenos plate or camarones rancheros, both rarely disapoint.

The camarones rancheros plate is a shrimp dish that is served with rice and Irma's signature runny beans.  It is served up in spicy red sauce that is "muy delicioso" and garnished with lettuce on the side.  

The chile rellenos plate is what you would expect chile rellenos to be.  No suprises here, just good sized green chiles stuffed with white cheese and coated with egg.  This plate is served with the typical rice and beans and lettuce on the side.
