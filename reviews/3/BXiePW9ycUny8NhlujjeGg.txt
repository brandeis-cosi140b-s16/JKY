I love chipotle and I would literally eat it everyday, but this location always seems to have something going on. Sometimes the cashier computer needs to fixed, too big of a line or even not having forks !! Yeah I ate my bowl with a spoon. Not the best experience let me tell you. Also some of the staff don't seem very professional. I will still continue to go there because its close but trust me you are lucky if you don't encounter any problems.
