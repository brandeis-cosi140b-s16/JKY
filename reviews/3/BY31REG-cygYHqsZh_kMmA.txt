The margaritas were good ( on special for $2.99 ) My family and I showed up around 4:30pm on a Thursday. Shrimp tacos were good as was the shrimp Chimichanga. My daughter enjoyed a mango smoothie and 2 bean & cheese tostadas. There were maybe 6 other people in the restaurant at the time. Their were three waitress's in the restaurant averaging in age from 18 to 20 or so it appeared. I  Had to asked three times for water and had to go tell waitress we wanted our check. The waitress was pleasant but had to ask her what she said several times because she spoke so softly. The decor was very lack luster and the large photo's of food behind the cash register in addition to the sign that said order above register would lead one to think maybe you order at window ( had I not read the reviews of others to learn otherwise ),  Based on my experience would I go there again? probably not. Although had I been there during their peak time I might have thought otherwise.
