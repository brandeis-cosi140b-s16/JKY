A decent enough mexican tex mex place if you absolutely refuse to try to get something worthwhile. It's better than Pedro's but I occasionally miss the free fresh tortillas you'd get there. As the previous reviewer said, thoroughly average.

If you want Mexican but actually want to eat good food instead of filling the empty cavity under your diaphragm, go to Taqueria Gudelajara. You'll save money too.
