Really didn't live up to my expectations - salsa is bland and gross.  The food was also bland and gave me terrible heartburn.  I am an avid Mexican food lover and rarely get heartburn in general.  I had the cheese enchiladas, my husband and friends liked their food but they also said it was somewhat bland.  My friend who ordered plate #2 had to ask for jalape√±os on the side to add some spice.  I don't think I'll be going here again, which is a shame since I live less than a mile away.
