The previous reviews didn't lie, wasn't really wowed :( if it weren't for the $5 for $10 yelp deal I probably would have been a little pissed. I would rather pay the extra $5 to go to chipotle instead IMO. I liked the concept/idea of the Asian/island flare but the flavor execution wasn't there.  It was filling and decently portion but not every exciting or satisfying to the taste buds.
