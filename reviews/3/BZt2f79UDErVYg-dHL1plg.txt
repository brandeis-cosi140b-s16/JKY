BAM MOFO!!! I'm drunk! 2000 instant calories and 60 grams of  fat wrapped up in a piping hot tortilla sounds perfect! Oh but make sure you drench that sweet "new breakfast burrito" in as much hot sauce as you can. Make a little pocket in the filling and pool up some spicy goodness!

In all honesty, since high school I only feel that way after a bottle of whiskey or two. That's a good thing, because if I had continued my eating habits from when I was seventeen I would be freaking dead. hard. Plus, there are a few more places that I'm willing to go to and stretch the wallet a little more for some decent food, not to mention better atmosphere. I see screaming bro's and ho's often enough, but trying to eat at the mecca of the bro world is like trying to eat while VH1's Tool Academy is turned on high volume. 

I'm not saying I don't appreciate you, Amado's, but I'm just ready to start seeing other people. You don't even have a drive-thru. Jerk.
