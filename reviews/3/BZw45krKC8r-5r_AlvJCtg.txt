It was my first time here, so I had to figure out ordering.  It's kind of like Chipotle style ordering, but with not so many options.  One mistake I made was that I didn't tell them not to put cheese on my tacos (I'm lactose intolerant).  I didn't realize they were melting cheese onto my tacos until it was too late, so I ended up just kinda trying to eat around the cheese....

As for the food, it was okay.  I really liked the fresh tortilla -- that was the best part of the meal!  The meat I ordered (chile roast beef) was alright, but a little greasy and overall the strongest flavor I got from the meat was salty.  In fact my whole meal was pretty salty.

My taco meal also came with beans and rice, which I wasn't that fond of.  The rice was just regular white rice mixed with cilantro, not the smaller grains you usually see with Mexican rice.  And the beans were not flavorful, other than being a little salty.

Would I come here again?  maybe, but probably only if someone else wanted to eat here.
