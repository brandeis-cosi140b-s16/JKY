Went through the drive thru for a quick bite after a long day of travel. It was about 8:45pm and there didn't appear to be any other customers there. Don't think I had eaten at this location before tonight. I usually go to the one on McDowell. I got the cheesy potato burrito and ordered a few items from the dollar menu that my boyfriend wanted to try. Only took about a minute to get the food and I was on my way. When I got home, the burrito was still warm and tasted good. Lots of beef in there. It didn't look very big, but it was filling. My b/f said the mini shredded chicken quesadilla was good. Taco Bell isn't the greatest quality pseudo-Mexican food around, but where else can 2 people get dinner for 6 bucks?
