Its ok.  I had the red chili plate. One of those deals where the cook should taste their food before it goes out for the day because the red chili was awful.  The meat was fatty and of low quality.  

 The seasonings were bland and no red chili flavor stood out.  The beans were ok and the rice was kind of bland also.  The shredded beef taco's however were pretty good and so were the tortillas.  

They do not have very hot salsa and they don't carry hot sauce so if you want hot Mexican this isn't it.  The service was ok and the location is pretty good. The prices were good. Food was nothing special.
