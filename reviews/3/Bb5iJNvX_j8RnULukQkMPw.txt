I was very disappointed in Chevy's. I ordered the fajitas, which were pretty good. I got all beef. The chips and salsa were very good. I like a lot of cilantro and it was perfect. The problem with this place is the service. It took about 15 minutes after we got to our table for our server to come take our drink order. We had waited so long that we were ready to order, but he quickly said what can I get you to drink and ran away. Another 15 minutes and we got the drinks. You really can't mess up a beer order, but it happened. I ordered Coors Light, and I got Miller LIte. No No No. When I did finally get the Coors LIght it was hot. Enough said on the beer fiasco. To the food. I really like the Fajitas. They reminded me of Uncle Julio's in Dallas. Our server checked on us once but I think he was on something. He seemed really hyper and it was hard to understand him. He rushed to clear off our table before we were even finished. I would go back if I happen to be shopping in Arrowhead Mall again, but I wouldn't make a special trip. I am giving them three stars because the food was pretty good, and they are the best fajitas I have found in Arizona, but the service just sucks.
