Lunch here was fine.. I would recommend it to someone looking for American Mexican food, nothing close to traditional Mexican cuisine. I liked the pork shank "Wings" the most.. They were in a sweet sauce and  The jalepeno ranch and salad it came with was very good. I would pass on the ceviche next time, it was more of a cocktail. My short rib tacos were very good, I liked each salsa, red and green, and used one for each. I did not like how garlicky the house rice was, wasn't balanced.
