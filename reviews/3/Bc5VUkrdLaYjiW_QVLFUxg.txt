The overall taste of the food was great!  If you love your mouth on fire from spice this is definitely the place for you. If you shy away from spicy food then you might want to reconsider. They have a very limited menu of non-spicy food. Large portions and the service was fast and very friendly. We were getting soda and the fountain ran out of syrup, which they fixed very fast. Great customer service!! They do have thick tortillas and very flimsy pasticware which made it difficult to eat with. Also cheapo napkins so we went through a lot.
