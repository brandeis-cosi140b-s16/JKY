This place looks Fantastic!  This Neighborhood deserves a place this cool??? Really Cool place to watch X Games (Live on TV).  If this is a Sports Bar, this is MY kind of Sports Bar!!!  They were playing "Strutter" by KISS as we were leaving.

Food is three times better than "Cabo Fish Taco"  Service was 100% better than "Cabo"... We had three different Tacos, each was more disappointing than the previous!  Chimichurri Skirt Steak, Ground Beef and Fried Avocado...  

Chimichurri Steak Taco gets 2.22 yelp stars

Ground Beef Taco 2 yelp stars

Fried Avocado 1 yelp star

The Mexican Street Corn was missing flavor, unenjoyable!

Best Part of the Food was the FREE Chips and Salsa!  Best NOT because they were Free, only because they tasted better than the other food! Salsa gets 3 yelp stars

Cool Decor and Salsa are Bringing the yelp stars up to barely 3 for this review!
