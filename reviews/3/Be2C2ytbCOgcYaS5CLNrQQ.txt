I was still in a San Diego state of mind when I came back from my trip so naturally I wanted some Fish Tacos and Guacamole with chips. 

The Guacamole was nice and chunky . I hate the watery stuff especially if it's just green with nothing in it. The serving size was big enough for three people . It also helps that there is free refills on the chips. My husband and I ended up taking the rest home. 

My fish taco packed a soft crunch. It tasted like it was breaded in corn meal. I prefer my fish tacos to have a crunch that is equivalent to eating Captain Crunch or a Cheeto. I want it to be so loud that I can't hear anyone talk. The fish taco was okay it didn't taste too fishy and the platter was filling it came with Spanish rice. The rice wasn't as salty as other places so I had a couple of spoons of that too!
