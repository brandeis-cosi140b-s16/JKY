First observation,  it is always SO loud in this place. Secind, the lines seem to move at a snails pace. Third, the tables outside apparently never get wiped and all are rickety.  The staff that has been in place here for awhile is always nice and helpful.  Most of the staff is great and the food is as expected. They really need to have someone fix those tables outside and clean a little more often. Nobody likes sitting at a dirty table. Just sayin...
