I've had mexican food at several (okay... a lot) of different places in the 4 years that I've lived in Arizona. This place was "A-OK", just as the 3-star rating I gave would imply. 

This location has a drive-through window, but we came to learn, you can't order from the drive through window - it's only there for people to pick up phone orders. So, we went inside. The young employee at the counter couldn't have shown any less enthusiasm about her job. She was mumbling and I had to ask her to repeat a couple of her questions to us. We got our food within 5 minutes and took it home to devour it as we were both pretty darn hungry. 

I got the 2 tacos and rice meal - one chicken taco and one beef taco. The beef was very dry, but the chicken was pretty darn good. The tacos were only topped with lettuce. 

The food was good, but I think pretty "average" for mexican food in Arizona. I'm sure I'll be back (mostly because my boyfriend was saying "nom" in between bites of his burrito and it's so close to our house. haha).
