I like the food (almost always get the veggie options) but could do without the bodacious ta-ta television that is often on. If we eat there with kids, we eat outside. I mean, I get the novella stuff but I'd rather have something else on. Or nothing at all. Music is good. Pong, anyone?

Very nice owners and staff. Again, I loves the veggie options. The potato taco might end my life a tad early but what a way to go!
