Good food for the price. I am a regular here,  because of the daily special. Under 7$ will buy you a big burrito, refried beans, rice, and a drink. It is almost enough food for 2 people. I like the chicken better than the beef.  I also really like their 2 hot sauces, good flavor.  The tacos are good also.  I recommend trying this place for yourself. It is the best 'berto in my experience.
