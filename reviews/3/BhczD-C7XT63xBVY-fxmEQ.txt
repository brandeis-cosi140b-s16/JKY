We were craving for New Mexican food, particularly Dick's Hideaway, but I remembered previewing the menu at Blue Adobe Grill and seeing that they offered similar dishes at a more affordable price. Also, being that it's in Mesa (we're in Chandler) it seemed like a great time to give this restaurant a try. 

The BF ordered the shredded beef enchiladas, christmas style and added a fried egg on top. I had one of the specials where you can pick two or three items for a set price. I chose the carne adovada (what I was craving) and a garden enchilada christmas style. Both dishes came with rice and beans. 

The verdict:

Carne Adovada: Tender and flavorful. Good, but I prefer Dick's. 

Garden Echiladas: Sucked. Filled with shredded carrots & zuchinnis. Menu stated mushrooms, but I didn't really see or taste any. Green sauce was really spicy. Too spicy for me. Red sauce was better, still spicy but not that much better. 

Shredded Beef Enchiladas: Really good. I enjoyed this the most, well the red sauce side. Something I noticed was this red sauce tasted better than the red sauce on my garden enchilada. Suppose to be the same, I think. 

Rice and Beans: Blah. I barely touched this. Rice was okay I guess but beans didn;t really suit my taste.

All in all. 3 stars, A-OK. Pretty much all I have to say. I wouldn't suggest coming here but wouldn't mind going if someone else suggested it.
