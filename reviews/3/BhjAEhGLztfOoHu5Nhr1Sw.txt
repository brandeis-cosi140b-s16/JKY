Ate here while staying at the siena suites, food was ok compared to other taco bells I've ate at in the past. The night before leaving this year I got 2 chalupas with only cheese, lettuce, and sour cream. Needless to say I recieved a salad with a side order of chalupa.. I understand they use this as a filler but when there is enough lettuce to actually make a salad between the two.. you might have used too much. I called and complained and was told to come back for a free meal but I'm from out of town and left before they were open.  

I'd still go here but more than likely wouldn't order a chalupa assuming that's how they make them here, everyone else's food was good except for mine.
