.The chicken is good and for the most part everything else is good but something is wrong with the coleslaw there. At one point, ever time I would eat there, I'd get stomach cramps soon after. Once I thought it was because of the side of beans I ate but then the next time I ate there, I didn't order the beans yet still had the same problem. Then I'd notice that when I ate leftovers, I only had the chicken and didn't have any problems and figured that the only common thread was the coleslaw and that seemed to be the problem. I haven't had their coleslaw ever since and haven't had any problems since.
