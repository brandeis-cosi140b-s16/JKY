Had you asked me two past trips about this place, I would given it a "5" but this past two trips...bleh!  The service was slow, made several mistakes on my order and left off items off my friends plates.  One ordered two chicken tacos and got a chimichanga?!  I had the Mar Y Tierra Combo, which was very good.  I substituted the steak fajitas for chicken, and the waitress was very good about that and got that part right.  I don't like Refried beans, so I ordered the black beans...which I think may have been spoiled a bit : (  She did bring me the refried at first, I had to ask her to fix my plate, but again, one of the reasons I keep coming back is due to the great service when they are "on."  
Now, that's not to say, that I won't try it again...I'm an optimist.  The service, food and atmosphere was well done before...I keep hoping they get back to that!  
I will update the next time I go.  I say give them a chance if you're in the area.  If nothing else, get a drink : )
