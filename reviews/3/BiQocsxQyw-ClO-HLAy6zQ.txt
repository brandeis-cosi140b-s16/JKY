Once upon a time, this was the only Del Taco that was near my house.  I would drive 10+ minutes out of my way to stop here....ahh the college years were always good times.  Now, I only stop here when I'm in the area and need to find a quick bite to satisfy my growling stomach.  It can get pretty crowded during the lunch rush, so I try to avoid it if possible.

Their speed, accuracy, and quality is about par with other Del Taco restaurants.  I enjoy the Big Fat Chicken Tacos and Veggie Works Burritos.

Will I return?  Sure.
