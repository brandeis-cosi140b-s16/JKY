Always seem to have a good meal here! The there is nothing "Amazing" about the food, but the service is always great. The cost isn't that bad considering you are located in the heart of the strip... If your up to it, try any of the margaritas as they make a top notch drink. I do like Cabo Wabo better, but this is pretty good!
