Seated right away even though the hostess walked so fast, we couldn't find her. Our server was Erin. Told her about free app with check in. Got stuffed jalape√±os.

Him- #7 combo 2 tacos and an enchilada. Steak Taco and blackened fish tacos were ok. Not better than their chicken or beef tacos. Pork enchilada is good. Beans and rice are alright.

Me-#7 combo as well. Veggie Taco was Ok. Shrimp taco was ok but tiny shrimp and the ratio to filling was off. Beans was good. Disappointed in my chicken enchilada. Queso fresco was barely there.

Points for having Cholula and salsa verde. Lots of TVs


Glasses were refilled without asking.

Needs improvement: food could have been a little bit warmer and rice could have been a little firmer. Also it was cold to me inside. I wonder if that had any effect on the food temp.

Will come back and try again to see
