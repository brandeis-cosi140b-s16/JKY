Indeed Altata does have some of the best seafood ever! The reason why I am only giving three stars is because of the service.  I cannot emphasize enough that if your a women eating here with out a man and your not ordering things left and right you WILL receive the worst service ever. Every time I've visited we always get ignored biece of someone else. I once waited thirty minutes just to get someone to run my debit card. I've learned to just get up and tell them to do it. 

The food like I said before is what keeps me coming back. Although I no longer eat inside I always order  .  It to go.
