Sometimes, you just want a decent burrito for a good price, without going to a massive chain. Patron Mexican Grill fits the bill.

The decor is a little over-the-top, and the restaurant itself is cavernous.  I've never seen it full, so it should be easy to walk in and get seated.  

The servers are very friendly and attentive.  I ordered a chimichanga off the special fast lunch specials, and indeed, it came out lightning fast.  I also got a basic margarita that was fine.  

This is not that special place to take out of town guests, but the portions are large and the food is tasty enough.
