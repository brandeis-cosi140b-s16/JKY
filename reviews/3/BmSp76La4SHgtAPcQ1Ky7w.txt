Don't have many options for Mexican at this airport, so this is the place to go for margaritas.  Unfortunately, each margarita is $12!  My two tacos were $14.  That's $7.00 for one small, lackluster taco.  Wow.  Actually, the mahi fish wasn't bad, but definitely over priced.

I'll avoid this establishment going forward as the food is just average, but the prices are way above average.
