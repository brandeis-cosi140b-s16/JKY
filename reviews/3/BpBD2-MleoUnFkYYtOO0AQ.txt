Went through the drive thru-
Price was right $2.90 for a Carne Asada Taco.
Beans, cheese, lettuce & meat.
Was asked if I wanted BOTH green and red salsa. Yes please! Green had a nice heat, red one was okay. Asked for hot carrots, didn't get them-think they forgot?
Service through the drive thru seemed slow for the time of day I was there: (1:15 PM). 
Employee servicing the Window was very pleasant.
Open 7 days a week 6 AM.
Fairly big menu, I posted a picture of all they have to offer. Weekly special; Taco Tuesdays!
I'll have to try other things on the menu if & when I go back. 
Tostada was just average tasting. I got home & added my own guacamole & sour cream for added flavor. Taco shell was a little over fried.But the price was good.
