The food had good taste to it and the service was fine. But when the cost is factored in I have to drop it a star because the portion size of their $7.29 burritos did not match up, and no beans or rice come at that price, just a handful of chips. We've certainly had more authentic Mexican food for less money.  

The fish tacos were good, too, but again the coat should have meant three tacos. 

The steak was tender, the chicken in the burritos had good flavor, and the salsa bar is a nice touch.  So it was a decent place, just overpriced.
