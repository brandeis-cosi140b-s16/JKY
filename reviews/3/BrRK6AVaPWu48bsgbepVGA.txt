Oh, Carlos, why are you trying so hard to be hip?  From the shoes to the cheesy collaborations to this restaurant--it just screams middle age crisis.  And I love you.  I truly do.

What I don't really enjoy is overpriced items based solely on name brand recognition as opposed to true quality.  Not that the quality was bad.  I actually enjoyed my duck quite a bit.  And I tried my mom's fajitas and they were nice.  And the appetizers (especially the queso) hit the spot.  (You did, however, fail miserably with the ceviche.)

But when the food is only "good", I don't want to see ridiculous price tags.  I mean, fusion Mexican is still just a version of Mexican and an average of almost $20 per entree is just a bit ridiculous for just mediocre flavor combinations.  

And the decor, while hip and trendy, is a bit garish after a while.  The band playing in the middle of the restaurant is also a bit obnoxious for those of us who came to actually eat a meal as opposed to going to a club atmosphere.

Kudos, however, to the incredibly competent staff who took care of our large group so well.  They really did a phenomenal job for my grandpa's surprise 80th birthday and everything was right on cue.  And though this wasn't a reflection upon the restaurant, I tip my hat to the cute group of girls out celebrating a bachelorette party who took the time to sing "Happy Birthday" to my grandpa--seriously, it made his day!
