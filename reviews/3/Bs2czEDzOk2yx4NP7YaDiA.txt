Been here plenty of times in the past few months have been very good!!! Went today and not only did they raise the prices but the food went down in quality!!!! What happened????? This was by far my favorite Mexican place to go so I will give it a try again! If the quality goes back up I will rewrite my review! Maybe I hit a off day but there was no where near as much meat and the taste of the food seemed like it was day old. All the other times I've been there that was the biggest thing is it all tasted fresh!!!! Bring back the freshness, quality and old prices!!!!
