Ate out on the patio tonight, beautiful night but the service SUCKS out here!! 
Thought for sure wouldn't be forgotten with the other tables but YEP slow to bring things.
Asked for queso dip but didn't get till the meal arrived.
Ordered a build your own combo dish with tostada....was tasty but soggy! What's the point of a tostada if you have to eat it with a knife & fork?! 
Next time will go back to sitting at the bar!
