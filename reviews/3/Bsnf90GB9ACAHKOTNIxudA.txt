The Chicken and Avocado Rice Bowl is a nice addition to the menu. The size is generous and filling for the under 500 calorie option. I still prefer the grilled chicken.... In this category for fast food chicken bowls El Pollo comes in first place but next time I will eat the chicken!

What I loved... We were given a buzzer for when the food was ready. This was genius because I have never liked waiting with the crowd when it is busy. 

Three Stars I am not sure how El Pollo can change this, but the salsa bar is always a little messy. Unless someone had the job of watching it for every spill, with the volume that they do it would be difficult to keep it clean. We also chose the cleanest table we could find. For the price point, that is something that could be done better.
