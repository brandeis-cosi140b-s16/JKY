Good food, good prices, the service is a little slow, though. They have a lot of combos to choose from and their a la carte menu is decent. The location is great, though. Being right next door to the Avondale Sports Complex is very convenient. You can grab a bite to eat while your kids are at practice or a drink to celebrate after the game.
