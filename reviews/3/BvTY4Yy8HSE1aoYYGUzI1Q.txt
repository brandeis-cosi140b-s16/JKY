Happy hour after 11:00 is a nice feature since most restaurants in the area close at 10:30 or 11. That said the atmosphere is as expected: pics and videos of Motley Cr√ºe; mediocre waitstaff; Denny's+ (that's my grading system) tables and chairs.

Even through that I can say that the fish tacos were effin' awesome. Filling and half priced during happy hour. The salsa was great. Also ordered the tempura shrimp: 6 pieces of bland and over-breaded mediocrity with no side for $14. I blame my wife for ordering tempura at a Mexican restaurant run by an aging hair band front man. The guacamole needed some lime or cilantro or even just a pinch of salt. Basically just mashed avocados with diced tomatoes.

So if you are in the mood for a $5 miller lite and fish tacos, absolutely go in. If you're not staying at the LVH, this I by no means worth the trip.
