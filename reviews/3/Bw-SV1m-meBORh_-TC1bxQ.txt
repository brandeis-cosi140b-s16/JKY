I was so looking forward to coming back here after our last time in Arizona.  I'm afraid I would have rather gone to any of the other ***o's in town.  The tacos were ok, not the best shredded beef tacos that the area has to offer.  The star of the menu would be the cheese enchiladas.  Their enchilada sauce is especially complex and tasty.  I wasn't so thrilled about the chicken enchiladas though.  To reiterate what some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the fillings were bland and maybe a little bit overcooked.
