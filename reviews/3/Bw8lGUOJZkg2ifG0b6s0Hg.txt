I was dissapointed! This was my first time trying Chipotle in over 2 years after I had gotten food poisoning from another location, and I just didn't feel it. The restaurant was semi dirty and they load you up on rice and beans but go way to easy on the meat. I don't see myself eating Chipotle at all from now on.
