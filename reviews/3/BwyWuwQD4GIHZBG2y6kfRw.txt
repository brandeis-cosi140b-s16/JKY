I wanted to like this place; I love the other restaurants in this conglomerate. Let's start with the good: the deco is great as well as the atmosphere. The service is excellent. Salsa and chips tasty. Draft beer selection pretty good.
The not so good: Mexican street corn- boiled not grilled. Mexican rice- too soft and bland. All tacos we had - shrimp, standard and chicken also bland. I'm not sure if it's the lack of salt, spice or if it's the flavor of the soft taco. Something wasn't right. We will probably try this place once more but if the food is not more flavorful- that will be the end.
