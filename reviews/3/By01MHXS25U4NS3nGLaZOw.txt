As our "cheap" dinner during our weekend in Vegas, the bill quickly skyrocketed when 8 out of 9 girls ordered the LARGE margaritas.  One each.  Each one equaled one large scorpion bowl.  AND each one cost $30!  Of course everyone got drunk fast, and we even had to request plastic cups to take the leftovers to go.

The food was decent and like your typical Chevy's.  I did enjoy the large salsa bar and the guac was excellent.  I ordered the taco salad and no surprises there.  I did really appreciate that the server steered me away from the carnitas, as "it's not their signature item!'

Come here for the margaritas, but don't forget to share!
