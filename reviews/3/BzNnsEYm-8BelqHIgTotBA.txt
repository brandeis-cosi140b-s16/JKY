Went here for a girls night out , it was a cute fun atmosphere . The starters looked delicious we started out ordering a sampler platter of a variety of stuff this is a Must !!! That was my favorite part  of the meal .the chips and salsa are very tasty as well . For an entree my girlfriend and I split an order of fajitas I personally did not care for them at all but was pretty much full from the app and chips any how . We had a few strawberry Margaritas yum it was cool and refreshing . And then we finished  our meal off with the fried ice cream it was so good . I am excited to come back and try this place again the service was great and the owner came out and asked how everything was she was very sweet I think she was the owner anyhow ?  It's the small things that make your dining experience memorable and keep people
Coming back again and this place defiantly is doing something right :)
