Looking for quick, moderately priced Mexican in Old Town?

El Molino is your answer...

It's nothing fancy but it hits the spot.  I've had chips and salsa, guac, a chicken taco salad, and most recently a bean and cheese burro... I hear the breakfast burritos are pretty delicious as well so I may be back soon for some am fuel or to cure a hangover.

Either way, El Molino is a step up from fast food but it's no frills.  Oh, and the people in the Yelp office are huge fans... they are the ones that turned me on to it.  (Gracias amigos!)
