Okay, I'm giving 3 stars because the food was pretty good and the service was great.  But $18 for enchiladas?? Whoaaa now.  $5 roach coach enchiladas could stand up to theirs.  $9 chips and guacamole?? It was good but not $9 good!  I think this place has a complex... You can put cloth napkins and fancy paper menus on the table but in the end you're still a mainstream Mexican restaurant with TONS of competition... CHEAP competition that's just as good.  I won't go back just because of the price unfortunately...
