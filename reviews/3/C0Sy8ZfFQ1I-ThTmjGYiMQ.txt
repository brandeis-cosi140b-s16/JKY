On your way in, you'll get a little nervous - is this really a happy hour margarita bar masquerading as a Mexican 'rant?

You'll check the menu. Phew. Between the Taco Salad and the Fajitas, even a cheesesteak sammich, you'll see some promising options - Sopa de Pollo, Chile Relleno, some Tamale options, tacos a la carte. K.

For veggies, there's a decently sized sections of basics - burritos a few ways, enchiladas, chimichangas. They were cool with me wanting something else, and seemed chill about substitutions of any kind, really. So I end up with a plate of enchiladas - two spinach/shroom in green, two cheese in red sauce. Flavors were fresh, sharp, tasty. Beans had a zing and weren't super heavy. Rice, very fresh.

Only issue - asked for fresh 'penos and got huge chunks stuffed into wherever they'd fit. So, one bite would be nothing but pepper, next, nada. Learn to mince, daaaahlings!

Margaritas weren't bad. Food would be the bigger draw for moi.
