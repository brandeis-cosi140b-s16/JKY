Not exactly easy to get to if your northbound,,, or even to notice.

We were looking for a cheap alternative to the ubiquitous Roberto 's. I think this is it.  We went Sunday about 11 ish,  we were the only customers there. We ordered the two specials - two chili rellenos meal ( w /rice & beans ) and the two tamale 's meal.  The prices were  $ 4.99 for each, drinks included. OK,  not much on atmosphere  and not breaking new ground on mexican cuisine,  but,  it serves up the standard fare.  The condiment station had the pickled jalapenos /carrots /onion. Two kinds of salsas - red and green - both were flavorful if a bit mild.

The rellenos were tasty,  as were my tamales. Our rice & beans / with huge flour tortilla were flavorful. Nothing to bitch about. Good for a decent - and cheap - meal. The prices on the menu were roughly the same as Roberto 's. I'll  come back a time or two and see if it merits s boost up in stars - but, for a cheap - fast - and good - it was pretty good.
