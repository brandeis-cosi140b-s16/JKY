Sweet Rice not my fav, and not very flavorful, but I will recommend the enchiladas (just get the green sauce if you have a sensitive palette). Also know it's not Authentic so don't go in expecting that. Overall 3 stars because it's an ok option for Mexican in the Biltmore Fashion Park...that so desperately needed one.
