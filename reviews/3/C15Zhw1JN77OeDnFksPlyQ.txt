I was asked what I want for dinner tonight, I say Mexican. Okie Dokie then, where? I say Manuel's since we have never been, Okie Dokie then.

So we arrive and are greeting by three people and taken directly to a booth, which for me is strike number one. I hate booths my body is just not made for them. But there seems to be no tables. I assume the interior is meant to feel like an outside courtyard, it does not in the least feel as such. I am truly over the open duct work look.  But it is clean and not overpowered with music, and thank God no TV's. So we are then greeted by our waitperson, Patches. Yes her real name, I asked. Most wait persons could learn a thing or two from her, very friendly but not over familiar and patient in answering any question and making sure you understand the menu and what comes on the dish. I watched her take the same care with all of her quests, but not letting the attention delay her service.

Now on to the food. I did not like the chips and salsa, to me the chips tasted like cardboard and the salsa had cilantro. I do not like cilantro and if I am aware it will be in the dish; ask that it be left out. I had the tacos with pork. I liked this a lot, the meat was tender and very flavourful the cilantro on this comes in a separate bowl. My mate had the sampler plate; he did not like the food at all. He said it had a hint of flavour and that would be the same flavour for each sample. So he was not impressed. I doubt we will be back as there are other places as close to our home we like better.
