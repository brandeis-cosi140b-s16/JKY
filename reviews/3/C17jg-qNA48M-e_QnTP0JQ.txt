I was a little hesitant about eating here given it's appearance but I would have to say the food and value made up for it.

It is a dive restaurant with vinyl red booths and appears to be quite old but the food is pretty good.
I ordered a fajita plate for lunch once and I've had their lunch buffet twice now.

The lunch buffet is definitely the route to go being it is only 7.95! It's not massive in size but offers Chile Verde (pork stewed in green chile sauce), Chile Colorado (beef in red chile sauce), cheese enchiladas, beef taquitos, ground beef for tacos, beef/chicken fajitas, chimichangas (deep fried burritos), rice & beans, a small salad bar, and all the condiments. 
All the dishes were good except the taquitos were a little harder than usual but had plenty of shredded beef in it.

I also was able to use the entertainment book coupon so a coworker and I got 2 for 1 buffet!
Now, I wouldn't give good reviews solely based on price because the food would have to be palatable so for overall taste and value, this place is great.

Again, the only drawback was the not so nice decor. Otherwise I would recommend this place.
