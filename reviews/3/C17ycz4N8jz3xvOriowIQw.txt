This used to be a Roberto's.  Now it's called Maria's.  Pretty much the same menu though, and might even be the same employees.

I ordered a california burrito and a cheese quesadilla.

Burrito was fine, but was missing guacamole.  I'm not sure if they forgot to put it in, but carne asada without guacamole is just plain wrong.

Quesadilla was okay.  I would have preferred for it be more buttery and for the tortilla to be more flakey though.
