I have been coming to Susie's for 10+ years. Food it good. Excellent beans. Yes, it's unbelievable that refried beans can get screwed up. Rice is okay. Tostadas and folded shreded beef tacos are tasty. Real fried tortillas not processed Taco Bell style. Salsa isnt bad. Chips are hit and miss. Sometimes fresh other times not so much. Enchilladas aren't bad.

Service over the years has consistently sucked! Starts with the hostess (the one that gives/takes the check/payment). Absolutley no personaltiy and sets the tone for the restaurant. She is who you see upon entry and exit. I assume she is related, that's why she's still there. 

Waiters are not much better. You will have to beg to get a refill because they only refill if you ask. Same with the chips and salsa. The salsa comes in a very small bowl no matter how big your party is.

It is dark and dingy but that's part of the appeal. Bathroom leave much to be desired. Unfortunately, I keep going back because the food is good... that is until I find another place.
