One of my peers is a native of Mexico and I asked him what he really felt about this place. His exact words were "It's just like Taco Bell." It's nice to get a native's perspective on our Americanized Mexican food. I gotta say that the food is fairly delicious and filling though but it does cost a bit too much for it.
