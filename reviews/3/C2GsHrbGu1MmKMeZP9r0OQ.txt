Visited for lunch Wednesday.  First time.  The food was good.  Not great, but good (my burrito was better than my wife's entree (some sort of fried dish...I forget what they called it...not traditional at all, but had a southwest flare).

Prices are a bit steep, especially given the quantity.  It was the perfect size for lunch for me...no leftovers.  For that price I expect to take half my food home with me.  And chips and salsa should be complimentary.

I doubt we'd make a point of going there again, but if we are meeting someone or there's a coupon, or something like that, sure.  It wasn't bad.
