My daughter and I go here on a regular basis, and the food is good.  Not fantastic, but good.  We almost always get the rod burro with no chorizo, which is a red and green chili burro with red and green chili over it.  It is very flavorful, but sometimes it comes out so hot you can't eat it.  Can you say microwave, anyone?    They also give you some chips and salsa.  Salsa they give you is pretty spicy, so you can ask for some milder stuff.  Both have a good flavor.  They have a fill it yourself soda fountain.  Since I am a certified diet coke addict, I love this.  You order at a counter, and they bring it out to you.   A little on the expensive side,  but convenient.  You can also call in an order and they have a drive thru pickup window.  I'm sure we'll be back.
