I have been here 3 times now for the Senoran Hot Dog, I would have to say the food is inconsistent. On a 1-10 scale my 1st visit for the Senoran Dog was an 8, the 2nd visit a 9, but the 3rd visit was only a 4. I'm not sure if I will be back after this as the hot dog tasted steamed not grilled, the charo beans were cold, and overall the ingredients just didn't taste fresh. I visited the location at 11am so it wasn't like everything was sitting out all day so I'm not sure what happened. I hoped for a good east valley location to satisfy the Senoran Hot Dog craving of the famous El Guero Canelo. Also some fresh salsa would be nice, not to sure why they provide pre-packaged salsa unless trying to go for the fast food thing. Have your servers fill some to-go cups with fresh made salsa, would probably be a lot cheaper too.
