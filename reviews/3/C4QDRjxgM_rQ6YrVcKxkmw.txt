You know, I would totally love this place if it wasn't at Hard Rock.

It's right next to Rehab shithole douchebags pool. I seriously don't know how these people can listen to the same techno dance music over and over again. 

But, other than that, I loved their food. I ordered a chicken tostada salad which was very fresh and had pretty good amounts of chicken. Their guac is so delish. I couldn't stop eating it. It had a little kick!! 

Service was bleh. Not that great but not that bad either. We needed refills on our drinks and when they dropped off our food for a table of 8 they bolted and didn't ask us if we needed anything. Super annoying.

I probably won't be back only because of jersey shore douches that like to come here.
