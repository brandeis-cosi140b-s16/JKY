Not bad. Not great, not fantastic, but, not bad. The food came out quick, it was hot, and it had flavor to it. This is not authentic Mexican. I don't think it attempts to be. It is touristy Tex-Mex: Sizzling Fajitas and such. They don't skimp on the tequila in the margaritas, and the service is quick and friendly. I'm surprised more people don't come here to start to get their drink on on a Saturday night, as it would be ideal for that sort of thing.
