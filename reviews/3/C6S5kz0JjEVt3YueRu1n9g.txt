Since this had been one of my favorites,  of course we would return. Only this last visit a couple weeks ago was not so great. The chicken fajita did not have much for flavor and the soft flour shells were very heavily soaked/cooked in grease.  I could not eat them. Nothing special with the beans, rice etc. Just very mediocre. We left still hungry as the waitress even forgot our appetizer. I don't want to give up on them yet, as it used to be so good.  Hopefully it was just a bad day and hopefully they get rid of the greasy shells.
