Come on! It's a chain...let's not take it too serious.  We had lunch on Sunday and I thought it was good.  

The decorations are pretty close to looking like the House of Blues, but still had my attention.  There wasn't a wait, but I've seen the place prettty busy for cocktails.

We started with freshly made guacamole and it was good.  It had a little kick and still was chunky and full of flavor.

I ordered the combination taco plate and tried the following:
- chicken taco- grilled chicken with everything, very good!
- carne asada- also totally good and full of flavor and not dry
- carnitas- a little salty, I think I would pass on this one next time

Would I be back? Possibly...it was good, not great- my tacos were fine, my ice tea was great!  Why not? If it's not packed...give it a try.
