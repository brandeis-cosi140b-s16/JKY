I give 3 of the stars to the waiters since they do a fantastic job.
The food is FORSURE overrated compared to the yelp reviews (I'm always weary when a non-minority person comments on how good a minority food restaurant is lol).
I had the Quesa shrimp tacos and they were just really cheesy with no flavor.
Did I tell you that at least the waiters were on point?

You Vegas Yelpers failed me again as usual..

Tip: Go visit South Gate, LBC, Lynnwood, any hood SoCal area for better food than this.
