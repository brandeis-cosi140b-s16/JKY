Came here with my husband the other night for a meal.  It is pretty close to the house.  We typically don't love american mexican food.  To much fat and cheese.  This place was decent- not gourmet by any stretch but you can certainly get your mexican fix here.  What I liked: The salsa.  It was really tasty.  I hope they make it there it had just a great fresh flavor.  The chips were warm and salty to.  What I wasn't a big fan off:  the marg was just meh.  I have had way better.  Only refried  beans?  We like whole and find that most places are now offering a choice.  The flour tortilla didn't taste fresh to me. 

I might or might not come back.  There is such a selection of mexican food around here that is really really good.
