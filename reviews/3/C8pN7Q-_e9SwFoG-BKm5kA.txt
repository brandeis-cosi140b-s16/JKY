Stopped by for lunch. The dinning room did remind me of a school cafeteria but it's the food you came for. The chimi was good but could of used a little more green sauce. It was lots better once you dump a bunch of salsa on it.
Good deal for the money on the lunch menu. Real good deal if you find the 50% off ad in the local paper.
