Came here for a quick frozen margarita, which was okay, not too icy slush. They offer different flavors. Unfortunately I don't remember the names of the flavors but thinking about their bar all I can remember was blue, green , yellow, red, and black margaritas from the dispenser pump. 

I'm not too much of a margarita guy but hey they serve these at different hotels , it just so that those colors of margaritas are tempting for a nice cool inject of alky for the mood. 

Service here was good, the bartender was pleasant, sucked that typically they tell you for extra shots cost an extra few bucks (hook it up?) Overall for a quick margarita to go, this place is recommended if you happen to walk down Planet Hollywood for some re-charging.
