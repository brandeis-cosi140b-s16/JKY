Zabbas is a Mexican inspired quick service restaurant that reminds of Chipotle. I'm going to compare it to Chipotle since it's what I know. Do I think it's better than chipotle? No.

I've had Zabas a handful of times for catered lunches. I stopped in today to try them out my way and first hand.

My first thoughts were that I liked the employees and that it was clean. They basically offer the same things as chipotle: bowls, burritos, tacos. They even have a corn salsa and a bright red hot salsa that are the norm for my chipotle order. They have additional add ons though in the form of potatoes, sweet potatoes, queso sauce, and shrimp. 

I got a bowl, brown rice, chicken, potatoes, fajita veggies, corn salsa, hot red salsa, and lettuce. My first impression was that the salsa was super spicy! Other than that I thought the meal was a miss. The flavors just weren't there for me. 

The food was fresh, the workers were nice, the place was clean and I thought the prices were okay. I feel like I could definitely get a cheaper burrito at chipotle though.

I would return to try their shrimp or their "voted best in Vegas" fish tacos, but I won't be rushing back.

I guess I'm a Chipotle kind of guy.
