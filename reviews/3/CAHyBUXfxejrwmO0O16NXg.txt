I have been going to Panchos for about 7 years and it is about as good as I can expect from a Mexican buffet. I like their chicken enchiladas with the green sauce, the green corn tamales, and the beef taquitos. There are plenty of not so great food there too.... but, again, it's a buffet, so if you get something you don't like, get something else. The place is cheap and the food is fine. Be sure to raise the flag and get some sopapillas... the best part of the meal, with a little honey inside. The place is cheap and, although not authentic, it's decent food.  I will continue going here and people should not be scared to give this place a try because they have never heard of a Mexican buffet.
