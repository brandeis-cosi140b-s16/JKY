Just your average Americanized Mexican restaurant. I quickly began to fill up on the yummy chips and salsa. I ordered a margarita. It was $8 and only had one shot of tequila in it. It tasted like crushed ice with barely any flavor.

The food was good. I ordered the Tres Rellenos which had three different types of chile Rellenos which I gobbled up. 

I would go back, but only for the happy hour specials to make it worth it!
