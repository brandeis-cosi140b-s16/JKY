They were out of the green chili pork, which I went to try, but that's o.k.  The chef wanted to serve the new batch, took a bite, and said it wasn't quite ready.   I respect that he wasn't ready to serve something up to his standards.

No worries... I went with the red chili beef. 

Overall the plate was good and tasty, but didn't leave me longing for more.  The beef was beautiful looking, succulent, well cooked and swimming in sauce.  It simply needed another note...  some more heat?  Some added spices?  A bit of sweet fruit or other twist?  I liked it, but it was overall kinda mellow.  I liked to get kicked in the teeth.  Or at least find a signature.

It was served with beans, rice, tortillas and a salsa. 

The beans were great.  I usually skip the rice.  The salsa was awesome, as were the tortillas.  Which leads me to my other constructive criticism... what goes with what?  I used the tortillas to sop up the beef sauce and dip in the salsa, but I didn't quite get if they all belonged together.  Was I meant to make tacos?  Likewise, they were all soft foods, so a bit of crunch/contrast would have been welcomed.  Chips would have been nice to go with the salsa, for example.  While all the portions were good, I simply didn't feel the harmony nor got much of a contrasting experience. 

But I'm merely nitpicking.  Overall, this is a very cool place, a nice space, and worth visiting.  I'll be back to try the pork, beef tacos and other dishes.
