Haven't done a review in awhile but I wanted to do this place...first off never heard of this tavern this place shares and when i walked in it seems others have not either. It was empty and smokey and a few power drinkers, very deppressing, it looks run down and old..I proceeded to the left into the restaurant which is a separate glass case i call it and surprise! it was not smokey but still very run down. 
        A young man approached and very friendly got our drink ordered and informed me and my date they were out of guacamole which i was hoping to try but he offerd Pico with the chips and salsa which was good. So i placed an order of beef chimichanga, $2.00 xtra for meal beans and rice...it was quick hot and fresh awesome food!
        Near the end of the meal was told they had no POS cash only and was forced to use the bar atm. He gave us a discount  on the bill but wow that was weird.. so in conclusion great food, poor decor, so so sevice maybe next time changes will be made. i feel i will come back but i can only give 3 stars right now.
