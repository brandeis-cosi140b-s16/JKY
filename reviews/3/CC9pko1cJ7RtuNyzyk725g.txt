The plates are all very tasty but my god, the servings are SO SMALL! 

The first time I ordered two soft tacos with rice and beans. It was about $9. I finished my meal in about 3 minutes and was still hungry so I ordered two more tacos, finished them in about 2 minutes, and was still just barely full. So I concluded that I spent about $13 to eat Mexican food at a walk-up restaurant. The sides of rice and beans were about 4 spoonfulls total.

The second time I ordered a more substantial plate but still did not leave feeling full, or feeling like I got my money's worth. The food is good- definitely 4 stars but the price compared to the portion size and tastiness is definitely 2 stars.

I've never seen a walk-up Mexican restaurant cost so much money. I'd expect to pay that at a sit-down place and have leftovers.
