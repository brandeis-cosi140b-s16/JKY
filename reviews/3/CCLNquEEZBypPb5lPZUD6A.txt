tip: if ordering in the drive thru - either there is no speaker system or it's out of order - when the person wearing an apron walks up to the side of the menu and stares into your car that means "Hi, can I take your order" There was a few seconds of awkward silence and wondering WTH this person was looking in the car for before we figured out she was there to take our order :)

Since moving to the west valley from southern CA we've been itchin' to find a replacement for Alberto's or Taco San Pedro. Humberto's reminds me of awesome hole in the wall type Mexican food, but unfortunately still leaves something to be desired.

With that said here's info on what we had:
If you're from So Cal and have had Northgate's shrimp ceviche Humberto's comes awfully close.  Verdict - Ceviche - good.
Cheese quesadilla - cheesy - did the job
Nachos - good

If you've been out late partying it up and need to satisfy the munchies monster Humberto's should do.
