Three star burrito place.  We drove a while to get here, not worth the drive.    My daughter had a sausage breakfast burrito, and it was kinda puny and tasteless.  I had a chili rellano burrito, and it was soggy.  Would I drive all that way back for one of their mediocre burritos?  No way.  If I was close, maybe I would go in.  On a better note, their green salsa is the best I've ever had.
