Don Pedro's is a good spot.  Probably the best Mexican I've had in this little area so far.  Their lunch specials are really affordable, most are $5.95 and they serve salsa and pico de gallo with their chips.  Yum!  The wait staff is friendly and quick and they wear little Spaniard-esque uniforms.  I had a chicken enchilada and chicken taco combo and was satisfied with the selection.  At the end of the meal they brought out some type of cinnamon/raspberry sauce giant chip with whip cream on top.  Nice little meal ending surprise.
