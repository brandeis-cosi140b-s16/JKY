I'm happy to say that after having successive bad experiences at Burrachos in Middleton the establishment has taken a turn for the better.  In addition to my review I sent in a comment via their website and received a apologetic response from the newly-appointed store manager.  He made several immediate changes which were apparent the next time I stopped by.  The staff were all friendly and the burrito was made properly.  I've returned several times since and have always had a decent experience.  I've tried several of the different burrito options and I've found that the carnitas pork is actually quite good, while I found the chicken to be a bit dry.  So I'm happy to say that this place has gotten better, and also that giving feedback can actually make a difference.  Who woulda thought?
