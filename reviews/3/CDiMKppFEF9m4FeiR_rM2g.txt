Our experience on the night was a sort of 3.5 star experience - so with the confused service rounded down to a 3.  The service team seemed a little out of sorts all night long. 

A little too much of a "scene" for my liking, but the food was inventive and well executed. More Asian than Latin in the fusion blend.  Enjoyed the Duck Rice special and both the coconut tuna tartar and the tuna tostado (which we didn't order - but then was comp-ed).
