Tried KoMex a few weeks ago since my friend, who resides in North Las Vegas was raving about it.  I went with the Korean Kogi tacos, which seemed like a popular hit.  

They were alright.  I don't want to say they were extremely tasty and at the same time say anything bad.  I wish I could try some of their other items since they offer a variety of different fusion type foods.  

Place is really busy though.  Try to come at an off time if you can't stand waits.
