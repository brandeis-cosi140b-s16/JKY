Coming from California, it's hard to find a "Carillos" equivalent, but Carolina's does a great job keeping me nostalgic. The homemade tortillas are just wonderful and it's a great place to stop for lunch. Be conscious of your lunch time because it does get crowded between 11 and 12:30. Great price for lunch, though. Love stopping by! The location is a little less to be desired and the parking is not always satisfactory, but worth it in the end.
