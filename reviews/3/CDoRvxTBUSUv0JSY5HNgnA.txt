Was starving because of being stuck at work so I quickly yelped "taco's" and found this place right down the street. I knew it was there but it's always empty and I am not fond of eating at places that are empty.
However, it wasn't bad...it wasn't wonderful either. I had the carne asada tacos and the meat was surprisingly steak like instead of thin like carne usually is. 
The tacos were STUFFED full of meat, a lot of onions and all that.

Overall, it was ok. Perfect for a quick meal like I needed that day.
