$2 Taco Tuesdays. Our party of 9 tried all of the tacos and most of the appetizers, and generally found most food to be acceptable. There were pros and cons to each taco variation, but my feeling is that if we'd paid the full $4 price for each we would have been pretty disappointed. 

Skip the carnitas taco. It's just pulled pork without any flavor. The chicken tinga taco was good but did have some inedible chicken pieces in it. The carne asada flavoring was great, even though the meat was tough (almost expected with carne asada). The winner for several of is was the grilled portobello taco. The mushroom itself had a good flavor, and the combination of portobello, queso fresco, cabbage slaw and the picked vegetables was really nice. 

The guacamole is made in house daily and was good. The chips are too thick and hard for my preference. And what Mexican place charges for chips and salsa?! 

The service was good, even though it was clear they're still working out some kinks. They allowed me to bring in a birthday cake and they provided extra plates and silverware without complaint. 

The ambiance is cool, and overall I found this to be a pleasant addition to the NC Music Factory area.
