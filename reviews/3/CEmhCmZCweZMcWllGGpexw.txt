I shoulda known better when you buy food from a gas station restaurant.  However the menu looked decent with lots of quick service Mexican food offering's and reasonable prices.  My girl kept telling me stories about how the Roberto's Super Nachos are "Bomb" when you have belly full of beer and blurry vision and need a moment to sober up.  I was neither of the two at the time and now I understand why you would need to be in that state of mind to enjoy slop like this.  

The nachos were decent with real chunks of steak (i think) and layered with beans, guac, cheese, sour cream on a bed of homemade tortilla chips.  I was concerned that they came out luke warm when I began consuming them right in the seating area.  I hope I don't pay the price later on with a bubbly tummy.  I guess I will keep you updated.  

I was really surprised at how busy the location was.  They had a continuous flow of customers the entire time I was there so that is a good sign of having fresh food often.  My reservations of eating at a gas station restaurant might be diminishing slightly.
