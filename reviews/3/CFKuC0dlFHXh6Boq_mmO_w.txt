Some Robertos can be good. Some are not. This location is just okay. It's fairly clean and really doesn't have a ton of people coming into this location. Roberto's is always open 24 hours for people who need some seriously heavy drunk food!

Ambiance: 3 - Fast food shop style. Small kitchen with a good amount of chairs.

Service: 4 - The people were okay, they got our order done quickly. They were nice and spoke Spanish! 

Food: 3 - There's a giant menu at Roberto's of fast food Mexican. Not really authentic food if that's what your looking for~!

Meh. The food was just alright. I've had better Roberto's from another location. I felt that the carne asada was a little dry and flavorless here. Mexican isn't really my food of choice, but man, is it filling!!

However, if you do plan to eat here, I suggest the breakfast burrito or the carne asada fries (which are not that bad, even with the meat)!!!
