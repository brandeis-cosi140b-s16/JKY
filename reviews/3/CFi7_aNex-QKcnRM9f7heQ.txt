The food is good and fresh. My beef is the lack of service from manager "Julie". Rude to customers and employees. They forgot my sons drink to go with his kids meal and typically when asking somebody a question,you would expect a response. She simply huffed, finished doing something, went and got the cup, brought it to table without a word. Nice.... I would never treat somebody with the lack of respect as she did. The entire visit left a sour taste in my mouth. That's the only reason for 3 stars. Would have given 4,but lousy customer service dropped this place down one.
