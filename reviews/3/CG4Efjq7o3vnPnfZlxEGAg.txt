Qdoba at Park Central Mall is the only Qdoba located in the state of Arizona. Is there a reason for this? I'm not sure, but if you want a decent burrito in a hurry then check this place out. 

Consistently during the busy lunch rush, there is a line out the door and beyond for Qdoba. Maybe I'm missing something or maybe its patrons are just doing the best with the closest selection of lunch places to choose from. 

You get the standard fillings... beef, chicken, pork and your choice of beans and cheeses. It's fairly run of the mill and I've been to better "fast food" burrito places. More than likely I'd go to the competition first, but if I'm running out of time before work and I'm craving a burrito that isn't obtained by making a run for the border, I might be tempted to go again.
