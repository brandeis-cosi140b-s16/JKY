So decided to check this place out from all the great reviews and I have to be honest I'm not a fan. Being Mexican I'm always looking for new spots to try so let's start with the guacamole. Great but not the best and the chips were super hard. I had a tacos one carnitas another chicken. The chicken was great but the tortilla they serve the taco in is huge! I was thinking they were more like street tacos.. Carnitas was good but they over cooked the pork. I also didn't like that you paid extra for rice and beans as sides! Hello this should already be included. For the price I would of rather went to tacos el gordo...
