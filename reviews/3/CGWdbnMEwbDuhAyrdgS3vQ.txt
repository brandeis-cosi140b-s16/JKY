First time checking this place out so I ordered their namesake with carne asada. The difference between their regular burrito and a super burrito is that the super burrito has everything the regular burrito has (beans, lettuce, tomato and cheese) but has sour cream and avocado. Price difference was about 1.50. To me the price difference was a bit steep because the burrito itself was not all that big. You would think a "Super Burrito" would be a pretty nice sized portion. 

The burrito comes with chips that they made themselves from scratch. You can tell just by the taste alone. The only thing I thought that was lacking was that they don't give you much chips to begin with. Of course if you want more you have to pay extra. 

Since I was dining in, they gave me two squeeze bottles of hot sauce. One was red (spicy) and the other was green (med). Both were I thought very flavorful. 

Their establishment was pretty spacious and clean. The employees are friendly. They asked me several times if I needed anything and that everything was ok. 

Overall I had a nice experience. I just thought that their burritos especially their "Super Burrito" should be a lot bigger in size since it's called that. My burrito satisfied me but I feel I should have had a hard time breathing after eating a "Super Burrito".
