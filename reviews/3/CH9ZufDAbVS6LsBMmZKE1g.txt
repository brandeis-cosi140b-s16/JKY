Last review I left was for what used to.be my favorite el.pollo loco. Last 2 visits were very disappointing. The drive thru window is slacking now. Dont ask me if I want salsa if your not going to give it (last two visits they forgot the salsa!!!) This time no salsa, tortillas, napkins or a reciept. So disappointed. I will continue to visit this place, sucks I have to babysit you and double check my order. Come on guys get your shit back together!!!
