I've never been a huge fan of Chipotle, but you do what you have to do when you're pressed for time, looking for some quick proteins, and don't feel like cooking.  First of all, this parking lot is crazy. There's no sense trying to park close to the restaurant. I suggest parking close to Jamba Juice to avoid the linger drivers and the ones not paying attention. As for the restaurant itself, it's clean and they're busy too. Weekdays during lunch time is usually packed with a line that wraps around. But due to their assembly line process, the line goes fairly quick.

Chipotle is known for their stacked burritos, their meats with no hormones, and tasty brown rice. What got me going to Chipotle recently is simple...side chicken and side steak to go.  According to Chipotle, a scoop is 4 ounces in case you measure your food.  I've come here and ordered as much as 10 scoops of this stuff. Yes, that's 40 ounces of chicken or steak.  The employees are cool about it, even though they usually have to cook a new batch just for me. Overall, can't complain about this Chipotle. Their busy, but quick. They're always accommodating too. 

TIP:  
-Ask for heaping scoop of steak or chicken. They usually hook it up for me. Sure doesn't hurt to ask.
-The chicken or steak isn't totally clean eating. Each 4 oz serving has additional 70 calories and 1 gram of carbs due to the seasoning. I'll usually wash this stuff off the steak and chicken. Yes, I wash the taste away. But I'm also eliminating about 70% of the bad stuff too.
