Café Rio is your average Mormon gathering spot for halfway decent "Mexican" food, but it's nothing new and in my opinion doesn't trump Costa Vida or Chipotle by any means. It's your standard wait in line, black or pinto beans, what kinda meat (sweet pork obviously), yada yada yada. The biggest difference (and my biggest problem) with this specific Café Rio is the time spent in line. During my last visit, I didn't move more than a foot for almost 10 min. The attitude on the serving line was pretty lackadaisical, and it looked like it may have been greenie training day because orders were being mixed up, ingredient containers were empty (hence the long wait until supplies were replenished), and there was just a general lack of hustle or even concern, I guess? Perhaps my impatience was quickened by my hunger but I ended up leaving the line and went to Firehouse Subs across the plaza. I had eaten at that Café Rio before multiple times, but every time I finally get to the cashier to pay after a grueling wait and stiffened knees, I catch myself thinking, "I could have driven across town to Costa Vida, eaten it, mastered the violin and returned here by now".
