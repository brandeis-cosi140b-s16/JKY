I was on the fence with Frank and Fina's as to whether I'd give three or four stars. I went with three mainly because I was disappointed in the main dish.
I came here specifically to try the Cochinita Pibil. It's a slow-roasted pork dish. Supposedly it's wrapped in banana leaves. It didn't taste that much different from regular roasted pork. IT didn't taste like the flavors were slowly cooked in.
Overall, it's a nice restaurant. They have good chips and salsa. And they give you an option to get pinto beans or black beans as refried beans. It didn't seem like a special restaurant, though.
