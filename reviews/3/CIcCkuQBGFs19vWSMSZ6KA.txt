I went here with family, and as Simon Cowell might say:

"It was rather forgettable"

There really was nothing special about my enchiladas... not a damn thing, i can go to my local, or your local, or even my grandmas local taqueria and get the same thing if not better for the price.

The place sure does have a pretty courtyard though!
