Why would a vegetarian go to Sonora Mesquite Grill, you might ask. Well, the menu offers three "vegetarian" items, unlike a lot of places in Phoenix. What the menu forgets to mention is that the beans are NOT vegetarian. They are cooked with pork. 

I was highly suspicious about charro beans being vegetarian so I asked point blank: "Are the beans vegetarian?" The very nice and cheerful lady behind the counter replied, "Yes. The charro beans are beans cooked with some bacon." Last I checked, pork and pork products were still considered meat. Oh well.

However, the rice is vegetarian and you can get the three veggie items (burrito, burrito bowl, and quesadilla) without the non-vegetarian beans. 

The only reason I am giving this place three stars is due to my horchata and their salsas.

For $2, you get a large, flavorful horchata with bits of coconut at the bottom. Yum. 

The salsas: Maybe it was just Thursday's batch, but the salsas were extra spicy, so I tossed them in the fridge at home and told my roommate they were his. I think my he drank the salsas as he ate them so fast. He says they are good and spicy and he has been putting the red salsa on everything. Everything.

Overall, I guess Sonora is a meat place; not meant for my kind. So, I do not think I can adequately evaluate the entire restaurant. However, it is very sketchy and annoying to claim to have vegetarian items when in reality, the items are just without meat.
