Had the fajitas.they were ok.not enough meats (had steak and shrimp).and the sides were very scarce to,just a little tomatos and lil sour cream.my plate was loaded with green peppers and onions though.wife had the crunchy tacos,same thing,very light on the meat but they were loaded with lettuce.drinks were great as expected in vegas.
