Went there during the day after rocking out at Ikea. Best part: really good tacos, and great prices. Worst part, and this is what dropped the score to a three, no air conditioning, lol. It was HOT out, and made the lunch a little uncomfortable. This seems like more of a night spot, and I bet it would be a really chill place.
