Its alright..   Had the red Chile chimichanga and that was great.  The sopapillas for desert and they were terrible. Soggy, no honey, thumbs down on the powdered sugar, I don't know what they were thinking. Its like they just put it together quickly. The place was empty and it was a Saturday afternoon. So there it is.
