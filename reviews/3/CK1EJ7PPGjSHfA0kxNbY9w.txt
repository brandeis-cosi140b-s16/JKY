I say Baja Fresh is the In and Out Burger of the chain taco restaurants except you cant get your burrito double double animal style (which is really too bad).

It is good, fast, and reliable, and much better than Taco Bell, it's just so fresh.  (A joke).

Too bad this locale doesn't have a drive through.  In fact, I don't know if I've ever seen one with a drive though.  Do you think you're not fast food BF... come on, BS.
