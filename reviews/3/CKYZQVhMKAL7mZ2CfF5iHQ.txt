roberto's was my first encounter with mexican taco shops especially with carne asada fries. and for me i stopped getting their fries because the fries get soggy quick and i dont like that it comes with tomatoes. but this last visit, i went with a couple of classmates and they recommend the 3 rolled tacos with guac and shredded cheese on top. they come in a choice of chicken and beef. i ordered 2 beef and 1 chicken. overall, 3 rolled tacos doesn't get my mexican fix. the portions are small like taquitos. and the meat was fit to the roll, so i tasted meat in a total of 2 bites and the rest was the fried roll. as for the guacamole, it tasted unfresh and the consistency was wateryy. as for service, its whats expected from robertos.
