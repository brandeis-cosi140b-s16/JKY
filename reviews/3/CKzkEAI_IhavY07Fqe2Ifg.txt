Burrachos is a fine Mexican establishment to get a burrito. It compares very well with the other well known Mexican establishments like Qdoba, and Chipolte.  It is very similar in pricing, quantity, and most importantly quality. I ventured to this place with my good friends Alex N. and Bri W.  Alex enjoyed a monstrous burrito with the barbocous Beef and Bri enjoyed a heaping plate of nachos with its wonderful Queso. I myself had a chipotle Chicken burrito. After devouring our lunch we all seemed satisfied and content with out lunch decision. 

So points of concern. Their pinto beans looked like Busch's baked beans. They were tasty but there was a little original concern. Also their Queso was a little thin causing Bri's chips to get soggy fast. 

All in all ,for less than 6 buck a piece, it was a good quick meal. I recommend it if you are just wanting to stop, pick up something ,and eat it when you get home.
