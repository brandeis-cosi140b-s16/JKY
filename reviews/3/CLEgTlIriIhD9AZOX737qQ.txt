Honestly, the burritos here are delicious, which is why I almost feel bad giving them only 3 stars. However, the service here is atrocious and in the 2 or so years I've been going here, it hasn't gotten any better.

They recently changed their hours and close three and a half hours earlier than they used to. However, they haven't updated the hours on their website and the other day when I pulled up after closing, the "Open" sign was still lit and the doors unlocked. After standing in the deserted lobby for a few seconds, an employee finally poked his head from around the corner and told me they were closed.

Some of the staff are friendly, but then others have an attitude that makes you think you're doing them a major inconvenience by walking through their doors. I get that it's a fast-casual style restaurant, but customer service is still an important tenet.

Finally, they consistently don't have certain items ready. I've come in during different times (lunch rush, afternoon, evening) on different days, and it seems like they're almost always out of something major like chicken, beans, or rice.

Again, the food here is delicious, but I have an internal struggle every time I crave Pancheros to decide if the food is worth the terrible service.
