Standard Chipotle or Moe's type of place. Better then Chipotle, but not as good as Moe's. I always get the tacos and they're always pretty good. The first time I went in, I got the shredded beef tacos and the meat was cold. I don't mean "not hot" either. I mean literally cold, like chilled. I don't know if this is just how they do the beef, but while it had decent flavor, I'm not in a giant hurry to eat cold tacos again. Besides that, the carnitas are pretty good (and warm) and the steak is quite good (also warm). The have an assortment of salsas, including a corn salsa. Since the others appear to be fairly heavy on the cilantro, I only ever get the hot. I can't speak to how good the others are, but I really dig the hot. It's got a good balance of heat and flavor. I'm a little bummed that they don't offer chopped onion, jalape√±os or black olives, but that's just me. Regardless, the highlight of every meal there, and what keeps me coming back, is their queso dip. It's really awesome stuff! All in all, a pretty nice place to get some good Mexican fast food.
