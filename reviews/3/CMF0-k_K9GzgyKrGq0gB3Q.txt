A half decent representation of the Southern California fish taco experience. This is no Senor Baja or any of the great SoCal fish taco experiences, but it's competent. Honestly, I'm happy to have this since good food in Las Vegas is hard to come by. 

With many other players entering the Baja California style fish taco market (i.e. Del Taco, Green Burrito), Rubio's had to step up their game from just a couple of years ago and they now batter the fish right in the restaurant at the moment you place your order. This means a longer wait time but a much fresher, crisper taco. Their other entrees are good too, even that fake lobster stuff they sell is really good and you'll forget that it's Langostino Lobster which technically isn't Lobster, but who cares? It tastes good and that's what it's all about.

Nearly 4 stars but there's something that really turns me off....

FISH TACOS SHOULD BE MADE ONLY WITH CORN TORTILLAS AND NOTHING ELSE!

I don't know where this came from, but they now serve fish tacos with FLOUR tortillas. FLOUR. How would you like to eat at an Italian restarant and get egg noodles instead of durum Penne? That's what's happening here and it's just flat wrong. 3 stars.
