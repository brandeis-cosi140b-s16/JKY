La Placita Cafe is a very large restaurant. I went in for lunch with a large group, and the atmosphere was alright - the eating area of the restaurant nicely decorated with traditional western settings, but the bathroom seemed old and a bit unsanitary. 

Perhaps it was because we came in a large group, but the waiters not attentive. My water was never refilled, and the food came out a bit cold. Our tortilla chips were never refilled. As for the actual food, it not the best Mexican food that I've had; the tortilla shells of the tacos tasted dry and oily, the beef inside was tasteless, the rice and beans were too salty, and the enchilada... well, cafeteria-like. 

Actually, La Plactia Cafe is great for large groups because the restaurant itself is huge and can hold lots of people. I would recommend calling ahead to place orders before coming in, though, because it might take a long time to prepare the food. 

That being said, I probably won't come back unless an event or occasion is held here. I don't dislike this place; rather, it didn't strike me as anything better than "A-OK".
