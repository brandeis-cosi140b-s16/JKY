Why do you go to Moreno's?  For a sonoran hot dog, that's why.  They have a hot dog on their sign for a reason and if you go there without getting one, well... that is just wack.  

Up until recently I spent a lot of time in that neighborhood and always drove by the previous establishment Soul in the Hole (soul food) and always thought I should try it.  Never did, and it went belly-up.  I wasn't going to make the mistake with Moreno's.  I always wanted to go when the hot dog cart was active.  I grew up in NJ/NY and we sure love our dogs from a cart.

The Sonoran dog is like a Chicago dog in the way they desperately try to cover up and hide the actual dog!  Both are closer to a pig-in-a-blanket than they are a traditional dog.  They also are in the habit of blowing out the bottom of the bun.  In those respects, I cannot consider it the best in the hot dog genre.  However, it is awesomely delicious!  Not exactly sure what is on the thing but I like it.  

Don't judge a hot dog joint on tacos, that's like judging a steakhouse by having fish.  They have a hotdog caballero on their sign people!  Do the smart thing and chomp down on a tasty Sonoran Dog.  

They opened a 2nd location in Tempe which will be my new base for Sonoran dogs.  I have not seen the cart at that one which saddens me but when I'm craving one, I'll make the sacrifice.
