Yelp search produced 3 Don Tortacos within the 5 mile radius, yes they are that popular, and I'll soon know why. This is the closest from my place, a non descript stall in the middle of the compound, and my hunt for a Mexican style street food is on!

Two items I had tried so far: the lengua taco which is average but worth a bite; meat is tender but overly moist that it is actually bland, and therefore requires additional seasoning and salsa. On the other hand, the carnitas plate is the "Don King" and I meant it on high regard - 4 1/2 star just for this dish. Both comes with rice and beans and let me just say they are tastefully spot on hmmm hmmm.

Why three stars? Because of high marks on food, in slight contrast to the service which is one off that I would expect - on my first visit here, they can't offer me a cup of water because they run out of it, yes, my throat stayed parched from the 100 degree outside. Despite that though, I shall return...
