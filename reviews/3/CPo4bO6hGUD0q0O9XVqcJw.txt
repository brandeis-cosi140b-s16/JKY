Chipotle is a good place to cure a hangover (not like I would know....ok fine I do know) or when you're craving Americanized Mexican food. I just have 2 issues with this location (inside the Fashion Show Mall): 
1. Online order apparently never works with this location which I find odd. You could have the email confirmation in their face and they would argue with you that "they didn't receive it". And it doesn't help they have such crappy attitudes. Even the manager will give you attitude. Sure, I can go out of my way and go to another location that's 5 miles away from my job instead of this location which is just around the corner but I shouldn't. I guess not everyone cares about customer service. Instead of trying to blame the customer and saying "no, we didn't get it" say "I apologize for the inconvenience. Please let me know what you ordered and I can make it for you immediately." IDK just a thought? At least that's what I would do...but hey it's not like I've been in the customer service industry since I was old enough to get a job....oh wait....
2. Food is always cold. Even when you eat there. Why is my food cold when I literally just ordered it? Is that also my fault? Maybe you should have a microwave next to the soda machine for those of us who are paying for a hot meal. 

If those two things changed I would probably eat there more often and love it.
