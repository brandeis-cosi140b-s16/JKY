I often go to Rosita's to meet an old old friend.  We do overstay the normal time frame for dinner, but what the heck we are girls and we have a lot to say!  I love the chips and salsa, there is just something about fresh chips and salsa that makes me melt.  We had ordered some kind of cheese dip and that was delish as well.  I ordered the cheesecruip with beans, cheese, black olives, and onions, WOWZA was it good.  I nornally just get cheese and onions and this was sooooo much better.  The normal waitress did not wait on us and the girl that did was a little slow, maybe she was in training.  Not really sure.  Everyone is always friendly.  It is just simple mexican food, always good, nothing fancy!
