I had forgotten about Qdoba, as it rarely comes to mind when thinking about "fast food" mexican.

This location is a pretty decent size & clean. Employees were nice & sociable. 

We ordered 3 seasoned beef tacos, a grilled chicken burrito, along with fresh guacamole & queso. Toppings were fresh & not mushy. Chicken & ground beef was
cooked perfectly & seasoned well. 

Chips were seasoned with lime & warm & crisp! The queso was good & the guacamole even better. 

*edited: Maybe too much TMI, but 4 hours later, the food is sitting in my stomach like a rock. :(
