The food was ok but just that. Salsa was kinda bland as was the rice and beans. Shredded beef tacos were best part of lunch. Not overly impressed especially considering the dining room is pretty sketchy and for whatever reason there was a sheet of plastic covering the table. Probably will find a different spot next time
