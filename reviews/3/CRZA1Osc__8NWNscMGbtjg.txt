First time experience, surprised by a few things. 


We ordered draft beer while waiting to be seated. The beer was REALLY warm. Once we were sat down, we let the waitress know, and she says, "Oh yeah, it's always warm." Come on now.. They were kind enough to replace it with cold beer in a bottle. Nevertheless, chill that brew! 

Second, I don't want to be a food critic here but I will be for a minute. The pulled pork sandwich is way too sweet, I couldn't finish the second half of the sandwich because I thought I was eating sugar. 

Apart from these two points, the atmosphere is pretty cool. Loved the lighting. 

Cheers
