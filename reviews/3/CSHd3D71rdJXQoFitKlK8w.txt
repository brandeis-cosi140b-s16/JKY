I was happily surprised when I saw the Paradise Valley Burger Company's listing on Yelp.  Since our recent return to the Valley, I've been hunting for restaurants that have opened in the year we've been away.  A new(ish) burger place, just a mile from my house? With good reviews? It didn't take me long to find an excuse to have lunch there. 

I was a little confused about the setup - order at the counter? Table? Counter it is.  I ordered the Brulee Burger.  Great choice!  The burger was super tasty, the bun was perfect, and the burnt sugar was an unexpected delight.  The only issue? The fried egg was cooked so little that the entire yolk just poured out and onto my plate. Icky mess!  Next time, I'll be sure to specify the have it fully cooked.  Other burgers at our table received good reviews, with the exception of the fried onion topping.  It was over-fried, to the point of tasting burned (and not in a good bruleed way).  I was disappointed that their french fry seasoning contains gluten, and the portion was pretty small.  This is not a side to share with a friend.  They also seemed like they had been cooked from frozen, and not fresh.  Favorite part of the meal? Milkshakes.  I had some questions about the milkshake ingredients, and was a bit skeptical when they told me their recipe... but dang.  That was a reeeeaaallly good strawberry milkshake.  The marshmallow milkshake was also delish, with lots of frozen bits of marshmallow fluff floating through it.  Mmmm!

There were some great things about PVBC - and some things that they can definitely improve on.  Their creativity with the menu is great. All-in-all, they have seriously potential, and I know that I will go back many times if they continue to improve.
