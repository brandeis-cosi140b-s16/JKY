I finally got a chance to visit Salsa's over the weekend. 

I was starving so I ordered the Fiesta Platter which comes with a chicken and steak quesadilla, chicken flauntas and grilled shrimp on top. 

Yep...all that. I said I was starving! 

The quesadilla was a bit different. Instead of the meat and cheese being cooked inside the tortilla, it  came out topped with the cheese and meat over lettuce. It was pretty good. I wish they wouldn't put it over lettuce though, it made some parts a bit soggy. But that's a minor issue, because overall the dish was very tasty. I was also really pleased with the portion size. The shrimp were cooked perfectly. And they had just the right amount of seasoning. Delish! My only issue was the flauntas they were a bit blah....not enough favor for my liking. But still overall this was a really good dish! I'd definitely order it again. 

But still this is a pretty good spot to get your Mexican fix!
