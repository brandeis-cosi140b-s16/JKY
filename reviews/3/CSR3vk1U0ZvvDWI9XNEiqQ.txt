I have to say that I've given this place three tries.  I finally got served and had a chance to taste the food, and I am writing this review after three attempts.  The first time I came here, I was confused by the many entrances (go ahead and laugh, but I mean it!), and I don't like that when I enter a restaurant for the first time.  Then when I found out that there are no waiters bringing food to you, I promptly left, as I was simply not in the mood that day, as I was entertaining an out-of-town guest.  On my second visit, I arrived 30 minutes before closing and placed an order with my boyfriend.  Neither of us had cash, so we were both very embarassed at the front of the long line.  Instead of using the ATM (which my boyfriend refused to use out of principal), we left and were told they would be closed by the time we were back, so our order was cancelled.  Finally, we made it back this past weekend for food!  I had a fish taco and a corn quesadilla with green chiles.   I would not get the quesadilla again as there was not enough cheese.  The fish taco was good, but not good enough for me to come back here over Filiberto's or El Taco de Chandler.  I find the ambience to be very cool; I like the beach thing going on.  However, I find the service to be disappointing, especially the lack of waiters, the cash-only policy, and the hours of operation.  I like my food available later than 9pm sometimes, so establishments like this simply will not do.  I haven't totally written it off; I may come back on a hot day for a Corona and a fish taco on the sand.  But more than likely, I'll choose one of the competitors instead.
