Tried this place out. Decor is basic. Service really good. Super friendly. Food? Like how the tacos are a bit unique. Oranges in my brisket taco? That caught me off guard. But loved it! Grilled fish taco or fried? We tried them both and vote for fried with an outstanding sauce. Bacon tacos? Yes please! (Did not know about that but will get it next time.) Bean and cheese burrito? My daughter's comfort food, however not a fan of Mucho's beans. She will not be back. But i will! Mucho more tacos in my future!
