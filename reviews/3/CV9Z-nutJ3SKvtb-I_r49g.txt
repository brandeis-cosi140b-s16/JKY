Fair - beans were barely warm. Rice is real flat. The pineapple sauce on the shrimp taco is good, they use salad shrimp this don't devein the shrimp

Service was ok seems like waiter couldn't grasp what I wanted thus a mix-up on what was delivered. 

Straws and food droppings on floor - lunch rush just ending good time to do little fleshing (ok not sure but had customer move so could clean around base of table; should've been done prior to customer sitting)

Again, I've had worse and I've had better!  Always worth a try!
