I'm a sucker for their chips and guacamole....

I do have to agree with Seth A., there's not that many options, but I guess if you find an item on their menu that you do like, it doesn't really matter then.

The place is really clean.  I mean REALLY clean... almost to the point that it reminds me of a laboratory or hospital.  It may be the excessive amount of stainless steel.  Definitely looks modern, but it lacks some warmth and vibrancy which I always associate with Mexican, or Mexican inspired food.
