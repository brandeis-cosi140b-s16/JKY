The customer service was great and The employees are very knowledgeable of the large menu and it's offerings however the product quality was lacking. The meat did not taste fresh by any stretch of the imagination. The only salsa offered with the tacos was burn your mouth off hot!!! Therefore, I was left with no option other than chewing down dry tacos.
