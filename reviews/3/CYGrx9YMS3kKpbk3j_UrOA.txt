I like this place because of the "hole in the wall" atmosphere and it's family owned.  The reason I return over and over is because of the chili rellenos. They make it right on point here and the sauce is seasoned and mild. (** = Must try)

PROS: Chili Rellenos**
             Bottled Coke
             Lengua Torta
             Chicken Consomme**

CONS:  Carne asada meat is on the tough side
              Loud TV
