Cabo Mexican Restaurant is another example of how Red Rock could do better. 

Come on people, this is Mexican food. My Norweigan grandmother makes better Mexican food than this.

The special prices are reasonable and the food is edible, just not anything you'll write home about. I made the mistake of ordering a ribeye in Mexican restaurant once. Probably the worst cut of beef I have had outside of prison (jk), it was so tough and all sinew.

Still you have to applaud a $9 fajita or an AYCE tacos special. 

Like I said, it is edible, just not memorable.
