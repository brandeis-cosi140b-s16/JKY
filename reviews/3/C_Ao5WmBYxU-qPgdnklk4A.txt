I've gotten their carne asada burritos and their carne asada fries. Both were delicious choices.
However, this morning I got their bacon,  egg & potato breakfast burrito.  There was hardly any eggs,  and maybe a tablespoon worth of bacon. And it didn't even look or feel like real bacon.  The rest was all potato.  I wish I had taken a picture. 
I'll just be sticking to the other entrees and save the breakfast burritos for the other place a little further down the street.
