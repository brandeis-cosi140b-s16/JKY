Pedros is a decent chain for Mexican Resturants, however it comes no where near the good authentic stuff you can have down south!

Starting off with the chips and salsa is always so good, but so filling, by the time my food comes, its all I can do to eat more!  The tortillas are also to die for, a little butter and they are heaven!

Chick Enchiladas Suiza are the only way to go! I always have a side of corn cakes as they are delicious!
