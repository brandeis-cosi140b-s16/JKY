Authentic? Yes. (My waiters name was Jesus. Not run by white people pretending to make good Mexican dishes) 

Hole in the wall atmosphere? Check.

Did our food take long to prepare? Nope. 

This is one of those places you feel bad about. We went on a Sunday night around 7PM and it was empty. The staff bought pizza from another shop for dinner.  Apparently they must've been bored eating the same thing every night. 

Food was good. We got chips and salsa and guacamole. Salsa was warm and the chips were salty. The guac was fresh. 

My lady got their barbacoa which was rather tasty. The beans and rice were a nice side. 

I got the half chicken and rice and potatoes. I would've given this place 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that my chicken was cold and they needed to bring it back to the kitchen to reheat it which dried the meat out. Looks like they cook everything in the morning and then just reheat it which kind of ruins the authenticity. 

It is BYOB with a $3 corking charge. Which is cool. And they have soda with real sugar in it which is a nice touch. 

Overall would I come back? Probably not. Mad mex has that market on lock and Chipotle is the way to go for fast food. But it is a nice little local joint.
