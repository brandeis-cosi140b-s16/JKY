Serving sizes are massive so order accordingly. It's the traditional Mexican style of tacos, guac etc. If you prefer American Mexican, you may not like it. I thought it was good. The cashier had zero personality but the owner came out at one point. He was very friendly and engaging. It's a good stop for tasty inexpensive food. Not sure I would crave it but I wouldn't mind eating here if I'm in the area.
