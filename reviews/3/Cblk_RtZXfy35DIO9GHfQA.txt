What I did like: some whiney girl in front of me asking for a side of rice because there was no rice offered in a burrito. The Rito's guy just about went soup nazi on her "no rice for you!" They make their burritos their way. Order your food from a couple options of taco or burrito, and NEXT. This isn't chipotle. My burrito came quickly and very hot(as on heat) nicely. It also left me feeling healthier than expected. I didn't leave feeling like I ate a tub of lard. They open whenever the hell they want. I'm cool with their business culture. It's a nice hole in the wall feel. 

What I didn't like: it's just not my style of burrito. It was a pur√©e blend of bean, cheese, and sauce. Kind of like it was mixed in a vitamix blender with water. When I cut into my burrito it was filled with liquid sauce that goes everywhere. There were a few square chunks of some kind of odd tasting meat. The meat wasn't terrible but wasn't great. The liquidy blend on the inside had a taste element of Taco Bell hot sauce. I don't dislike Taco Bell hot sauce, but would expect more uniqueness in taste. 

Overall the dining experience was worth a visit. I liked the overall vibe.
