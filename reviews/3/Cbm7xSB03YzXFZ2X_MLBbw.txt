I don't know about anyone else, but until looking this place up on Yelp, I thought this place was called "Aye Jose Takos", because that's what the sign says from the road.  So I somewhat refuse to call it "Las Famosas de Jose" because I like the name Aye Jose better.  

I live a stone's throw from Aye Jose and come here on a weekly basis.  I am from the LA area, and if there's one thing I miss the most, it's the abundance of 24-hour street taco restaurants.  This is Las Vegas' version of one of those 24-hour LA street taco places.  While it has much more than street tacos, I think the tacos and burritos are the best things on the menu, and the only things really worth getting.  

If there is one thing at Aye Jose that sticks out as the absolute best, it is definitely the Chorizo Tacos.  They are some of the best I've ever had.  If you don't like grease, then you will not like this dish, but it's not a bad greasy.  The grease doesn't come from them throwing lard into it, because they don't.  The grease comes from the fat that makes up chorizo sausage.  When they saute the chorizo, the red-colored, flavorful oils come out of the chorizo and into the tortilla.  This is what makes the chorizo taco so good.  So you should definitely get one when you're here, considering they are under a buck, i believe around 90 cents.  
I also really enjoy their carne asada, carnitas, and al pastor tacos.  If you're a street taco connoisseur then you will not be impressed with these tacos.  But if you are hungry for street tacos at 2 am then you will love these tacos!   

The drive-thru at Aye Jose is probably one of the worst I've ever seen, and they often take a while to make your order, but this may be because my orders are rather large when I'm bringing tacos back to an apartment full of hungry friends.
