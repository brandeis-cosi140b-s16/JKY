Nice embiance, good service. 
I've been on a MAD search for good mexican food in AZ and haven't come up with too much so this deserves a yelp! 
It's an actual restaurant not a taqaria where you get the tiny to go containers of salsa and hard crispy tacos.... 
Its restaurant bowl of salsa, it's actually small picher of salsa (homemade) so you don't have to keep asking and waiting for more! Chips were fresh and I had the chicken fajita and it all had a very good flavor, they piled veggies on it and I love that cause usually there's like 5 slivers of bell peppers and such....
The rice was good (not the best I ever had) but good, didn't have onion, corn or carrots... I like that fact too! 
Beans had a good taste.

I would compare it to Abuelos or a Chevys.

It seems most of the Mexican joints around town are mostly the taqaria's where you typically get your quickie crusty taco with grease dripping and your chips and salsa that you had to pay extra for... 
That's why I like Ajo Al's ! 

So I say try this place if you haven't. 

OH and I didn't even have the fried icecream (they are famous for it) but they said it comes with a flake crust in a cinnamon bowl with whip cream strawberries and honey on top !!!!!!!! 
Can you imagine how yummy that is ? Sugar coma !
