TLDR: Skip the guacamole, go straight to the caramel flan. And they're totally cool with laptops!

The menu:
Skip the "must-try" guacamole. It looks like grocery store guacamole was scooped with an ice-cream scoop, then sprinkled with feta on top. The salsa was fine, but the chips were sooooo salty I had to wash them down with so much water.

Speaking of salty... the Tortilla Soup was the saltiest thing I've tasted in a long time. And it was so thick I think it was more along the lines of a lentil soup than a tortilla soup.

But... there's a silver lining. The Caramel Flan was a-mazing and I would come back for it again. The fruit was a nice balance to the creamy caramely flan.

Service & wifi:
Service was pretty good. I know they have to deal with a lot of weird schedules given that it's in an airport, so I appreciated that they accommodated me and my laptop so nicely. The host showed me to a table right beside a power outlet, and made me feel welcome to stay and work as long as I needed. It was 1pm on a weekday, and I think most restaurants would not have been as accommodating. That was a nice plus!
