Ok Mexican, but it is Cheaply priced.

I have only been here fore  the lunch rush and they are pretty fast at getting your food out to you.  Depending on who you have as your server will vary on how/if you can get refills.

The lunch menu is cheap, and you get a some good portions. I get the #8 Burrito and quesadilla.  Choice of beef or chicken.    Do not be scare of the burrito it is basically a rolled chicken tortilla, served with sauce on top.  Nothing scary on the inside for the timid.

Nothin great , but nothing bad about the place either.  It just food.
