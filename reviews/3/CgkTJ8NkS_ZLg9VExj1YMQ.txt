I come here once in a while with my in laws, as they love it and get the same burrito each time. If you are a creature of habit and order the same thing every time because you liked it the first time you got it, this place will work with you if you get lucky with what you order. But I like to order something different every time and get disappointed a lot. I ordered a salad the last time I went and it was made with the cheap iceberg lettuce and wasn't very fresh. I have ordered the lettuce wrap taco before and that had been my favorite dish yet. My husband ordered the spinach enchiladas with the spinach cheese sauce and could hardly finish one enchilada because the sauce was too overpowering. My mother in law got the same thing but with the green sauce and loved it. They do have nice bean dip and green salsa with the free appetizer chips though, so I can usually try to fill up on those.
