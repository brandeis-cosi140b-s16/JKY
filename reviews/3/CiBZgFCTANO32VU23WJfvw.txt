Got the carne asada burrito combo and a chile relleno.  The meat was very good, well seasoned and perfectly cooked for the burrito, only one problem,  thats all that was on it.  No pico or anything, not even a sprig if cilantro. There weren't even the customary little salsa cups in the bag. The rice and beans were sad with no flavor or anything that would make them stand out. That being said the relleno was ok(doesn't look like the on line photo), not too greasy like most places.  Just remember you have to ask for anything besides the tortilla and meat. I really hope this place improves as I can see the potential and need for a good mexican place in our little area.
