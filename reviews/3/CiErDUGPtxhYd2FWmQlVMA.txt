I've been here once before & dont remember what I had,  BUT what I did have came wt chips & I added some sauce that got it FIRED UP!! Big time!!...I remember THAT!! = FIYAAAA!!!

Today I had them in my sights long range at 3pm'ish riding the day on only an omelet at 10am. I was hungry and ordered the Chicken Burrito and it did not fail....THIS is authentic Mexican so it wasnt full of rice, beans, cheese, sour cream or guacamole.

The burrito at $5 was big and thick = soft ball size, full of moist chicken. It wasnt spicey & I had to add to it once I got it home. 

I reccomend this place BIG TIME!!
