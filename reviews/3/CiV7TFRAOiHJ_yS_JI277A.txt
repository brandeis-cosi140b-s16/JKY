Serrano's to me is one of those good 'bad' Mexican restaurants. It isn't authentic. Everything is covered in cheese. But it still tastes good. Plus, Serrano's serves free bean dip with their chips and salsa.... that is a hue plus! I've been to several Serrano's locations, and this one was a little weak compared to the others. A friend and I sat in the bar, which was fine. I had the Chambord marg, on special for 6$, and it tasted a little like cough medicine, but wasn't undrinkable. We split a cheese crisp and I got a side of rice and cup of albondigas soup. The albondigas has been WAY better at other locations, it could've been an off night, but it just didn't seem like it had cooked long enough or something (the veggies were still a bit firm). The cheese crisp was delish (of course), and still tasted good the next day. I will return!
