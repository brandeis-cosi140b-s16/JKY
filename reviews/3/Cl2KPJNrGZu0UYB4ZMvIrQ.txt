To say that this was the slowest fast food I have ever encountered would not be an understatement... I stopped off here for a quick bite because we needed to head out of town and usually when we go here; it's fast and delicious with a friendly staff... This visit was neither... lol

I got there on the end of some customer service dispute... Apparently, this means instead of the customary easy going vibe I'm used to, I walked right into the snarkiest place of the day... The patron and employee were still attempting to "kill each other with kindness," but not genuine kindness... The kind that says, keep talking and I'm coming across that counter with a broken taco shell at your carotid... I think the cashier was a little disoriented by what had gone down before I got there because I repeated my order at least three times and she still got it wrong... I ordered a Nachos Bell Grande with no sour cream, a Beefy Nacho griller and the Doritos box... The Doritos box was for the boyfriend and his food was fine... I got a Nachos Supreme and the griller thing... The griller had to have been made quite some time ago because none of the corn chips were still crispy, so I didn't even finish it... And the Nachos Supreme is a smaller version of the food I wanted... I was hungry as hell, but all out of food... And there is something really wrong with their drink machine in the dining room... I got a Pepsi and a fruit punch... That fruit punch tasted like someone drained it through a real life sweaty sweatsock...  I couldn't even drink half of it...

Anyway, I gave them three stars because I couldn't go two and a half... But I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say this was just a one time thing... I don't know what was going on in there the other day, but I hope it's over in case I go back...
