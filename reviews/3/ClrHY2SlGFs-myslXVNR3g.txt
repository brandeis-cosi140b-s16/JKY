Surprises are good. Like eating at a Mexican restaurant inside a giant pyramid and discovering that it doesn't suck at all. 

Me and my wife weren't expecting much from this place.. We thought, if nothing else, it would be a decent place to grab a beer and lounge until our show started. The menu enticed us enough to order a round of appetizers. We got the guacamole, which was delicious, served in a generous portion with fresh made chips and salsas. They asked us how hot we wanted them to make the guac, and for a  change, our request was granted. It was plenty spicy, and while I love hot stuff, next time I'll probably get medium so my wife can enjoy it more (we aren't used to things actually being hot when we ask for it).  

We also got a roasted corn, served street style with a slight gourmet twist. It was slathered with aioli, dusted with cotija cheese and chili seasonings, with just the right amount of char on it. My only gripe with this is the price. It costs $8 and you only get one cob. I didn't expect anything more than one, but the price is quite high for what you receive. Either way, it was treat.

Next up was the nachos... definitely the highlight for me. They aren't the typical nachos you'd expect from a place like this. Think of them like high-end ballpark nachos. You get a massive pile of corn chips, layered with refried black beans, guacamole, jalape√±os, and a delicious chipotle nacho cheese. I recommend ordering the steak to top it off. 

Ambience is pretty chill. If you come at a slow time like we did you should be able to relax without too much noise or distraction. The restaurant is open to the rest of the hotel, no walls, no roof, just a straight view up to the top of the pyramid.

Beer was cold, food was plentiful and tasty... We'll be back next time we're at this casino.
