Chipotle is my latest fast (yet healthy) food stop!  There are no bells and whistles to the Chipotle atmosphere but this location is clean and spacious.  Parking is around back for those of you who are new.  I recently visited during pique dinner hour and I was dismayed at a long line.  I was, however, pleasantly surprised at how quickly the staff kept things moving.  The food has always been good - not amazing but never disappointing.  I'm also a supporter of Chipotle as a company because they put effort into purchasing meats/produce from ethical and sustainable farms.  They are also very vegetarian friendly for those of you who opt out of eating meat.  

I'd give Chipotle 3.5 stars.  I'd definitely head back, but wouldn't go out of my way to get there.
