Went in for lunch this past weekend and paid over $60 for 4 people. I asked for a pale ale and there were two. I asked if she knew which was better and she said she didn't drink. Ok, which one sells better? Which one do you hear the most about? She was a manager, so I feel like she should know something about all the product in her store. Her shirt was also filthy which I thought was a bit unprofessional. 

Food was OK. $9 for a chicken quesadilla and chips is a bit rediculous,  but it was ok. Everyone else at the table ordered a meal with beans. All the beans were cold. Long wait time for the food too.

Overall, I'd rather go elsewhere. For this price you could go to a sit down Mexican restaurant!
