Here with my family. Kids meals were huge and fit for an adult. Wife ordered chicken flautas and they were a little bland. I ordered a shredded beef chimichanga with red sauce... It was good.  They were generous portions on everything. Chips and salsa were ok. The environment was was nice old world Mexico and the service was good! We will be back.
