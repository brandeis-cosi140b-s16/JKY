I went here several times when I lived in Charlotte, and it's legit.

Likes:  Never crowded, even though it's street parking it's convenient, large portions for a reasonable price.  I've gotten the carne asada dinner several times, and it's pretty awesome.  Huge portion, tasty, and I always got at least one more meal out of it by throwing the leftovers into a tortilla at home.  They also give you more than one type of salsa with your chips, I love that for a change.  I'm a fan of the outdoor seating.

Dislikes:  Definitely tastes like "Americanized" Mexican food, though they still do a good job at that.  I went on a Sunday night once and got the margaritas on special, but the marg mix was fluorescent in color and pretty terrible (I cant judge the normal margaritas, since I never wanted to try them again).  

Take it or leave it:  Take it.  I like this place.  It's a little Americanized, but so are most places in Charlotte.
