The tacos, while having good flavor, were seriously lacking on quantity of meat. Ordered 3 and the meat in all of them could have fit easily in 1 small tortilla.  For $2 each you can get much better tacos at Tex Tubb's. Margarita was standard. Would have been 2 stars but the service was really good.
