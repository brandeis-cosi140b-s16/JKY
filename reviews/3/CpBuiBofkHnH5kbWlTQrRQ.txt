We only gave LGLG&C 3 stars because we are still deciding...we will need to visit again. 

On the up side...super clean restaurant, great hot chips quickly arrived with delicious pico and hot sauce, great service by all including Tony who kept our drinks full and was always available when we needed him plus good happy hour prices.

On the down side...the nachos were the only food we ordered as we are nacho lovers. But they left us a little underwhelmed especially at $10. The chicken in green chili sauce was delicious but the dry chips, sporadic cheddar cheese and sparse refried beans made for a bit of a disappointment. We prefer a queso blanco over shredded cheddar as the cheddar cools into blobs.

We have high hopes for LGLG&C and will visit again and re-yelp our experience.
