We visited Isabel's Amor after spending the day traveling just to get to Phoenix.  It's a restaurant within a strip mall so while it's not large, you're also not sitting on top of one another.  They have plenty of heating lamps for the outdoor seating area (but when do you ever really use those in the Southwest?).

Our waitress was very nice and friendly.  Their menu isn't extensive but has something for everyone.  I decided to treat myself to a Mexican Coke and an order of tamales.  My friend also got a Coke and an order of fajitas.  My tamales lacked flavor but the rice and beans were great.  My friendly only received one tortilla with her fajitas even though they provided plenty of peppers and onions.  We skipped dessert due to the huge entree portions but they seemed to have quite the offering.  Overall, a decent Mexican spot if you want something quick.
