We ate here because so many people had told us that it was amazing. My meal (the honey glazed shrimp) was great. The atmosphere is fun with all of the bright colors. The salsa was much too sweet for my liking, our app (the bean/cheese dip) did not have any of the 'kick' it claimed on the menu - and was just downright bland. My husband liked his burro, but it was filled with the same bean mixture that we had had as an app, so he was pretty much done with the bean thing. Overall it was an ok experience, but seeing as it is a Mexican place, and there was no spice in any of our food, even the salsa, I have to say I was disappointed. Especially after all of the rave reviews. To each their own I suppose.
