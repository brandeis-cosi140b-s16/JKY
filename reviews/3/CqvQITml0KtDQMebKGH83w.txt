So I was always wondering what kind of food Qdoba was. Little did I know what that it was similar to other places I have ate at. 
The concept is the same as a Chipotle or Cafe Rio. You tell the first person you see what you want and they prepare what you want on your burrito, taco, salad, etc. The food is good, but it is not worth the price. Chipotle is virtually the same price and the same food. If you want convenience, go to the closer one to you because it is virtually the same.
