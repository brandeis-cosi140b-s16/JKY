I have been here several times for the carne asada fries. Not once have I had any problem until yesterday.  I mean it wasn't such a severe problem that I won't go back because it lasts a lot longer than your crispy delicious carne asada fries.  Now saying this makes the carne asada fries from this location sound disgusting by the fries not being crispy enough. They reminded me of steak fries with how thick they were.  I never have had carne asada fries that I happened to like more after sitting out for over an hour than fresh carne asada fries.  

So if I go to work in the morning I would probably enjoy some carne asada fries from rivas BY lunch time. =]
