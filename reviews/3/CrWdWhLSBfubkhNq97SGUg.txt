3.5 stars! A co-worker took me to this restaurant and I was glad to find Mexican restaurant that was truly a Mexican restaurant - not a Tex-Mex one disguised as Mexican. 

We sat down fairly quickly,as it was a bit early for lunch, and we were given chips and salsa right away. The chips were hot and really good.  We also ordered the cheese dip - which reminded me of the queso from Salsarita's - it was good but I don't know if I'd go out of my way to order it again.  I'm from Southern California, we don't get cheese dip in Mexican restaurants. 

Because I'm trying to be a good Catholic girl, I gave up meat for Lent, so my food choices at the moment are a bit limited.  I ordered the Camarones Mexicanos (shrimp -I'm allowed seafood) with corn tortillas.  It came out quickly and hot.  The shrimp size were decent and was served with avocado on a bed of rice, ranchero sauce, cheese, green bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions. It was a nice, filling lunch.  They do have very good service, the servers are very attentive. 

I'd go back because, so far, it's the most authentic Mexican cuisine I can find in Charlotte. And by all means, if any other Yelpers have any other suggestions - please let me know :).
