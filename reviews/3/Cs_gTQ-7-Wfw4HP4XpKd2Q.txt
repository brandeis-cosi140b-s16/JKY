Grilled chile lime chicken ceasar was tasty and fairly fresh. The portion size was above average.

An order of steak nachos is good enough to split between two people. Preparations of these nachos were different than nachos from other Mexican restaurants.  There are four large chips with toppings and steak strips stacked real tall.  

The drink menu was decent; the standard assortment of drinks found at most Mexican restaurants.

The server was attentive but drinks and food took forever to get.
