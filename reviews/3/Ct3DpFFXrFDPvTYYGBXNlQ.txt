I loved this restaurant, was obsessed, went twice a week. However I went this past week and they got WAY smaller containers that are literally half the size as before and they are still charging the same amount. The lady assured me that they were the same size, absolutely not honey. Very disappointed because I always thought so highly of this place. I understand them down sizing and wanting to change containers but do not charge me full price for half of the food you used to serve. I won't go back.
