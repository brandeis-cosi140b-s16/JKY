I've been here three times now.  Twice for dinner and once for breakfast.  

First, I love their shredded beef tacos.  They are addicting. 

The kids like their cheese quesadillas.  They use a full size tortilla and aren't stingy with the cheese.  

Their carne asada was so-so.  

The cheese enchilada was pretty bad. This was due to the weird sauce.  It certainly didn't taste like any enchilada sauce I've ever had.

I had the bacon breakfast burrito once.  When I pulled up and saw the price, roughly $4.75 after tax, I thought  "oh boy, this is gonna be one of those places that throws a 5 lb. bomb at you".  Unfortunately, no.  For nearly $5 I got a small, hopeless burrito.  

This is my biggest problem with Federico's....they are over priced.  I can get a larger burrito at similar restaurants for at least a dollar less.  It's not just the breakfast burrito, but everything on the menu.  I'm all for smaller portions, but at least make your prices match.  

Will I be back?  Oh yes!  As I said, the tacos are addicting.  But I'll probably just stick with that.
