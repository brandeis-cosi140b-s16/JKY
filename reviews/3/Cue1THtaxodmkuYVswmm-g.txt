pretty good crispy shredded beef tacos, the beans and rice were average nothing to scream about. the unlimited free chips and salsa was a plus. drink selection is okay did not see any alcohol on site. place looks a little run down i think it used to be a burger place. overall i wouldnt go out of my way to go there but if i was nearby and craving some tacos I would hit it up.
