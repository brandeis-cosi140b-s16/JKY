Rosemary potatoes, FTW. I would go back just for a plate of those delicious potatoes. 
....that's a lie. I'd probably have a drink too. 

Stopped in after grabbing some produce at OTFM on a Saturday morning. Lively crowd at 10:30 am. Comfortable bar, friendly service.

I had the chorizo and we didn't like each other...so much that I missed a dinner date that night. :( 

53.00 for a basic breakfast for two, 3 mimosas & one bloody mary.  
Not cheap but not over the top either.
