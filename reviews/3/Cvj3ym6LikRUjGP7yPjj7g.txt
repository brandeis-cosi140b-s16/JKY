I usually enjoy eating here. Never had any problems before. Today the issue was the staff. The guy who was building our order was very friendly and nice (promote him) everyone else was not so great. The girl that was by the guy was throwing a huge attitude and looked like she wanted to kill everyone here. Not the kind of worker I would want at my job. In my line of work its all about teamwork or you will fail. Just flat out rude. Food is what you would expect but just the staff with the exception of the one guy was just plain rude.
