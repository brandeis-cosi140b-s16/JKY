I read about Top Shelf here on Yelp!, so I decided to give it a try in lieu of my weekly brunch with a friend.  We went early, around 5pm and requested to sit outside since it was such a nice evening.  (NOTE: Sitting outside = inhaling smoke from all the smokers coming outside, so be forewarned.)  We enjoyed the chips and salsa they brought out before our meal, and they were quick to refill the chips when we went through them.  I ordered the fish tacos, which came in three and in flour tortillas with a side of jalapenos and pico de gallo and rice and beans.  They were good and greasy and really filling.  My friend ordered the pollo grande, which was so big, he couldn't finish it.  He said they were good, but they were just meh.  

The cons: the prices were a little high for a Mexican restaurant, and the ambience was sort of bleh, but...

The pros: the food is decent enough, the employees are friendly, and it does the job of fulfilling your Mexican food craving.  It's just not anywhere I'm rushing to get back to. 

PS: If you go in a group, know that they're cool about splitting a bill.
