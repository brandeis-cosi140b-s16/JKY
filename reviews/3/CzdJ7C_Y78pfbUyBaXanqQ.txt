If you want to try some of their menu items made with their melted queso, this might be a good place to visit. I didn't try any of those bc I try to avoid dairy.

But if you are just going to try something on their menu that is similar to the Chipotle menu (like me) then just go to Chipotle! it's literally one block away and much better.

I tried the steak burrito bowl here.  I ordered it exactly like I order my Chipotle burrito bowls (white rice, black beans, corn salsa, pico, red salsa) and it was alright, but not as good as Chipotle. for one, the black beans weren't cooked the entire way through and were kind of hard and raw at parts. the red salsa was also weird in that it tasted sort of like spaghetti sauce? literally the moment I had my first bite, I thought to myself - this reminds me of spaghetti. everything else from the corn salsa to the rice just wasn't as good as I could have had at Chipotle. for $1-2 more, Chipotle is worth it.
