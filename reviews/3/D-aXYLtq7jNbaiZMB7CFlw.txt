For a Mexican restaurant and the area its located in it seemed really, really expensive. Our check for 2 people was $60. We both had 1 drink and 1 entree and split an appetizer. 

The rating is highly influenced by the total price of the experience.

On to the food-- the ceviche was OK at best, it was comprised of 90% pico and 10% shrimp/fish. I've had ceviche from several dozen places and I'd have to rate this ceviche in the bottom 3 : /

The 'Camarones Fantasia' were very dry (over fried a little) and small for an order/the price. It came with 6 medium sized shrimps and should have been at least large or jumbo so as not to become so dry while cooking optimally. Ironically enough, I thought the actual taste was not terrible, but I could not describe them as "succulent" by any means.

The 'Camarones de Ajo' were very good but lacked some flavor that should have been there and that has been present in other Ajo dishes I have sampled throughout the US and Mexico.

The drinks were AWESOME! The micheladas were very great and by far the best part of the meal. However, they were the most expensive I have ever bought (40% more than the most touristy of spots in Mexico, which if you understand, is saying a lot!). 

I'm quite confused how they can charge so much for the drinks and dishes here.

The experience was not "bad", but its certainly not a place I will return to anytime soon.

3 stars is the best I can give this place.
