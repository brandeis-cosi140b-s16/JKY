I'm reviewing Guadalajara because it seems to be the haunt of my family. Meaning, if we're having any sort of celebration for any family member that is not myself, we end up going here. I guess my parents aren't that apt to try new things, so the easy way out is mediocre Mexican at the local casino.

Look, it's not bad, but it's not great either. It is your typical Mexican fair. They have combos, burritos, dinner plates, appetizers, and seafood specials as well. Normally I go for a combo or get a burrito (usually the carne asada, because it's pretty good here, although not spectacular). 

Margaritas: Eh, they're okay and I guess the prices are okay (between $6-$9). I had a Chambord 1800 Margarita, which was actually pretty tasty. However, I also had the Cherry Lime Margarita which tasted nothing like tequila and made me think this is what hairspray must taste like if it were watered down and put in a glass. 

Lastly - their chips have never disappointed me. Always warm, and they are quick to refill your basket if they notice you're running low. Plus there is a salsa bar that provides different salsa and bean dips. Try the dark one (I think it says it is a mild), but it has a very distinctive smokey flavor that really does add some depth to the palate (I know, who says that? But it's true!).

Overall I enjoy this place. Would I go here if I weren't with my family? Probably not. But like I said, it is what it is, and that is A-OK.
