5 stars for food + 1 star for margaritas / 2 = 3 stars for Los Dos Molinos. I loved my blue corn enchiladas, my husband's carnitas were decent, but I'm sorry - limeade + tequila does not equal a good margarita. We were shocked when we took our first sip, and the fact that our mouths were already burning from the delicious salsa made the ridiculously sweet and   limey margarita even more disappointing. To the owners - please at least "upgrade" to Jose Cuervo margarita mix. If we could least get a standard mixed margarita (and have to sacrifice fresh citrus and tequila combined together to make a perfect one), we would probably be in your establishment 2-3 times a week. Thank you.
