Vida, you're a dash of spice, special sauce, and $4 away from being a 5 stars review.  Vida is a fun location for any occasion. Lunch, meeting friends after work, or weekend visit. The wait staff is very courteous, friendly, and professional. Unfortunately the food is just okay at best. If you're at the Epicenter and want Mexican, your options are limited. However, I would recommend Cabo Fish Taco over this any day based on taste and price. Vida serves hefty potions of food so you'll leave full, but unimpressed.

P.S. Beware of the frozen margarita. I had ONE and was 2 steps beyond tipsy. Doesn't taste too strong drinking it, but it is not to be underestimated.
