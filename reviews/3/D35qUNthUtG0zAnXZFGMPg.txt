We sat outside and enjoyed a nice dinner. The margaritas were just ok, I was hoping for a little more kick. The chips were fresh, but the salsa was a little runny for my liking. My Mom and friend enjoyed their burrito and tacos, but I thought the fajita was a little plain. A lot of chicken, but only onions, maybe one pepper and one tomato. A little disappointing.
