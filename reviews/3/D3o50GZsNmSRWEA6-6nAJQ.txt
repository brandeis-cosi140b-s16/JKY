I eat here somewhat often since it is close to my workplace. I like the food that Del Taco offers. However, this particular location probably isn't the best. In one visit I tried to order a shake, "no, our shake machine is down." Ok, that wasn't the most polite response. Then once I paid I was asked if I'd like any hot sauce, I said mild, "we don't have mild." Lol this one visit soured my opinion on this location.
