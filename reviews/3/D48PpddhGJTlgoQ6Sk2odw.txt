Great food however the girls at the register lack any personality. I asked questions about certain menu items and received yes and no answers. She could have explained or offered suggestions based on my questions for what I was looking for.

The 3 young girls at the counter chatting didn't acknowledge us as we left. 

The lady who bussed the table was friendly, nice and actually said thank you, come back.
