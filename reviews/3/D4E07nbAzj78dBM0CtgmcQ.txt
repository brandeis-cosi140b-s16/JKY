Good food,  slow service. 
We went with a party of 6, at about 5:30 on a Tuesday
The restaurant was about half full (filled up by 6),  but it took them about 35 minutes just to bring us the chips and drinks we ordered.  The entr√©e cane quickly,  but the second round of drinks took so long we canceled them because we finished eating.  Turns out they only had one bar tender for the whole restaurant.
the food was good when it came, which is why it hit three stars.
