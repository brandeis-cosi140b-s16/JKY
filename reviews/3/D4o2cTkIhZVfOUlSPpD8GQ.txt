The food was really good but the service was horrible. We got seated right away but waited at LEAST 15min to get our drinks and our server.  When our server (male, quite, hair down) finally arrived he asked if anyone has taken our drinks or orders and we said no. And from there, i was expecting some sort of apology or some sign of "sorry" but nothing. 

We got our food and it was delicious. Their dessert was so-so. Our waiter never came back to us to ask us if everything was ok and if we needed anything. He never refilled our drinks. 

I was disappointed. It was Mothers Day and she wanted to have a great Mexican dinner. I'll go ahead and say i will give this place another try and hope they dont disappoint again.
