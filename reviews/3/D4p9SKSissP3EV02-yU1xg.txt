We came out to this restaurant as part of the package for the IU Insight Bowl game a few years back.  The place was really cool looking on the inside nad almost all outdoors, but in an area like Arizona you don't need to worry about snow.  It was a fun atmosphere but I don't think they were ready for the IU faithful, while we were there they ran out of Miller Lite, Coors Light and Corona.  It was a fun place but hen IU goes to another bowl in 20 years make sure you order more beer.
