30 minute wait on a Saturday night during prime time. By the time we were seated the restaurant had calmed down. Our waiter provided good service at the beginning of the meal but then towards the end he came by less frequent that other servers got us to go boxes and cleaned off our tables. I liked how they provided chips and salsa which had a kick. I settled on the carnitas and sadly I was disappointed. The rice and beans were good though I don't have high standards w/ anything with cheese but really the pork though was in mass quantities and was very overcooked. I had a lot of food left over and ended up eating the leftovers for lunch the next day and I had to force the meal down since I did not want to waste. I had high hopes for Gran Agave - my boyfriend loved his margarita and the carne asada and would go back in a heart beat. However seems I struck out that night.
