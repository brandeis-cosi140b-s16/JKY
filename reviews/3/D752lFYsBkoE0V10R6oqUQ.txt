I was on a road trip and they delayed me because of bad cow disease.....The food was ok flavor wise, so I won't rate them as low as I Should, but I got a bad burrito and " MONTEZUMA'S  REVENGE " to put it nicely. 

  I'm not sure if their normal kitchen practice is not checking their meat, but it delayed my trip and I wouldn't recommend them.  It may be ok ???,but just seems like a quick stop, take your chances kind of place to me. 

I think you have to eat at palace more than once to really tell how good or safe they are. I definitely wouldn't eat there again, unless there is a zombie apocalypse and no where else has power.
