After trying this place several times we are a little disappointed with the food, flavor wise!  The meat in the Taco's lacked any spices,  the Chicken was slightly dry and tasted so-so.  Their tortilla chips are thin and bland at best.  The Machaca was nice!  Portions are large and most combo's include re-fried beans and rice (which was too dry!)  A salsa bar provides several different varieties from mild to pretty hot sauces.   The staff was surprising pleasant, cheerful and provided great service.  In my opinion they need to step up their game and offer better tasting and more authentic Mexican fare.  Having lived in So Cal where the Mexican food is amazing, we have yet to find really outstanding Mexican restaurant in the NW valley.  Our search continues!
