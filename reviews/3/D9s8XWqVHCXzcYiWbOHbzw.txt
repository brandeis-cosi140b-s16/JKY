Let me start by saying I went here with really high expectations. I had heard it was unbelievable.  My table started with chips and salsa. There were 3 salsas, two of which were wonderful. The third,  salsa DE arbol was supposed to be spicy, but it was bland and not spicy at all. I ordered the Korean taco. The meat was cooked perfectly but the Korean sauce was extremely salty. The peanuts added a nice crunch but overall, it was an average taco. Another diner ordered the Baja tacos. They were also nothing special as far as fish tacos go. The highlight was the potatoes bravas. They were really flavorful and crispy. Overall, I felt slightly let down. Maybe too high of expectations,  or maybe there are too many other quality places to grab tacos, so I just wasn't impressed.
