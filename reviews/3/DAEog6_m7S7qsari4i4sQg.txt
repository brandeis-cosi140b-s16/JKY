I'm not overly impressed with Ajo Al's. 

I was dining with a large group, so maybe that explains the waitress's snappy demeanor. I didn't feel very welcome in this restaurant. Luckily I had some wonderful company make up for this!

Chips and salsa were kind of generic...and the salsa was presented in these carafes...not overly appetizing, but that's just me. Usually I find myself going back to the chip basket, but I found it surprisingly easy to hold myself back before our entrees arrived. 

I had the chicken fajitas. You know the best part of fajitas?  The sounds, smells and attention each sizzling skillet receives as it's carried out of the kitchen. 

Sadly, mine had none of these attributes. A couple people in my party had this pleasure, but I did not. My only guess is my plate was sitting under a heat lamp as the first round of orders were carried out. Perhaps I should've ordered something else. 

On the plus side, the guac was incredibly fresh, the tortillas were tender, and the rice was very good.
