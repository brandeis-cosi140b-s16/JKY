We found this place on the Yelp app and since we don't live anywhere near Chandler, we had no idea what we were in for when we decided to drive down for lunch from Scottsdale.  The restaurant is located inside of an old indoor mall that's not in a good part of town....I'm glad we were here for lunch and not dinner.  Everyone was looking at us like we were from outer space.  We were here for the food, not the ambiance...here's what we ordered:

Carnitas Tacos, $1.25 & Pastor Tacos, $1.25

The Tacos were amazing...served Street Taco style, they were simple but very good.  The Pastor Burrito was average....the Pastor was very dry, which is unusual to me....Pastor is generally juicy and full of flavor...this was dry and full of flavor...different and it didn't appeal to me.  The Burrito comes with Beans and Rice inside.

There's a Salsa bar with a handful of choices for you to place in small, plastic cups.

They have Mexican Coke available here...which is my fav and it comes in larger than average bottle (500 ml).  When you're done eating, you leave your empty bottle on your table and they will come pick it up for you....at least that's what I think you're supposed to do.  We looked around and didn't see a place to put empty bottles....we didn't want to throw them in the trash because there's recycling value to them.  During our meal, we watched several other tables leave their bottles on the table when they were finished, so we assumed that was expected.

Overall, the food was OK.  When we left, it didn't leave me wanting more.  I'm not sure I would drive all the way back here again.
