Came here to watch one of the best UFC fights in recent memory when Jon "Bones" Jones barely eeked out a decision against Gustafsson.

The food was fairly standard. Nothing that stands out. What does stand out about this place is that you're overlooking a main chunk of the strip (one of those great sights I love) from a second floor perspective. Also, a couple of HOT waitresses didn't hurt. Think of it as a slightly elevated Hooters with more menu items and elevated atmosphere (both figuratively and literally).

Would I come back here? If it suit my itinerary on my next trip out. I question any Vegas Cantina charging $25 to watch a PPV. But they do have this 20 atomic wing challenge where if you can scarf down 20 of their hottest wings in 20 mins, you end up on their wall of fame. It's precisely the type of perfect challenge to get your slightly drunk friend who loves wings to partake in. And that's definitely worth coming back for.

Done.
