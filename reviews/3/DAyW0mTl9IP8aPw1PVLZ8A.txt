I have noticed that the breakfast burritos and chicken tacos are half the size they used to be.  Portions used to be generous and I found myself there 2 to 3 times a week.  Two chicken tacos used to be enough to fill me up, it now takes 4.  I used to be able to split a breakfast burrito with my wife, now we both want our own!  The food and service are good but I am disapointed that they are cutting back on portions.  I will be looking for another place for my Mexican fast food fix!
