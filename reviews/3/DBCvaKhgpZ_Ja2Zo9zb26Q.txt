I went to Salsa's/Cabo's for the Sunday Brunch Buffet.  The fresh-made tortillas were wonderful and the service was excellent, but the food was just ok for me.   There was a good selection of items and everything was tasty, but some items were a bit too salty for my taste.   I may give it another try.
