I can't high rate the restaurant. Why.  All I get are carne asada fries. Don't get me wrong they are good but not five star good.  What equals out the the rating is the portion you are given. It is really enough for 2-3 people for 7.50!  Damn good price to me. 

Drive thru service is quick.  Downside is you can't see the inside of the joint, so this may be an off review but take as you may.  
Hands down though you will want to order some carne asada fries.
