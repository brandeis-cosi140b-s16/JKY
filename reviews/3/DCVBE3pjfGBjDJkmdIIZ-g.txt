we came here on a sunday afternoon and ordered 6 tacos: (2 carnitas, 2 asada, and 2 tinga) and a horchata for 12. 

- tacos comes with little meat. compared to el gordo (which although is a bit more expensive), they pack their tacos with more meat and has more flavor.
- asada has too much fat. small pieces.
- tinga and carnitas were nothing special (shredded beef and pork)
- misfire. they sprinkle the cilantro and onions on. few tacos had alot and others had none! lol.
- the mom hooked it up with a free refill of horchata :)!
