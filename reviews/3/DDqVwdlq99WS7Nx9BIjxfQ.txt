I love trying new places. So I was excited when I was invited here. Upon entering the server, Rick, greeted us. He seemed hurried, so our party of 3 sat quickly. I was interested in the blanco sangria. I asked him what the fruit was, and he quickly left. He returned telling me that the sangria didn't have fruit in it. The menu says fruit, can you tell me what the fruit flavor profile is? He said the sangria doesn't have fruit, it has wines, rum, triple sec and other liquors. I said the menu says fruit - is it peach, melon or what? The replied there is no fruit in the menu! 
I changed and ordered a glass of wine. He seemed annoyed with questions and to be quite honest, appeared to lack knowledge about the menu in general. I won't go into the other incidents that occurred during lunch. The food was good but the service was horrible. I hope next time I am interested in visiting he isn't my server or I won't be eating in!
