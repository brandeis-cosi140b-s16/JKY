Great food as usual. I brought my parents here for the first time. They really liked it. My only complaint was the noise level. Wow! Right next to the bar screaming across the table to each other or the server. My hard of hearing dad just tuned out because he heard nothing but bar laughter and chatter. Next time a table far from the bar....
