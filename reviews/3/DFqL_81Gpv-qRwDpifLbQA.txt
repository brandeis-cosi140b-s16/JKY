I went here to try some tamales and they were pretty authentic. This place has been around since 1947, so something is good here. For some reason, I ordered a dozen tamales because thats what your supposed to do around the holiday's right? The beef version had plenty of beef and peas also, but sauce wasn't as red as it could be. The green chile and cheese had whole strips of green chili and lots of masa, but Tolteca uses cheddar cheese and my preferred choice is some sort of white cheese for tamales. Every single sauce at the large salsa bar was too hot for this gringo as the sweat started pouring out of me once safely back at my house. The rice was good as a side dish, real mexican rice, but the fresh guac was also brimming with jalapeno's, so this was also a hot guac. Overall, probably better tamales out there, so next time, I will just buy a couple at a time and sample. They were $2 each, but a dozen was only $17 bucks. Flautas looked good also for next time.
