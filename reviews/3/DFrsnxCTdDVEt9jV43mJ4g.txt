I got the tostada bowl and wasn't too impressed. The tostada wasn't what I expected with a flat round on the bottom. The chicken is way too spicy for my liking. Guac is also over spiced. Skimpy on filling the bowl but over flows with lettuce unlike other locations. Gave us a punch card but didn't fill it out for today's order. I'll stop by again in a few months after the newness wares off.
