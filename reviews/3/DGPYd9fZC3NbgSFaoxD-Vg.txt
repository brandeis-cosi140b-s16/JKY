The fish tacos are really good.  It's just a shame this place is in a Wal-Mart parking lot because the riff raff like to eat here.  On our visit one guy was in handcuffs detained by the police outside (for a non-fish taco related incident) and there were about 20 people crowded around the few tables waiting for someone to leave so they could sit.  Those fish tacos are solid though.
