I haven't been previous to the remodel but I agree with previous reviews....it looks fantastic! The food isn't bad either. 

I tend to judge Mexican restaurants by their salsa. Theirs passes my sniff test. What comes to the table is a medium-hot red salsa. But if you want something with a bit more kick, ask for the tomatillo salsa. 

Taco salad is decent. But honestly,  the best thing about it is the shredded beef instead of ground beef. My favorite thus far is the spinach enchilada w/ whole leaf spinach. Tasty! 

Wha...? What's this white curd in my guacamole?? Is this cottage cheese?! Ewwww!
