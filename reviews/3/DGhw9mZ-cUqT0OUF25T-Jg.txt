This is my favorite taco joint in Vegas...if you don't count the ladies selling contraband tamales out of stolen grocery carts. But they stay on the move, so you can't count on them. As a side review, the lady who used to sell them around Twain and Swenson was particularly good. 

But, I digress. There are a few Tacos Mexicos scattered around, the ones I frequent are this one at Sahara and Valley View, the one across from the Huntridge Theatre, there's one on short west Trop, and the one down on the North End by the Stratosphere.  There is no consistency between them, one may stew the chicken for the tacos, another may grill it, but  it's all good...and every time I am in there, I am the only gringo in the place. 

The hardest part is dealing with the juke while waiting...Somebody explain to me, when the hell did the polka get adopted as the national pop music form in Mexico?  

The menu board still has duct tape over where it said "Sesos"(brains) because of the whole mad cow thing I guess, but you can still get "Tripas/Guts" "Buche/Beef Cheeks" "Cabeza/Head"(not that kind, cross the county line, freak) and "Lengua/Tongue" tacos....but I don't like to taste anything that can taste me back, so I stick with chicken, carne asada, and al pastor, tacos, burritos, tostada, whatever I'm in the mood for. Oh yeah, and most importantly, it's 24 hours. 

 It ain't super clean, if you are into that. But when I was a kid in NY my dad always used to say that the guy with the dirtiest fingernails had the best hot dogs, and that's kinda how I look at Tacos Mexico...yeah the floors are greasy, and in at least one of them the cook is missing a hand, but what the hell. Good burritos don't fall off of trees.
