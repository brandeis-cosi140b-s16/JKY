I guess this would be my favorite place to eat in AJ.  Anyone that lives in AJ knows that that's not saying much...we typically have to go somewhere else for a decent dinner out.  The food here is pretty good with good flavors.  The portions are good and the quality is ok (above average for AJ).  Give this place a try.  I think it's worth a trip for the hungry looking for a place to eat/drink and relax.
