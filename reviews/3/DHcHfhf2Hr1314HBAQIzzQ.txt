Went to Chipotle for dinner tonight. They were busy as they usually are so we had to wait in line a few minutes. I got a burrito bowl with white rice, black beans, barbacoa, cheese, and sour cream on the side (because they always put way too much). They were running low on chicken for my boyfriend's bowl so they gave him some extra when the fresh chicken came out. The sour cream was also running low and they put out a new batch after me. The iced tea was a little on the strong side so I added a little water to my cup and it was much better. I wanted to eat outside since it was a mild evening, but it smelled skunky out so we came back in. Unfortunately the dining area is pretty noisy and echo-y because there's no carpet or insulation to help absorb noise. But my meal was very tasty. The barbacoa had some kick to it and I like the sour cream to cool it down a bit. They also gave me a generous portion, so I was satisfied.
