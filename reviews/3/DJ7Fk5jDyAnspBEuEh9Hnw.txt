I tend to visit this location a bit more than the boca park due to it being next to where a good chunk of my friends live. It's not a bad bar at all. I've watched tons of sporting events and had a good time. It's also good because the bar is a bit more seperated from the restaurant. One major factor that the Boca Park location has over this is the patio. It absolutely changes the dynamic and I wish this location had one like that. That aside,  I still love wahoos with its cheap food, cheap drinks. (Mostly) fun bartenders who have no problem joining in on the fun most of the time
