Taco Bell is a guilty pleasure of mine, I admit.  Typically, I leave missing at least one item I have ordered (even if I only order two items); however, this location off of Dobson/Southern in Mesa has never let me down. 

The service is usually fairly quick and the employees I've encountered have all been very nice, speak English and are always ready to give me any sauce I need.

Keep it up, Taco Bell.  My stomach and wallet thank you repeatedly.
