I'm kind of surprised I gave this 2 stars a few years ago. Although I can say I still don't find a lot of the menu items overwhelmingly good - there is one simple item that is absolutely stunning here, the Chimichangas. The avocado one and spinach ones I get from time to time are what really sets this place on a pretty regular delivery/dine-in option for me.
