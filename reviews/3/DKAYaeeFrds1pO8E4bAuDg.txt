Food was good. Service is odd, like they're trying to be upscale but haven't got that all figured out. I brought the coaster discount from City Tins, and included that with my credit card when paying the bill. When the check was returned, the coaster was gone but the discount was not applied. Another post said that the owner visits tables but he wasn't anywhere around on a weekend afternoon.
