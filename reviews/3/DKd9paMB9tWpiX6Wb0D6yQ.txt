Went here for the first time. Food was average for las vegas mexican food, no better. I will say the menu was huge, so there could be plenty of things that are great, just don't know after one visit. The facility itself is in need of repair. It is a little on the old side and looks it inside. As for the employees, our waiter was 'Lorenzo', and if you are looking for the one single employee who has no personality, as in zero, this is you man. Holy smoke. Drove out of our way to get there, not again.
