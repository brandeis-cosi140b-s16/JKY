Ah. This isn't anything great, but it's not horrible. It's a nice and CLEAN taco shop on 40th and Camelback (NWC) that has a good seleciton of tacos (duh), burritos, and basically everything else that is Mexcian/American.
The tacos are good sized and the salsa is tasty.
The service is friendly and the food is good. Solid 3 star review for me.
