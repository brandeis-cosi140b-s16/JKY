when our food was brought to us, half our order was wrong. they weren't apologetic at all. I got the carne asada nachos and they were ok. the meat it self doesn't half a lot of flavor and a bit dry so you definitely need salsa. their aguas are probably the tastiest item! I got the mango and my sister got watermelon, amazing! I will probably not return due to their poor customer service skills and ok food.
