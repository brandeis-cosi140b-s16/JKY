I wasn't sure why Sandbar has such a low rating. I had been here for drinks and appetizers before but had never eaten here. We had dinner at Sandbar last night and I have to say the service was top rate, the food was good. This is primarily a bar so don't go expecting gourmet. It is pretty basic but still very good for what it is. I had the Baja Taco's which is one of their specialties. I would certainly order them again. I want to go for Taco Tuesday, That sounds like the deal. Friday and Saturday nights the place is more or less a club for the college set. The prices are up there but it is a good place to go for happy hour or dinner and drinks. Even though I rated it a 3 it is a place I would go and recommend just not a place I would pick.
