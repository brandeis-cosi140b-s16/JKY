I've eaten here numerous times and am still amazed how popular these places are. It must be because they're open 24 hours and late at night it's one of the few places you can get something to eat fast. That's the only reason I eat here.

The good is soso. It fills you up but as far as being flavorful it leaves a lot to be desired.

I'm sure I'll visit again. It serves a purpose.
