It's located in the same plaza on the other side of Marrakech and Satay which used to house the old Firefly location.

Came here around 1p thinking their HH was earlier than it really is but decided to check it out anyway since we were already there. Inside decor is hip and I remember hearing Empire of the Sun playing in the background. My friend noticed a Black Keys poster hanging on their wall. Got seated by the windows and started off with a passion fruit margarita, mango margarita, and chips and salsa. Margaritas were good. Preferred the passion fruit over the mango. They were flavors you can easily down. Chips and salsa were ok but for $1.95 it wasn't bad.

Ordered the corn salad, fish taco, shrimp taco, and the al pastor. My friend liked her fish taco and I liked the shrimp. The al pastor for us, was meh. We thought it wasn't as good as the fish and shrimp. I think what makes their tacos good are the tortillas they use. I could probably eat it alone. Such perfect texture. Also, don't skip out on the corn salad. Probably my favorite thing I tried here.

Service was very attentive. They consistently make sure you're doing okay but it came to the point where they checked on us so often, we felt rushed to finish our meals. 

HH is 3p-6 and 11p-close. I'd come back to check it out. The HH menu does seem like it got shorter in comparison to the past but prices are reasonable regardless.
