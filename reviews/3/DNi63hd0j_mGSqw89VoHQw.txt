If you're on the Strip and looking for a decently priced, quick meal, Del Taco is the place to be! 

Unlike some of the other fast food joints in this food court between the MGM and Planet Hollywood, Del Taco's prices seemed pretty consistent with their prices in the "real world." I got two grilled chicken soft tacos for $3. Cheap meal for Vegas!
