We have been to this place twice now and the first experience was a little better than the second. The decor is lacking in the clean category and the patio looks like half storage and half for seating. 

The food is actually very tasty. My husband was very surprised how good the chicken burrito was. It was very full of chicken and not just fillers. 

We won't skip this place, but it won't be our first choice for dinner.
