not horrible, not great. 

the service was actually very good. our waiter took our drink order shortly after we sat, and our food came out scary fast. I ordered the prickly pear margarita. it was a good size, but like most Mexican places I've been to, I could barely taste the tequila. I ordered the chimichanga for dinner, and it was just ok. the flavor was there and the shredded steak was tender, but the tortillas were thick and chewy. definitely not the flakey fried perfection you'd want from a chimichanga.
