My friend thought he was bringing us to Macayo's, but it turned out to be Garcia's but we were just in the mood for Mexican food so we stayed. Our server was a little rough around the edges, but she got the job done so I can't really complain. I can't remember if it was HH, but I got a regular margarita which was very good. To eat, I believe I had a combination with a beef taco and a chicken enchilada, which was good. The queso and salsa that they brought out was good, but not mind blowing. Would I come back? Eh, not sure.
