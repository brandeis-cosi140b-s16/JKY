I haven't been to Baja Fresh in years but what stood out to me was their fresh and zesty ingredients. I decided to go there recently and try their Steak and Shrimp bowl. It also had chili tomatillo rice, avocado slices, roasted corn salsa,  grilled calabasitas squash, achiote onions , and anejo cheese. My mouth waters just listing the ingredients because it sounds good ! It has a lot of my favorite things but the taste was blah! It tasted plain and boring despite the exciting things contained in this bowl. Maybe I should have ordered my usual fish tacos.
