I've been waiting with bated breath to see which restaurant would occupy the final spot in the shopping center by my house. When Chronic Tacos was announced, I was excited at the prospect of an alternative to Chipotle. Unfortunately, in the vein of Smashburger, Chronic Tacos expects you to pay a premium for subpar food. I can't begin to count the ways paying $9 for a "California burrito" is wrong, but soggy fries is definitely one of them.

Customer service is also lacking. This place has only been open for two weeks, but the workers expect everyone who walks through the door to be a veteran. I repeatedly had to ask the server to describe what my options were. No, I don't know that the white cheese is called "Oaxaca." I also had no idea that brown rice wasn't available. 

The ordering system is strange. too. Instead of bringing all the ingredients for menu items to the front of the store, some have to be cooked to order in the back. The result is that you have to step out of line to wait for an item to be cooked to order, then back in when it comes time to tell the food worker which toppings you want.

While I will readily admit that the Chronic Fries are delicious -- and appropriately priced -- I do not feel, having eaten an entire California Burrito, that the price was on point. Chipotle does the same thing for almost $3 less, though with fewer topping options.

In the end, I feel like Chronic Tacos's entire business model revolves around asking customers to pay more to avoid dealing with Mexicans. But if I want good Mexican food, those are exactly the people I want making it! There are also a dearth of cheaper Mexican food options in the area. I will try any restaurant once, but I won't be back here. I can get a California for $4 less right down the street.
