Server was nice.  Had to track him down for the check with only 4 other patrons in the restaurant though...not cool.
Salsa was GROSS.  Like sweet spaghetti sauce.  Never had anything like that EVER, and don't wish to again.
We were there on Saturday afternoon and they had a decent happy hour.  I got some street tacos for $8 and they were pretty good, but there was something strange about the flavor of the meat.  Like, "what kind of meat IS this?" type of strange.  It looked like beef but tasted like pork. So weird.  They did present my friend with a beautiful side salad, however.  I think if I were to return, I'd go that route.
I added a star for location and d√©cor.  It's really a nice atmosphere inside.  Other than that, I was underwhelmed with the food.
