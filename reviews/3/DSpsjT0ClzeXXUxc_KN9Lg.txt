The appeal of this place is their name.  When you're coming off from a long flight and have some time to kill during your layover, you know that this place is gonna serve alcohol.  Unfortunately, since I was traveling on Army orders to a class, and would have to take a physical fitness test in a few days, I had to hold back from the liquor.  

It was crowded in there, but the bartender greeted us immediately and invited us to sit there. Had it not been so close to the walkway/entrance, we might have taken him up on the offer since it was right in front of the TV that was playing the basketball game.  Luckily, we found a table more toward the inside of the restaurant so we could get some personal space.  

My buddy and I both ordered the enchiladas.  I was ok with the plastic utensils, but when the food tasted like cafeteria style quality, I felt it was way overpriced, even considering it being in an airport.  The black beans and rice were just ok.  Next time, I'll just come here for the drinks when I want to get smashed for my next flight.
