Thought I'd give this place a try. Sometimes you just never know. Could have been a diamond in the rough. Sadly it was not. I tried the three item combo. Chicken enchilada, shredded beef burrito, ground beef taco. It came with rice and beans. The shredded beef was actually good but the rest was just below average. The beans were just plain bad. The service was good and the staff was attentive. Chips and salsa tasted like they were prepackaged.
