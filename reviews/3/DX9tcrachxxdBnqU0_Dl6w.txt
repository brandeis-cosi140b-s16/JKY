Atmosphere and service was good. The inside of the place is pretty cool and I enjoyed the large connect four game, and my daughter enjoyed the corn hole. The female service was good, and this one girl inperticular was good. She wasn't our server, but brought us chips and just had a good personality. I wish I knew her name for a shoutout. Moving on, food was bad. We did not like this food and we will definitely not return If we are looking for some bomb mexican food. I wouldn't mind having a drink here, but in terms of a "grill", not good stuff. Bar, A+ enviroment, restaurant, F
