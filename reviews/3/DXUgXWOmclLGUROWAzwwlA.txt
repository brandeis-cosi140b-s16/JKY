Being from Southern California, I'm always on the lookout for a Mexican place that reminds me of home. Thankfully, Rey Azteca is close by. It's not what I would consider a five star dining experience, nor is their food gourmet quality, but don't mistake those critiques as me saying it's a bad place to eat.

A hidden gem on their menu is the Chicken Soup. Order it with a side of flour tortillas for dipping/scooping and you can thank me after. 

If you're by yourself or with one other person, a good idea is to go back and sit at the bar. My wife and I regularly visit Rey Azteca after we go to the gym Wednesday nights and just head back to the bar where we get prompt service and a dedicated wait staff.

One comment I feel I have to make is Rey Azteca recently received a "C" rating from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. Meaning their food handling and cleanliness was "poor to marginal" during a surprise inspection. They've since brought their rating back up to an "A", but I felt this worth at least mentioning.
