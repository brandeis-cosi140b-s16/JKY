The last time I came here I wasn't too impressed but yesterday I went with a friend for lunch and I really liked it. The chips and salsa they serve you when you first sit down are average but I liked how they do give you two types of salsa right off the bat. No need to ask for a spicier one. I ordered the Poco Polla con Queso off the lunch menu. It came with rice and beans for $9.00. It was quite a lot of food for lunch and I ended up taking half of it home with me. I got the black beans and they were pretty good but a little bland. So was the rice. I had to salsa to both of them to give them a little more flavor. But the Poco Polla was excellent and I would go back again.
