Decided to check this place out since its near my house. I gave it a 3 star but I was teetering on the edge of a two. I just didn't think the place was all that great. When we initially arrived we were quickly seated (Sunday mid-afternoon) and the waitress promptly took our drink orders. She drops of our drinks and then proceeds to disappear for a solid 15 minutes. When she came back she gave us some chips and 2 types of salsa. The chips were 100% stale however the salsa's (red & green) were actually both pretty good. So the waitress took our order and it honestly seemed that it was another 30 minutes before the food came out. I can understand the wait if the place was jam packed but I would hardly describe the place as busy when I was there not to mention all we ordered was a hot sandwich and some fish tacos. Anyway, I got a steak and pepper torta which was actually pretty decent. The bread I thought made the sandwich...it seemed fresh. My wife had some some fish tacos which she said weren't all that great as well. After we ate we promptly paid and left. The weirdest thing about this place and I'm not sure if it happens all the time but all the workers and what seemed like their friends hung out in front of the customers. Literally right next to the booth I was sitting in there were at least 3 girls just sitting there with one just straight up eating! Call me old fashioned but isn't that a big NO NO in the restaurant biz?? It just struck me as very unprofessional to be eating out in the open. One of the guys she was sitting there with who I imagine was the manager or something didn't even say anything to her! Bottom line if you were to ask me if I'd go back there I would probably say no. Food was "eh" and the service was sub par. To many better Mexican restaurants to come back to this place, first one that comes to mind is PoPo's right off of Bell and I think 59th Ave.
