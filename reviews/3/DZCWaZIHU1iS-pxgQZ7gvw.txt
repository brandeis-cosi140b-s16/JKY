This is definitely the LATE NIGHT hot spot. Since it is only one of the few places open 24 hours in phoenix, I hit this place up quite frequently. 

I have only known San Diego to be home of the infamous Carne Asada FRIES, and I was very excited to see that 'Bertos had them as well. I prefer the ones at the McDowell location to the ones at E. Thomas. They use the thinner fries. 

If you have yet to experience CARNE ASADA FRIES....you need to hop on board...QUICK!! Just imagine nachos, piled high with cheese, sour creme, guacamole and carne asada. Now...replace the tortilla chips with fries and there you have it. 

I know it may sound intense and overbearing to some, but I probably get them at least once every week or two. The rolled tacos are decent as well. Get them with cheese and guac. 

The only thing I wish for is better hot sauce/salsa. It's very blah and standard, but I still use it. Red one is the best in my opinion.
