Had their Carne Asada fries. Came with a "fry sauce" that was very unique and added a kick to the flavors. Went there again last night and they had there doors locked. It was 7pm and they close at 10pm. Went across the street to Cafe Rio to fill my Mexican craving and on the way home passed by and they were open... SAD FACE!
