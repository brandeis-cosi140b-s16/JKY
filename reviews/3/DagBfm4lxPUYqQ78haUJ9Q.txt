I'm giving El Conquistador 4 stars for the food but 1.5 stars for the service. I wanted to LOVE this place, I really did -- I know that it is a mom and pop place, and it has a fantastic review already on Yelp and in the AZ Republic. I thought I would be a cooler Phoenician if I could make this my new "my place." 

Perhaps we hit on an off night (just a random Saturday), but our service was horrible. I was taking my neighbor out for dinner, and her comment was that "we could have died back here and they wouldn't notice." We waited at least 5 minutes before anyone came over to give us menus or take a drink order. We alerted them that it was our first time in the establishment and asked for recommendations, which were given but wtih minimal enthusiasm. We tried giving "the eye" or "the nod" and stopped short only of getting up to refill our own drinks during the meal. 

On the plus side, the food was very good and I have been craving it since my initial visit! I had a combination plate that let me taste a yummy chili relleno, taco and enchilada -- all were fantastic. My neighbor got the special (seafood enchiladas) and raved about hers as well. 

I will definitely visit again, but if the service isn't any better then maybe I'll turn it into my new special "my takeout place."
