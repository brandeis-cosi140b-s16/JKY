I looked at the menu and I instantly felt that this was the most overpriced Mexican restaurant around Charlotte.  Nine dollars for a quesadilla!  That is pretty outrageous.  

I ordered the fried shrimp, and when it came out I was pretty impressed.  I loved the presentation of the food; all of the shrimp were nicely arranged around the plate. There was sliced avocado in the middle, with lettuce and other sliced veggies to clear the palate after each bite of shrimp dipped into melted butter.  I thought the food was actually worth the price in hindsight.  

I hate to say it, but I did not enjoy the service as much as I did the food.  Our waitress asked if I was finished with my plate, when I obviously had a lot of shrimp left to eat.  This actually happened repeatedly.  I just am not a fan of getting rushed out of a restaurant.  The food was great, but the service could use a little more love.
