Eh... sadly, the last few times we've gone there/ordered take-out from there, its been less than awesome.  There's something in the ranchero and enchilada sauces, some kind of spice, that they are getting REALLY heavy-handed with. In fact, even the smell of it turns my stomach now, sadly. I can't put my finger on what it is... oregano or maybe cloves?  Whatever it is, it's not a good thing.  

Their rice has been especially dry and clumpy the last few times we've ordered, as well.

Their beans are still delicious, their salsa still rocks, but I do think they could pony up for some homemade chips. It's not that hard to make them and it would make their great salsa stand out more.

Their service is still great, too, but overall the place is just not as awesome as it was for me before. Bummer.
