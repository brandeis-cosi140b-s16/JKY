Endless enchiladas and Tacos on Wednesdays and Thursdays. They kind if went downhill with quality because now they do buffet (serve yourself style) versus freshly made enchiladas and tacos. They also don't do endless margaritas anymore. Buffet style enchiladas and kind of hard after 5 minutes.

Nice decor and attentive staff. They were a 4 but after the change a strong 3.
