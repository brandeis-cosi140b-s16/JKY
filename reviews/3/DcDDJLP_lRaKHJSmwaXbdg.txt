Only getting 3 stars because the 3 women working provided legit customer service. 

I'm a SoCal native and I've heard about chronic for years. Figured it was all hype "which hype is over doing it for this establishment". The food was absolute trash.. I wouldn't give it to a stray dog it was that bad. I tried to give the so called "Asada" some life with limes but I sweatergod that shit ain't work cuhz. I bit into my taco only to be taken to a Sahara desert. DRY. The tacos tasted like what I imagine those t shirts they shoot out of the cannons at sporting events would taste like "given someone decided to eat one". 

The place needs to change its name to chronic, but you'd literally have to be on that good good to ever want to eat there again.
