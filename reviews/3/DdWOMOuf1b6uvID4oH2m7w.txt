To start with, I'm not so impressed with Qdoba. There are lots of similar sorts of places out there, notably Moe's, with better offerings. Location wise this place is fine. It's great because I can drop off books for sale at The Last Word and come in here to eat while they look them over.

They have everything you'd expect from a place like this. The various salsas, guacs and picos. They've got the usual toppers for your burrito or salad. When you're just craving that Mexican face-smash of flavor these kinds of places are where it's too be found. But the reason I'm giving them only three stars is because of hidden up-charges. Well, I suppose the hidden part is debatable. They tell you outright that pretty much anything delicious you want to add to your burrito is an up-charge. Guacamole, for example, is an extra charge. Go to Moe's, you can put whatever you want on your burrito from their line-up, no extra charge. I think Qdoba might find that they even make more money if they just charge a slightly higher price for everything and let the customer choose what they want on it without having to constantly ask "Oh wait, does that cost more?"
