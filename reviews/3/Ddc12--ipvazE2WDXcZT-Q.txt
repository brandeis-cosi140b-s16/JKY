Overall, they have delicious food, but we ordered lunch for an office meeting, only to get it to the office and find out that the nachos were soggy and cold, my burrito was tasty but again cold as if it came straight out of the refrigerator. We were a little disappointed this time around. They seemed super busy and short staffed which could have been the result of our cold food. We also informed them that we wanted the food ready for pick up by 12:40 (we called it in at 10:45 and on the receipt it stated "pick-up time 11:04) which we think our food sat for almost 2 hrs. 
Again, food is delicious, just disappointed in quality this time.
