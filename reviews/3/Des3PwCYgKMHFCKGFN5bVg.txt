God bless Rolberto's for being a hop, skip and a stumble from home.  Thanks goes for being open 24 hours - especially on late nights when I need some greasy carby goodness to soak up the alcohol and prevent the hangover from hell.  Everyone - you can categorize this with all the other Erto's (Filiberto's, Raliberto's, etc.) 

I must admit I have never had Rolberto's sober or during the day, so I can't vouch for food quality.  But I'm sure it's shitty.  As a matter of fact ,Sunday morning I had to deep clean my kitchen because I was about to hurl from the residual stench of the food.  But that is neither here nor there.  Major points go to Rolberto's simply for providing another alternative to barfy fast food and the Gay Denny's.  The chicken torta and carne asada burritos are good (read - digestable).  But don't blame me if you get sick!!
