I thought it would be a dive, but it was really good!
The place is clean. The decor is tasteful. (I think of Restaurant Impossible when I try a new place out.) 
I had grilled shrimp tacos and the shrimp was DIVINE. I'm not even kidding. It was spiced just right, and the tortillas held up to the weight. I love the salsa bar.
Staff was super friendly, too. 

I am craving those tacos again, and I was just there 4 days ago. I will definitely be back to this place.
