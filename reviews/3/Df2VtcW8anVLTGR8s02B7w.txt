So just went there two days ago for my birthday, and what happened? The tacos were totally different. We were laughing at my shrimp taco it only had one piece of shrimp. Also I get the sex appeal bartenders are sexy that's how they get tips but the girl back there had practically all her boobs popping out. Like seriously it's 3pm not 11pm. I would not recommend this place as a "family friendly establishment" man I really liked you guys but looks like you've guys changed for the worse. Bummer!
