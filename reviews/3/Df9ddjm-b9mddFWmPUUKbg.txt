The food was ok. The bartender made a really good patron margarita. The restaurant got really hot and I'm not sure if there air conditioning is holding up to the heat! If I went back I would just try something else on the menu. I always give two tries before I make a decision not to go back. Service was good and a very beautiful view sitting at the bar! Live music was a nice added touch!
