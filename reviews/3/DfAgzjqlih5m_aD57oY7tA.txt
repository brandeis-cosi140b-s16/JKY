Ok, so it's still not 100% what I'm looking for but it's way better then Roberto's or Super Burrito... The carne asada was decent and the guac was pretty good. I am still looking for someone who does a decent chicken burrito, but thats another story. Overall the place it clean and the people are very friendly. This alone sets it apart from the others.
