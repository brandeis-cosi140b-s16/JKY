This place is messing with me.

My husband enjoys the menudo on weekends and the lengua burritos, which are not served everywhere. Erick's is 24 hours and a million times better than any 'bertos establishments out there. The ground beef, carne asada, Chile relleno, they are all great. There are 4 types of churro and a vast menu.

But still...

EVERY. TIME.

There is ALWAYS something missing from my order, and I seriously think the girl there is messing with me. Usually it is the churros that are left out of the bag. Today, I made sure that they were in there. So much so, that I got home and hadn't made sure that I had my actual food. I didn't.

I'd had it. Drove back and the girl didn't recognize me from 5 minutes prior. The short "sorry" I got seemed like I had done something wrong. I had to wait for it to even be prepared, and finally got it, but I almost don't even want it anymore. While I am waiting right now, people come up noting things that they are missing from their orders. I should take comfort in the fact that maybe she is not messing with ME in particular, right?

It's a shame that more attention isn't paid, because the have great food. They really do.

Ok. So quick update upon getting home. This thing is not cooked. I'm fuming. The girl asked me what kind of salsa. I say red. In the bag, ALL GREEN. No red. I want to punch butterflies right now!
