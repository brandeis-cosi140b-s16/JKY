This Chronic Taco location has been open at the Palms for a little while now, and I've always been curious as to how it has been since I've seen it. Well, my curiosity was recently killed.

At first glance, what I take this place to be is a place similar to Chipotle and Qdoba by telling the first person what you want, and then going in a line to pick which specific fillings you want in your dish. It seems a little different, and so I thought I should give it a try, why not right? Here, they offer two different kinds of rice, 2 different kinds of beans I believe, and the rest is honestly similar to Chipotle and Qdoba by picking cheese, lettuce, etc. The people helping me out seemed a little impatient and not necessarily happy to be there, and so that was just a little bit annoying to deal with. Compared to Chipotle, I like Chipotle a lot better, and generally, the service is a little bit better too. I more than likely wouldn't come back here, due to similar prices compared to Chipotle and the food is not more authentic than any other place that offers Mexican food. If you're hungry at the Palms, I personally rather just go to Earl of Sandwich, but that's just me.
