This location is better than the Gilbert location.  It is decent. Nothing spectacular but there are some menu items that I enjoy.  The flour tortillas, however,  don't taste that great.  A good Mexican restaurant needs good tortillas. I have never had to wait long for a table but the parking sucks.  There is a valet service and I guess it's more important to save the good parking spots for them to use.
