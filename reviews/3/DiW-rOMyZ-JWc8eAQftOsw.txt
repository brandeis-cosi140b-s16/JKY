Just ok. 

Tortillas are great! But everything else needed a serious dash of salt! 

Me and the hubs got our food to go and it was so awkward in the restaurant. Smelled like Lysol and it was so quiet even though there were 5 other families in there. They are in need of some music! My husband was joking that the lights were interrogation lights. So bright and spotlights almost.

I would go back. I would tell someone to try it but not my favorite.
