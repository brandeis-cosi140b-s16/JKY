I had been in Tempe for two days and hadn't gotten any Mexican food - how is that possible?  So when my friends asked what I wanted for dinner I said "TACOS!" and off to Dos Gringos we went.

The food is pretty decent - not the best I've ever had, but I'd certainly go back.  The salsa seemed fresh, and I liked that there was a big variety of meats for the tacos, and you could get them prepared three different ways (gringo, tex mex, and something else that escapes me).  

The service was a little flaky, but nothing offensive.
