There are quite a few expensive looking restaurants in The Borgata, but I don't know how they manage to stay open, it was practically deserted. Still, it was my first time there, so maybe that's the exception and not the norm. What set Blanco apart and ultimately made us decide to go here was the very welcoming outdoor space on a perfectly beautiful day.

The best part of the food came free, the chips and salsa. I'm a big fan of frescas and cucumber beverages so I ordered the cucumber-kumquat fresca it was very refreshing and delicious. Pistachio and Goat Cheese salad was disappointing; avocados were hard. I don't think avocados were even listed as part of the salad on the menu. If I were preparing it I'd never put a less than perfectly ripe avocado slice on a salad. It's like biting into ice cream and realizing it's "light" or being an innocent child who suddenly finds out life isn't fair or finding out the person you love doesn't love you back or...anyway it's heartrendingly disappointing. Please spread awareness about unripe avocados and refrain from serving them anywhere, ever.

But I digress. The patio situation was beautiful and comfortable, but eating a meal out there was very awkward. To make a long description short, the most comfortable ways to eat without occasionally dumping food all over myself were to hold the plate under my chin or lean over the small umbrella stand/table to my left.
