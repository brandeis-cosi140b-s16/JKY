Great? No. A decent, reasonably priced burrito for an airport, and fast? Yes.  There's not that much to say about a place like this, other than if I was hungry in this airport terminal again, I'd probably be back.  

The staff was both fast and friendly, given that they were busy.  

They sell decent (non-alcoholic) drinks, including Naked Juice.

Probably the best thing on the menu is the Blue Burrito Super Burrito.
