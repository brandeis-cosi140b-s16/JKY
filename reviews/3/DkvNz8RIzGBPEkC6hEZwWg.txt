A mom and pop spot that attracts locals on the weekend for menudo--
32nd Cafe serves a combination of American and Mexican fare.  It is not the best Mexican food in east Phoenix, but I do recommend the Chorizo.  I haven't tried their burgers or fries, so I'll leave that task to someone else.

I like the feel of the place.  It is old and clean.  When you walk in, there is a definite feeling that the other customers there are regulars, which gives me confidence any time I walk into a bar or restaurant.

While I have not had everything on the menu, I have had their Chorizo burrito, and it is solid.  Every now and then, a man who has drank enough tequila for two men in the prior evening needs chorizo the next day.  This would be a good place to go on that occasion.
