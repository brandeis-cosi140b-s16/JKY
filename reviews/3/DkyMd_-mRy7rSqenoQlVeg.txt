Had dinner and drinks at Azteca this weekend with a friend of mine. The restaurant itself is quite large and had a festive aura. Upon arriving, I sat at the bar (as I waited for my friend) and had a top shelf margarita. The margarita itself was strong. As a bartender, I tend to like mine a bit more subtle w the alcohol, but I'm a bit crazy like that. The bartender was affable and hard at work. He ran the bar nicely.

When my friend arrived we grabbed a table. No reservations on weekends keep in mind. Our server was quiet and a bit hurried. I understand that because it was a Saturday night. When we did order (burritos and a chicken dish in a cream sauce) our food came quickly. The chips that came with salsa were bland and too thick to me. The entrees themselves were on plates larger than a small country. It was aesthetically funny to look at. Our meals were good. Not amazing but not bad. I will say the chorizo burrito was quite tasty though. 

The pricing was inexpensive. Like most Mexican places, you get a lot of food for the $$.

Would I return. Yes. For what is in the area, Azteca is a decent spot for a quick and filling Mexican dish.
