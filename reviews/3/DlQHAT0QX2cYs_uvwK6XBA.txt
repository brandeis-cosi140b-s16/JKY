This place use to formerly be a KFC. I walked in and it looked very clean, because my husband had been here before I went on his recommendation of the picadillo burrito which was a ground beef bean and potato burrito and it was good and I had a sangria soda. I kept it simple with my choice since i have had some bad experiences with mexican food. Everyone here was nice especially the guy at the register who was helpful with the descriptions of the menu items. I will be back and I recommend it if you like mexican food.
