We have had decent experiences at this particular Macayo's location. This time was not too shabby. We walked in and were being seated before all of our party was through the entrance. 

Shortly after sitting down, somebody came by to get our drink orders and drop off chips and salsa. Not long after he went to fulfill our drink order, the server stopped by to see if we needed drinks.

When it came time to order food, my father in law confused our server by asking if they had chili (he thinks Tex-Mex is served at all Mexican restaurants). She had a confused look and said they had green chiles that could be put on his food.

Our wait for food was just long enough for us to finish the first bowl of salsa on our half of the table. The food was good, decent flavor and hot.

While conversing over the meal, i had not kept an eye on my drink level. When turning to take a drink, there was a full soda sitting next to my half drank glass. Very nice to not go without beverages due to staff inadequacies. 

Looking at menus, comparing items, what they include and their prices, frustrates me. Some of the items are identical, with the exception of the sauce, which generates a $2.00 price difference?! This is baffling to me. I understand businesses are around to make money, and we pay to not have to cook and clean in our own homes. There are times, when charges get excessive.

The main reason for 3 stars instead of more was the price vs meal size. Granted, I can eat for days and still be hungry, but if I am going to spend over $10.00 a plate, I would at least like to feel like I've eaten $10.00 worth of food. Also, the location just seems... dingy. It was clean inside, well as clean as old carpet and booths can be. The overall feel of this restaurant is bordering on dive-y.

Macayo's on Tropicana near Maryland Parkway is well appointed, brighter feeling and more inviting to the diner.
