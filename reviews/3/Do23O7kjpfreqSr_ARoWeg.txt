I've been to Cabo Wabo twice & have enjoyed it both times. Is it overpriced? Yes, because it is mid-strip in a great location. The food is Tex-Mex & far from authentic, which is what I like about it. I'm more of a ground beef & cheese taco American taco girl than I am an onion & cilantro street taco girl. I think Cabo Wabo is more for the American taco lover. I had the chicken & carnitas fajitas, & they were good. The server was also good.  I was not disappointed. If you want a big bowl of cheese dip & a boisterous atmosphere, go here. If you want a glass of wine & a Porterhouse, keep on looking.
