This is our standby Mexican place - partially because it is close by but also because their salads and burrito's are top notch. 

Atmosphere is very bright here - it's the typical fast casual set up, but there is seating outside and both booths and tables. Service is very quick, assembly line style that quickly puts together your order.

While their "specialty" is torta's, Mexican-style sandwiches, we usually get their salads or burrito's. Why?
1. Excellent quality fillings - from the steak to the grilled veggies, everything here is cooked well and tastes great. Toppings are fresh and a cut above what you find at Salsarita's or Baja Fresh.
2. Whole wheat option - the tortlla's and salad bowls are available in whole wheat.
3. Affordable - they have both a frequent buyer card AND constant coupons in all the local papers.
4. Kid friendly - kids eat free nights, giant quesadilla's and free refills for the kids. Need I say more?
5. Locally owned - this is not a chain, so every dollar you spend stays in our community. Worth going just for this alone!

Overall we are fans!
