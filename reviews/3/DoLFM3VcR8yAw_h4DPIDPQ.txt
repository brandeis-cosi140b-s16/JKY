Decent food but any place with two $ signs and paper napkins I just can't get behind.  For that much money I want cloth.  Sorry.   

I did enjoy the mason jars and attentive bartender.  A little on the pricy side for what it is but overall it's a nice atmosphere.  Wish them the best of luck and I appreciate them being in downtown.
