My typical Robertos is off of Fort Apache and Tropicana, by where I used to work.  However, now I don't work there so I needed to find a Robertos by my house.  This is my first one and it is really not as good as my old Robertos.  I ordered the cheese enchilladas.  The beans were very dry and tasted powdery.  I had never eaten beans in all my years until I went to Roberts on Fort Apache,  The also were very stingy on the cheese topping, the guys at Ft. Apache load the beans with cheese. The rice at Gibson was actually good, but the enchillada was lacking in sauciness (not sure if thats a word). I will have to continue looking for a Roberto's like up on Ft. Apache.
