This place is a good average mexican food restaurant. I would say its comparible to Macyos. We did get something on there menu that I have not seen anywhere else . It was enchiladas with mashed potatos shredded beef and a really good sauce on it. I would get it again for sure  when ever i make it back . They get packed for lunch!!!
