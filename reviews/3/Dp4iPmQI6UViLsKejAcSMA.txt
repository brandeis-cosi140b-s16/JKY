This was my go to lunch spot years ago and we decided to pop in my last visit to Phoenix. The food is still really tasty, nothing fancy but good. Try the tropical apricot margarita-it's delicious, one of the best I've had! Just as their name says it's all about fajitas..steak, chicken, pork, veggies and more. Their portions are big and come with sour cream, cheese and salsa. Guac is extra which is a bummer. The only bad thing about the visit? Their queso was soupy which was kind of gross-thicker queso would've made it perfect. 

Overall, still a good experience and for their lunch prices, it can't be beat.
