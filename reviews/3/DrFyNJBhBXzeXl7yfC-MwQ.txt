I ate at Taberna last night for the first time.  I live down the street and used to love going to Roy's.  The first thing I noticed was the extended patio, I thought it was nice and spacious, but we decided to eat inside.  Once I got inside, nothing really caught my eye.  The Mexican culture is bright and vibrant and right off the bat, every decoration is subdued and muted.  

Drink were pretty awesome. My margarita could have been larger, but there was a good amount of tequila in it so I was good with that.  The person I was with ordered this mint and vodka drink and it was CHAMAZING!!  will definitely be getting that one next time.

The food could have been better.  I ordered the asado de queso to start and it was nice, the cheese was bland but along with the sauces and the cactus on top it was nice.  The chips were nice, Im a big fan of plantains.  The roasted pepper salsa was meh, the tomatillo salsa was nice, I think it had cilantro and mango in it.

For dinner I ordered the scallop and pork belly tacos and the person I was with ordered the carnitas.

My tacos apparently were given to someone else, so they brought me out the fish tacos and told me my actual tacos were on their way.  The fish tacos were actually very good. The slaw was actually just shaved veggies, they were kind of bitter but the flavor in general was good.

My Scallop and pork belly tacos came out and I dove right in.  Immediately, my glee towards this item change to sadness as I realized the fishiness of the scallop did not marry at all with the pork.  So I ate the scallops separately from the tacos. This changed everything and I enjoyed it.  The Carnitas were actually really good, but it was just weird that instead of coming shredded, it came as a huge fried chunk of pork.  It was tasty and the crispiness was nice.

I will have to go back and order different things next time.
