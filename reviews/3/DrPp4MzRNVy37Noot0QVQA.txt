The chips and salsa were okay. The chips seem more on the stale side but the salsa was excellent. Decently priced, our meals came our quickly and the ingredients were freshly cooked to a very hot temp. The restaurant has a neat atmosphere with a variety of bright colors. I would come here again for lunch or dinner.
