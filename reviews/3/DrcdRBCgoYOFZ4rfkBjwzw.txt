Decent Enough Burrito would be a more appropriate name for this place, but you can't blame taco-slingin' restaurateurs for aiming high. On the good side, they offer have slightly bland but passable interpretations of Mexican-inspired fast food. Little miniature tacos for a dollar is a fine deal, allowing you to sample a fine variety of meats in your meal, especially important since pastor is offered. And there's a little salsa bar too, which is a huge bonus for capsaicin junkies, as there's nothing worse than having to plead for an extra couple cups of sauce from stingy taco makers. Can metered doses of hot sauce really be cutting into profit margins? Maybe if the cups were a little bigger, I wouldn't need five of them. Anyhow, with salsa bar, go to town. Get reckless. 

It's not all smiles around here, however. The glory of a taco shop lies partially in its propensity to serve up your grub lickity split, but Super Burrito does not subscribe to this philosophy at all. Super Burrito took an astoundingly, amazingly long time. There was only one other customer in the restaurant too, which compounded our confusion. I felt forgotten and unloved, and if I had known about the wait, I would have brought a copy of Atlas Shrugged. Nonetheless, the food does the trick and its available around the clock, meaning you could do worse than Super Burrito.
