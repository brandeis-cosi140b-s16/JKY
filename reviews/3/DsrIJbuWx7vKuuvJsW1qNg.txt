Food was alright.  The fajitas plate was very large but kind of pricey.  The margahritas were good.  Many choices of drinks.  The service was decent, though it felt like we were forgotten about a few times.  Waiter forgot to bring out an appetizer that we really wanted to try.  Over all it was a good meal and we enjoyed.  The chips were very good so consider that as an appetizer as they are not free here.  Also the lighting makes it hard to read the menu.
