Figured I'd give this place a try as I live very close and the reviews were high. A more or less mediocre experience. I ordered tamales sat down, was then informed that they were out of tamales so I exchanged that for a green enchilada. After a while, they tried giving me red enchiladas and asked if I'd take that instead. I'd already accommodated them once and I figured that was enough so then I had to wait longer for my correct order. Eventually I got what I ordered which included a bowl of pozole which, to my disappointment, was served with a lime so dehydrated, I could've gotten more juice out of the skin. However, I will say that the food was good if not remarkable and the portion sizes were very generous in relation to the prices. But, in the end, nothing really stood out about this place in a good way and I can't recommend coming here when Anaya's is just down the road. If you want really good Mexican, just take the extra 3 minute drive there.
