We came here for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. The restaurant is located inside the Tuscany Suites & Casino. It has a very nice atmosphere and was an enjoyable place to have lunch. The staff was very friendly and seated us right away. Our waiter brought out nice warm tortilla chips along with a roasted chipotle salsa, and also warm bean dip. I started with a Cadillac margarita which was very good and pretty strong to get this party started.

We opted for the lunch specials which are available for $6.95. A very reasonable price, especially considering how BIG the entrees were. I got the entree that included a chimichanga, and a tamale both of which i got with shredded beef. the sauces were good and it came with sides of spanish rice and refried beans. My husband got the combo that had a soft taco and an enchilada which had seasoned ground beef.

Overall i would rate this Cantina about 3.5 stars. Good mexican food for a very cheap price if you get the lunch specials. Nice ambiance, and friendly staff.
