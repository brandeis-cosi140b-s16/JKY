Went there for a friends birthday. I ordered the bulgogi nachos/fries combo and fusion wings, my wife ordered the bulgogi burrito. The nachos was by far..... the best! Everything else was okay. The fusion wings seemed to have been tossed in a deep fryer (plain, no seasoning) and simply rolled in their special sauce... nothing special. The bulgogi burrito, just a normal burrito with korean beef.... again, nothing special. And the bulgogi fries.... just get the nachos instead. All in all, if you're expecting to be punched in the mouth with a whole bunch of "fusion" flavor, this is not the place for you. But if you simply want a decent affordable meal, komex is the place. Would I eat here again? Only for another birthday dinner or IF I were in the area.
