Oh man...was it an off day? 

2 carnitas sopes were not the best, not the worst either.  The sope itself was too thick, not tasty. I ate only the filling.

Burrito de pollo asado with the works ( guac, crema, queso) came wrapped in paper? The saving grace was they put it on the grill once wrapped.  

No horchata.  2 aguas de sand√≠a. .. mostly ice! 

Missing bay area taco joints. ....
