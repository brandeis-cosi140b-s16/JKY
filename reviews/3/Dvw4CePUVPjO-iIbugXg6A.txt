After my Sunny D Fast I got hungry. I headed over to the dumpster packed in neatly against the billiard joint and Red Wing Boot shop. Armando's is a dive. Food tasty. Armando's Breakfast Burrito: Egg, (scrambled) potatoes, cheese. Number #2 greasy soaked in taco oil. Beans are usually cooked, rice is edible. Drive thru takes around 10 minutes to get through the 3 cars in front of the window. Hardly any traffic. Different staff every night. Owner is never present. Shrimp is delicious on certain nights. Don't get fooled by the prices, they appear cheap, except when you order a "large" Horchata. The price raises to around 12 dollars.  Once you leave the side of the drive thru. Be careful because the main street is facing traffic. If you want to be safe, try driving cautiously around the opposite side where Pizza Hut is. 

Open all Night.
