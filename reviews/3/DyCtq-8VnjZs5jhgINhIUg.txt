Is it me or is Taqueria Guadalajara fun to say? It's easy to ride past this restaurant and say to yourself, "I wonder what that place is about?" or maybe not even notice it.  When you walk in, you know it's going to be good.  They bring pico, salsas and fresh limes out pronto. You get hot salsa without having to ask, that is a gold estrella from me.  Comfort food and great service.
