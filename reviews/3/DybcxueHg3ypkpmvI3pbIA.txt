We stopped by for dinner on Friday night and the place was packed. When we walked in the sitting area was full of people waiting. Since we decided to sit in the bar we were able to get a table right away. 
I am not sure if this was a good or a bad thing. Our drink order was taken fairly quickly and our chips and salsa arrived promptly. The chips were so-so and the salsa was unusual but we decided we liked it. I ordered a margarita which I did not think was very good.  It took a while for the waiter to make it back to take our order but that was nothing compared to the time it took for our food to come out. My husband ordered some type of casserole so maybe that took a little longer to cook or something but wow!  Once our food arrived I was a little disappointed to find out that my chile Rellano was wrapped in egg instead of fried but other than that it was ok. My hubby's casserole was also ok. Like the other reviewers the food is decent, not the best mexican food we have had. 
It also seemed like the more the place cleared out the better the service was. 
In all this was much better and cheaper then Arriba Grill down the road and we enjoyed the atmosphere. We will probably give it another try on a less crowded night.
