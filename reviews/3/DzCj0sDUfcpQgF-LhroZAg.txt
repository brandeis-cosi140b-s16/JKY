I was super excited to try this place as its close to my house and I love tacos. Hole in walls typically have bomb food that you dont want to tell anyone about so they dont go there and busy it up. I know selfish! I had super high hopes for this place and was terribly disappointed in the food. The service was amazing and outstanding, and was expecting the food to follow with amazingness. 

I had the 50/50 steak and chorizo taco first. That taco was literally cold and the chorizo was super salty. 

Then the baja fish taco-that one was really good but as I bit into the fried fish grease came out the other end of the taco. So of course the greasy taco was good, just too much grease?? 

The shrimp taco, was weird. It had no flavor what so ever. The major flavor in that taco was the cucumbers. Cucumbers! The shrimp had no seasonings or spicies, anything! 

I also ordered beans and I didnt get them with my order, and by the time I remembered I was just so disinterested in anything else I just left. But the most annoying thing was the soda machine, every single choice when you pushed on it to dispense the soda, the handle would stick and spray soda all over you. 

Maybe I came at the wrong day/time.. Cause the freshness was lacking. Chips were stale, salsa looked like it had been there for a while. And I am in no way shape or form picky, I love those side street taco stands. 

I am going to give it one more try and come during peak hours when they are constantly having to cook things up. I hope it is better next time, and I can update my review to give it 5 glorious stars.
