We've been eating at La Fonda since I was about 7 years old, and believe me, that was a long time ago!

Their food has always been pretty good, their chips freshly made and served hot most of the time and their servers frenquently have the kind of attitude of "Yeah honey what'll have?".

I am very pleased they are still in business after all of these years, and even expanding to new locations. But don't look to La Fonda if you're searching from true Mexican food. They are very good "Americanized" Mexican cuisine, but there is nothing here that will surprise you very much.

Don't get me wrong, I love this place, but let's be honest, it's very generic although it is done quite well. All of their options are tasty and plentiful. (The Nachos Grande are enough for 4 people easily.)

You'll like it I promise, they just wont be winning any awards for originality any time soon.
