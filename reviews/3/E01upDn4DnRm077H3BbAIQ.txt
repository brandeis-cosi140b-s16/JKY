To be fair all I had was a couple of beers waiting for a connecting flight.  The menu looked interesting and there were certainly many tequila varieties for sampling.  From what I've heard though the food leaves a bit to be desired.  I travel a fair bit so next time I'll try the food and get back to this one.
