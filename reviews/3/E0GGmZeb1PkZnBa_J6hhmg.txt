Cute decor and authentic setting. It seems like they are trying to be an upscale Mexican restaurant but the staff and setting don't agree. We ordered table side guacamole but never got it. Asked to have it removed from the bill and waiter made it out like he was doing us a huge favor to remove it. Food was pretty good, we had steak fajitas and tamales.
