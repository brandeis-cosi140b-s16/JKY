The manager was nice and people were happy to be making free DBacks tacos. It had a party - like atmosphere with happy customers and employees. Very clean and well kept. Good for a Taco  Bell.  I enjoy the somewhat healthier Fresco Tacos over the original.  I think the biggest difference is the lack of cheese and the addition of pico de gallo.
