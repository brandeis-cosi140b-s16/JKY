It doesn't pretend to be actual mexican food, but it is good for what it is. Big meals, cheap, served fast. I enjoyed the huge number of vegetarian options - practically everything on the menu can be made meatless if that's how you're rolling. I had tofu in my burrito, which turned out too mild compared to the loud flavors it was paired with. But filled me up, and I love any place the serves chick peas. (I know, I know. I just love them.) I tried some of the corn bread, and will say if you've never had real cornbread you'll like it. It tastes good, because its actually cake.
