When I visit my sister in the Phoenix area, she always wants me to pick up Mexican food for her and this place is very authentic and way above Taco Bell or Bakers or any of those places. The food is messy, but it has the real flavors and the prices are good. They have a drive thru and you can eat inside. I think there are two of them that I know of in the area.. and I think they may be connected with Alberto's (in Cali) which we all know has great Carne Asada Burritos!
