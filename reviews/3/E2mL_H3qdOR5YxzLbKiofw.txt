I've been on a enchilada-style veggie burro kick lately so I decided to try Some Burros before going to work last week.

That was a mistake. Not because I had a bad experience, but my meal put me into a sluggish food coma that was difficult to shake. The burrito was pretty good. I liked the whole pinto beans instead of refried beans that I'm used to. The enchilada sauce was on the bland side but the salsa helped that. The onions were overpowering, but the sharp cheddar cheese within and on top of the burrito was very good.

Bonus points for the clean restaurant and fast, friendly service.
