I had a good time at the depot cantina. It is a fun atmosphere and is a great place to grab some brews and food. I had some sampler platter which was extremely tasty! I like their tortilla chips and their salsa is pretty good. $2 Dos Equis all day every day and I am a fan of the dos. FYI, If you go here during a tempe event you can park but you have to pay $20 to do so, then they give you a ticket that you give to the waiter to get your $20 back. If you want some tasty mex food and alcohol this is probably the best spot to go in the tempe/mill area. Lot's of people watching and places to sit. I love the big margarita glasses and you get a discount on the tasty margs if you buy one and bring it back with you on your next visit.
