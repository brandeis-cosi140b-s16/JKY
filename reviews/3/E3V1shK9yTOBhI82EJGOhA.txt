Ordered the three sauce fajita burrito. It was actually really good and you can taste the 3 sauces it's smothered in. Very gooey cheesy texture in every bite, but not super gooey like yogurt. There's enough solidity that you've gotta bite the cheese to release all that wonderful flavor. 

Served with rice and beans, which were pretty standard. Nothing super special. Lime cilantro rice would've been amazing with the dish. 

Good atmosphere. Can be crazy crowded on some nights. But overall, it was a pleasant dining experience.
