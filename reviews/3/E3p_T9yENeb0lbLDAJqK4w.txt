Decent, filling food served fast. Last visit the volume of the music above the usual lunchtime din was so high as to compel me to eat outside on a 110 degree plus day. Today the music was bearable but there was so much smoke (grease?) in the air that customers were choking and coughing.  Bonus star for courteous highly efficient staff.
