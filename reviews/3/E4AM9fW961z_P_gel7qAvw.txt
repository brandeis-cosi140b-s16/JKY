The ultimate panacea for a hangover:
-THC
-H2O
-Burritos from El Norteno.

 Sunday I awoke with a headache that could reduce a lesser man to renouncing alcohol. Rather than do something so drastic and foolish, I opted to meander wearily down 7th ave to El Norteno. Riding my bike there in the already intolerable morning sunshine I fantasized about what I would order; savoury green chile pork, creamy pollo fundido, succulent machaca beef, mountains of delicious beans, gooey melted cheese, gallons of horchata. My goal was to be the fat and happy mexican version of Augustus Gloop, drowning myself in beans rice and horchata, while small guatemalan oompa loompas admonished me in song. Thick in the midst of daydream I nearly rode my bike into oncoming traffic on 7th ave. A wandering homeless man gave me a look that suggested "what the hell is this guys problem?", I shrugged my shoulders and waited at the cross walk. Staring expectantly at my destination, mouth agape, drooling, raving and mumbling, unaware of my surroundings, tortillas and tacos and tostadas danced around my head like little hallucinatory mariachis. The homeless guy I saw earlier managed to catch up to me at the cross walk, and again he stared dumbfounded, with the same look. I paid him no heed, I was so close to my goal, if only the light would turn!!
 Finally the punishment light turned and I rode across, once there, I realized there was no where I could safely lock my bike up, and in this area, I'd either lock it up, or end up walking home. I walked it a little up the street and found sound rod iron gates I could hook the u-lock around. I start walking back and I see the same homeless dude go inside ahead of me, I cursed my luck and followed him into the cramped little closet of an area inside where you place your order. The homeless guy,....lets call him Thurston, was third in line behind two portly Hispanic guys, assumedly father and son. I sat and sat cramped behind the three ahead of me. Thurston finally got his chance to place an order and opted for two! mexican pizza's. Again I cursed my luck, knowing how long it would take to actually get my food.
 After Thurston placed his order he stepped outside into the glaring sunshine. I got up, rubbed my hands together rapidly, and stepped up to the counter. I chose the pollo fundido plate and a carne asada cheese crisp with horchata, and after waiting eagerly my number was finally called. I grabbed my order, headed to the little eating area, and promplty blacked out, apparently over dosing on mexican food.
