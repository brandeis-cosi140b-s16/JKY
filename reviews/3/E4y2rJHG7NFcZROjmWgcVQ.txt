I love Chipotle...I always have. Today I grabbed a burrito to go and went back to my desk at work to eat it, when to my surprise...


...half-way through my burrito, I found a hair. I threw my burrito away immediately.     :(

Per my recollection, I've seen people at other Chipotle restaurants wearing hair nets...a policy that this location should probably adopt. Especially when the guy behind the counter puts enough grease in his hair that he could probably wring it out and use it for his next oil change.  

I will continue to go to Chipotle because normally I have really good experiences. I'll just consider this bad experience as an outlier.
