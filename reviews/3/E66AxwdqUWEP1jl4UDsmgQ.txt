Anybody who knows about El Charro knows that they close the restaurant whenever they want to.  It's kind of funny really, but you can never be too sure they will be open.  My 3 stars, however, is only about the food:  A-OK, decent Senoran, but nothing I ever crave.  Consequently, I don't find myself going there much.  A lot of people really like this place, but I think there is cheaper Senoran that is better.
