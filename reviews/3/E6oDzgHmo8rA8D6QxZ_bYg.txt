As mentioned previously, a family owned and operated food joint is always exciting to try! 

Scored an awesome Groupon and went on our marry way with a couple coworkers. We were roughly greeted by whom we later came to find out was the owner. He appeared to be friendly, in his nice minions t-shirt but when my coworker asked for the "pork bowl" instead of the "pig bowl" he snapped at her and in a very sassy tone said; "read the menu! What does it say?!?!" Oh, ops! "Sorry." "Pig Bowl."....yikes. 

Then, I asked for the "Huli Huli" and got ripped a new one for not specifying if I wanted tacos, burrito or bowl! :-/ at this point I'm scared to ask anything and afraid to present my Groupon. 

After surviving the ordering part, we proceeded to find a table. Clean establishment, I must add. Later; Mr. Minion t-shirt man came around asking how our food was and appeared to have a complete different attitude. (Yay to him!) Huli Huli Tacos were awesome and tasteful. Chicken was tender and flavorful! 

What was strange was his center pieces brochure thing where he offers "Free Guacamole & Chips" if you take a picture of your toes and post them on Facebook...Mr. Minion T-Shirt man confessed he has a toe fetish...Ummm...ok. Weird. 

But food was good! Yes- I would probably go back.
