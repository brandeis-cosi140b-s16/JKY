Ate here on Saturday.  The good news was that the service by Jon was off the chart good. The chips and salsa were great and my wife's carne asada tacos looked and tasted good.  The beans and rice were fine.  I got a carne asada chimichanga smothered in a cheese and spinach sauce.  The bad moment for me was when I was down to my last bite and I suddenly realized there had been way too much fat in my chimi.  So I tried to pull out the fat from my last bite by removing a suspect piece of meat, and when I took the last bite it was all fat and that grossed me out.  Technically my wife and I had the same ingredients, but in retrospect I realized that since you can't see what's in a chimi when it is smothered, they dumped in fat scraps, and that makes me mad.  It wasn't just a little fat, it was like every 2nd or 3rd bite was dominated by it.  Lame.  If do go back, I'll be sure to get meat that I can see.  Maybe that is why people always order fajitas at Mexican places.
