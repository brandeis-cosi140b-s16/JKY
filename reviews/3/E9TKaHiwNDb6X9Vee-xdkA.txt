So my fiancé just left from there. Let's just say he wasn't pleased with the service. There was a father and daughter in front of my fiancé and the "distributing line" accidentally grabbed my fiance's order and just started putting every topping on both our quesadilla and tacos. The "kids" working behind the counter then bagged it for the father and daughter. After explaining to the cashier that it wasn't his order my fiancé had to have them remake both the quesadilla and the tacos. Also the young lady who took my fiance's order was very rude! We LOVE Cafe Rio and come here all the time! Maybe it was just a bad day but regardless there needs to be a bit more communication between the workers. The food was very tasty as always though!!
