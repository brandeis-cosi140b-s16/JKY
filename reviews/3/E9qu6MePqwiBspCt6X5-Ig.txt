24 hrs drive thru.Taco shell was crispy and tasty, but chicken inside wasn't. Although the chicken was tender.  Tamale was a la carte, with enchilada sauce and cheese, no husk, served in a long Styrofoam container, placed in the bag and given through the window sideways so the sauce basically coated the whole bottom of the paper bag. the mais of it was good, and so was the sauce, but the meat inside was only a very small amount. you get what you paid for.  The guy at the window was polite and was easy to talk to.
