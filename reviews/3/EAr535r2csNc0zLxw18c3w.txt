This mom and pop Mexican restaurant serves authentic fare.  We each ordered huevos rancheros which came with chips & salsa, rice, refried beans and warm tortillas.  The owner also served us complimentary cups of their delicious consomme loco which is a fat free chicken rice soup spiked with cilantro.  Neither of us could do this bountiful meal justice.  Our bill fell short of the minimum purchase requirement on our gift certificate so we ordered a slice of flan to go.  Later the same day we shared the flan which we found to be tasty, but a bit too heavy.
