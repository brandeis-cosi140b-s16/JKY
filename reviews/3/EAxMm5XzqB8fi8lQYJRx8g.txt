I've never actually gone into this Filiberto's as the drive thru is more convenient for my lazy ass. I feel like my order always takes a long time to make. I usually get the pollo asado combo plate. I'm sure they go and kill the chickens and cook them as I'm impatiently waiting in my car starving. It's the price I pay for being lazy and only living 5 minutes away.

Red sauce is bomb.
