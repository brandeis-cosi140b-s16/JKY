Mexico sure is a long way from Wisconsin, and I walked into Abuleo's with a certain amount of resignation that it was probably going to be a bad meal.  Well, I got a pleasant surprise and Abuleo's gets a solid 3 stars because I really liked my food.  The dip trio is a combination of 2 warm dips (cheese and chili & cheese) and 1 chilled avocado dip.  For some reason, our group of 5 stuck the dips right in front of me with the idea that table would share, but I kept eating the dips during the entire meal because all 3 tasted great with chips.

I also got the fajita tacos with steak, and the meat was tender and flavorful.  It kind of doesn't matter whether or not mashed potatoes are a Mexican side dish - they were good!  My plate also came with a scoop of guacamole and lettuce & tomato that you almost eat like a salad.  The genius is in the details, though, and the cooks really had their thinking caps on when they did this.  Check it out: my flour tortillas and the warm steak filling would get cold fast if touching a cold plate.  So my soft tacos were sitting on top of a room temperature corn tostada, held in place by a small dab of beans on the plate.  The first time I had ever this, and yet so clever.

I didn't have room for dessert, but if I did, I would have gotten the chocolate explosion.  One person was hoping that it wouldn't come out on the receipt that way, since we have to submit copies of everything in order to get reimbursed, but sure enough it said "chocolate explosion."  She got her dessert to-go, and the next day we teased her and asked whether any chocolate explosion got on her hotel room walls or ceiling.  That question was met with silence.
