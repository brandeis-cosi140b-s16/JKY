WOW!!! That was a WHOLE LOTTA food for an ITTY BITTY price. 

After driving past this place a gazillion times, I decided to pick up some take out from them for dinner last night. 

There was nothing skimpy about the portions. We ordered super nachos, carne asada quesadillas, rolled tacos and a chimichanga...I am not sure what I was thinking when we ordered that much, but for $25 I think I must've had 'Taco Bell' portions somewhere in mind (usually the boy can put away about $20-25 of Taco Bell all by his lonesome). Um no. I'll have to remember that next time. We will definitely be back. I think the rolled tacos were my favorite.

And the customer service was also pretty cool. Everything we ordered looked very much like the picture on the menu...and you KNOW that's a rare treat nowadays. They even took the top off of my manzanita for me and gave us plenty of salsa and salsa verde!
