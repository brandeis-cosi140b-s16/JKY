Tried "Chiles en Nogada" and the enchiladas suizas last night. The Chiles dish was far more sweet than I ever could have imagined it to be. The enchiladas were quite plain, low on flavor, as they simply had sliced chicken breast inside and melted cheese on top. A  lack luster experience considering the $60 tab (that included one margarita...) We were a bit disappointed. Service was very attentive and friendly. A difficult place to review considering my prior expectations weren't met.
