Moes is an alternative to Chipotle- menu features tacos, burritos, salads, and quesadillas, with your choice of vegetarian/tofu, or various meats. The chicken salad sans the tortilla tends to be my preference. As a major plus, this spot allows you to customize your dish with several free toppings- they do charge for guac and queso,but give generous portions of both.

Service. There was only one lady working to assemble and ring up orders when I came in on a weekend. The line grew to six people before one of the guys watching from the kitchen finally came over to help. She apologized for the delay and let me know the guac was on the house for the inconvenience- which was appreciated. 

As for flavors? The salad is the only thing I've found satisfying, and that's with tons of added grilled veggies. The queso has the right consistency but no cheesy flavor, it's really bland. This spot will work in a pinch, but I won't go out of my way to return.

TIP: Check the LVWeekly for coupons. Sometimes it's a BOGO, other times it's a free drink. Free queso day is coming up 9/17!
