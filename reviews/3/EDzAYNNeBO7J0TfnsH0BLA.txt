My friends and I have been to this place twice. Once on Friday March 13 and Sunday March 15. Enjoyed the food and the service. We didn't enjoy being harassed by a bar Paton there, Doug, to the point of being poked, yelled at, and finally disgusted enough to leave. I'm disappointed that the person in charge didn't control this patron. I wonder how often this guy drives away others. We would of liked to make this a regular spot while we are here enjoying spring baseball but we will not be coming back if we do not feel that we can enjoy ourselves without being harassed.
