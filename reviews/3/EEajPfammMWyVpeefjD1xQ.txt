Glad to have one close to home. I have been to two other locations also the San tan location and the mesa location and have had way better customer service experiences. I've been to this location twice and both times there has been many dirty tables left even though they weren't so busy. The high chairs weren't too clean so it was difficult to find one for my daughter.  Like the food, but they need to work on a few details!
