Finally stopped by this place after a year of living right by it was actually way better than i thought it would( yes I judged) Lots of seating and the bar area has nice big comfy booths also. Service was very good and food came out quickly. They have a HUGE menu and not too expensive either. Everything was really good, we had a crap load of leftovers. Chips and salsa were also good as well :) Will have to go by for a second time to see if I can bump up my star rating. I'm just not a huge Mexican food fan so i am pretty hard to please in this area of food so go and try it out for yourself cause it def is not a bad place!
