Consider Calico's game stepped up. After quite some time of avoiding the place, I came back for a special event and was not disappointed. Upon entry, the dress code looked ridiculous (Really? No plain white T's? Why?), but there were no haters, bros, or thugs in there breathing down anyone's neck. It was acoustic night, and my friends and I had a roomy booth. Sure, there is still dancing, but there also seems to be more space than I remember. Great place to be social.

And in the restroom, I was pretty surprised by the attendant. This is by no means a fancy place, but that guy was really cool and had pretty much anything that would come in handy at a bar. Like your own assist for hire.

I also take back everything I said about the VIP/referral program they have. I totally get it now: Popular people like me will pay no cover and drink for cheap every time, and you newbies will be paying $5 at the door and significantly more for your domestics and wells. When I want to drink something of higher quality, the prices aren't that bad, but it sure does help getting discounts all the time for being in the know. And even better, you get the extra hookup if you bring tons of friends. Now, I can't give the four stars I want solely on the basis of discounts, but when it comes down to it, Calico Jack's has transformed into a place cool, young adults should give a try.

PS-I haven't had the food, but you already know that's not why you're here.
