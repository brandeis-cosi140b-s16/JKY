It's ok. I mean it's Mill. The place must be old but it's kind of dirty and the bathrooms smelled particularly bad my last visit. Sadly my cran-vodka and rum-coke were extremely watered down the last time I went. That's to say that I don't believe water was in my drink beside the ice but that the amount of alcohol was lessened considerably. The moscow mule I had was much better and the margaritas aren't bad. The big margarita glasses with mini cerveza bottles in them are an AZ novelty for sure. Servers were decent people. Door guys were on power trip.  Nothing outstanding.
