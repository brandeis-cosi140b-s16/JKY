Like some people have said, this is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant that seems to cater to native Spanish speakers. I'm big on places like that because they usually have pretty good food and provide a cozy, intimate dining experience.

At Taqueria Guadalajara, however, you really don't get that vibe. The place is pretty low end as far as restaurants go (in order to get to the back for additional seating you literally have to walk through the kitchen).

The prices are amazing. You could easily feed a family of 4 for $20 if you wanted. The cost of these low prices, however, is the quality of the food. I will give some bonus points for authentic ingredients and recipes, but the food was mediocre in general.

Overall, the price was right, but you get what you pay for in ambiance and food quality.
