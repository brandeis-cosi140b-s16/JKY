While any claim that the food is authentic (or good) may be overstated, I still consider it the best option in the food court. Don't expect any flavor and you won't be disappointed. 3 cups of "hot" salsa could not bring any bite to my burrito. If you want fried food, don't eat here- the tostadas are downright bad.
