we tried the chimichanga and the enchiladas here. they were both pretty good. the chimichanga was a little spicy but tasty. the chicken and shrimp enchiladas were very good.

the place itself is really nice as the outdoor seating is really pretty and has a mini pond. the inside is suppose to resemble Carlsbad Caverns Cave and is also nicely decorated but can be a little dark.

the parking lot is a litte small though.
