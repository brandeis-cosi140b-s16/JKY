Mahogany high-backs, salsas x 5, and cheap, nummy lunch deals. Yup, they bring you as many salsas, just for sitting down, as there are A's in Guadalajara.

What it isn't: high-quality ingredients. What it is: almost free from Tex-Mex super-flavorful Taqueria that also does Tortas, Chilaquiles, Chile Rellenos, etc. There were Fajitas, so that's the almost. I had slighty-angry belly later that day, which is the no-high-qual.

There's so much good food lining this road that the small lunch crowd we were part of made sense, I guess. Still, the flavors are solid, Chilaqulies done right - crisp but soaked (and part of a combo so I could have an enchilada or Relleno too!! first for me!), fried egg on the side. They drew a smiley face with Crema on 'em for me. 

I like you guys too.
