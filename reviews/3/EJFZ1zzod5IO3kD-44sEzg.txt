Just finished eating. Have to say the food was good. Liked what I had. Didn't like that they nickel and dime you for extra bean dip. And the service was horrible. Never picked up the empty dip containers. And nobody in our party got refills. Guess they are trying to nickel and dime us there too. Gave three stars just for the food.
