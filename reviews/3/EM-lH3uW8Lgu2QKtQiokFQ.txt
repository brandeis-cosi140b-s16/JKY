This place is brand new opening up a day or so ago. As stated before, they took over where Qdoba was inbetween Starbucks and Thai Basil. I killed off my chai tea and since it was about 10am and this place opens at 10, I figured I'd grab a bite to eat. They just got done placing all the food out and it pretty much seems like Chipotle but everything else but burritos. 

They told me to pick what I wanted and that pricing on the board was for 3 tacos. I asked them if I could have different proteins on each taco and they stated that it was fine. I picked Abobo steak, Spicy Korean Chicken BBQ and Teriyaki Chicken. I got about everything on all three though most people probably wouldn't. I put white rice on it, black beans, quacamole, corn, pico de gallo, and the spiciest salsa they have. It tasted fine to me. I really liked the Abobo steak and Korean BBQ Chicken. After two tacos, I was pretty full. I think the chai tea I had right before compounded. 

I thought it was a little expensive for what it was...coming out to little less than $12 for three fat tacos and a large drink. Probably would've been sub-$10 if I didn't get the large soda. I did like the soda machine they had. One of the new ones that have single spout but have a touch screen so you can pick from like 20 different flavors. They were out of the Vanilla Coke I wanted. 

There's plenty of seating inside and out with misters outside. There's wifi from next door Starbucks. Parking is plenty and there's places for hipsters to park their bikes. 

All in all, not bad to try if you're in the mood for tacos and nearby.
