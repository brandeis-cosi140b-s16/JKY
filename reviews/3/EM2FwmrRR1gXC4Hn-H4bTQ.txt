I'd give them 5 stars because I really dig the burgers, but the greasy floors are bad. Last two times I went in there, the floor was way too slippery and you can tell it's because they are using a greasy mop in the dining area. A little skill with a mop goes a long way. Figure it out please, I wanna come back but it's kinda gross. Here's a tip. Have two mops. Use one in the kitchen and the other one in the dining area. Don't use the same water. Bam, problem solved.

I came back and got a burger last week and the floors were better.  -JC 6/12/2015
