Stopped by here around midnight on a Monday night so not much was going on.Tried to order a chimichanga, and a friend tried to order a shrimp fat taco, and we were both told they couldn't be made after 10pm. Settled with a pastor burrito which was okay. Service was friendly and fast, but I probably wouldn't try this place again unless a friend wanted to go
