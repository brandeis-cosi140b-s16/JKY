Decent pricing, particularly on the specials: $5 will get you a breakfast burrito with chorizo and egg, while just over $6 will get you a plate with two huge lengua tacos. Not bad at all!

Salsa bar has several fresh options as well as carrots, onions, and cucumbers. Bottled traditional sodas are available in a cooler by the register. Service may or may not speak even basic English, which is a little alarming- "Add cheese, please" should not require you grabbing the cook to translate.
