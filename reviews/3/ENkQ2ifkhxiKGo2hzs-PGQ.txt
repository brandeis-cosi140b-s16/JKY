Yummy chips and salsa, so-so fancy tacos.  

Our group tried the Eggplant, Arctic Char, Tuna, Steak, Braised Chicken, and Chorizo.  The eggplant was weird-little cubes of fried eggplant, I couldn't even really tell it was eggplant, it had more of a dogfood-like appearance, but the saucy was pretty good and together it tasted alright.  The arctic char and tuna were pretty good-I couldn't really taste the bacon and aioli on the artic char though, the fish taste was pretty overpowering.  The other tacos were all good, just not really notable.  It was a great place to go for something different, but I wasn't blown away by the taste and presentation of the food.
