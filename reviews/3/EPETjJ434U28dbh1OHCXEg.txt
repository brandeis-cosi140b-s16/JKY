Arrived late on a Friday night and had no wait time. Staff was very friendly and food was good. I had the Hawaiian quesadilla and would get it again for sure!  Probably not going to be added to my favorite Mexican places, but definitely doable.  Reasonsably priced and great service with an extensive menu with many mix and match options!  Check it out!
