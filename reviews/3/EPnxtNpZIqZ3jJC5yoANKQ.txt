Came here for dinner. The inside was clean but they seem to have a few kinks to work out. One of the employees brought a menu and explained some of the food. The soda fountain wasn't working and I wasn't going to pay $1.25 for a bottle of water so the food was packed for take out instead of eating inside. The woman who took the order said they were having some issues getting the man out to hook up the machine. She also said they had a lot of delays in even opening at all. She seemed nice enough and appeared to mean well. Like I said they just have some kinks to work out.

My wife purchased a yelp deal... $10 for $20 and even though they changed the deal to $5 for $10, they honored what was purchased. The tortillas here are weird. The texture and taste remind me of the shell they use on Gorditas at Taco Bell. It wasn't dry or anything but I didn't care for it. I like a more traditional tortilla. The quesadilla wasn't very good. It was a tad overcooked and the cheese was funky. The rice has a good taste... kind of like they maybe cooked it with chicken stock? It was good. The beans had a good flavor but not in the bean and cheese burrito. I think it goes back to the tortillas here I'm not find of. I had a sizzle taco and really liked it. It was different and the taco shell was great. We shared a big white fluffy sweet thing for dessert. The name I don't remember but it was damn good. It reminded me of something I would eat at a carnival or some sort of fry bread. I wouldn't drive far to eat here but when in the neighborhood I would stop by for sizzle tacos.
