Rubios is right on the corner near the theater. They have been there since the complex opened and have always done well. Then place is lean and the staff efficient. 

The food is average but good. 

Today I had 2 Fish tacos beans and chips. 
The tacos were OK the fish was just a little on the soft mushy side but not bad enough to no eat. The flavors are all great with the cabbage and the Baja sauce. 
The beans are refried with a heavy pepper taste (my kid won't eat em) with a little sprinkle of cojita cheese. I like the beans. 
Chips are thicker and small but are a nice add on to the meal. 

The price was good something like $5.75 or something with only water to drink.
