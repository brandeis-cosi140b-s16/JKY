We didn't make it for happy hour but we did enjoy the yelp offer when you check in. Buy one get one free drink! Well by the name of this place you can already guess that it is pretty dark and sinister. It reminded me of a scene from the movie "From Dusk til dawn". We found out that on weekends there is a cover charge to go on the rooftop as it turns into a nightclub with a live band or dj.

I am glad we decided to give this place a try after walking on the strip. It was not that busy for Friday night, we got a table as soon as we walked in. As soon as you sit they bring out chips and salsa which as very good and not too spicy.
We ordered steak nachos with an extra side of pico de gallo. The nachos came with guacamole, cheese, beans and steak. The food was good and it was more than enough for 2 people. We were unable to actually finish it and ended up getting a to go box. Our total bill was about $30 for both of us which was quite expensive but what do you expect when you dine on the Strip?
I would say what made it worth for me was the Yelp offer because we ended up getting one free drink. 

In conclusion, this place is for tourists and you can tell by the price. My experience was not bad, the waitress was nice and the food was good..just a bit pricey.
