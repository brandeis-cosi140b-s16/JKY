This is one of the newer restaurants in the Mandalay Bay.   I guess you could call it upscale Mexican cuisine.    We started of with some cocktails, I had a margarita and my wife had a black cherry mojito, both were great.   We also got the queso fundido, which is like mexican fondue with chorizo, and it was delicious.   Had we only come in for drinks and apps I would probably be giving 5 stars.  But we stayed and ate dinner.

On the servers advice, I had the smoked beef taquitos, they were okay, but they certainly were not $23 taquitos.   My wife ordered the fish tacos with crispy fish, they brought it with grilled fish, no biggie as my wife likes both.  This grilled fish however, was very bland.  You could taste char and little else.  The fish wasn't necessarily burnt, just flavorless so the little char that was there from the grill marks was overwhelming.  We asked for some extra hot salsa and it never showed up. 

$140 later, we realized that we should have stuck to drinks and apps.
