How many times can you claim to have had a decent meal in an airport?? Having flown through Phoenix Sky Harbor numerous times in the last month I've found myself strangely drawn to El Bravo. When your other choices are Wendy's and some random Chinese place its easy to see why. 

My chicken burrito, which I enjoyed many hours later, 30,000 feet high somewhere over Chicago was surprisingly good. Granted I'm starving, on a plane, and anything sounds good at this point, but I found the burrito to be filling and have pretty fresh flavors.


If you find yourself starving and stuck in Phoenix Sky Harbor its not a bad choice..
