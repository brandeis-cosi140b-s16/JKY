Went here with a group of about 6 ladies for breakfast on Sat. morning. We were all excited to try it. When I walked in at about 930 it was almost completely empty, It was not because it was early because at around 11 when we left it was still just as empty!

Anyway, the service was kind of weird from the start. The waitress was attentive but also the bartender. Then there were 2 other waitresses that were kind of drifting around . Unfortunately, for all those servers and lack of guests the service was not attentive at all. At one point I had to get up and go to the bar to ask our waitress for a side of toast. You would think for a group of 6 they would check up a little more. 

I got the classic chicken and waffle. I liked it a lot. For me, the food was the best part of the experience (besides the company). The other ladies with me were not so impressed. My one friend got the protein waffle and that looked good..

Overall, this place is going for too many identities. Brunch? Chicken and waffles? day bar with a cool patio? Nighttime scene? 

I might go back because I liked the fried chicken but we shall see.
