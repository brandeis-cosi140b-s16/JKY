Bam!  This place really pops.  Either that or no other place was opened that night.  Definitely, not my cup of tea any more.  Everyone here was so young and I felt so old haha.  Granted, I think if you just wanted a few drinks with the guys, this is a great spot.  Drinks are cheap and the music is bumping.  The music isn't bad; then again I was really listening.  I was busy playing the games in the back room.  Pool tables, extra large jenga, connect 4, and bean bag throwing (which I sucked) come and bring your A game!  I wouldn't say this would be a great pickup bar as some signs suggest, but if you're a gal pal then by all means. - enjoy!
