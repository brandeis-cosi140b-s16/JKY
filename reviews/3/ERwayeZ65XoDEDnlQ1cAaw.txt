Wedge is a want to be high end restaurant but really not much more than an El Toro with more eclectic menu options. The Tacos I had were good but the pickled veggies were actually frozen when they brought them out. Also, the margaritas are average. A place that advertises themselves as a Tequila Bar, in my mind, should have drinks and cocktails that are unique and try to blow you away, that didn't happen for me.
