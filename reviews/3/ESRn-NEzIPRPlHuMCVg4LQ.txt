First. How many damn doors is there to enter into this place? I saw people standing at one side, I saw a couple more on the other side. But I was closer to another so went in there, praying the door was unlocked the whole time walking up. I stood there for a few minutes waiting to be seated. Well waiting, I noticed that it was different levels, not just one main floor. Bar was in the middle seperated. Seating was up and down for people who didn't want to sit on the bar. Good to know since my mom would have difficulty with any stairs.

Next to the bathroom there are those free nieghborhood weekly papers, so I grabbed some of those.

When the girl finally appeared and seated me chips and two salsa's showed up fairly quickly. The chunky salsa was too salty for me. And the smaller salsa was pretty good. By mixing both actually improved it.

I ordered the pollo fundido. My favorite part? The sides of cheese that were "burnt". Not sure if they threw the plate in the oven for awhile after palting it, but the crunchy part of the cheese was delicous, with the jalapeno cream cheese -yum! It was filled with chicken and not bad. You had the choice of black beans or refried with spanish rice. I got the refried since I already knew I was only going to eat a bite or two. The spanish rice had been sitting all day. You can tell because it was clumpy - yuck!

The waitor was attentive and courteous. The meal was about $13.00 bucks.
