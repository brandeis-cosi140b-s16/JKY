I don't love it, but I don't hate it. Black Chile is nice for its location (in the Biltmore), and is one of the only mexican restaurants I can think of in the Arcadia area. My only gripe is that I go when I'm craving traditional Mexican food, and that isn't exactly what their menu looks like. However, everything I have ever ordered there has left me satisfied and usually with leftovers.
