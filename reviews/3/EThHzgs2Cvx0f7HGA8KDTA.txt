I stopped in for dinner tonight.  I could find the place because it was still light.  When people say it's a small place, they aren't wrong.  I counted 14 tables - 6 booths each seating up to 4, 7 tables each seating up to 4, and one table seating 2.  

I had the pork chili verde with beans and rice and corn tortillas.  Standard chips and salsa--the salsa having some great zing to it!  The chili verde was good.  I used a fair amount of Tapatio to give the cili verde some zest.

For dessert, I had some flan which was a great custard with caramel sauce that was quite tasty.

This place was OK, but it wouldn't be my first go to place when I wanted some Mexican food.
