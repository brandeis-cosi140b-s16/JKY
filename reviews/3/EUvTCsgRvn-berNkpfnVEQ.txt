It's been a few years since I've eaten at Don Jose. I use to stop by fairly regularly due to convenience and due to the nice folks there, but I was never passionate about the food. I was in the area today and was curious if a change in ownership had materially changed the restaurant.

The good news for fans of Don Jose is that the restaurant continues to have a very positive vibe. The servers are amazingly attentive, refilling drinks, replenishing chips... before you have a chance to realize you're in need. My server was surprised when I needed a moment to look at the menu, a reflection, I think, of the number of regulars the establishment attracts.

Unfortunately, the food still seems uninspired to me. I like Mexican food that is hot and spicy. I want to have to wipe the sweat off my brow when I've finished my meal. Don Jose has never been such a restaurant. On this visit, I single handedly consumed more than one mini pitcher of their "hot" sauce. It's a fine sauce, a nice complement for the chips, but it could definitely carry a little more heat for my taste. Since no complimentary mild salsa is served, I suspect more heat in the sauce is not a practical expectation. My feelings are the same regarding the enchilada sauce. Fine, but bland.

Ending on a positive note, I do plan to return. Don Jose is not a destination restaurant for me, although I always appreciate creative use of a former IHOP location. The people who work here are amazingly efficient and just plain nice, strong reasons for a return visit. I can understand why some long-time customers have a real sentimental attachment to this place.
