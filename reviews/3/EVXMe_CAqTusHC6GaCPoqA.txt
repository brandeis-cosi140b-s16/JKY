I tried the chiles rellenos again and the covering and sauces were both normal this time.  Since chiles rellenos are my favorite, and they've learned how to make them right in the past 7 months, they get an extra star.  However, they jacked up the prices and 2 chiles rellenos with rice and beans now costs an absurd $14.50.  The food's good but entirely too expensive.
