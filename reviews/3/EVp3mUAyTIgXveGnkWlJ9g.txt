This joint serves simple and solid fare.  With that said, it's not something I'd go out of my way for.  The enchilada-style carne asada burrito was fresh and authentic, however the beef lacked flavor and was cooked a bit tough.  The horchata is some of the best I've had in Phoenix.  I'll have to go back and try the sit-down experience for a more complete review.
