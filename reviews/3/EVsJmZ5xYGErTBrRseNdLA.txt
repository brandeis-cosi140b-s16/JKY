This place is really good for breakfast, decent (but not great) for lunch/dinner. I really love their machaca & eggs, chiliquiles, and omlette, but I think all their breakfast offerings are pretty tasty. Service is usually quick and friendly, although sometimes you order at the counter and sometimes you get a waitress. Lunch offerings are what you would expect for any generic strip mall Mexican restaurant in the Valley. Although I've never exactly been blown away with meals here, I guess you've gotta give credit to a place thats managed to survive so long amidst the hulking carcass that is MetroCenter. So maybe it's worth a visit if you're in the area.
