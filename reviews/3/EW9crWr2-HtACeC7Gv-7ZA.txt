So we hit up Yolos since we were staying at Planet Hollywood and it had some pretty good Yelp reviews.  

It sits off to the side of the casino floor and the bar seemed to be the place to be!  The restaurant was empty on the other hand.  When we stopped in before the Donny Clay show there were a lot of empty tables and a lot of dirty plates and napkins on them.  I don't know if they were short handed or what, but even though they had 20+ open tables we had to wait for the hostess to clean one up for us.  The plus was she let us pick the table we wanted so we got a nice spot to people watch.  

Service was attentive - almost overly so - we had a waiter who came by every 3 minutes to see if we needed anything else.  After awhile it was like yeah - a moment to ourselves!!!  That aside the food was good.  I had the street tacos and they were tasty.  The house margarita was huge and had a nice kick.  

It was a good spot, but doubt I would be back.  Been there, one that.
