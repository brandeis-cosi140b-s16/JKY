I usually meet a girlfriend for lunch at 1900 about once a month.  A regular meal that includes cheese dip is required to keep me running.

Located in the Park Selwyn Shopping Center, this place is always hopping during lunch time.  I order the same thing every time cheese dip ($4.50) followed by the lunch special of beef chimichangas ($6.50) served with rice/beans and some sour cream (mmmmm dairy).  The chips served at the beginning of the meal are always hot and fresh, served with a salsa that is a little too heavy on the cilantro for me (I am not a fan of cilantro), but request some of the corn salsa - it is YUM - fresh tasting and a great start to your meal.  The cheese dip is a little thinner than at most Mexican restaurants, but it thickens as it sits and is delicious - very creamy with a slight kick to it, but nothing that will light your tongue on fire.  You get 2 small chimichangas with your lunch meal that are fried, but not to a fast-food heavy crunch, these are lightly fried, so slightly crispy without being rock hard.  They are covered in a cheese sauce and served with refried beans and Spanish rice.  I clean my plate every time - delicious!

There are TV's around the bar area, which are usually playing soccer or ESPN when we go.  Comfortable seating in booths or at tables.  Service is fast and friendly and the food has been consistently good.
