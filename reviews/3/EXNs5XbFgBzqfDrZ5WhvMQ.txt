I have been here twice. My first time here was great. I sat outside and the atmosphere was awesome. The service is good and the portions are large. I love the Margheritas and the guac is very tasty.  The old town tacos are amazing. However, the second time I dined here I ate inside and  the atmosphere was dark and crowded. The tables were too small and the space is cramped. I would go back here in the summer when the weather is nice because the experience is completely different when you can sit outside. It was like going to two different restaurants depending on the weather.
