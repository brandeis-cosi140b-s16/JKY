Japan burritos. Imagine a big roll- the size of a burrito. Now come here and eat it. That is what they serve here. Only burritos.. like Chipotle, except these burritos you're starting off by choosing what type of seaweed for your jaburrito, then you select ...the innerds. Like shrimp tempura, crab, lots of fresh dead fish, maybe cucumber.. You can order a drink and sides. And I think they had ice cream mochi.

I love sushi, I love hand rolls, but I don't love jaburritos. Nothing wrong with them, but 1 hand roll is usually plenty. If you could eat 2-3 hand rolls this place would be great for a fast lunch that isn't fast food. 

Lots of people when I went, so it must be doing something right.
