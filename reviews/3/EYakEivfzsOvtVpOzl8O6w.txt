So I decided to go for lunch instead of dinner because some places are better at one than the other. I will say that it was better but I would stoll only give it 3.5 overall. 

I had a chicken buritto. I will give them a solid 5 for there homeade tortillas byt the meat and veggies are just ok and lack seasoning to me.
