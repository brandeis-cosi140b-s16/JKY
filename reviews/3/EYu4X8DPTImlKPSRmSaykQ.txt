Eh, the food is okay.  I really like their carnitas and their cilantro lime rice.  The black beans were pretty damn flavorless though.  I think for what you get it's a bit too pricey.  About a buck and a half too much in fact.

And for God's sake, why the hell does every Chipotle have to be so deafening??  Did the architect that designed Chipotle not consider acoustics when they designed the place?  

My lunch was fine when I started eating at 11 AM, but by the time I was leaving and the lunch crowd had filtered in, the din of noise was like being verbally assaulted while underneath a tin pail in a hail storm.  There are no noise baffles anywhere and the corrugated tin walls and booths and concrete floors make the place uncomfortably loud.    This is not the first time I have noticed this in a Chipotle location either.  They are all like this. 

Decent, if over-priced, food in an awful setting.
