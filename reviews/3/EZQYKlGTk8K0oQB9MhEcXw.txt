I've heard of this place before and decided to give it a try. I've been partying hard since Friday when I arrived to the city of sin. I came here for happy hour which is from 4 to 7. They offer margaritas and beers at happy hour prices. Half off appetizers.

The food was decent. Nothing particularly special. Our server Christian was really sweet and attentive so its hard to give this place a lower rating. I would come back again for happy hour but I don't know if I would gladly pay for their food at regular cost.
