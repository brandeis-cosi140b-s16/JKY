This is a fast food Mexican chain similar to Chipotle or Cafe Rio. The pork burrito ($5.41) I tried had a sweet taste to it. Not as good as the pork burrito at Cafe Rio, but not bad. The size of it was comparable to those other places. It's a decent little fast food place, but if I had to choose among the three, my favorite would still be Cafe Rio.
