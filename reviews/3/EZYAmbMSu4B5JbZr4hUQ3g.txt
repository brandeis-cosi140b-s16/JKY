More Honduran than Mexican, forgive my categorization.

Lempira's menu is huge, HUGE, like Greek Diner scale with many typical Mexican delicacies (minus Mole), Chile Rellenos, Fajitas, Burritos, Burritos Suizas, etc. We went for pupusas but ended up with more - Boltanos, like an open-faced brekkie burrito, cheese, eggs, beans, avocado. Some sort of empanada wrapped entirely in plantain and deep fried, filled with some sort of rice pudding. Deserty. But delicious.

It can be a struggle to eat here if a) you don't speak a lot of spanish and b) if you're vegetarian, but both of those apply to me and I left very, very full. As we were poking at our various foods, enormous Platos Typicos were steadily streaming out of the kitchen, all large and enticing. Veggies will stick more to breakfast, empanadas, pupusas, and burritos. Be emphatic - some menu descriptions forget to mention ham, etc.

Ask for the spicy salsa when you sit, as their gringo Red is mucho boring. They also do Botela Coke - enough for two to share. 6 dollar lunch specials daily. Breakfast combos served all day long. Lots of wood and curved doorways. Neato.
