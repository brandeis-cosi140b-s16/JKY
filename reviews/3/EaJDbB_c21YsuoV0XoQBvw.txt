One of the selling points for Mexican food is that it is cheap and flavorful. Habanero's was only one of these. From a place named after one of the spicier peppers, one would expect more heat and flavor, but both were lacking. 

I ordered a burrito and filled it with chile pork (I think that's what they said it was. I just pointed.), rice, black beans, bell peppers and onions, cilantro, onion, corn salsa, pico, cheese, and those spicy onions (note: the onions were mildly spicy at best). I also got some of their horchata, which was a little on the watery side for me. Things to note: the rice is just plain white rice, no spanish or cilantro rice here. Also, if you are looking for spice you probably want to try the hot or extra hot salsa. The one marked as "medium" did not have a bite at all. 

As others have said, the ordering process is Chipotle style: you choose what style of plate you want - burrito, tacos, tortas, quesadilla, etc. Then you pick your meat and toppings. The guys behind the counter were really friendly and nice, and I would give the service 5 stars. But the food is a 3.5: just A-OK. I would be open to going back and trying something else.

Habanero's is located on the end of a row of stores that sell things like flooring. Pretty easy to miss if you're not looking for it.
