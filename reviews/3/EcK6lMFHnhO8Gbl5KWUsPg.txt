I had high hopes for CDS based on some recommendations.  But I found it to be pretty mediocre, and the service sucked.  There was plenty of staff, but our waitress seemed like this was her first table on her first day and she had no help.  Other times people would come over and clear 2 plates and leave an empty beer glass.  Just weird.  The food had good taste - maybe one step up from Pedro's, but it's very much the commercial mainstream mexican food that you would find at a chain restaurant.  That, coupled with staff that seemed to be pretty confused, and I'll pass.  There are some great small restaurants in Madison that serve much better food.
