Que Onda Guero? 
By The Rue

Chimichanga wasn't from the gutter,
But I should have eaten peanut butter,
The food didn't make me bust a nutter,
I'll bet you like to drink Coors Cutter.

I will say though the service was great,
I'm pretty sure my waiter's name wasn't Kate,
Why is everyone so full of hate?
I think this weekend I'll go skate.

The chips and salsa were unimpressive,
The lunch prices were a bit excessive,
When making out I'm not real aggressive,
And I don't get jealous or possessive.

This place is popular with the older crowd,
Lots of senior citizens speaking loud,
Come in at happy hour and get yourself plowed,
Go home with someone well endowed.

Another thing I liked was their ice tea,
I'm a fan of taking road trips to sightsee,
Years ago I sported a goatee, 
Boost your immune system with vitamin C. 

TOSTADA!!!
