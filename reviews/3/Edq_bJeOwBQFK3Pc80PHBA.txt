First time at Los Favritos for lunch today. Arrived at 3:00 PM on a Saturday and had the place to ourselves. There was WWF on tv, not exactly a digestive fit but whatever. 

My wife and I each ordered the #5 combo: two shredded beef tacos. They come with beans and rice. 

The beans were awful, right out of a can with zero flavor. I'll skip those next time. The rice was okay. 

My wife enjoyed her tacos but mine were very, very oily. It wasn't beef juice, it was oil from frying the shells. I had a size able pool of oil on my plate which killed my appetite. I also wish they had better liquid offerings. 

These guys are trying to upstage Filiberto's but will need to try a lot harder. Not even close. 

I had the burrito at another Favritos years ago and it was very good so I'll go that route next time I visit.
