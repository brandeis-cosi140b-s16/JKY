Good Mexican food is hard to find unless you are in border lands like San Diego or Texas.  Macayo is not quite there although they do a good job for Vegas.

This isn't the cleanest establishment and I have had to send back a glass or two due to lettuce or sauce on the rim of the glass.  The staff is friendly enough and replace the glass right away.  They have a varied menu from burritos, to tacos, enchiladas, and chimichangas.  The chimi's are very good.

They have a great salsa for dipping chips but the chips are sometimes stale tasting.  

I enjoy their faitas and they have great lunch specials.  The tortillas have the same problem as the chips as they sometimes taste stale.  Still, overall Macayo has the potential to come close to the Southern California restaurant level.  And as I said their lunch specials make this location a favorite of local attorneys and businesspersons.
