I tried Cabo Fish Taco again, and I really wasn't impressed. I got the veggie burrito, and it was just bland and unexciting. My boyfriend got the cabo fish tacos and was pretty disappointed, especially since this dish is the restaurant's namesake. I wish I liked the corn salsa and chips they give you as an appetizer, but the spices of the salsa are just really off and it tastes gross.
