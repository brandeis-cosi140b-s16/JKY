Ok - so this place is a little bit of a hidden gem.  It is open until 3am every night, except for Friday and Saturday night when it is open until 4am.  You read that right!

The margaritas are tasty, decently priced but nothing special.  I had a taco, tostada, and quesadilla.  The taco and tostada had steak in/on them.  The steak was tasty, fresh and hot.  The topping were fresh, nothing fancy.  Just the usual tomatoes, lettuce, onion, cilantro..etc... The food was flavorful but nothing new.  With a taco it is really difficult to reinvent the wheel.  

So if you are looking for authentic Mexican then head over.  The dining room is very sparse so first date place, skip it.  Been dating a few months?  Definitely.

You go here for the awesome hours, good tacos and decent margaritas.
