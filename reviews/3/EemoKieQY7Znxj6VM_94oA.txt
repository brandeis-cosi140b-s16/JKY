Service was very good and I would go back for the lounge area.  However I think the prices are a little high.  I appreciated the lite menu with calories listed and ordered off of that.  My lite dinner came with some delicious chilled sliced cantaloupe for the fruit side, but the salad was not very green.  The salad had big white hunks of iceberg lettuce that I did not care to eat.  My boyfriend got the chicken fundito and it was good.   I would come back to try again because the salsas and service were very good, and maybe the salad side with the lite menu choices will get better.
