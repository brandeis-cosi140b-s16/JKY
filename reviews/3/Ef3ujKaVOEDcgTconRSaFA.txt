Years ago, this was absolutely the worst Taco Bell in the City of Phoenix.  Over the years it really improved.  Recently, they remodeled.  I don't know if it's the new set up, but if you come in here, expect to wait.  The service is fine, nice people who do their job well.  It just takes so long to get your order.  I really think with the remodel, the emphasis was on drive through.  People who order in were an after thought. I make this comment based on more than one visit.  Wish they would have left it alone!  I liked the old building.
