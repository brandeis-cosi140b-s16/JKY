It was very expensive for lunch! Ouch. Especially for a mexican type place. Although, they started with bread and a tapenade. What??? That's not mexican right?? Anyway, the food was good although a bit too much. The kids quesadillas are so cute. Although I will not be going here again, it was a nice lunch and I don't regret it.
