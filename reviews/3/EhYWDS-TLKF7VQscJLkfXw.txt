I'm thinking more of a 3.5 for this place. Let's start with a negative, the parking is usually a nightmare. The narrow strip of parking spots doesn't accommodate everybody when it's a Friday night. I actually tried eating here this past Friday but we couldn't find a parking spot anywhere, so we left.

Luckily for them I've eaten here many times so I will return! The food is good, and all at a very reasonable cost. Queso dip is always a great way to start, along with the margaritas. Both always tasty and delightful! Strawberry frozen is my recommendation :) The food has usually been good for me and the waitstaff is always pretty quick with service. I usually get chicken quesadilla with queso cheese, yum! When I order take out, they always pack plenty of rice. If you're craving Mexican, this is a great place to go.
