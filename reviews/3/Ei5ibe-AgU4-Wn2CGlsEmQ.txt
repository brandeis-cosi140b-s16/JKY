I went for a late lunch, and Monday through Friday, they offer happy hour specials in the bar/lounge area, YAHOO! Best way to try out the dishes!  Half off certain items, mostly the appetizers.  

The bartender recommended the chicken and poblano cheese crisp.  So I decided to try it.  It was HUGE..so for $4.50, totally worth it..paying full price..I don't think I would.   It wasn't full of taste, the chicken was moist but lacked taste.  

You don't get a side of salsa or chips and salsa, actually for a side of salsa, $1.95.  The kicker was I had just ordered a soda, ummm $2.95 ..agua next time.  

I will go back for happy hour and try the nachos (half off for happy hour as well).  A co-worker had a chimi when he went and wasn't unhappy but nothing to rave about  plus it had a lot of sauce on it, and so it wasn't crispy as you would like one to be . So I would recommend Happy Hour with co-workers or friends first before going all out for dinner.
