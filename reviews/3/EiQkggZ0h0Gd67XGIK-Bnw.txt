We came here instead of waiting in the lines at the buffet or coffee shop.  Chips, salsa, and bean dip are standard.  The bean dip was a bit smoother a more moist than many places and it made it great for dipping.

I had the carnitas and my wife had the chicken ranchero.  Both are served with refried or charro beans and Mexican rice.  This is simple Tex/Mex food and they do it well.

Our server was very much on top of things.  When I asked for Cholula, he told me he'd bring me something.  He came from the kitchen with a cup of nicely hot salsa that is kept there and served if requested.  It could have been hotter, but it did the trick for my taste buds.

We've been here before and we'll be back.
