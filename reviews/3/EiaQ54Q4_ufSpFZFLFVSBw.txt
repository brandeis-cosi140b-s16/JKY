We met at this restaurant with our friends. It was half way for both. It was on a Sunday and very, very, very nosiy. But should have known as alot of people are out on Sunday after Church. Food was okay, nothing to write home about. My order was wrong, instead of the Taco I got a tamale. The tamale was sweet and to much masa, very little filling. Really could not tell what was in it. The Chili Relleno was good. not much breading wtih some fire in the chili. Rice and Beans were so, so. We were a party of five and tho I did not check with the rest, I did notice food left on the plates. Margarita was excellent. Will we go again. Of course. Can not judge a place by the first visit. Salsa needs work. I refer to it as "Gringo Salsa"
