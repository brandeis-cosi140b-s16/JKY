I usually only post reviews for five or one star places but I have to say I'm disappointed in this place and won't go back anymore. 

Tonight I brought my brother from out of town here because I was raving about it from my past times going. We got a different waiter than I am used to and I regret not asking to be seated under my favorite waiters section. My favorite waiter is Louis.

Our waiter hardly have any attention to us at all and we were waiting and waiting for someone to pay attention to us so we could get soft drink refills and chips,beans,salsa refills. I got so irritated that I walked all the way to the front where a manager was and said "Can we please get some service ?! I'm about ready to just leave!" He asked where we were and the hostess followed me back to my table and another manager got on the ball and asked if we needed anything and I said YES! Couldn't he see our drinks were low and we had no chips or salsa left? So we finally got our refills and he actually came by a few times after that and topped our drinks off. Our waiter never did. So when we left we never got any word from the manager apologizing or anything he just said on our way out something g along the lines of "Have a good day" so I'm shocked because our first experience there was complete opposite of this and they just convinced me not to come back. They don't deserve a 1 star cause if we had Louis I'm sure it would have been a different story and their food is decent so it gets a 3 now.
