I have to drop this place a star.... sad day. And it's not the food either.... I went here last night with a group of friends for karaoke and drinking. It was some of the worst karaoke I have ever experienced. First of all, it was deafeningly loud. I couldn't hear anyone talking over the ridiculous karaoke and sometimes (most times) that is made worse by the people singing. The main problem, though, was the guy who runs the karaoke was completely pompous and would sit there and sing songs while paying customers in the bar (like my table of 6) hadn't gotten to sing one in the hour we had been there. He obviously had people that he knew and would let them go repeatedly as we sat around and waited. He even started playing the wrong song for someone and when they complained he said 'uhh that's the number you put down' as if the customer was just so stupid for not just knowing all the karaoke CDs he had. Then he played the entire track with no one singing.... while we waited and he stuffed his face with chips.  It's just so lame.... the guy acted like he was the king sh**, but really he was just a jerk and turned off a lot of customers that may come to the bar on a saturday night. We didn't eat... but the food is still really good from my other visits here and they did give us some chips and salsa while we were drinking. The drinks were fine, priced appropriately, but I wouldn't go back here again for drinks. I still would come here for food... yum. Chicken fajita burrito fundido FTW!
