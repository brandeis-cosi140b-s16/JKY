3.5 stars. If you must do a chain Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, then Arriba is your place.   Don't bother with Macayo's, Ajo Al's, etc.  Sure it's not the best, but when you want full-service and don't want the uppity Barrio Cafe type of place or the counter-service La Tolteca type of place, Arriba is good for that.

The servers are always friendly, the atmosphere inside is more gawdy than its busted bright Vegas jumbotron on its exterior sign on Camelback -- but is to be expected -- and the chip/salsa stand thing is righteous.  We were in there and out of there for dinner last Thursday in under 40 minutes (a measly 10 minute wait for our food) and under $30.

While I sometimes order the White Sands Chimichanga adorned with a creamy white cheese sauce and a mini New Mexico state flag toothpick, the Pollo al Diablo is my favorite and features a grilled chicken breast covered with fiery Hatch chile and monterey jack cheese.  It's one of their more well known dishes and is not for novices.  I am not responsible for your indigestion or hyperventilations.  Just sayin.
