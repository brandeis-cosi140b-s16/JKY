The street tacos were excellent. I enjoyed the chicken, carne asada, and mahi mahi tacos. I ordered them a la carte so I didn't get the rice and beans on the side. My husband ordered some tacos with rice and beans and I noticed that the rice and beans looked very dry and a bit stale. I tried them and they definitely were not fresh. I looked over to the plates of others and the rice and beans looked the same. 

It is a shame that they serve the sides this way because the tacos were delicious.
