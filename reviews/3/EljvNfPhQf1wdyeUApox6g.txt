The food was good, but I had high expectations. This is one of those places that were really good, made a name for itself, and then sorta stopped caring...kind of like the waiter that is so often spoken of.  You know, the forgetful one that just doesn't seem to care too much.

The guac is no longer made at the table.  It was a bit bland. The tortillas chips were pretty tasty however.   Slow roasted pork, pazoles verde, fish tacos, sangria, and bloody marry were all good.  But no great.  

Given the quality of the food, I would say the prices are a bit too high.  

Glad to have tried it but will most likely never go back.  

I'd rather go to Gallo Blanco.  The food there, I think, is slightly better in quality and cheaper in price.
