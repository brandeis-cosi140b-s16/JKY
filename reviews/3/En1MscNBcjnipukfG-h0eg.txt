Eh, Chiptole is way better. I had somewhat avoided this place from the Charlotte airport and seeing it around Charlotte.

This location was "factory like" just like Chipotle, but something made me feel like it wasn't fresh and that it was contributing to obesity in America. Ugh, I don't know...just didn't love it.

This location seems legit, minus the tables are SUPER close to each other. This is the South, not NYC.
