I called in ahead of time to place a catering order for 10 people. I was promised that my order will be ready by the time I get there . I was 5 minutes late and to my surprise, they were not yet done with my order.  I had to wait an additional 20 minutes which of course made  me late for a meeting that I was bringing lunch at. So frustrated with their service.
