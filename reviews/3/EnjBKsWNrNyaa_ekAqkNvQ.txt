Most of the food consumed at a 'bertos is like bad sex.  It's cheap, dirty, and leaves you with a burning sensation the next day.

But fear not, gentle readers, I come bearing a message of hope. Not all 'bertos are created equal.

I used to live down the street from Poliberto's when it was Happy China Buffet, but never ventured into the dingy beige joint.  Then they went and added some electric yellow paint and garish red trim and for some reason it drew me in like a skeeter to a bug zapper.

There wasn't a drive-up here, only take out or dine-in, and the place was packed with my people.  Us poor unfortunates that work outside all day, covered in sweat, dirt, and godknowswhat.  So I figured it was a sign of some sort.  And I was right.  The carnitas were tender and crispy, the guacamole was flavorful and chunky and there were about five different types of salsa for me to measure the mettle of my taste buds against.

It's cheap as sin but doesn't leave me with that seedy, slightly used feeling the next morning.  Give it a whirl if you feel like your lard quotient for the week needs to be met.  It's a step up from Fili-B's fare.
