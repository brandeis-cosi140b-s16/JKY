Food is good for Americanized Mexican food. Would be comparable to Macayos without any of the decor. There really is no mexican feel to this place. Even 80/90s music playing. Bought a groupon so we saved some money to try it out. I got the veggie tacos and they were good. Guacamole was "eh". And husband had pollo fundido. Portions were good sized and prices average. It was fine for what we needed but pretty far from home and I wasn't "wowed" enough to return
