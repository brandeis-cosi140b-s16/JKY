What can I say about Panchos... its a buffet with lots of mediocre Mexican food. Upon first entering the strange multiple sectioned building with lots of loud colors on the walls, you must enter a cafeteria style line and pick what you would like. Here, you have all kinds of stuff to choose from: greasy chili rellenos (aka cheese sponges), several types of enchiladas, tamales, small chimichangas, flautas and taquitos, rice, beans, tacos, and tostadas. The cost is pretty reasonable for all the food you can get and if you like non authentic greasy Mexican food made with lots of trans fat, this might be an ok deal for you. Once seated, you can obtain more items from the buffet simply by raising a little flag at your table. I will admit, this might just be the best idea ever! You raise this flag and the waiters are standing at your table literally seconds later. If only all restaurants would get on board with this! All in all, Panchos is an alright spot for a large unhealthy meal. The service is always good thanks to the flag system and it actually seems like a fairly clean restaurant. Also, who can resist fresh hot sopapillas after your meal? I know I can't, which is why I reluctantly agree to go to Panchos when the hubby asks (he loves those cheese sponges).
