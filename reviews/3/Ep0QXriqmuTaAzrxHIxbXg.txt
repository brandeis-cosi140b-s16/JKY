Not too bad for the price. 

I ordered the cheese enchiladas and ended up with chicken, but didn't mind it. The chicken portion was decent, actually pretty generous compared to others, but the flavors were just okay. The steak and shrimp fajitas was cooked just right - tender not chewy. But I don't see myself coming here if I have craving for Mexican food. But you will find me here when I want $1 tacos. Yup, they have $1 tacos and you can get whatever protein on it. The steak was pretty good but the barbacoa was a little bit on the salty side. They have chorizo and tongue, so you can still go for something different for $1 and not be limited to just chix or beef. So it's pretty affordable. Throw down 4-5 bucks and you'd be set for lunch/dinner.

Tip: the location is a bit weird. I sat at the east corner not realizing that two feet outside the window is a bus stop. You'll get more visits from outsiders looking in than visits from your actual server. So note to self: do not sit at the far east corner.
