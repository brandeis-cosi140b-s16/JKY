This place came highly recommended. We grabbed lunch here and boy were we in for a shock when the bill came. Our server was really attentive and so graciously charged us for extra funny-tasting salsa and salad dressing. I didn't feel like the food and beverages were worth the money that we paid. I have had better chain Mexican food but cool for drinks and apps.... I guess.
