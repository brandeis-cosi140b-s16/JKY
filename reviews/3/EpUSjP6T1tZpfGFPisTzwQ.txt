An odd combo of Mexican and Chinese on each side of the restaurant.  We decided to share four dishes just for a taste and here is what we had:  

When Pigs Fly - small pork buns with lots of pork inside
Kao Lao Lao - oat noodles with a cilantro sauce, the sauce was good but oat noodles ok
Chicken Ji Song - was good and tasty
Pollo con Mole Poblano Taco - good

Just don't expect to get too full on these.
