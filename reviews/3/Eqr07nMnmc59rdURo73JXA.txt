The wait staff is fantastic, and I really enjoyed my food. I had the Korean beef nachos (half order) and then 2 tacos (beef and chicken). The tacos were ok, but to be honest nothing spectacular. The nachos stole the show for me, and I enjoyed every aspect of them. They have the perfect combination of spicy, sweet, and crunchy. I will say that I bet a lot of people would want them spicier, but they were perfect for me.

The one drawback seems to be their drink selection. I think that they should invest in a soda delivery system - this would make me raise my review by a star for sure.
