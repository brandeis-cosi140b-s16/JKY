I'll go ahead and pull out another star just for location. We currently reside about two minutes down the road and had never been to a On The Border Mexican Grill. So, we decided one afternoon to try this place in hopes of adding a new restaurant to our favorites list. Wrong...the service was distasteful. The waitress was upset at my husband for returning his food because he did not like it. It's not like he ate it and was trying to get out of a bill. He legitimately took one bite and was done. I then took a bite of my tacos and was displeased but continue to eat them because I was hungry. However, I told my husband not to force himself to eat the food and to return it for something else or nothing at all. He proceeds to return the food for nothing at all and the waitress immediately caught an attitude. We asked that she no longer wait our table and requested to speak with the manager. The manager then came to speak with us, apologized for the issue and introduced us to our new waiter who was AMAZING! We ended up leaving the new waitress a $40.00 tip and thanked her. The reason for the three stars and not five is because the food was not that good and the first waitress we had was horrible. I'm probably not going back and I hope that the first waitress got her act together.
