Pricy but good quality food and huge points for the atmosphere. I had a super rude server last time I went in which really bothered me because I've always had great service in the past.  She seemed irritated to have a large party of the younger variety (my friends and I are in our twenties) and it definitely showed that she fully anticipated we didn't know how to tip, which is silly to assume.  Other than that, great food, great location, great environment.
