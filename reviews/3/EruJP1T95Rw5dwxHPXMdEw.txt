Stopped by today and had the double enchilada plate and let me tell you, it looked way better than it actually was. I ordered the "hot" sauce on stop, that sauce should be re-labeled "mild". It had no kind of spiciness to it. I ordered it to go and by the time I got home (I live 2 minutes away) my food was cold. I give it 3 stars because the first time I went I had the sweet pork barbacoa tacos and they were pretty good, unlike today's meal. I wish I would have stopped by Panda Express instead.
