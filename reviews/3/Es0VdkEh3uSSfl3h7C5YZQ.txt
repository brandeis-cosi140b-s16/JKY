Decent, cheap food. Like the street-style tacos.  I've found the burritos are actually better the next day after being in the fridge all night (I think it just gives them time to come together).  Are there better Mexican places in this town? Yup, but this place is an inexpensive, reliable place to grab some food, especially later in the evening after a few drinks.
