The food from Chicken and Grill was very fresh, which meant a little longer wait but was worth it.  The meat is good, burritos good and guacamole made fresh..  the only negative I would say is the cheese sauce they use unless you ask for real shredded cheese.  good food, stay away from the cheese sauce. fresh ingredients and great customer service.
