Very casual, small, inexpensive Mexican place with the standard fare.  Sometimes I feel guilty getting the standard plate of enchiladas, beans, and rice.  But it's good!  My husband and I both had enchiladas and the kids had a quesadilla.  Great place to go if you want typical Mexican but want to feel that it's at least semi-authentic.
