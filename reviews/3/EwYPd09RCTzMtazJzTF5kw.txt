Place is decent.  What attracted me was the sketchy area it resides.  I walked from downtown Vegas to the strip.  And for those that know what I'm talking about, you will get hungry, right?

I stopped in and I was immediately greeted with a sign that "restrooms are only for customers" which was cool, I was gonna eat, something.  I use the restroom, all while be stared down.  I head to the bar, grab a beer and some chips.  So far, so good.

Place seems full of locals, something I love about Vegas and the locals, you can just sense it.

Food was decent, chips were perfect and the owner(pretty sure it was) was cool guy.  They were pretty busy on a week day afternoon, and the prices are very affordable.

Nothing really stood out, but the chicken was seasoned perfectly and the salsa was good.  

Would I make a special trip to hit this place in Vegas while visiting? Probably not, but I sure as shi$t would if I was walking from Freemont to Hard Rock. lol
