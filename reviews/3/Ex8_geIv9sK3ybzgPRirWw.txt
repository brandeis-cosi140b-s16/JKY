Easy place to have a quick meal. I think this is the best choice in the Palms Food Court. I ordered two tacos, and like most places you are able to watch them make it. Corn tortillas (my preference), cheese, salsa, etc. Good selections. Tacos tasted good. I would definitely return next time I'm hungry and need a quick meal at Palms. But I can't see myself going to the Palms just to eat here. There are just way too many other better Mexican places.
