Great great chili verde. Pork Chili verde is one of my favorite dishes and the family owned El Sombrero knows a distinctly incredible mouth watering recipe. The rest of the menu is pretty authentic, but not entirely...

The service is very very casual (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), and since it's beer and wine only, the wine margarita is pretty laughable, but it is $4 (nothing to complain about). But they do serve some great Mexican Beers, and their Salsas are wonderful!

You might miss it It's a tiny square of a restaurant, and as my old roommate loved to say,
"You have to pass Gas to get there!" (Gas St.)

If you become a regular they will keep a little reserved sign at your special booth when you come in ; D
