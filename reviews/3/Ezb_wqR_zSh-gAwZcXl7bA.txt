Fish tacos. Great, no, but good. Simple cod with that purple cabbage on a soft white tortilla. Skipped the cream sauce.  Salsa bar looked good, yeah I just looked. You get chips, $8. I did have trouble ordering, which was a good thing. The selections are many. You order at the register and wait for your lucky number to be called out kind of place.
