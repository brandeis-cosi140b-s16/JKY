Had a late lunch at Julio's Too the other day.  Food was absolutely fine, and washed itself down nicely with a Mexican beer I'd never heard of before from the fridge.

Nothing outstanding, but nothing to complain about.  If I was walking past hungry, I'd certainly go back; would I go far out of my way?  Probably not.  Would I take my wife?  Yes.  A hot date?  Probably not.  Does it do what it set out to do - decent Mexican food in a diner setting?  Certainly does.
