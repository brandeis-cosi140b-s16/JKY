Yeah... I think this place tried a little to hard to be trendy in all aspects. I knew it once they sat us under a giant head-shaped projection screen (??).

Food: super small portions that are good but not something I would remember/crave/die for. Ordered a bunch of different of sui mai & some lettuce wraps. I was expecting the food to be a little more than Cheesecake Factory or Elephant Bar, but that's basically what it was.

Drinks: I got some sort of lemondrop with jelly "noodles" in it... interesting, but I had no idea how to approach it (I looked like an idiot digging in my drink with chopsticks). My friend ordered the salt air marg was pretty cool, once you got past the first sip which is basically a mouthful of foamy salt.

Good effort but won't be back!
