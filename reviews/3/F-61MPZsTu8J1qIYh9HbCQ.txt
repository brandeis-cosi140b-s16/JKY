People in Avondale often said this was the best Mexican food in the area, they are probably right. Yet there is nothing special about this place. Speaking mostly on combination plates, its just average. Don't get me wrong the taste of everything is good but they didn't set themselves apart from other places in the Phoenix area.

Service was friendly and prompt. Chips and salsa were pretty good!
