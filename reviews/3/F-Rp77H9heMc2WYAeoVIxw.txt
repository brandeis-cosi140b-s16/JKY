I had the 2 taco combo, a ground beef and pork taco to be exact.  The ground beef wasn't bad but it didn't have a lot of flavor. To pork taco was really good though, it was really tender and wasn't over seasoned. I didn't really care for the rice, the beans tasted like they came out of a can... but good canned beans at least. I had the red roasted chile and chips too. The chips were great, really thin and crispy. The chile needed a little salt and was fine. I will go back but just for the pork i think, if i just had pork tacos i would have given them 4 stars.
