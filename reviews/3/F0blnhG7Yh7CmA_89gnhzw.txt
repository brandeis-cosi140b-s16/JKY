Just not good. We saw a show on PBS about it so we thought we would check it out. The food was standard low-end Mexican food. The major problem I had with it was the rice. The flavor reminded me of the smell of medicated dog shampoo. It was gross. Service was slow. Getting our food was slow. Salsa was not good...which sucks because salsa can raise the likability of a place.  Really the only reason I gave them 3 stars was because it was a family run place & I liked the Christmas lights on the ceiling. Unfortunately, for them, we won't be returning.
