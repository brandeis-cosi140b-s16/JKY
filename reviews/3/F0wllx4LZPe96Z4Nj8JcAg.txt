Went to check out this restaurant with my business partner for lunch, we are both big Mexican food junkies and were looking for something new. The first problem we encountered was that I looked at the map on Yelp to see where it was, and it was very, very wrong! The map showed it on Chandler Blvd. and Gilbert Rd., when it is really on Chandler and I-10, a BIG difference! Well, we finally got there around 1:00...the place was empty except for 3 tables. 

My first reaction to the menu was it was cheap!! I know lunch specials and so forth are generally cheap, but even the dinner menu was very well priced. They menu had a lot of Sonoran stand by's, as well as a whole seafood section that is not usually found at most places. 

The chips and salsa were really good. The chips were thin and crunchy and the salsa fresh. We asked for the hot salsa, and that came out with a side of bean dip as well. My business partner likes things the hotter the better....it was too hot for me...but she really like it. The bean dip was a little blah, but when mixed with the salsa it was good. 

I had the Mexican burrito, which was a shredded beef burrito, enchilada style with a queso sauce on top, with sour cream & guacamole. I really enjoyed it, it had good flavor. The beans that came on the side were good too, better than the bean dip. 

My business partner had the cheese crisp with green chilies, it looked like a really good cheese crisp, a lot of cheese and very crispy!! 

I would return for a repeat visit, but only if I was in the area, I wouldn't go out of my way for it. But the price was right, the bill for the two of us was $12.70!!
