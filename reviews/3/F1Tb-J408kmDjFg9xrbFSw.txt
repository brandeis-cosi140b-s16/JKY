At first, I was surprised that once they rebranded from Casa de las Enchiladas that the food has remained just as good. Opening up to a new demographic has changed the feel of the place a little, but it was all about the food.

Unfortunately, my girlfriend and I got there just a little too late for their normal dinner menu last night.  Their late-night menu is sparse and not very good.  I don't know if they have changed their normal menu (I haven't been in a month or two), but it seems like completely new offerings later at night - which is atypical for a restaurant to offer new items late.  It's usually an abbreviated version of their normal menu.

Tacos are the item most reminiscent of their typical fare, which my girlfriend got.  Was pretty measly for $3. I got what was described as a Dominican hamburger.  There was as much mayonnaise on it (sweet mayo, at that) as there was meat.  We also ordered a chicken empanada to split, but we received a beef empanada, which was extremely salty.

Not a good night, and we both didn't feel so well afterwards.

However, this is complete contrast to every other meal I've ever had there.  I've lived within walking distance of there for 3 years, and it has historically been spot on.  Just hope this isn't a sign of meals to come.
