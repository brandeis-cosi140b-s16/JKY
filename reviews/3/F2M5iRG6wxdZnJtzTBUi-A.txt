Not authentic except for the salsa which was on the dot! Spicy but addicting. My lettuce l guess was meant only for decoration since it was dry n old. Beans and rice and tortilla don't taste home made. The campechana (seafood mix soup) was way too fish And more oysters then anything. The sope was hard like it's been frozen before. I wouldn't say I would never come again but not when I want authentic.
