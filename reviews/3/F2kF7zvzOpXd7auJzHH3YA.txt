The appearance of this restaurant is so colorful and beautiful. We took numerous pictures here. It is the oldest Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale, and it is named after the olive trees that used to grow in fields around its grounds years ago. 
My husband and I went here on the suggestion of some locals who highly recommended it. The menu is large, but unfortunately does not have carnitas or mole on it. Instead of our favorites, we opted for a meal of carne asada steak and a chile relleno with rice and beans. The salsa served with the chips was good, but served in a carafe. I didn't get this, it would have been easier for it to just have been put in bowls. The chips did not seem fresh, either. However, the tortillas served with my husband's carne asada were home made!! This was a nice surprise. His steak was tender and tasty as well. The rice and beans were standard style. He liked the fact he was given fresh, diced green chile with his lunch, too.
My chile relleno was fresh, not one taken out of a can. This made a real difference. I wish I had tried the flan, as I love this particular dessert. 
Overall, this is a decent restaurant, but not the best I have been to, either. It's not a bad choice if you are in the area.
