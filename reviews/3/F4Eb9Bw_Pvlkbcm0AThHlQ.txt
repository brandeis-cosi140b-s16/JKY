This place would have been a better experience, had I not been to the Century City LA Pink Taco which surpasses this one in every way. I was so disappointed that they are not at all affiliated with one another, however they do share the same happy hours from 4 to 6pm. This one didn't have my firestarter margarita and the drinks just weren't as good in general yet still cost as much at $9 to 12. Food was good though, I liked how the Pink Taco tortilla were stuffed with black beans, we ordered them after having seen them made which had spiked our curiosity.
