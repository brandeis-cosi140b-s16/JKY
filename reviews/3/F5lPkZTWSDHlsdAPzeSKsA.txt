What can I say, it's your average run of the mill chipotle. The only gripe I have is the cold ingredients where super cold (salsa, lettuce, etc) and the meat on our tacos/ burrito where lukewarm at best. It was like eating leftovers out of the fridge instead of fresh food. What gives? Next time make sure my chicken is warm please
