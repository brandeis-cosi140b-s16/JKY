This trip to Sky Harbor Airport Term 4 included a visit to Sir Veza's.

Food
Average - not bad, not memorable.

Atmosphere
Cool, rustic antique-looking stuff  surrounds the dining area.

I wouldn't walk across the concourse to eat here, but it wasn't terrible.

Good thing they have a captive flow of hungry diners waiting for flights to airports near and far
