Known for their spicy (hot) mexican food.  Good place for tourists wanting something different.  I had a red burro, which was good but I admittedly enjoyed the chips & red salsa and margaritas the most.   They do nickel & dime you with drinks and salsa which I assume is out of necessity.  Not the best neighborhood but safe none-the-less. I'm looking forward to going to the new location on Camelback Rd.
