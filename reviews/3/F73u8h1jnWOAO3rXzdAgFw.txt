Was hungry on the way out of PHX so stopped here.

Margarita - yum.

Food - came out cold.  Came back again was luke warm.  The guy next to me said hi steak was not that warm either.  Would move this review to four stars if they heated their plates!

Service: pretty good actually.  At least for me.

Just get drinks and colder items like guac or salad.
