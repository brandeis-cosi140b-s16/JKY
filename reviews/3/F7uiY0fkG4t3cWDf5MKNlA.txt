Love the feel and atomphere of the place.  Feels like I am eating in the middle of Casear's Palace with the indoor blue skies.  But the food and service was nothing specatacular.  Service was a little on the slower side.  The food was ok.  

Ordered the beef and cheese chimichanga (I love chimis).  The flavors was just ok.  Nothing popped or made me sing (in my head).
