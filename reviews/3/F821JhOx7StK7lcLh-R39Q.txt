Got here early for dinner. Not many people were in the restaurant. Service was good not great. Ordered the chips and salsa for appetizer.  Then shrimp mojo and 20 vegetable fried rice for main course.  Shrimp mojo was ok. Says it had garlic blackened flavor. It lacked flavor in my opinion. Would not order it again.  The fried rice on the other hand was extremely good and the presentation was awesome as well. It had loads of mini sized veggies throughout. We like spicy so we asked for a side of hot sauce. They brought out some very spicy original hot sauce which helped add some kick.
