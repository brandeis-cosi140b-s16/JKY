I have only been here for lunch, as it is close to the office. The service is always quick and friendly, especially if you are on a time crunch. They get your drink order right away and have some authentic choices. Free chips and salsa are given to each table at the beginning of the meal and replenished as quickly as you go through them. Lunch specials are worth taking a look at it, and the portion size is definitely a bang for your buck. Word on the street is they have great drink specials and dinner is good as well. Worth checking out if you are in the area and looking for somewhere affordable to eat, but it won't knock your socks off. The servers did play along with us as we pulled a prank on a member of our party by pulling out sombrero and birthday candles. Their sense of humor was much appreciated.
