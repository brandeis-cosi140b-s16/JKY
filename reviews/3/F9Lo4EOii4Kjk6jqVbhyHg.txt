Oh Dos Gringos in Tempe (Priest),   i miss you like crazy!! you were always my go to spot!!   Chuck (bestest bartender ever) is soo much fun and keeps you smiling.   uhh i digress..
 
Now that im in Mesa, This place is close,... and is still alot of fun..  The same kind of atmosphere, and happy hour specials, and the employees are super sweet, and became fast friends.  That being said,  the crowd just doesn't seem as fun and outgoing here.  I love meeting new people, and at this Dos,  the peeps just don't seem as friendly. hmm, maybe living soo far out makes everyone put their crabby pants on??  I've only had the Apps at this location, but so far, everything is equally as delish here as the other locations. Maybe i just need to give the atmosphere more of a chance now that the weather is warming up,...   I'll  keep ya posted !
