Solid Americanized Mexican food at a decent price, much more cost effective and better tasting than the place with the ducks up the street. However, the atmosphere doesn't compare. It isn't run down by any means but lacks a certain charm. Pretend not to notice the trailer with boarded up windows in the parking lot. If they spruced up the patio a bit it would make a fantastic place to spend a spring or fall evening. But oh my god, I wish these guys would lay off on the karaoke. One night a week is fine, especially if you advertise it on your sign, but I wandered in here with friends on a Sunday afternoon & these two bar stars got on the mic and would. not. shut. up. And they had that thing cranked up to 11. We moved to the other room & they still ruined our lunch. Karaoke on Sundays makes the baby Jesus cry.
