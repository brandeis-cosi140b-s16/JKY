I've been a fan of Tia Rosas and I was thrilled when they opened another shop close by. I love their food and it's certainly 5 star worthy. However I felt the need to drop a few stars because  A) the guy you have serving food is a jerk and B)  I always get the same thing every time and have the last 4 times I've been in. Suddenly today I am charged $1.50 more?? I checked my receipt and it was right but a $1.50 price increase literally overnight?? And $1.99 for a basket of chips is ridiculous. I will still come but probably not as often now. Now I don't think it's worth it.
