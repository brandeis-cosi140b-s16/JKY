I went here with a fellow Yelper who had a fabulous coupon from restaurant.com.  At 11:30 AM, it was one of few places that was willing to serve both breakfast and lunch.

I ordered the club sandwich and side salad, she ordered the french toast, and we shared the hummus/crab pate appetizer.  We asked for everything to be brought out at once because we were in a bit of a hurry, and it was all served at the same time.  My side salad was yummy, with all of the non-lettuce accompaniments chopped into tiny little cubes.  The sandwich was on bread about the thickness of a pita and made panini-style.  I loved it: turkey, ham and bacon makes everything better.  

The appetizer was a good one to share, but I definitely wouldn't want it all for myself.  I enjoyed the roasted red pepper hummus and my partner in crime enjoyed the crab dip.  We both enjoyed the sliced veggies and grilled pita for dipping.  It was on a huge serving platter sized plate though, and I felt bad leaving so much food behind.

The service was good, the patio was wonderful and the food was yummy.  My only complaint is the bit o' 'tude we got from the waiter when we told him we were using the coupon, at the beginning of the meal.  He said it was only good for dinner, even though it didn't say so, then did us a "favor" by honoring it.  Mildly annoying, but nothing that would prevent me from returning.
