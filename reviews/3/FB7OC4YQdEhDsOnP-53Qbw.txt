I really want to love this place. But in all honesty, the only reason I ever go here is because it's five minutes from my house.

Maybe it's me. I had heard all kinds of great things about La Unica. Maybe I set the bar too high in my head. I've been here a handful of times now and nothing has been overly impressive. Nothing has been bad... it's just all okay. One thing I will not recommend is the ceviche. Probably should've known better than to order that in a place like this, but we really wanted to try it.

I like that they bring you two different kinds of salsa. One hot, one mild. I like the cheese dip, too. They usually have drink specials of some sort. Nice spot to get down on some chips and cheap drinks. The lunch menu is reasonably priced. Tuesdays they have dollar tacos. 

Not terrible, not fantastic. A-OK. I just think there are much better Mexican spots near/around the Plaza Midwood area.
