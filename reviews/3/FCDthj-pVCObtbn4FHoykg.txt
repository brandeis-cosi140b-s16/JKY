I had heard a bunch of good things about this place. I have traveled all over Mexico and was hoping this would get close to what they make. Customer Service was terrible, the cashier was tapping her foot while we looked at the menu, then I tried to order a Tlayuda and they were out. We ordered one of each kind of taco to be able to try everything. The campechanos and carnitas were really good. Barbacoa was bland and cold as well as the grilled jalapenos. Pastor was decent. Everything else okay. Sodas were warm. I really enjoyed the meal but they lacked on the service.
