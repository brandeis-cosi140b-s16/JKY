Located in the E terminal around gate 20.

I hate eating greesy heavy fast food when traveling, it just makes me feel bad.  So when traveling with my husband and 2 children this is where we ate.

We are huge Moe's (also fast tex mex) fans and this place was pretty close.  We got 2 small buritos (one veg and one chicken) and a cheese quesadia.  It cost $18.00 plus some change.  So a bit pricy, but the quality is much better than other fast food options.  My 5 year old ate her entire burrito and my 8 year old her quesadia.  They were both a bit hungry afterwards.  I shared with my husbad and it was enough to take off the edge, but that's all.

The woman in front of us was one of those problem customers and she slowed the line way down so I'm not sure if they are slow normally or if they were hampered by the previous customer.

They have burritos, tacos, quesadias, and bowls.  The selection of meats is standard.  The vegetarian option is just veggies  (no tofu).  The salsa selection was nice and the ingredients whiel not fresh fresh were tasty.  Salt content was pretty good.

If I'm ever in Charlott again I would eat here again, unless I was trying to make a tight connection.
