Good sangria. Food mediocre. 

Food - I was able to finally gotten around to this place. Heard good things from the hubby. I had ordered the "Dennis Enchiladas," and was let down by the dry meat, dried rice, and it was not satisfying.  The only thing that made me happy was the delicious red sangria.

Price - it was not that bad, the price was decent, especially when you get a large portion of food on your plate (that I was not expecting - suddenly, I felt full).

Service - We had a kind waitress that was attentive.

The Tex-Mex food was alright and nothing to rave about. As a native Houstonian, I was disappointed. Ah well.
