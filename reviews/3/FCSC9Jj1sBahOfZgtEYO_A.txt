Like so many other Mexican restaurants in Charlotte, nothing about this one stands out more than the rest. The usual margarita special that contains what tastes like pure sour mix. The menu of all things that look the same that leaves me not able to decide what the heck I want. I usually end up getting something I didn't really want in the end but scarfed it down 'cause let's face it; it all tastes about the same anyway. The staff seemed to be attentive but didn't really care to be there. I would come back if in the area and craved Mexican food. And that's why I came here this past time.
