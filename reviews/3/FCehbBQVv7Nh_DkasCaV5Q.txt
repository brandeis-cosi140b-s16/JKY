Really good margaritas.  Their food isn't anything special.  I am particularly critical because I am capable of making my own Mexican food that is way better than this place.  I would say their food is more Americanized Mexican food than true Mexican food.  Their salsa tastes like tomato sauce from the can.  Their happy hour is pretty good though.  I tend just to stick to that menu along with the delicious margaritas.
