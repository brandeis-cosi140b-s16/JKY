Come here for the crazy murals, stay for the tasty Mexican food. Ignore the dated fast-food interior and focus on the unique guac, which is more of an avocado-green-salsa than an actual guacamole, but in a good way.

Not dissimilar to Roberto's, Gerardo's has roughly the same basic menu and comparable (if not a smidge lower) pricing. Staff is polite, but it's a one-man show so if you go with a group be prepared to wait. More of a grab-and-go kind of place.

Didn't notice a chile relleno on the menu, but they have tons of burritos (including breakfast), tacos, menudo on weekends, and a low priced daily special. My pick is the $2 3-piece taquitos, which come with cheese AND guac- most other places do one, not both.
