(Leaning more towards 3.5 stars rather than 3, but not quite a 4.)  Finally stopped by after their renovations and it looks nice!  They've definitely expanded and they added a ton more seating.  I love that they kept the murals on the walls, cause to be honest, that was the best part of their decor.  Their menu is a little hard to read and that might hold up the line, so guys and ladies of Los Taquitos, if you're reading this,  laminated menus at the start of the line might be a nice touch?

Customer service, once again, wasn't great, but I've lowered my expectations since my last visit.  However, I was pretty taken aback when a very cheery and polite lady handed us our food to go.  I almost wanted to thank her for actually smiling but that probably crosses some sort of line between normal and creepy so I kept my mouth shut.

Food, food, food.  My boyfriend got the burrito bowl, which was a little smaller than expected, but still tasted great.  Was expecting beans and rice on the side, but since you already get beans and rice in the bowl, I guess you don't get more (yes, I'm greedy).  I need to read that menu again.  The tamales with beans and rice were good, tamales a little dry and crumbly and needed some reheating by the time I got home (probably takes us 10 minutes to get home).  I am in love with their red salsa though.  It has a little bit of a kick, and everyone needs a little spice in their life.

Word of advice, don't do takeout.  It's still good, but from my experience, it tastes a ton better fresh.  Plus, soak up the atmosphere - it's a much livelier place than the hole in the wall it was before.  Though I kinda liked that hole in the wall...dammit, nostalgia!
