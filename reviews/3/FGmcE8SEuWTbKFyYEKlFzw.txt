This is my favorite Roberto's location by far. The service here is pretty good, and the shop itself is always very clean. It's definitely not my favorite "Mexican" choice, but it works if you're looking for quick takeout and of course, 24 hour service. I love the bar where you can grab as much spicy pickled jalapeno/carrot/onion mix and cucumbers with salsa as you wish. The burritos are huge, and extra spicy if you prefer. My fav is the shrimp burrito, stuffed with large shrimp and tons of onions/peppers. The tortillas are delicious. A popular item is the carne asada fries ... worth a try.
