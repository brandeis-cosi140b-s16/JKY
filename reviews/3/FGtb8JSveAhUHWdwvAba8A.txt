Ate at Rubios for the first time last night. It was mediocre at best. 

My daughter ordered a fish taco kids meal. The taco was so drenched in white sauce that we had to send if back. When I went up to the counter, I asked if the amount of sauce was normal. The employee said that there is only supposed to be a spoonful I. The taco and offered to make another one. Kudos for the customer service. 

My don ordered the bean and cheese burrito kids meal. It was the tastiest thing we ordered last night. The burrito was much larger than give kids fish taco.

I ordered two fish tacos and a side of rice and beans - if was a little under $5 because tacos are only $1.50 on Tuesdays!  The fish was tasteless. I did like the shredded cabbage on top. 

Best thing about Rubios = salsa bar. You're going to need it if you want some flavor!

Negatives- kids meals are tiny!  Rice and bean sides are less than 4 ounces - how's that for tiny?!?  The beans I received were in a plastic 4 ounce container that was just barely half full. 

I doubt we will return. Too many other places where the food is better. Three stars for customer service - friendly and helpful employees.
