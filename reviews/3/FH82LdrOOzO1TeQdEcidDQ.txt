This place is fun and cozy if you're willing to hang somewhere that isn't high-end.

Their food is average and enjoyable for a night out with friends or some munchies while drinking, but I wouldn't take mom and dad here if they're visiting Madison. Drinks are reasonably priced and typical Mexican fare.

I really like their burritos the best. The veggie one is my favorite.

It can get a little crazy on Friday and Saturday nights, since they do karaoke, but if that's what you're into, stop on by.

Overall, it's pretty fun and a nice little hole in the wall. Also, it has 3 floors with ample seating, so there's almost never a wait.
