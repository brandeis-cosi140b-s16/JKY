You go in here at pretty much any time of the day and you would swear that they were giving away free food... the lines are so damn long! 

The burritos or bowls are good. The proteins are always pretty fresh... as you can see the staff cooking them right over the prep line.

Today's trip was slightly disappointing because several items I wanted were almost depleted in the serving pans, and I wouldn't let them use the "dregs" on my burrito. 

Be careful ordering the guacamole: It's a $1.50 for a "scoop". 

My tips: Try one of their Margaritas! They are interestingly pretty potent!
