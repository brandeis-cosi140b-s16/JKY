This location is okay but not as good as the one in Litchfield Park (gets 4 stars). 

I live half-way between both of them and depending where my errands are at in Goodyear/Avondale I end up at the two different ones. I have eaten their food at least 20 times:

-Rolled chicken taco special
-Chile Verde
-Carnitas (way better at Litchfield)
-Chorizo burrito
-Carne Asada Fries
-Enchiladas


It is my understanding this location on Estrella is run by the son of one of the Partners. He needs to be in his store more! Depending who is on shift, the food quality varies so widely. And the heavy set dude at night on the drive-thru needs to quit if he is so unhappy. 

They need to take notice because the Ramiro's down the street has new management and they have greatly improved and will give this location a run for it's money.
