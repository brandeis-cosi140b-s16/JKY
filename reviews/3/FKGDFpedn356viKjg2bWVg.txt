After walking the strip all afternoon, my friends and I stumbled into this establishment looking for great (strong) drinks and some good, filling food before getting ready to go out for the night.

The house margarita was delicious and the pitcher of sangria was a great choice; however, I wasn't prepared for the tiny plates of food that were brought out..  I ordered the chicken empanadas ($9) and couldn't suppress a laugh when 3 fortune-cookie sized empanadas came out on a tiny plate.  Aside from the unexpected tiny portions, Diego's was just fine.  I'm always a fan of watching people make my guacamole (even though this guac seemed a little bland) and was impressed by the assortment of salsas and different flavored salts that they provide.

If I were to go back, I'd stick to the drinks with chips and salsa and have dinner elsewhere.

(Note: Don't show up in tacky flip flops and grubby clothes from the night before - you'll feel grossly under-dressed as they walk you past the beautiful people and into the back dining room.  Far, far away from the public eye.)
