I didn't have any coupons which sucks but I guess after reading the other reviews, it doesn't seem to suck anymore. lol 

I thought the food was good, the chicken was more flavorful than Chipotle and service was good. they always get you with the ad ons though, but it's the same at Choptle, your 6.50 burrito hits the 8-10 mark when you add veggies or some side they didnt tell you about. 

Other than that it was good but if you do the math with the ad ons you can go to a decent sit down place for the same price. 

I would return when I need a fix but the hole in the wall places are still my fav.
