Fire grilled chicken...Do I give them an extra star for having healthy eats? I don't know. I don't like giving chain restaurants more than 3 stars!

This place seems pretty authentic...they have an orchata machine. I don't think I am a fan of that rice, cinnamon drink combo though.  Hey, to each, their own!  

Concerned with the pricing versus portion size however.  I hate paying a premium price for anything, and getting a little bit of product in return.  I don't like paying that much and possibly feeling hungry afterwards.  I could have gone to another chain restaurant, and eaten off the dollar menu, and ensured myself a full stomach.  

Good taste and skin crunch to the chicken. You can taste the spices on the chicken, which is always a plus in my book. Bland fowl...is well..fowl!  Sorry, had to do it!  Sides are decent in taste, presentation, yet not portions. Macaroni and cheese actually tasted as if they put some time and thought into it.  Corn cake had nice texture and sweetness.

All in all, not a bad place.  If it is around, I would make stops here on occassion.
