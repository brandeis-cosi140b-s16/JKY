I've been here twice, and both times left wishing I could like it more...

The first time was for lunch, and I tried the buffet, thinking that this would be a good way to try several dishes and know what to order off the menu next time. I was REALLY disappointed in the selection. There were rice and beans, chilaquiles(which are corn tortillas in a tomatillo sauce), two quesadillas, maybe one more item(which was obviously forgettable) and basic salad and fruit. Meh...Nothing was bad, but nothing stood out. I thought that this was just the curse of the buffet, and decided to go again for brunch.

First of all, 11 seems a bit late to start a brunch...but whatever. We ordered Cafe de Olla to drink, but were bummed when our server said that they were having issues and would only have regular coffee. I ordered the Huevos Divorciados that I had seen in an article. The tomatillo sauce was tangy and nice, but the "roasted tomato" sauce just reminded me of tomato soup. One of my eggs was yolky, but one was hard. Not something I'd order again. The boyfriend had Huevos con Chorizo which was basic. The eggs were overcooked, and we've gotten more chorizo-y flavor out of the dish at El Dorado.

 All in all, I don't think I'd go out of my way to stop here again. I miss Rice Cafe...
