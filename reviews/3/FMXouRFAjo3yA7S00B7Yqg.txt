It was alright. Staff is kinda rude they don't really care pretty much , not friendly at all. I felt like everything was rushed . Drinks however take a while to come by  . I had the chicken tostada salad and it was pretty good . I wouldn't go back to this place just because the staff makes you feel so un-welcomed
