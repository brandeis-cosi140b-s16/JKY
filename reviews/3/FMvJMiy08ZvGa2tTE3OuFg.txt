Hmmmm, what is a Yelper to do on this one? Very mixed experience. Bullet points to the rescue: 

The Good: 

-Nice server and prompt service 
-Good ambiance 
-Great patio 
-2 of 4 meals were excellent 

The Bad: 

-Sub-par carnitas--overcooked, cold, and no flavor to top it off 
-Bad fish tacos--cold and not much going on 

The Ugly: 

-Plumbing issues in the bathroom. The majority of the sinks (and apparently toilets in the ladies room) were backed up. Not necessarily the restaurant's fault, but a little worrisome as it makes you wonder whats going on in the kitchen. 

So anyways, mixed bag, nice folks, nice patio, I'll just average out the experience to 3 stars.
