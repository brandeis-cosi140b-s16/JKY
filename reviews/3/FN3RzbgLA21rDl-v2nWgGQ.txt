Awesome atmosphere and very friendly and courteous staff. The food is good and serves decent portions. I do think that the food is overpriced, it's mostly beans and rice on the plate and a portion of your choosing (i.e shrimp, steak, or chicken). The fact that it's mostly beans and rice on the plate is always what gets to me when it comes to the pricing. Also the steak usually has a lot of fat on it and the shrimp is always extremely over cooked which makes it chewy and rubbery.
