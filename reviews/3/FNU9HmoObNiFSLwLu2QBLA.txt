I ordered their salmon bento box. The taste was good not to die for. I actually thought their brown rice they served me was spoiled it had a funny smell and taste to it which I did not enjoy, I ate everything else but skipped on the rice. I spent about $20 on my meal including the bento and their happy hour price for the bao, $3.50. It was kind of in the pricey end because I didn't enjoy my bento box. However, their baos is amazing!!! I like how the bun is so thick and soft and the fillings tasted so good!!! When you are around Central Phoenix, you should try it. The location is very hidden so make sure you go inside the Desoto Market. Parking is free!
