Went here last night for dinner.  It was about 7ish and the place was pretty dead.  We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken and we were given a big bowl of tortilla chips and some salsa.  The chips were eh' but the salsa was pretty good because it did have some heat to it.

Our waitress was fast and friendly so no complaints there.

As far as the menu is concerned, I'm not really sure what to make of it.  My guess is this place is trying to be a typical Scottsdale restaurant that tries to do a fresh take on old cuisine.  Blue Agave's goal was probably to take a bunch of typical "Mexican" dishes and combine them with a Californian and New Mexican flair.  Combine that with some gringo stuff in a Scottsdale joint trying to be trendy and there you have Blue Agave.

The food:

*Tortilla Soup - I loved it.  I am told that this isn't "real" tortilla soup but I don't care.  I love it a bit thick/creamy and not watery.  I thought it was perfect.  Plenty of chicken and plenty of spice.

*Chicken Lettuce Wraps - These are basically chicken tacos without the shell.  Definitely a healthier option which is probably why my wife ordered them as a meal.  Anyway, it was actually pretty good but a tad bit bland.

*Stuffed Relleno - How can a spicy, cheesy, meaty thing NOT be good?  This was in no way a healthy option but I love stuffed chillies so what the heck.

The food here is pretty ok for what it is.  The quality of it is eh' as is the ambiance of the place.  I would like to try more of their menu but there are tons of other Mexican/New Mexican/Baja type places in the valley that are far superior I would visit first.
