Order off the menu, its amazing if you do. If you ask for ANYTHING out of the ordinary, like no cheese (because your allergic) or guacamole CHECK CHECK CHECK before you leave, I hate sending things back, but with allergies it can't be helped.  I went back several dozen times (various times for dinner (My guy loves it), everything if ordered exactly as the menu was always good and everyone was always really happy, except those with special requests. I wouldnt have returned after the second time if my guy and his friends didnt love it, it was almost always my food they messed up or something that one of our friends was okay with having messed up. I think that the fact that there was always a language barrier (YES, always) makes it harder. So, great food. But I no longer go, and havent in more than a year because my guy had the same bad experience that I did, repeatedly. (They did get my order right, 3 times out of approximately 28-30 visits. Also the cashier would check and on 4 other occasions made the cook fix the screw up, but the other food got cold while I waited at their insistance because it wasnt done correctly to begin with.)

~~~EDIT~~~
Went last week after ages of not having been. everything I GOT was right, I had her check before I left. Though I was shorted 2 chicken tacos. I would have noticed but there were two wrapped tortillas for other meals and I thought they were the tacos. 

Its a disappointment. The food is so good, why can't they EVER get my food right.
