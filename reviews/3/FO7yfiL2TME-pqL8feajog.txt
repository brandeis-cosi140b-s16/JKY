Nothing special.  The prices are slightly higher than average but nothing exorbitant...

I had the lobster taco which was definitely not worth the price.  At least the flavor didn't match the cost.  I also ordered the chicken taco which was drowned in bbq sauce.  The bbq sauce tasted very good.  If you don't mind sauce dominating the food, then the chicken taco will satisfy you. 

I doubt I will choose to eat here with other options at Cosmo to choose from....
