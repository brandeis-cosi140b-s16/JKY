The food was pretty good but I wouldn't consider this "authentic Mexican". The menu has ratatoullie which I'm pretty sure is French. They even spelt "pozole" wrong on the menu. But I had the filet minon and it was pretty tasty. Our waiter named anthony or andrew or something was slow as heck and wasn't paying attention to his customers. It was sort of frustrating.
