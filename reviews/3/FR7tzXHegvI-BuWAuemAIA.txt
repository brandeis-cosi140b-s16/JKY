I've eaten here about ten times.  It was right up the street from where I used to live and very inexpensive for a taco joint.  Its open 24 hours but the parking is horrible (if someone is the drive-up, you can't get out until they leave).  

The food is very good and the choices are many; servings are quite generous.  They only take cash, so be prepared for this when you come (there is an ATM in the restaurant).  It has indoor and outdoor seating but it's right next to Sahara so you don't get much to look at sitting outside.

Like others have commented, its your typical authentic mexican food, nothing more or less.  If you're nearby, it is what I'd recommend.
