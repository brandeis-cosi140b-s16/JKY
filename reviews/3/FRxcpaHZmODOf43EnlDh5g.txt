My first experience here wasn't the best so I'll add my second trip to the bottom of this review.  To decide a review on one visit may not be fair, at least not at this point. 
  I had the green chili burrito and the portion size was great.  The only problem was my blood pressure went up twenty points.  The main flavor was salt... Now I love salt as much as the next saltaholic, but my Great Stepmother supposedly cooked for Pancho Villa and I Inherited an awesome chili Verde recipe (aka Green Chili.)  THIS BURRITO. WAS FAR FROM IT. 
  In fact, usually cumin and green chilies are what you're supposed to taste (not salt.) 
  The meat was tender, the staff was friendly, and the restaurant was (pretty clean).  I'll wait for my next trip to finalize my review.
    Second trip wasn't much better... I had the carne asada burrito, it was good. For some reason the other locations seem to have much better food? I've gotten at least one point better food at their other locations.

I've made several trips now and it seems to me that this must be one of the better burrito places in the area, which is disappointing because in San Diego there are many burrito shops with excellent quality food. I suppose it just depends on your expectations and your location.
