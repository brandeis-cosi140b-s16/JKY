Very quiet here (few people) & multiple times we've been here the same staffers have been here with consistency in both food & svc.  I should rate it higher but I don't eat Mexican that often out.  We actually were taken care of by the owner who was very pleasant.  He even checked on us & the other patrons.  We were entertained by his telling of some of his humorous work situation real life stories.  Oh, the food?  It's not bad $7.95 for a smoked beef salad with 2 sides & $7.95 for a shredded glazed chicken burrito.  We cared enough to share some of our marketing ideas with him.  See, we make the world go round.
