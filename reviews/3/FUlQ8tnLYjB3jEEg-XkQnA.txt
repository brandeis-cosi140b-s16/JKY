I came into this location today and everything was great until the shift leader Alyssa delivered my food to my table.  She came up with that I don't want to be here look on her face. Then she didn't even say one word to me ...at all.... she just dropped the food off and left. As she was putting the food on my table I was very nice saying thank you and she just walked off. Then I noticed that she was going on break  . So I got the impression I was her last customer till she was free to relax and she didn't care about me. Her cashier working today was very helpful and very very nice. She should be the shift leader instead...other than that, my food was amazing as usual. I love rubios but I didn't love my service today.
