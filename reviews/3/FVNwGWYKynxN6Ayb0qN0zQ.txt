Good casual mexican grub..... awesome queso fundito!! But as others have said... entrees were just ok. Not bad, but nothing that will bring me back again with all the other Vegas dining options. They do have a great "Patio" - next to the indoor grand canal. So that was fun. 
Service was awesome... I even forgot my brand new sweater....they had it tucked away safe for me!
