Look this is the White Castle of Arizona, Mexican style.  There are plenty of great stories and movies to make about being out late getting a case of the munchies and hitting up Fili B's!  Outside of this unless you are a burrito connoisseur you need to understand that this place is just great when you need a burrito, or at least your drunk self does.
