The food is good but not super fantastic. I like it here because it's a small place with pretty authentic Mexican food. A bit overpriced due to the a la carte and additional toppings. Not a big deal though. All the ingredients are fresh and simple. House made sauces and salsas. Only thing that really sucks is the service. There's only one girl every time we go. She's very nice but not fast @ all. Nice server, super slow service. Don't expect a speedy lunch.
