Food was fresh and I loved the salsa bar but one thing is clear here. Poor customer service....I walked in and was starred at by the employees as they called out some lady. The lady comes out some corner while counting money (manger lady?) and says in a not so pleasant voice "go to other register". Okay, so I go to other register as I wait for her to finish counting money. Keep in mind I've been waiting to have my order placed for about 6 minutes and I was the only customer in line to place an order. So she turns and gets upset at someone while taking my order and never once smiles or seem cherry throughout my experience  here. 

So, I get my order and sit down to enjoy my Mexican food and I notice that every employee here seems quiet and down. I've been to several Mexican restaurants and they seem very happy and welcoming. Then I here the same lady who took my order scold her the employees in front of all the customers! My goodness lady does someone need a career change? 

Overall food was good but I think next time I'll hit a friendlier environment.
