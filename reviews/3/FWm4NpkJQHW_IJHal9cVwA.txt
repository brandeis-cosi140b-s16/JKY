I went here on a Friday to get some grub before a movie on a Friday night. I was promptly greeted an seated and the waitress I had was very cheery and attentive ! I ordered the stacked nachos but warning if you order these you need at least 2 people to eat these! The portion is huge and the price was reasonable the bolt reason for the three stars is because the nachos tasted okay and kind of bland.
