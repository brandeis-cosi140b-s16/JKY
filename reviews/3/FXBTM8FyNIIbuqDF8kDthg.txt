Food here is good, predictable, sometimes enjoyable, but most often falls short. Today I had the chile relleno meal11 which cost just over $8 dollars.  Not cheap but not overly priced either. It's really a good plate but the
Chili Rellenos had very little flavor. They are served with rice and beans,  and salsa.  You get some guacamole not much and a little sour cream and a gigantic tortilla. One thing's for sure if you eat everything on the plate you will not leave hungry. But as I said there is not much flavor to this meal. Thank goodness you can have free salsa green and red and chili and hot carrots. For a quick meal, I say go ahead. But for anything else, I would look elsewhere!
