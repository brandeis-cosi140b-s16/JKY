A very solid fast-food Mexican establishment.  Los Cabos serves up quick Mexican food at a very reasonable price.  During my visit here I tried the cheese enchilada combo.  The meal came out hot; however, I noticed that the tortillas used for the enchiladas were somewhat stale at the edges.  Serving sizes were generous and overall service at the restaurant is fantastic.  Chips come complementary with your meal.  While the actual tortilla chips are solid, the salsa is a standard watery roja-type concoction used in many other Mexican restaurants.  Overall my initial impression is that Los Cabos is a quick, cheap and solid establishment, but certainly nothing to write home about.  I will be sure to give this place another shot in the near future.
