My wife wanted to try Cafe Rumba again so off we went along with our friend Kathy R. Kathy got the shredded beef burrito. She told Carol & I the place reminded her of Chipotle only better. My wife Carol got the pork burrito beans, cheese and sour cream. I ended up getting the same dinner as she did. The burrito was served with chips and mango salsa and a drink. 

I must admit I enjoyed it much better than the beef we had there on our first visit. In fact that is why I gave it a higher rating than on my last visit. 

I didn't realize they also had a selection of several different kinds of salsa. So I tried the pineapple salsa and two others. They really added to the over all flavor of the food. 

FOOD: Very fulfilling - fast and efficient.

Another nice thing is that when you dine in they have complimentary chips to accompany your meal. SERVICE: Staff was nice, and the service was up to par AMBIENCE: Looks pretty much like a typical fast food restaurant. CONCLUSION: Their portions are always large so you really get your money's worth.
