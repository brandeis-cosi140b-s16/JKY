Still reliably "decent."  Food is just okay in my book.  I don't care for either the red or the green chile or their supposedly "award-winning" tamales, but I am a fan of the tijuana tacos and their guacamole tostadas, the latter mostly because they heap on a ton of guac and I can convince myself they are "heart healthy" and eat it all guilt-free.

Pretty bad service tonight for the last half of our meal, but I can't blame the server.  Somehow he got stuck with a table of 8-10, all straggling in separately and indecisive, plus two other tables arriving at the same time.  I actually saw our server running through the restaurant, and I mean running.  Yet, we saw plenty of other employees virtually comatose.  Nice teamwork there.  On the plus side,  my husband was lucky enough to catch a glimpse of Arizona's next parent of the year digging the fruit out of her cocktail and feeding it to her baby.  At least give the baby her own drink.  Geez!
