Cheap lunch or dinner spot. Didn't try breakfast so can't comment on that. Guacamole and chips were good. Salsa was hot. I had fish tacos (street tacos so small), they were ok a little too much cabbage. We also has taco salad, and tacos both with ground beef. Ground beef a little dry. Food was out fast. Pepsi products served. Service was good.
