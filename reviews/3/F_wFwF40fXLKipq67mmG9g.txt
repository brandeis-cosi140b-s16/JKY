Food is good, but a over priced for what you get.  The food tastes just like the food at Costa Vida. I'm not sure what chain come first, but they are nearly clones of each other.  I also was a little frustrated that they didn't have any baby Chang stations available.  This made for a major pain when changing my kid's diapers on the bathroom floor. 

It was very busy when I came in,  but the line moved at a reasonable speed, and staff was friendly.
