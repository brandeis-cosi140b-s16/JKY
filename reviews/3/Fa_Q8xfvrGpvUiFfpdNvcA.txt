Came here on a busy night with a large group and the girls up front accommodated us very well.  The vibe was also excellent loved the music they were playing. Now on to the food and drinks, the food was not that great since it's suppose to be mexican it really didn't hit the spot for me who puts crumbled cheese on rice... :/ the drink I got was pretty average nothing I haven't tasted before and everything was a little overpriced but come on it's Vegas what isn't overpriced .
