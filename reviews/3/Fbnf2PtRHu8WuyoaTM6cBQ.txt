The funny thing for me and Baja Fresh is that I was never a huge fan. BUT... I became more of a convert after I saw the show "Undercover Boss" on CBS. The big message I took from it was the work that goes into the food and keeping things very fresh... especially for a "chain restaurant". 

Big plus for me is definitely the "salsa bar". It's tough making a decision when there is a Chipotle directly across the street! And a more upscale Mexican food restaurant in the same shopping center (Pinatta Nueva). 

The food here is good, not outstanding. I also think that it is a little pricey for what you get (portion wise). Given a choice.. I will try to seek out a Filiberto's any day of the week! (Please do not flame me for that comment!!!)  

The other good thing about this location... is if you have some room left in your belly.. there is a Cold Stone directly next door for dessert!
