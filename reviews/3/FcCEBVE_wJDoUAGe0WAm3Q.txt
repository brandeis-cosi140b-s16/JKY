okay so Rand H. and I when here for a quick bite to eat I ordered a macho combo burrito and I added steak to it for an extra dollar. I also ordered french fries and a small drink it was a combo with the dollar hop up. Anyway my meal came to around eight bucks and change, an Rand
told me I could get for the same money at Juan's Authentic Mexican Food
or at Filiberto's a heck of a meal for the same money. But what the hey there we were. I hate it was full but it was nothing spectacular. And the help was an awful and the place wasn't anything special. So three stars to eaks out of my forgiving mouse hand. That's all I have to say about that.
