Since the Hilldale area is not know for their breakfast in the immediate area, one Saturday morning recently, my Dad and I visited.  Now I had been here for lunch and dinner, and saw that it was pretty popular.  I enjoyed the outdoor seating, when you can get it, but unless you love the sound of small children screaming in an echo chamber (One lil' scamp kept throwing his hard, plastic toy on the concrete, as hard as he could one evening I was there.)  Anyway, I thought I would try it for breakfast, and I have to say, it was pretty good.  I had heuvos rancheros, which were nicely spiced, with black beans and potatoes on the side.  They also had a huge piece of blue corn bread that I ordered as extra with agave dipping sauce.  Not sweet like most Northern corn bread, but still 'cakey'.  Coffee wasn't the best tasting, but I've come to expect that from west side places.  Best of all, only adults were occupying the tables, and it was blissfully peaceful.  I'm just afraid they are going to discontinue b-fast at Pasquels, since there is so few patrons.  They also have a few bakery goods on sale, and a coffee nook with a tv.
