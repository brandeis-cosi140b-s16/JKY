It's a typical bar. Good happy hour and late night specials though. Service could always be better, but that's true of most Dos bars. What brings us back to this one is the location, the food, and the cheap drinks. Oh, and the gigantic Jenga blocks or cornhole keeps the evening fun too.

There are DJs on some nights and every Thursday is ladies night, so the ladies get a special discount on drinks.
