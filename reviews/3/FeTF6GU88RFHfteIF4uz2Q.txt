So far so decent.
I mean yeah I've had better...much better...but it'll do for the area.  Maybe there's a better place to get good tacos around, but I'm new downtown so I dunno.  
There's a taco truck guy down in Maricopa that serves this size of taco for about the same price.  So I'm used to these itty bitty things.  3 for $7 at Vitamin T?  Not horrible, especially considering where you're at.
I've had the pibil, carne asada, and barbacoa.  The pibil was the least memorable of the three - kinda bland and didn't mesh with the cabbage and pickled onions.  
The carne and barbacoa were really tasty.  The meat was marinated like a mother and juicy.  What I really liked was that the tacos were chocked full each time.  
I'm not picky about my tortilla, but I guess these are flour.  Soggy, yeah.  But its not meant to be nice and neat.
I also tried a torta, I think it was ado...abo...abdo...something that starts with an 'a'.  Didn't know what a torta was until I got this.  Again, they didn't skimp on the meat.  Whatever bread was used was great, too.  A different kind of sandwich if you're tired of subs, paninis and such.
As far as service, who really cares at a place like this?  You get what you get.  Its downtown.  They aren't rude or anything.  Friendly enough.  
The place itself is small, but at the time of this writing there is some construction going on (in fact they were closed yesterday due to this)...not sure if the construction to make it bigger here or what, but they need to.
They usually have a salsa bar here.  It went missing when the construction started.  I like messing around with salsa bars mixing this and that, and they had some decent picks.
I'll be going here regularly.  One $2.50 taco is good enough for lunch, it actually fills you up due to all the meat.  I'm sure there's a pun there somewhere.
