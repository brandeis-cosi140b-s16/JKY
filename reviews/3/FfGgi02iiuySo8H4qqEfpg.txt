This is my second try at Laredo's, and I'll admit that it is better than the first.

My first time also happened to be my first mexican restaurant in Wisconsin, period. I had high expectations coming from Kansas, the land of the mexican restaurants, and I was let down.

Upon having tried probably 10 mexican restaurants in the Madison area, I guess this one isn't so bad afterall. It is your run of the mill mexican food. I'd say this warrants 3 stars.

Spend the extra 2 bucks for a soda here. This is one of those places where the water tastes like it came out of a tin can.

This place is pretty empty both times I've been, and the food comes super fast. (I get easy bean burritos though) They have good service overall.

I guess I'll be back in the future. Sigh
