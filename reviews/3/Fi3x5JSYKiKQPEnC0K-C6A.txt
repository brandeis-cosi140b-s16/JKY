This place feels like a rip-off of Chipotle right down to the tables and signs...Just like Chipotle, it has an aluminum interior with the same browns, same looking booths, and the same way that Chipotle sells its burritos...The only difference is, its higher prices, more selection of drinks, and the decision of white or brown rice and whole-wheat or flour tortilla...The food was ok, I think Chipotle is better, but Zaba's was pretty much the only place open in the parking lot at 10:50 AM...
