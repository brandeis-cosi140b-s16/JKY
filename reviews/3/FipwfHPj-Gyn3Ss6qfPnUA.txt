I'll start this off by saying, this is no tex mex cantina, nor a hole in the wall eatery.

But its pretty darn good for a station casino, I wish they had better happy hours that extended to the table, but hey, I'll take what I can get!  

My husband and I had a blast drinking one too many pina coladas and our sever was great too. The chips, salsa and bean dip where fantastic, and kept on coming! 

The sopapias where okay, glad I didn't pay for them, thanks Yelp!
