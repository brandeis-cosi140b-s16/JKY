I tasted my first Qdoba burrito last night. I went with the Queso Steak burrito. The burrito was hearty with lots of meat, rice and beans topped off with pico and some cheese and sour cream. My wife enjoyed her chicken burrito bowl with similar ingredients.

I've had many burritos from taquerias to the burrito chains. Qdoba falls somewhere in the middle. I would gladly take a Qdoba burrito over a Chipotle or Una Mas burrito any day based on my initial experience.

The staff was friendly and we were in and out for our take out order within 3-5 minutes.
