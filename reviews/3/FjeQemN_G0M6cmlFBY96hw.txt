16 of went to RuRu's for dinner Thursday night. The service was attentive and the food was good. The steak fajita was excellent. The meat was perfect - slight char on the outside and medium rare on the inside. 
The only note of distaste was the 23% service charge automatically added to the bill. The waitress commented that 20% was for her, which I have no problem with, and 3% was for the person who took the reservation. Since when does an employee deserve $18 for taking a 1 minute phone call for a reservation. That my friends is a ripoff.
