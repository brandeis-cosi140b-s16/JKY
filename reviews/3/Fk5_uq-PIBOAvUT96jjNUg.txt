Went for dinner tonight to celebrate my Aunt's birthday, she had never been before and wanted to try it out. She liked the festive atmosphere of the restaurant. I had not been in years, and was happy they still served the baja chimi I liked- with the spicy cream cheese. SO not a healthy choice, but worth it because you get plenty of food and you have lunch the next day. ;-) The service started out ok.  Then the dinner rush hit and our service slowed down. They also brought out 3 of our 7 meals, then 5 minutes later brought out the rest. Thought that was weird. All-in-all it's a decent place to go once in awhile, but not to go out of your way for.
