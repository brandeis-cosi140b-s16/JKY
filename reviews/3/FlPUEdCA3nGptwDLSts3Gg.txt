The whole experience was mediocre compared to a Robertos, Betos, or a Rancherito. Fairly simple restaurant that is clean. The employees were very nice. Wait time for the food took a while. I ordered the Carne Asada super burrito which tasted like any other burrito that you would order at Robertos didnt really stick out, plus it lacked flavor. Next I ordered a shrimp taco which was super simple, the shrimp seemed like it came from a prefrozen bag from Costco or something. The only that the restaurant has going for then is their horchata which is amazing and their fried ice cream. The fried ice cream was good but small in quantity. Amazing presentation though. The price for all of it was a bitt over priced for what I got.
