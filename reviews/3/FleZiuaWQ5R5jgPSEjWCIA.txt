So I woke up this morning telling my loved one that Waffle House sounds good... Our local Waffle House has been under remodeling and after calling and getting no answer, she decided she wanted "something different" After jumping on yelp she came up with a hot dog buffet!?!? I am known for my love of a good hot dog, not just any run of the mill dog. We arrived to a near empty parking lot in a strip mall and walked into an even emptier place to eat. We were immediately greeted, and had both the Sunday breakfast buffet and hot dog buffet explained. We both ordered the frys/hot dog buffet. The fries and tater tots were great and even better with the chili and cheese sauce provided dumped on top with some onions. We both chose the Sabretts skin on and a Italian Sausage which were both very good. She now knows what I mean when I tell her a good hot dog should snap when bit into. All in all, the food was good and a great deal with the coupon which she always manages to find. It was a little out of the ordinary for a Sunday morning, but I know where I can get my fill on good hot dogs when I have the urge now.
