Every time I am out until late, this is what I crave before I go home.  They offer all kinds of meats from tripe to tongue, the tacos are small but very tasty and they give you grilled onions or peppers on the side if you ask.  They have this dish called MULAS which is basically a sandwich made of tortillas, with the meat of your choice, cheese, and beans and it is absolutely yummy.
Their tripe is pretty good, although I'd prefer it more crunchy!
Adobada tacos are AMAZING and the steak are good also.



After hearing how dirty this place operates and watching them pouring lard into a tortilla I don't like it that much anymore...... still tastes good but ew!
