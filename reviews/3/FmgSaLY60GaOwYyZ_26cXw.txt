TL;DR
Pricey, decent, good texture, long beach. 

Sushi? Love. 
Burritos? Love.
Pick and choose style eateries? Love. 
Jaburritos? :(

Having eaten Jaburritos 3 times now I can't say I'm a fan no matter what the hype says. It isn't terrible, its pretty decent, but so many aspects makes it a place that I wouldn't eat regularly. It isn't exactly mind blowing, and really more so a giant hand roll that isn't so giant. Smaller appetite patrons may be satisfied after one sushi burrito, but larger appetite patrons may consider getting 2, which ends up costly. Consider quickly though because the lines are tremendously slow and as the place gets busier it'll only take longer. I have been in line for at most 20 minutes, which isn't bad for a sit down, but for a pick and choose restaurant its rather slow. Lunch breakers consider ordering ahead of time.The Long Beach may be the best of the ones I've tried.

The sauces are great here (my favorite is queso, weird eh?) but mask most of the flavors of the fish which seems counter intuitive if you're here to eat fish.                There is good texture though, with creamy and crunchy being most prominent. The salsa cups are paper cups but a larger variation is needed for dine in (there is 2 separate cups for dine in and take out), too small to be useful for chips. 

There is a variety of prices for each burrito ($6-12) but seems to be a bit expensive for the size.
