Went with a group of about 10 girls for 5 de mayo. We had reservations and our table was ready for us as our arrival staggered. The salsa was addicting hot and the bean dip was pretty good too. We ordered our drinks and my frozen margarita tasted more like water, sent it back. My friend sitting across me literally waited for about 20 minutes for her beer and we had to remind them. The whole time we were confused as to who our server / busser was, there was like 4 different people servicing our table.  

The pi√±a colada looked pretty cool as it is served literally in a pineapple. I ordered the pescado frito 'fried fish' and it was good. 

Overall, service was crap, food was your normal for a Mexican restaurant but it's a little bit over priced. The ambiance was fun and we were there to get drunk and have a good time, and we definitely did.
