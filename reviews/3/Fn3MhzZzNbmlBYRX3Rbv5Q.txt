Eaten here 3 times since Nov 2014:  Have tried the chicken enchiladas, breakfast burro, and chicken flautas.  The chicken flautas were dry and flavorless, but the other two meals were of good quality and portions for the money.  The chips and salsa here taste freshly made, and the drinks are relatively cheap.  It has a neighborhood bar and restaurant feel about it, and appears to attract a wide variety of customers from gay couples on dates to families with kids in high-chairs--something I particularly like to see. It's a well-worn place to be sure, but the family that runs it seems to keep it pretty clean.
