This is in the basement of the Wachovia Bank Building in the back by college street and 3rd. 

I waited all week to eat here for the Tamales on Friday. They were chicken with red sauce inside. 

In your styrofoam container you get 2 Tamales($8) and whatever toppings you want on them from behind the counter. All the standard stuff, rice, beans, sour cream, onions, queso sauce I got put on top, plus some sauteed zuchinni. 

I needed more hot sauce on it to make it to my liking, but since I was already outside in the hallway and it was super crowded now I didn't get any. Make sure you get anything you might want on your food before you walk out.

Most of the staff is latino. You can't eat inside and it got pretty busy just after noontime. You can sit outside in the hallway they have 3 tables and there are some more down the hallway in front of another eatery.
