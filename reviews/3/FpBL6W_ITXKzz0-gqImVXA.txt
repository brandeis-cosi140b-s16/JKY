Arrived at lunch on a Friday with a Groupon.  I was surprised at how large the place was although it was not particularly busy.  The server was friendly and quick to the table as was the free chips and salsa.  The salsa was different in that it had the consistency of a bottle of 'taco sauce' or ketchup but I thought it was surprisingly tasty.  It is a sauce so not chopped up tomatoes, peppers, etc. Chips were also good.  My wife had the lunch special (taco and enchilada) while I had the chile colorado which I always order if it is available on a menu.   She reported that it was 'good' not exceptional and my chile colorado, I felt, was a little bland.  However, everyone's taste is different and others may like it.  However, it was a very large portion and I had to make sure I ate the chile colorado with only a little rice and beans or I would not have been able to finish it!   My only complaint is that we did not see our server again (and I would have liked to try a little more of the salsa) and then we had to wait a little too long for the bill but the restaurant had gotten busier by that time as well, so that perhaps played into the delay.   Seemed like a good place to take a group as there was plenty of room (and there was one group there of about 12) and the decor was nice and the parking lot was large.
