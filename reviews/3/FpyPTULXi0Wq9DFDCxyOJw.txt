Ya know this place is ok in a pinch if you're in the area and want a quick lunch as in in their Buffett, which is one of the only Mexican Food restaurants in the valley that still offers one!  Beef Fajita meat has a good marinated flavor! Three stars because it's not the best I've ever had, far from the worst, just somewhere in the middle, definitely edible....I'm just a Mexican food fanatic, and certainly know the best places in the Valley to go.  This place doesn't make my top 10.
