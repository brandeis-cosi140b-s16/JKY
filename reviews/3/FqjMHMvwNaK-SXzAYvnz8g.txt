Just not up to par for I want from a Mexican spot. 
Better than Taco Bell or Chipotle? HELL YAH! 
I went with 2 tacos, red pork and red beef. Went with the refried beans and rice on the side. It was OK. Tortillas weren't soft, meat was a bit chewy, but the fresh ingredients were very good. 
Also order Chips and Queso, very basic and boring. 
I'd probably go back b/c they're down the street from my office, but wouldn't go out of the way for it. 
If you're all the way up north, strapped for time and want Mexican food....Its probably worth a shot. Just not very Legit in my book.
