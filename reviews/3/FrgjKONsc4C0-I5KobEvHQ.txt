The food was good, albeit a bit spicy.

My wife is very sensitive to spicy foods, and can't eat any at all. We asked the server if the food was cooked spicy, she assured us it wasn't - that the only spicy item would be the salsas or the barbacoa, but the chicken was not spicy. However, my wife couldn't eat her burrito, as it was far too spicy. I tasted it, and there was a decent zing to it.

Other than that, the food was fresh and well-cooked. They had just swapped out the black beans and white rice when we walked in with a fresh batch, so those items were very good. The barbacoa had good flavor, although the cook was a bit heavy-handed with the spicy seasonings. That seems to be a trend here.

The guacamole was decent. For almost $2 extra to put a dollop of guacamole, it needs to be much better than it was for me to buy it again.

All in all, Chipotle doesn't stand out for me among Moe's, Qdoba, or Salsarita's. It's nice that the food is all organic, but it doesn't matter when it's killed with spice.
