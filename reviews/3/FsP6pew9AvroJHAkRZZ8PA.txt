Can I admit something?  I don't get all the hype about Chipotle.  Is it better than fast food? Yes.  Is it better than other "fast casual" places?  Depends... I'd say it's better than Qdoba, but on par with, say, Noodles & Co.

I've patronized this location a few times (albeit not lately).  It's super-crowded at lunch, but the employees are efficient and the line moves fast.  I've only ever ordered the burritos here--which is what they're known for--and they've been fresh and tasty, but nothing worth really going out of my way for (hence the lack of recent visits).  Also, they're a calorie bomb, so think twice before indulging if you're trying to lose weight.  I like the guac, but I don't like the upcharge for it.

If you want something different than the usual options, you can try ordering the secret menu options (e.g., quesorito, nachos). However, I'd recommend doing so on the off hours, so as not to annoy the employees (I haven't tried ordering any of them myself, but I've heard stories...).

If it's the weekend and you want a great taco, I'd recommend walking two blocks up Atwood and patronizing a local establishment (Las Palmas). 3.5 stars.
