The mr. and I stopped here for a quick bite on the way to the grocery store.  We dined in this time, which had its ups and downs.

I opt for the 2 shredded beef taco plate and the Mr. tried the shrimp tacos.  We grabbed our drink, chips and salsa and sat.  The mild and hot sauces were very good causing me to up my star eating from last time.  I'm typically a "hot" chick- but even the mild had me going back for thirds.

The dining area was slightly better than a fast food spot and one table near the soda fountain had two rags laying out.  The floor was not very clean near the fountain either.

Our platters arrived which looked yummy- nice size servings of rice and beans.  My tacos were crisp and not stingy! The beef was a good consistency, typical lettuce and finely shredded cheese.  The only downside is when you see oil drip on your plate as you eat. 

His shrimp tacos were definitely healthier as the corn tortilla was not fried.  The shrimp were freshly cooked though quite small.  He also opted for whole (not refried) beans which were fresh & homemade.

We will be back for the salsa and to try more menu options at this hidden gem.
