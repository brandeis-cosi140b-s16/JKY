My wife and I tried this place a few days ago for dinner Local Dines gift cert in hand ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ).  I was uber excited to eat here because I love Mexican type food and their menu looked fantastic.

I absolutely loved the decor inside but since the patio looked great and the weather was perfect, we sat outside.  Their patio is perfectly chill and great for people watching.

Our service was kinda blah and was as if our waiter didn't really give a sh*t.  He wasn't bad or unfriendly though.  Just blah.

The margarita, sangria and cheviche were ok but not memorable.

This "chips" and salsa they give you to start are very unique.  They are  fried plantains and some other stuff which were very unique but I really didn't care for them.  I prefer plain old chips with my salsa.  Both the salsas were very good and one of them had a nice kick to it.

The guacamole was unique as well.  Needed more chips and needed some spice to give it more taste or something.  I think they tried to get too fancy with it.  Was worth a try though but I wouldn't get it again.

The highlight of my meal was the chile relleno.  It wasn't fried or battered in anything.  It has a great kick to it and was filled with great stuff.  I wasn't sure I was going to like that it was filled with veggies but it was simply fantastic.  I would return just for that.
