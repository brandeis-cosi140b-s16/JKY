This is another one of those places where it is what it is.  Don't come in thinking it's the be-all, end-all and you'll be fine.  It's basically like Qdoba or Chipotle.  There's nothing overly special about it, but nothing wrong with it either.

I got a chicken burrito.  It was really good.  I liked it.  It was overloaded with toppings.  I can't hate.  Was it beyond expectations?  No.  But it was solid and I didn't feel like I overpaid.  

I'll go back in the near future.  

Oh, and try the Boylan's Root Beer.  It was unique and good, if you like root beers.
