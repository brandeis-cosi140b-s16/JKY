Way too much tortilla to meat ratio on my chimichanga.  Last few times I have been there the food was "less than".  Less meat especially.   Chips were all flopped together and not separated when cooked so you had to pry them apart when you eat them.   So they all fell apart into little tiny pieces.   Not in a big hurry to go back.
