Went on a Tuesday before a comedy show and it happened to be $2 taco night. The tacos were good and salsa was too. The only thing that lacked was the service. Our group along with maybe two more were the only people in the restaurant. The staff seemed frazzled at times, like they couldn't keep up and the food took at least an hour to get out to us. Will probably go back, but it won't be when I need to get some where in a hurry.
