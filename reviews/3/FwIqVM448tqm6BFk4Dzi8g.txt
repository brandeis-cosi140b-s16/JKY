Very clean but food is a little on the pricey side considering there is a taco shop across the street. I was disappointed with their aguas frescas because their menu makes it sound like they carry different flavors but they only had horchata and jamaica. The only reason I would buy food from here again is because they deliver for free since I work close by.
