Just alright... I'm not a hater;

Chips were good, but, the "salsa" was a bit more like "taco sauce".
Frijoles were runny, rice was okay.
Chicken taco and chili relleno were the best things our small group tried enchiladas, shredded beef burritos and so on. All getting a taste.

Being from SoCal, my Mexican food "bar" is higher than most. My work travels thru New Mexico and Arizona have just added to my palate.

Owner advise; As the Teakwoods before it's problem (GET A WATER FILTER!) the water taste like it came from a garden hose, it trully  does effect anything you make with that crappy water, both food and beverages.

BTW- Be careful, the skim coat on the concrete is slick! My wife almost ate it.
