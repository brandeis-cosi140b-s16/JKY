"Even bad Mexican food is good."  That's what I always say.  This place is pretty good actually.  I really like the tortillas-big and thin.  Reminds me of the tortillas I used to eat from a Mexican bakery when I was little.  The kind  that are so big, you can punch holes in them and wear them.  Hey, it's fun when you're 5!

Anyway, I do like the food overall.  I really like the fact there's a drive-thru, so when I'm looking and feeling my worst, I don't have to worry about people thinking, "the last thing she needs is a taco plate."  

Why only 3 stars you ask?  Because the meat is...well, you know how when you cut up a roast and throw out all the fatty, grisly parts.  I think they comb the streets for those parts.  But, they do make 'em taste pretty darn good.
