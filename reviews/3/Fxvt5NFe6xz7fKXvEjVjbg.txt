Solid family-run Mexican joint- props for the diverse menu (check out the new additions section) and the drive-thru. Service was also polite, and there are both hot and mild versions of red and green salsa available.

Hard shell chicken tacos are  a touch overpriced at $2.25, considering they don't have much in them but they're generous with the cheese. Happy to see the California burrito on their menu, served with carne asada, as it should be- hefty size, not much in the way of fries/potatoes but good overall flavor.

They have a special section of the menu for skillet-type meals that feed two for a good price, and come with a stack of tortillas. Several tortas on the menu, including a mega and a pambazo.
