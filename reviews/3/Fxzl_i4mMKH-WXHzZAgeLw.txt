Gave this place a second try before writing a review and it didn't help.  I am from NM (Santa Fe) and this place really does not deserve to be called NM Food.  I will admit their Red Chili is good, but their Green is pretty bad.  It actually had a floury texture to it and not very spicy at all.  When I saw the word "burro" on their menu I knew they were trying to cater to Arizona crowd because no one in NM calls it a burro.  The chips and salsa were okay, but only because they were free.  The first time we were there we ordered two enchilada plates, mine with red and my wifes  with green.  When we got home they decided to make both xmas which was annoying because I was pretty clear when ordering.  We also tried the "burro" which was about average.  In summary I was hoping for a Little Anita's takeout and got a Filibertos.
