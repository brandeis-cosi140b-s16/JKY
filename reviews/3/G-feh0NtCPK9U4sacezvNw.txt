Man, I was stoked to try this place and really disappointed with my first visit.  The decor is awesome and the bar is comfortable.  Unfortunately we sat at the bar for nearly 10 minutes before we could even get a drink menu. The bar staff was nice enough but they certainly didn't convey the same kind of friendly service that we're used to in Gilbert.  The skinny cholla margaritas were great but served in a small glass FULL of ice and definitely not worth $9!  It was over an hour from the time we walked in, sat and the bar and were seated versus their estimate of 35 minutes.  We had time so that wasn't a huge deal.  The food was pretty good, but definitely not worth the price.  We had 2 margaritas, guacamole, ceviche, one taco and the carnitas plate and our bill was over $80 with tip!  All in all, the place is cool, the vibe is right and the menu is right but the prices are WAY too high for what you get.  There are a lot of options in Gilbert that offer great food for a reasonable price with friendly staff that are genuinely pleased to serve you.  Hopefully Barrio Queen can make the adjustments to their menu and their people to become a better fit for Downtown Gilbert.
