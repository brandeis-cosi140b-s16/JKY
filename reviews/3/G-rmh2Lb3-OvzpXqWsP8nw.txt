I mean who doesn't love chipotle? Yumm! It's always fresh and delicious. But since when does it cost just about $30 to eat "semi fast food" for two people? Craziness! It seems to be getting more expensive every time we visit. Funny thing is we are creatures of habit and always order the same thing. It's not about the food, and this particular location always has a huge line but good customer service, the problem is I'm starting to feel like I'm not getting what I'm expecting for my money. At these prices we might as well go to a nice sit down restaurant and be served.
