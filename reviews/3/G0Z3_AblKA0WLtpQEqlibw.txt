Stopped in here for a quick drink and snack before a show. The Vine is really cool especially if you sit at the bar towards the back it opens up onto the link shopping alley. The bar is really impressive and the sangria was good we had the chips and salsa and chips and guacamole guacamole is served with pomegranate seeds on the top which made it really excellent
