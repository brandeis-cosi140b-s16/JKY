We liked this place... mostly because it was half priced fajitas night (Tuesdays)... I think if we had paid full price, this might not be a three star review.

The fajitas were really tasty, but not earth shattering. What WAS awesome was the roasted corn with their southwest chipotle dressing on it. I may have to eat corn on the cob that way at home! The cilantro rice was interesting and tasty too. Beans... not so much.

Someone mentioned below about the salsa and chips not being free after the first serving.. I have to agree that is a serious bad mark against the restaurant. Their salsa is one of the best I've had. I wanted more of it.. but no way was I going to pay for it. That's just crap. It costs them next to nothing for chips and salsa. Don't be so cheap with it.

My wife said the guacamole was very good.. I don't eat it so you have to take her word for it.

In summary, go there on Tuesday nights for half price fajitas. It's well worth it just for that.
