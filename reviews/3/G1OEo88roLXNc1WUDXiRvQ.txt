I went here for a nice Valentine's day meal. I made a reservation for the atrium but we were originally sat at an inside table. I spoke to the hostess and she got us to our desired table. The food was fantastic service was not very good and the waitress was short with her replies and made my fiance inferior for asking about a sauce. However my fiance did order a cocktail that she did not care for and they tried add cranberry juice to it to give it less of a "boozy" taste. That was nice. She ended up getting the cocktail switched to a soda and we were not charged for it. The atmosphere was nice but don't expect to be in and out in a timely manner.
