We came here on a friday night and the place was super packed.. We had to wait about 25 minutes to get our table. The service was awesome, everyone here was very nice and very attentive. The food was pretty good but nothing special.. The decor and the environment are pretty nice, the best thing is that they are open until 2am! I would probably come back and give it another chance.
