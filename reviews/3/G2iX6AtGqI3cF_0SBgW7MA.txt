First off, I'm surprised (and a bit disappointed!) that I'm not the first to review this place. I was sure no one would have taken the time to review this restaurant/bar inside Terminal 4 of the Phoenix airport!

Well, that being said, it's certainly not worth more than 3 minutes of my time, so I'm going to force myself to keep this short (in fact, I've got the timer going as we speak!). 

The decor inside this place is surprisingly attractive for an airport restaurant and I especially liked all of the mosaic and tile work. The server was efficient and friendly and took our order quickly. The Bloody Mary we had wasn't anything spectacular but was definitely spicy enough and mixed well. The "Mexican Pizza" we ordered (in large part because the server said it was "really amazing") was not actually amazing--however, it was a really large portion for the $7 or so we paid and would be a great thing to split if you're looking to have a quick, cheap meal in the airport that's a notch above the fast food options. 

If I owned this place, though, I'd definitely change the slogan, which says something about "inventive" Mexican food. From a look at the menu and the dish we tried, the food is pretty standard. They'd be better off marketing themselves as a nicer sit-down alternative to the other choices in Terminal 4. 

Done!
