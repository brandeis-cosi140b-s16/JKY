We had COB for a work lunch the other day and it left much to be desired. I did like the guacamole and the hotter salsa, but not much else. Well, the rice wasnt bad either. Maybe it was the whole to go thing, but it wasnt very good. And the sour cream had black things in it? Olives? I dont know, but I didnt find out.
