On our way back from the waste-of-time home show at the Metrolina Expo, we decided to stop for some Mexican food, and this was the first place that we saw.  Well, we didn't really see the place, but we did see the sign out front, and managed to find our way to the back of the strip mall that housed them.

Inside, the restaurant is decent, but not spectacular.  The staff is nice, but not speedy.

The day that we were there, at least, they offered a few specials, and the menu selection was pretty typical Mexican fare - average portions, average food, but nothing outstanding.  A short while after getting home, just about everyone spent an extra shift in the bathroom, though, so something managed to work some magic.

No food poisoning or anything - just some good, old-fashioned beans or grease or who-knows-what that didn't want to stay inside for long.

I don't even remember that there was anything unique about it, other than the short stay inside.  The chips and salsa weren't bad, but then they usually are, unless you're at Valentino's on Sharon Amity.
