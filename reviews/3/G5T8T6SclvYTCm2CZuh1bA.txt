I was lucky enough to meet up here with Christina P for lunch yesterday.  The menu is currently the same as the other beach house with soft tacos, burritos and hot dogs.  They are are planning to add tamales to the regular menu and we got to try a sample of pork tamale and it was tasty.

I got the three tacos for $5 and a lemonade for $3.  There are several flavors of lemonade but I got the plain.  I got one each of fish, carne asada and chicken.  They were all tasty and I tried some of both the green and red sauces on them.  One thing I noticed is the meat didn't stand out on any of them and there was very little taste difference between the three.  All the ingredients were fresh and there was nothing soggy.  I thought the lemonade was good.

They have only been open a week and of course the place is spotless.  The two employees we dealt with were very pleasant.  I always carry cash which is a good thing because that is all they take.  There is an ATM in the lobby.  I haven't been to their other location but I am told it is much smaller. Inside there were 5 2tops and some stools with a couple of tables outside too.  The tables would seat 3 or 4 (cramped) so I think they should have a couple of additional chairs.

Overall I see it as a good neighborhood place to grab a quick bite to eat but certainly not a destination
