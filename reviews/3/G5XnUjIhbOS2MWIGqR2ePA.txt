Came here again at around when it opened. I ordered 2 fish tacos and a chiles rellenos. It took around 7 minutes so not too bad. The fish tacos were alright. Fairly good, but definitely not the best I've had. I would probably get the fish tacos again. The chile rellenos really wasn't good. I've never had one before but I always understood them to be battered in egg whites and deep fried. The chile relleno here was made basically with a charred chile stuffed with cheese inside a slightly overlooked omelet. Literally just an omelet, I saw the cook make it. As for the chips I thought were really tasty last time, they were stale, bland, and cold.
