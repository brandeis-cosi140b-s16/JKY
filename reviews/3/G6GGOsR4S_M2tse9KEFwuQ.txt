two and a half stars, but I pushed it up because they have Thrifty ice cream and that reminds me when I was a kid growing up on 12 street and Northern always going for a $ .35 cent cone.  I like the atmosphere and the set up but I am not all that impressed with the food.  I have been here twice now and nothing grabs me to come back (except the ice cream).  I ordered a enchilada, taco, & tostada plate today and the food was just average.  I didn't even eat the taco, I wish the meat had more flavor.  The beans and salsa are also a test of a good Mexican place and those to was just average.  The tostada was the best on this plate.  I hate to not be a fan since this is the closest Mexican joint near my home but I sure wish I could crave going there.  After the owner was nice enough to contact me I will try it again after I meet him and ask what he may recommend for me.  After that I will most definitely re-review Mi Familia.  Thank you Jim.
