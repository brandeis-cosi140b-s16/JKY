I like Moe's. This location has some of the nicest employees I have ever seen and the food is usually pretty good. I love the burritos and the bowls. They finally have a couple of good salsa options. The drink machine is the bomb - only place I drink a vanilla coke! 

BUT there is a problem:
I had dinner with a friend here and the constant 'WELCOME TO MOE'S' was just too much. I don't usually mind it but during the dinner hours when someone is always coming thru the door - it is annoying and way too loud! I could not carry on a conversation with my friend so the meal was not very enjoyable.
