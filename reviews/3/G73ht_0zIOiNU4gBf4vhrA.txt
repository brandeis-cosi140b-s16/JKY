Went there for lunch before a movie.  I had the chimichanga  with shredded beef.  Very best I've ever had.The beef was very tender and juicy. Just enough spice. And the sauce was not too salty like most places.  My husband on the other hand had house burrito with shredded beef. First few bites were shredded beef but the last 1/3 was some white meat, perhaps pork? It almost taste like turkey. Service very quick, Oscar our server was nice and alert.  My husband didn't complain because he's too polite. I ordered ice tea and they didn't have anything on the table to sweeten it, nor they offered. Which is fine with me because I like my ice tea plain anyways. 
Think worth give this place another try another day
