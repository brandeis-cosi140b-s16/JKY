After a nice cardio class at the gym, we just had to get some protein to replenish our energy.  Roland wanted Mexican food, even though I wanted to go home and eat an Asian Pear and a banana.  He was just too hungry and decided to go to Los Burritos, which is right across the street.  The place is quite small, will several booths.  The food are all on display, kinda like what you would see at the buffet.  This is what we ordered:

-Chips and salsa ($2:50): Decent, but I am used to other places giving free chips and salsa...O well.  

-Shredded beef plate, which includes eggs, potatoes, refried beans, corn tortilla ($6:50): They were all room temperature, except for the eggs.

-Side of guacamole ($.50)-I thought this was cheap.  I used the chips that came with the chips and salsa and dip it in this small side of guacamole.

-Pork Tamale ($2)-This tamale was pretty big compared to all other tamales that I have seen.  It tastes a bit different too.  By that, it is the flavor of the maiz.   It has like a couscous texture, and a bit saltier than the other tamales that I have eaten.  This was our favorite actually.  Different, but in a good way.  

We only finish 3/4 of the food.  Roland's eyes were too hungry compared to his belly.  I just got out of the gym so I didn't want to stuff myself.  Everything tasted decent, but will only come here for convenience.
