I cannot lie. I am in love with their pork enchiladas, but that's pretty much where I draw the line. I think their decor is obnoxious, and the salsa sucks, even though for some godawful reason it was voted best in Phx for 2008... I do not agree, I also think their uniforms are possibly the ugliest I have ever seen. I'm not sure you could pay me enough to wear those bright ass parrot themed button ups. Although the food is decent this place has never been my first choice for Mexican cuisine.. I only came here because the Garcia's across the street was closed down, which upset me to no end because their bean dip is fucking amazing, well was... stupid economy. I had a margarita, and an hour later still have a decent buzz so cheers to the bartender.. The portions are big enough for two dudes, so I always have leftovers.. their service is suffice, but about as boring as this review is. 

I am now in a food coma, from the food baby they served me. Time for a nap.
