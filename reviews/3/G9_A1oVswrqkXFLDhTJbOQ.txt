A big plus for this place is that the BF is from San Francisco and this franchise is from the Bay area, so all the wall decor are pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge, Lombard St. ect... The BF felt proud....Oh Boy.....
Anyhow, the food I thought was good. I got Steak Quesadilla, the BF got a Super Burrito with rice & we got chips with salsa.
I hate rice in my burrito but if you want rice they'll put it in you just have to ask.
The steak was tender and marinated well & the Flour tortilla was made well. 
The BF did not care for his burrito much - he thought  they put too little rice. 
Now, the chips and salsa were hellah good!!! The salsa had a great flavor and it was a dry salsa. (I never knew just how much I love my salsa dry ) I'll forever seek out dry salsa's from now on...
The chips were hellah good as well - what a perfect crisp crunch and texture. 
The Green Sauce was salty/tangy good....
The inside is spacious and the guy behind the counter was quick.
All in all I wouldn't mind coming back- the BF said he'll just try something else next time.
I will be craving their chips and salsa shortly.....
