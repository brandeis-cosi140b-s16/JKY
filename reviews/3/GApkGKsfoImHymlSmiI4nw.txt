Went here tonight by accident, we were looking for a steakhouse that closed down nearby and discovered Don Pedros. The atmosphere is fun and party like. Service is good. The food is fresh but taste is just acceptable. We had the mixed seafood platter and gaucamole. The salt content of everything is high and the margarita was way way overpriced and not good. This is not going to be my go to place for good Mexican food, only for dining in a fun atmosphere. My go to places for food will be on North Tryon or even On the Border is better. But I think this place did a great job of decorating and creating a good social and relaxed atmosphere. Definitely worth checking out for the atmosphere and service, food just happens to be available as well.
