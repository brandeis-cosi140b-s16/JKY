A friend of mine told me about this place.  I stopped in for lunch and inside it was much larger than it looked from the front.  Sort of dark I thought but maybe because the bar is a prominent part of the interior.  Service is so so.  Not many customers for a weekday lunch.  I had a couple of chicken enchiladas with rice and beans.  Made with corn tortillas, they were fine.  I thought both the rice and beans were better than Pedro's.  I thought the price was reasonable.  So this now makes 3 Mexican restaurants I want to keep in the regular lunch rotation that are close.
