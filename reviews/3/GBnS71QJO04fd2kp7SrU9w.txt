SInce the Salsarita's at the Quad closed, this is the closest place to get a quick burrito fix when I am at the office.  I think the burritos are ok here but I preferred the chips & queso at Salsarita's.   I haven't been sickened by the chicken here, but reading that review makes me wonder if I should just drive a little further and head over to Qdoba at Stonecrest when I am in the mood for a quick burrito to take back to the office.
