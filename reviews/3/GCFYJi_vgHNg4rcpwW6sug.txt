Got the Pollo asado quesadilla, grilled fish taco, bean and cheese burrito. $7.20 for a quesadilla seems high. It was good but that felt a little high. Only got one salsa though. And salsa was very mild and watery. The fish taco was OK. Needed more flavor. The sauce on it was good. The bean and cheese burrito was HUGE lots of sheeees. But beans need salt. Overall gave it a 3 star rating because it's new, clean and everyone was nice to us and food came out quick. Standing room only when we went on a Saturday afternoon. Better flavor than the other places in CG (filiburts, vakerrr)  Nicos still better IMO..
