I was craving some mexican food the other day & went to Roberto's which is now called Laurita's. I go inside and it smells spicy! Yum! Order up a chimichanga plate with an extra side of rice. Got it home and it was HUGE. It seriously took me 3 days to eat this thing.
I dont usually eat much ethnic food but I have to say this was not bad..it was not the best I ever ate but is sure beats Taco Bell. LOL
