Okay I only gone once since I was out in the Sun Lakes area and there is not many options for Mexican (That I  can see. No Taco Bell is not real Mexican food folks). It was okay. The portions are generous and the place inside looks clean. Drive through service was prompt and courteous as well as FAST. Ordered a tostada and enchilada by drive thru.  Beans were a little bland for me but the taco sauce that I added helped. Maybe its because its in a well ''Senior Community'' they cater to people who cannot take spice? *Shrugs* Will give it another go because I prefer to support smaller business over the big chains. Nice but as someone who hails from S Ca Ive had better.
