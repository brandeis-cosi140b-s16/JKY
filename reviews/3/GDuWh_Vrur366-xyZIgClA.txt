Short and sweet. Great food but a bit high priced. The service wasn't bad, we went at the ultimate lunch hour with a full house so you're bound to fall into hold ups. The only unattractive thing about the locale really are the prices, I mean I understand the location is in Scottsdale, but c'mon now. It made me really appreciate my hole in the wall dive mexican food joints.
I will say that I'm huge critic about hispanic restaurants salsa, and their hot is pretty damn good w/ fresh chips always.
