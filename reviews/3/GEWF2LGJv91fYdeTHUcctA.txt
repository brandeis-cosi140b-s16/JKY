I've been a few times and I can't say that I've ever been blown away by it. Granted, I typically am only ever here right before they close up (10pm for a taco shop? Lame.), but there are other taquerias that I definitely get more excited about.

I still enjoy coming here and love the burritos, but I would recommend giving some other taco shops a shot before swearing your allegiance to Los Favs.
