I usually don't like chicken, but when i do, its Pollo Loco. I love their dark meat, so juicy and flavorful, and especially their skin, so crunchy. Some people may say the skin is a little salty but i think its just perfect. I don't usually get anything else but the chicken, but i have tried some of their other items in the past. 

When it comes to sides, i love their fries because they are soft and squishy. The beans are pretty good as well. the only item i am not a big fan of is their spanish rice. I think its a little dry and doesn't really taste like real spanish rice should taste like. 

They also have a new under 500 calorie menu. I've only tried the Chicken Enchiladas but i thought it was a great deal, came with two enchiladas plus rice and brocoli. Also the Chicken tacos, 2 tacos, with guacamole and pico de gallo.

Very affordable, efficient, and can be healthy if you choose the right options.
