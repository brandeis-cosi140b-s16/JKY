Not too shabby.

I had the beef taco and cheese enchilada lunch special. It was OK. I would've preferred there to be more sauce on the enchilada and some pico de gallo some where on the plate.

The atmosphere felt authentic, I mean, I have been to Mexico and it felt the same? LOL

I'd like to try this place for dinner when I can check out the drink menu ;)
