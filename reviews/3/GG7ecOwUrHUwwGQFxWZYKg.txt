OK, I am spoiled. I have had really great Mexican food being from Southern CO, living in SOCAL and working in Albuquerque, so... The Old Pueblo Cafe is "OK" Mexican food. But this is a biased opinion. I think in the west valley it is probably one of the best "sit down" places. 

The food is usually pretty good, prices are very reasonable and the homemade salsa is GREAT. The atmosphere is what really makes it a spot I go back to often. The staff is always friendly, fast and accommodating. Plus, in a West Valley World of Chains and bland taste buds, this locally owned, unique restaurant set on a quiet, neat little street is a breath of fresh air!
