it was my first time coming here... to be honest the only reason anyone should ever go to baja is if there isnt a rubios anywhere within a 5 mile radius, the tortillas here were too tough to cut through with a fork and knife.  menu is kind of weird and the service sucked, told her it was my first time and she couldn't recommend anything..

the one saving grace is the salsa there, the baja salsa is so amazing, honestly im thinking of buying the burrito at rubios then going to baja for the salsa..
