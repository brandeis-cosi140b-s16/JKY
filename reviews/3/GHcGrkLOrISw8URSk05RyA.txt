It's not that Taqueria La Casa Del Pastor has changed--they still do a good job.  It's just that my eyes have been opened to the finer side of Al Pastor after this week's Taco Trek UYE.

Taqueria La Casa Del Pastor will still do in a pinch, but if I have the time I will definitely be heading to other parts of the valley for my tacos.

Stop by if you're in the area as their tacos are good here!  Otherwise check out Taqueria El Pastorcito or Taqueria El Buen Pastor.
