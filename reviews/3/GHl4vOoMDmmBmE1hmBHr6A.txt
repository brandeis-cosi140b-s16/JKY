Stopped by with my husband for breakfast burritos the other morning. Nice and clean taco shop, loved the menu board so easy to read. Good burrito, nice salsa bar with decent salsa. the side of refried beans were luke warm at best and still a tad crunchy so that was a bummer but we will try this place again.
