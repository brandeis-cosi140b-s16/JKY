If a successful commerce encounter is one where the business fills a need for the customer, then I must say that my lunch as Fonda las Cazuelas was indeed successful. (The need being a decent, relatively clean, Mexican place near my office.)

They offer a lunch special at the cant-be-beat price of $5.75 for your choice 12-14 entrees (all of which include the standard rice and refried beans) and a (soft) drink. I went for the Enchiladas Verdes with chicken. The food arrived so quickly that I was suspicious it would taste exactly like it came out of a can, but the chicken was well seasoned and the sauce had the tiniest bit of kick. The rice was about average, not crunchy but nothing special. The beans were slightly less reminicent of cat food than many places I've tried, and when mixed with some of the stray cheese crumbles they were downright tasty.

The server was cheerful and attentive, but that may have been because there were only about 4 tables occupied in the entire place. On my lunch hour I was able to comfortably run a 20 minute errand, eat at a comfortable pace and get back to work with 10 or 15 minutes to spare. 

It's safe to say that I'll be lunching at the Fonda again.
