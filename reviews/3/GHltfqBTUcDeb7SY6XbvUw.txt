We have been here before and there always seems to be that little bit of hospitality or smile missing. Three star is bad or good. It just is right. That's how each time here feels. I love the ambiance and the food is generally good. Went with street tacos and the habanero pasta. I loved the pasta. Chicken was cooked right on. Took some Togo. It could've been just service really. It was fine enough. Greet, order, drink refill and check. No mistakes. But it felt awkward, no smiles, no conversation. This place isn't off our list but I doubt it'll be a top priority to get back.
