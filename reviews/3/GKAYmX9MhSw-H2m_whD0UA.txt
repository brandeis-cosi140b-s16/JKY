If you like Chipotle, this is Chipotle. The only thing that separates itself from Chipotle is that "queso" (cheese with peppers in it) they offered to put in the burrito. Other than that it's the same exact thing. They just re-labeled a Chipotle. The food is fake mexican like Chipotle, but served by clueless non-english speaking servers. Know what you want, say it loud, and be prepared to point. Don't make special requests. You'll ruin someone's day.
