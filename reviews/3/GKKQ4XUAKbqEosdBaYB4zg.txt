My husband and I have always ate at Macayos. Enchiladas with Baja sauce, side of refried beans. (Don't care too much for the rice) Last night Chose to get a different Enchilada so I got a cheese one. Just Cheese? No onions inside, no flavor whatsoever. Our Waitress was nice and got our drinks when they got low. Salsa and chips are always good. What I don't understand is, why does it look like we're eating out of a silver dog dish bowl that the chips come in?! Put some paper in there or something! Here's some negatives about the place in general. Dirty! Tables and Booths are nasty, food stuck in the Booth where we were sitting. Table is old and could use a good paint job. They have fake plants hanging from the ceiling that have dust all over them and blowing around near the vents and over customers food! Way too much Decor. Smells like crap when you walk in cause the Men & Womens Restroom is right there as you walk in near the waiting area. Never have Splenda for Iced Tea, C'mon really? You have all the other sugars. I love Macayos food, but they sure do need to keep up with the place. It needs a deep cleaning bad! Play some music too. It sucks to hear everyone's conversations and babies crying around you. Other than all that I mentioned. I'll still come to have lunch or dinner there. :)
