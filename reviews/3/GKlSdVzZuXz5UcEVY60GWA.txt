My wife and I were roaming the industrial and business park area of Phoenix looking for a decent bite to eat, preferably Mexican food. We finally stumbled upon a set of about five Mexican eateries. We decided on Salsitas, which seems to be a chain in the Valley of The Sun.

I wished that the woman had done a better job of speaking and understanding English. The food order was correct, and plentiful, not to mention cheap, but we had specifically asked for forks and were not given any. I had to go to our hotel's front deck and beg the clerk for a couple of plastic forks. 

The burrito was huge and very tasty. I had a couple of Grilled Chicken mini-tacos, and while they were pretty good, they were nothing special and I even found a few pieces of gristle. My wife had a chicken burrito and said it was huge and very good. She could not finish it. They also gave us some hot carrots so that scored well with her.

Ten bucks for all of that, including four salsas and sour cream. Not bad, but I'd like to try more.
