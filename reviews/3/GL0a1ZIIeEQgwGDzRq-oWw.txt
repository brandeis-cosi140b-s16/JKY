Taberna Mexicana food was pretty good.  One thing that was really good was their guacamole with the plantain chips.... WOW! 

For my main course, I had the fajita burger.  It was fantastic and juicy.  The service was great, however the prices are a little steep, and when you walk in to the place, it smells a little like they have a sewer problem, which really curbed my appetite.   Hopefully it was a temporary event.  The food was good enough for me to try again, even though the smell was a little overwhelming at the door.  The next time I go in the restaurant, I hope to report a positive experience so I may up my rating.
