On our recent trip to Vegas, our initial flight was delayed, which caused us to miss our connecting flight, sadly this meant instead of having a fun first night in Vegas we didn't get into town till the wee hours and were exhausted and hungry. Enter Tacos Mexico for a quick, cheap, late night meal. The tacos were good, although not amazing, but they hit the spot and were surprisingly affordable for being so close to the strip. Im pretty sure its open 24 hours, and it has a drive through, so we were able to grab some food and get back to our hotel quickly for some much needed rest. While I would probably never choose to come here during regular hours, I would not hesitate to return for a quick, after hours meal.
