Yes there is sand and yes its a bar, nothing great.. wait.. what.. ahi tacos with jicama tortillas... yeah thats right..... listen up!

Its just like any ole mexican/ cantina/ whatever bar..except... this is the only reason i am writing this... I was super interested in the ahi tacos with a jicama tortilla. what is this you say? they use thinly sliced pieces of jicama instead of a tortilla!! I watch my carbs so this was a famtastic option but the taste was incredible!! I cannot wait to go back!!!!
