We have eaten I at the Border Grill over a dozen times.  It is our first stop when we get to Vegas. Until this last trip, it was five stars all the way.  I ordered the steak quesadilla and the waiter asked me why I would go all the way to Vegas to order something I could get at Taco Bell.  Guess I overpaid...their quesadilla was $17....pretty sure Taco Bell does not have anything that pricy on the menu.  That being said, I have ordered it before, and was not happy with the quality this time.  My husband ordered shredded pork tacos. He didn't feel he got value for his dollar either. He said it was like they "blobbed" refried beans on top of three mini corn tortillas and topped that with over cooked pork shoulder with not much flavor.   I'm hoping there is a new chef or some other kind of transitional phase going on there right now. That being said, I will probably wait 6 months (2-3 trips to Vegas) before trying again.
