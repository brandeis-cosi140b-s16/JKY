I ordered a chicken taco today.   Chicken is the only meat I eat so I cannot vouch for the other options.   What can I say?  It was your basic taco.  Corn tortilla, I couldn't pick up any particular flavor from the chicken.  I guess I was expecting more of a smoky or maybe lime marinade.  Although not a big hit with the flavor, it was moist. The taco also has guacamole, cilantro, and Caramelized onion.   Personally I enjoy the stronger flavor of raw onion.   The menu lists lettuce should be on the taco, but that must have been missed on my order.   Nothing was great, but nothing was bad either.   I was pleased to see fresh brewed iced tea, regular or tropical.
