We stopped by Caminero Mexican Restaurant the other day for breakfast.  We wanted a change to the "norm" breakfast routine and we found it at Caminero.  

They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and offer dine it and take out.  They are small and a "dive-ish" type of place but serve good food.  
I had their huevos con chorizo plate served with re-fried beans, rice and a flour/corn tortilla.  It was a huge plate full of Mexican goodness all for $5.99.  We also had their Mexican omelet which is made using three eggs, green chili's and your choice of meat smothered in their green sauce and cheese.  It too was a lot of food and tasty.

They are some what of a "fast food" place but with very good service and they use real plates for their customer's when dinning in, so don't let the "dive-ish" ambiance deter you from trying them.  You won't be disappointed. I'm looking forward to going back very soon for lunch/dinner.  Hope to see you there.
