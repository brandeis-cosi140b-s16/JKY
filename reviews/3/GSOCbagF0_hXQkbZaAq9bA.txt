Spanish Fly is a great place to go out with friends on a hot day.  The pool adds to the relaxed atmosphere.  The drink specials were great, however our service was incredibly slow both for food and drink.  There were not many people there to bog them down either, it just seemed like the service staff was relatively apathetic.  Overall though, it did not hinder me having a good time.
