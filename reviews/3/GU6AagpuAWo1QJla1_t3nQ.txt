If you blink, you might miss little Los Jarritos.  It's a tiny, free standing building with a cute little dining room.  The lady inside is nice and helpful.  I ordered the mini chimichanga with green chile beef, rice & beans.  The rice & beans were a little bland for my taste, so I mixed them together with some of the salsa, which was tasty.  The green beef was good, and the mini chimi was the perfect size for lunch.  At less than $8, it was a good value.  I will return, but I'll probably skip the sides and order a la carte.
