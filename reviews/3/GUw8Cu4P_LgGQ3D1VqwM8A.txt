It was ok, but nothing that knocked my socks off. Wait rec'd an expensive bottle of wine which w also just ok. All of the food offerings seemed like they were more intent on offering you a spicy food rather than a flavorful one. I am a fan of both but the fire here overpowered any flavor offerings. Others at table felt the same way as even the scallops flavor was hidden by the fire. Busy night in Vegas and hardly anyone here so not so sure how long this one will last unless some changes are made.
