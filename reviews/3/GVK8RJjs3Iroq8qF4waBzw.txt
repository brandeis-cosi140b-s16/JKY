If you love some Asian spice then you've reached your destination, that's if you like kimchee if not then I guess not. 

The first time I came here was with my bf so we ordered the Nate Dogg, we both liked it. It was loaded with flavor mmmm....just thinking about it makes me want some. It's a definitely must try! As for the french fries, it was good but way too salty for me. My second visit was during a Food Truck Fest so I decided to get the beef tacos, it was good not the greatest. I do want to try their sweet dough that I've heard so much about, so I guess I'll be coming back here some time. 

Oh yeah you have to expect the long lines and wait during a Food truck Fest. People always complain about the long lines, so to avoid the long lines go to their main location spot when you can.
