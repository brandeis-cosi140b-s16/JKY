This is a good spot to get good, cheap margaritas after work and a snack. The music was really loud where we were sitting so it was hard to hear each other, but the service was great. We had an attentive, friendly waitress and chips with cheese dip that was yummy. The patio and cabanas look like a fantastic spot to hang out when it is not 115 degrees. : ) Good pick for after a long day at the office!
