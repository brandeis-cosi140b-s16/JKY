Good value overall, their specials are phenomenal with free churros, 2.99 plates and kids eat free days. The bad thing is the service, it's not exactly the warmest or friendliest. My daughter and I got the 3.99 specials one was 3 mini tacos, the other was a burrito both with drinks. Not bad at all for the price.
