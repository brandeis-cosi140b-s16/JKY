Well less than a month after it's grand opening and less than a week after sending out a bunch of Buy One Get One Free entree coupons in the mail (which I didn't even get to USE), Corona Cantina is closing to make way for another Zipps.
Can't say I'm too disappointed. I LOVE Zipps wings and wouldn't mind another sports bar in the area. It just boggles my mind that they would go through all the trouble open a restaurant only to close weeks later.
