This place is the Applebees of Mexican restaurants.  The place is clean but lacks any character.  The food is decent but does not stand out at all, pretty bland and lacking any of the rich flavors of its more traditional counterparts.  The service was good and friendly.  All in all it screams "safe" chain restaurant.  There is much better Mexican food to be found in the neighborhood.
