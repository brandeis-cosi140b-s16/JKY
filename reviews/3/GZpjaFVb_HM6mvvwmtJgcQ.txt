Wow, It has been a long time since I was in a Chipotle since moving to AZ...  Sure their food is good, but compare to Filiberto's they are WAY more $$$ for a burrito and such.  Yeah they have good chips and guac but honestly it will be hard to go there any more with the other selections here in the valley.  They are always clean and friendly when I have been in and no issues with the food, but just the cost & selections vs. the others has me forgetting about Chipotle.
