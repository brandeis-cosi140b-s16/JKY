I went here while visiting charlotte.  The menu is not very big and the food doesn't have a lot of taste. Me and a friend both ordered a chicken burrito and they turned out completely different.  A can of blue moon was $5 for a can, which I thought was kinda high. I probably wouldn't visit here again,  would be a good place to go if youre drunk though.
