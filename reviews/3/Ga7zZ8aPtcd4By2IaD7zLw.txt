I've had the opportunity to dine at this location twice now.  Service has been quick, place is clean and it's a fairly comfortable Mexican restaurant.  So on the topic of Mexican... I get the Carlos, yet the Obriens.... not so much =).  

The top 2 recommend dishes on both visits were the Pollo Fundido and the #13 A Little bit of Everything In Miniature!

Sadly, I have had both and they were both just borderline OK for me.  Not much flavor (though decent serving sizes).  I do not understand why it's so hard to find good, especially authentic tasting Mexican food in Arizona?  Sorry C.O. just not a winner for me.  Best to you and the customers that are fans.

I'd strongly suggest to spice things up.
