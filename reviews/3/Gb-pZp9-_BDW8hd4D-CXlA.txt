Sometimes, the best way to feel good about your life is to see how bad off others have it. 
This is why I propose you take a trip to Mexico this weekend. 
More specifically, Rocky Point.
Just a short four-hour drive from Phoenix, it's there you'll become acquainted with what a real shit-hole existence looks like...up close! 

Unfortunately, that's not the only perspective you'll gain from your travels. 
You'll also have the added pleasure of experiencing what real Mexican food tastes like, realizing how the watered-down, Americanized version of what you've been eating all these years is anything but Mexican. 

And that brings us to Macayo's.
You'll like Macayo's. Do you know why?
Because it's safe. 
Not too mild, not too spicy. Perfect for your white-bread, milk-toast, American tastes. 

See, Macayo's has been around for over 60 years. Unheard of in the restaurant business. And they didn't do it by frying your taste buds, or making you shit like a sick goose the next day.
They did it with consistent menu items, like their red and green chile, or their chicken poblano...perhaps their most flavorful items.
And their spectacular margaritas, chips, salsa, and chile con queso are also honorable mention.
In short, while it may lack authenticity, it's certain to tantalize your taste buds, just enough to make you come back for more...next week, the week after, and the week  after that.

Added note:
Economic times being what they are, a trip to Mexico may be out of the question for some. Even if you do have the money, there's always the prospect you'll never come back alive, dying in a hail of some drug overlord's wayward bullets.

For this reason, I recommend South Phoenix as an alternative to Mexico, where I'm sure you'll find a place that'll give you Montezuma's revenge, burn your mouth and bum, get your car stolen, and leave you in the street sobbing like Mo'niique did in "Precious" after her mom beat her with a shoe.
