reasonable prices. family oriented.food just average. they got great karaoke entertainment............which is why i keep coming back.

nothing negative i can say about the food but nothing special too about it. just AVERAGE........

i wont even dare go to this place if it didnt have karaoke cuz this place is DULL without karaoke. Well,maybe not if you come in big groups as this might offset the boredom.

Karaoke nights are on Friday and Saturday only so take heed.

Nice place for families as kids are allowed during karaoke and that is another reason why my group goes there with their respective families.

My wish is they should start karaoke earlier than 8pm to offset the long rotation for singing. It is family oriented anyway so why not have karaoke start say at 5:30 or at least 6pm?


This is honest unadulterated opinion.........
