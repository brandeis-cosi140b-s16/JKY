Chipotle is a your average step-up-above-fast food Mexican-inspired restaurant.  Think of Qdoba, Moe's, or Salsaritas.  I heard the rave reviews from friends about this chain so I discovered it for myself.

The restaurant was clean (it was brand spanking new at the time) when I visited and the ingredients were fresh.  However, I was dismayed by the lack of options.  The streamlined menu (maybe some people like this) was basically tacos, burritos, or a taco salad.  Nothing particularly original and though the food was good, I wouldn't make a special trip to visit this place again.  This is not to say I wouldn't return, but they are no unique dishes/ingredients that distinguishes it from the aforementioned chains.  

Important note-Chipotle is Cali-Mex, rather than Tex-Mex like the other chains.  Therefore, they have leaner sides; less cheeses and sauces and more fresh veggies.  So, if you're like me and prefer heartier Tex-Mex taste, then Qdoba's, Moe's, or Salsarita's would be a better bet.  If you want a leaner Mexican-inspired meal (but still substantial), you might like Chipotle.
