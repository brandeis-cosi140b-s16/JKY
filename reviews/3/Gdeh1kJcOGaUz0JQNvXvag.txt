The food was really good but the service sucked both times we went there. The last visit there was what really rubbed me the wrong way. We spent 45 minutes waiting for our food (an order of the tres tacos and a quesadilla... not much) and our server came by only once in the 45 minutes to check up on us. Once we finished our food we waited about another 30 minutes for the check in which it took another server to come by our table and ask if we needed anything because she probably noticed how upset we were. We told her we were ready for the check and said we didn't know where our server went. She then said our server had gone on her break and our server never informed us of this. I did not get the chance to get our server's name but she was a brunette covered in tattoos.

Overall the food is awesome but because of the service I have to give it 3 stars.
