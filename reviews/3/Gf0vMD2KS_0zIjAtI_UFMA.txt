The food here is okay but the service leaves something to be desired. Last time I was here, there was a hair in my margarita and I had to be persistent to get seated because there was no hostess at the door. I also called about catering recently only to be told that the manager wasn't available.

All in all, it's decent but there are certainly better mexican restaurants in town.
