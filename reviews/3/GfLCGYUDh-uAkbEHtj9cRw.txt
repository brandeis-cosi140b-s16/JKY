Can be hit or miss. The tacos are usually pretty good and fresh, as are the breakfast burritos. Salsa seems to be more of a hot sauce... I'd say pick up a tub from Trader Joe's and pile that on instead. (Haha.) Chimichangas are a big NO, especially for ye of sensitive colons. I always get a big ol' awkwardly sized styrofoam jug of horchata that I can barely hold in one hand. 

Overall, don't expect a gourmet culinary experience. Also, just park and order from the window when there's more than two cars in the drive-thru or else chance attacking your sleeve, your friend, or yourself out of sheer desperation and hunger.
