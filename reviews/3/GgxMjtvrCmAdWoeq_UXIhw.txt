They Claim the Best Cabeza Tacos in the Valley,south side of Thomas, just beyond Grand Ave.

Do people still talk about stay-cations?  Or has that word of the quarter been replaced by slicker coinage?   If you want a staycation, try Taqueria El Vaporcito.  I almost swore they moved the little truck stop between Hermosillo and Bahia Kino here when I stopped to try the food.

Of course, that superb Mexican Coca-Cola, The REAL Thing in green bottles with bottle opener caps doesn't cost 12 cents any more.  In Phoenix, it's two dollars.  No salsa bar.  It's hot and hotter in plastic squeeze bottles, Cholula and Tapatio in bottles.  
  
Close your eyes, smell the excellence, take a bite of your taco, burn your tastebuds out with some screaming salsa and you too can be right there next to a major Mexican highway enjoying a fine meal.  Thomas Road provides traffic sounds.

Try it.  Do they REALLY serve the best cabeza tacos around?
