This place is in an interesting location downtown. If you can walk here great.  If you can find street parking great. If you can it can be a little frustrating.  However once you find a parking spot or walk here the ambience is very interesting.  The Decour is very Catholic almost bordering on creepy and I am a Catholic. The service is very fast and very good.  I had carne asada tacos with beans and rice.  Unfortunately the reason I gave the place three stars is because the food is just average.  But would I go there again for lunch absolutely it's reasonably priced it's decent and the service was great.
