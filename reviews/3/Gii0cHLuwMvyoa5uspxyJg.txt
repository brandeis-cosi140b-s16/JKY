It's a Chipotle, like all the other Chipotles. Main difference? It's by UNLV, so obviously the lines can get a little out of control during the semester. I tend to hit this one up during the times when UNLV is not in session. Even though it can get busy the lines does move quickly, after all it's pretty much a no-brainer menu if you've been here enough times.

I tend to always get a chicken burrito, black beans, little sprinkle of cheese, dash of sour cream, and a bunch of lettuce. I'm hardly ever disappointed with Chipotle, after all the ingredients are fresh and the meats are hormone free, etc.

The parking here is pretty ridiculous though. I don't know how many times I've pulled in, done a loop and had to end up back out on Maryland Parkway to drive back in and just head to one of the further back lots. 

Anyway, if you need a quick burrito or some other fresh-mex fair and you're in the area hit this place up. I prefer it over the other fast Mexican place which is Cafe Rio down the street.
