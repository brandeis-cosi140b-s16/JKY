I love the atmosphere of this place and the food was pretty good. I ordered a crispy fish and shrimp fish taco which took a while to come but were both enjoyable. I really like the cocktails here but I have to take a star away for the service, it was slow and everyone looked miserable to be there. Poolside service was ridiculously slow, it took an hour and three reminders on an order before my entire party gave up on the ONE waiter they had staffed on a busy Saturday and went straight to the bar. Not sure that I like this place as well as Gallo Blanco but I would like to give their brunch a shot.
