As far as Mexican food goes in Pittsburgh, there aren't a lot of options if you are looking for something traditional. This place definitely hit on some good things, but there were some disappointments as well. I like that it's a small place with a homey feel to it. The salsa was delicious and very fresh; however, the chips left a little to be desired. They were on the stale side, and the oil used for the chips was at least a day old. Maybe on a different day the chips would have been fresh, but I'm just judging on one experience.

I coudn't decide what to order as there were many options on the menu, so I just ordered an order of chicken quesadillas and a side of rice. My friend ordered a combo with an echilada, taco, and relleno. My chicken quesadillas were really yummy, and the rice was decent. Nothing special, but good. My friend's dish looked tasty as well, and everything seemed well cooked. Perhaps it was just because I was comparing this place to my favorite authentic Mexican joint of all time, but I thought it was just okay. But, that being said, for Pittsburgh, it's a solid choice.

I definitely want to go back to give the chips another try.
