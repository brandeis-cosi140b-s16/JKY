Good for a quick bite to eat. 


The food at Tamales Guadalajara has a authentic Mexican fare, with large portions. If you go to Tamales Guadalajara make sure you try the salsa and the guacomole, it's very tasty. 

On my first visit to Tamales Guadalajara my friends and I tried various menu items.   Some of the items we tasted  were the red beef tamales, beef flatas, rice, beans, chips and salsa.  I really enjoyed the beans and salsa. The tamales had a nice taste but they lacked filling. The Guacamole was delicious and their salsa was very good. If I were in this area again I would definitely plan a second visit.

 The staff is polite, courteous, and accomdating.  You will not feel rushed though they do a great job of getting your orders out to the table in a reasonable time. So if you are in the area, do yourself a favor and try Tamales Guadalajara, good food, reasonable prices, and great service. You'll be glad you did.
