The food is awesome! However, the staff at this location seem very rude. We waited about an hour in line which wasn't the problem, but when I ordered with the first man in the line he judged me for ordering a salmon quesadilla. Where have you been bro? It's not that uncommon. He wasn't hospitable or professional at all. He even proceeded to be rude to my friends and their kids. I understand it's busy, but you don't have to be a judgmental ass to your customers that actually enjoy the food.
