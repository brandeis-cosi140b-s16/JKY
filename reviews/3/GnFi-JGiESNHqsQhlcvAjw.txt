It's Taco Bell.  If you are expecting gourmet food then you are at the wrong place.  I have been inside this location and it leaves something to be desired.  However, for a later evening food run it is ok.  The service in the drive thru is usually very friendly and sometimes funny.  It's Taco Bell though.  The food is what Taco Bell is.  Ordered a BLT crunch wrap tonight.  It was not good at all.  Taco Bell needs it off the menu..
