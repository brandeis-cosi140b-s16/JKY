Not bad! Very friendly staff. Good prices and generous portions. No, it is not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it is good enough to go back twice a month. I usually get one of 3 items, Chicken Torta, Chicken Burrito Enchilada Style or the Fish Burrito. My wife usually gets Caldo, 3 Rolled Taquitos or Chile Rellenos. I can honestly tell you I seldom finish everything on my plate and I never leave hungry!
