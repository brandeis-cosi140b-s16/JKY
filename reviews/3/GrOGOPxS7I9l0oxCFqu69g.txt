This place is hard to get into unless you have reservations or sitting at the sushi bar is an option.  And it so happened that we wanted to sit at the sushi bar near the back and enjoy girl talk, a glass of wine and good rolls.

It's a total Scottsdale scene.  Loud, hip, and good people watching.  

The charred edamame was a bit spicy but good.  I can't remember the actual name of the rolls but they were fresh and yummy.  Very filling.

Service was ok.  It's  just a busy place.
