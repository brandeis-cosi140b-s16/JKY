Two visits in two days, but in different locations. The food court choices all looked bad, but I had remembered hearing about this Taco Shop and since I'm a huge carne asada fan, here we go. The carne in my burrito was tasty, had some crunch too it and from what I can tell no fatty pieces were involved. The $6 small burrito had carmelized onions and guac and a tasty spicy salsa was served on the side. Might be the best carne in this mall, but I went to another location the next day and didn't have the best breakfast burro. That burrito was from the University Drive restaurant and the carne did have some fatty pieces here and the potatoes they used for the breakfast burros were too small and chopped up and the whole thing just didn't come together well. KInd of greasy and just average. Hopefully, the mall court comes through again on my next visit because good carne is tough to find.
