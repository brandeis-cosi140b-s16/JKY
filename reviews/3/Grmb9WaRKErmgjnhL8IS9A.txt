Biked here on a Friday afternoon with the hubby.  The chips and salsa were awesome.  Aside from that, I wasn't that impressed.  First off, it could be due to the fact I didn't realize that I could order my chicken taco grilled and it came shredded.  I'll probably try here again just because its so close and since moving out here, haven't found good salsa anywhere else.

If your like me, just make sure you order the chicken grilled.  I'm def not a fan of shredded.
