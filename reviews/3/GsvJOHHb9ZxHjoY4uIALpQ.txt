I love Chipotle, but unfortunately, this location seems to be poorly managed; they always seem to be out of ingredients and the line moves very slow.  Came here for dinner tonight and there was no brown rice.  In addition, I had to wait for steak.  Aside from that, the food tasted good, just poor service.
