So, some friends and I decided to stop in tonight & overall everything was ok...again. Our service was great, almost a little too much. Our waitress was at our table every second, somewhat too much. We enjoyed fajitas, steak tacos, and chicken tacos. The salsa and chips were good, but we got charged for a refill, really? And, two of us ordered a side of sour cream, for our fajitas, and were charged $1.50 for each. Ridiculous! I really wanted to give them a four, but right now I am just not ready, everything stick ok.
