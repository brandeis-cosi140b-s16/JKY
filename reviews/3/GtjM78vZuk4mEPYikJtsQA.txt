Gorgeous ambiance, great music and service, but lackluster food. I also thought the plate presentation was sad in comparison to the knockout restaurant design. Aesthetics aside, the food tasted mass-produced. 

I was with a group of 6 girlfriends and none of us were impressed. 2 of us ordered the $60 filet - I was immediately turned off by how over cooked it looked (both ordered medium rare), and watching both friends literally saw into it with their knives was painful. No amount of steak sauce could've revived the "filet". We were convinced that it was a cheaper cut of meat. 

A great place to get drinks before a night out, but skip the meal!
