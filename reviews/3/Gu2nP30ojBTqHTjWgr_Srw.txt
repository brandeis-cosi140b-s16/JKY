Had the Queso and Chips with Chorizo for an appetizer, very good!!!! I had the make it yourself burrito with Pulled Pork, black beans, grilled onions and peppers. Inside was great, the burrito needed to be finished on the grill on both sides, was gummy. GF had the Chorizo burrito, same thing, inside was great, outside needed to be grilled for a little bit. Overall good, will go back.
