Quintessence of Mexican food mediocrity. Ordered tortilla soup ($4.99) and carne aside burrito ($10.99).  Chips and dips came straight away. Soup tasted like a spicy, unimaginative broth plus a wedge of guacamole tossed in to make it seem authentic. The carne inside the burrito lacked tenderness and flavor. None of it, including sides, zinged with freshness.

Some cigarette smoke drifted from the casino area into my seating area. Service was excellent.
