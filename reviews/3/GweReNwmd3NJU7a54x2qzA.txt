Very tough to find as the address is actually located behind a gas station. The restaurant itself was a refurbished hamburger place and still had some if the signs left. Decent menu and reasonable prices. Food was above average, large portion size for the money so a great deal. Strange thing was no chips and salsa when we waited for order to be prepared.
