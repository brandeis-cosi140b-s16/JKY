Maria's is a great place to eat.  The staff is always nice, and the food is great.  The .99 cent beef tacos rock for some cheap food on a lunch break.

The problem would be that the .99 cent tacos are really the only deal there.  As other people have said, this place is more expensive than Robertos/Amigos/any other place for the same quality food.

I will keep going for the lunch deal, and that's about it.
