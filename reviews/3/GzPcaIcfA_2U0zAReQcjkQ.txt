It's like a permanent food truck anchored in a parking lot. I find it strange, but nonetheless I pass it twice a day to and from work; so curiosity got the best of me and I stopped here. 

I tried the croquetas--I found them gross. The outsides were crunchy, but the insides were like a soggy cream of ham soup; that is the best way I can describe them. The empanada was so-so; it's overpriced for what you get. I threw both of them out.

The burrito was pretty good; I got a shrimp burrito even though I thought I was taking a huge risk on either too little or crappy shrimp. Luckily neither was an issue. 

I'm willing to try the tacos or another burrito next time, but I would advise to skip the tapas.
