Edgar's has dropped in where the Calif. Taco Shop was.  Stopped in today and the Manager greeted us.  He said they have been open 4 weeks.  

The decor has not changed but the menu and owner have. 

The menu is Mexico City style food.  We were seated and given a menu.  The Manager took our order.  Someone from the kitchen delivered our food.

There was some chips and salsa samples at the counter that we were told to take a sample.   There were 6 different salsas that they sell to take home, too.  All the salsas are made at the restaurant with fresh ingredients.  

The menu has Burritos, Tacos, Tostada, some Mexican sandwiches, some entrees and Combo's.   There was a daily special.  The burritos start at $9 and are large.  I had a Barbacoa..Lamb.  The Manager was happy to explain the menu, said the lamb was very good and popular in Mexico.  It come with beans, rice, cilantro, lettuce, tomato, cheese and sour cream.  A side salsa choice of medium or spicy is given to you to go with the meal.  The burrito was very good!  Better than the burrito I had when this was the Calif. Taco Shop.  

Drinks consist of Mexican pop/soda some homemade aqua fresca and the menu said ice tea..but none available when it was ordered. 

A TV had ESPN deportes on but the sound was muted.

 Here's to your success...Edgar!
