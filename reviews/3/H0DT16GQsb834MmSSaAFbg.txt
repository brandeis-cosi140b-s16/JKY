Macayo's offers a broad selection of Mexican favorites like enchiladas, burritos, chimis, etc.  I had a chicken chimi and it was very flavorful.  The salsa is delicious with just enough heat. Service was friendly and fast. The restaurant is enormous, but the interior decor is interesting to say the least.  It is overly bright inside, like a Mexican Denny's.  There are fake animals everywhere and enough fake plants to make Rainforest Cafe jealous. Overall this is just an average Mexican restaurant in a town full of great Mexican restaurants.
