Who wouldn't want to try a restaurant that has been designated Best of Phoenix for tacos by the Phoenix New Times, with tacos that cost only 99 cents each? I came to this small restaurant one mid-afternoon to sample four of their taco offerings: pastor, asada, longanisa, and carnitas. A complimentary small basket of tortilla chips and two bowls of salsa (red and green) preceded my sampling, and these were pretty generic. The tacos were tasty but a bit on the dry side, except for the moist carnitas. I washed these down with iced horchata; it was mild and pleasant. Not spectacular, but not a bad meal either, and all for only $6.50. I'd definitely come here again if I'm in a taco mood and find myself in the area.
