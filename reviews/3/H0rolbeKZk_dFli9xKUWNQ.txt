This is your standard Chipotle with standard fare. The place has a decent sized dining area and a large patio. The patio is nice because for some reason they keep the place at sub zero temperatures inside. Ok so that's an exaggeration, but at the same time, as Arizona residents we are better acclimated to the heat and don't necessarily need it to be so darn cold inside. 

Aside from that, the place kept pretty clean and the service is friendly and efficient.

On my last trip I ordered a chicken salad with guacamole. I'm not sure if it was a standard serving, but I got a monster dollop of guacamole. It was pretty darn good. The rest of the salad was ok. The chicken was over salted and there wasn't much lettuce, but with the salsa and black beans, all and all it was a fresh and satisfying meal that I would order again.

I usually get a side of chips, but lately I've noticed that they are way too salty. But still really good.

Enjoy!!
