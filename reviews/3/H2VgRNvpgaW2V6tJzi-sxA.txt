Ride the light rail from Tempe. Go to Monster Jam early to use Pit Pass. Take a break and walk to Tee Pee Tap Room for dinner. Return to Chase Field for Monster Jam Show.

Convenience alone, I'd give Tee Pee Tap Room 5 stars. Walking distance from Chase Field it's a great place to go that's off the beaten path and not quite as loud and chaotic as some of the other places surrounding the ballpark.

It's definitely not my favorite place for mexican food, but at a recent Monster Truck Jam with the 5 year old nephew and family we were able to break away and grab some food with the kids in a relaxed environment. 

They have Negra Modelo, enough said. I can separate the foodie critic in me and appreciate the food service (which was excellent) and being able to enjoy a post-pit, pre-show dinner with a table for 8 even if it is just OK food.
