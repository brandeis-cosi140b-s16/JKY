Located in McCarran airport, this place was one of the few dining options that looked appetizing. They've got all sorts of burrito combinations consisting of different ingredients and sauces (cajun, Thai, teriyaki, curry, mediterranean). You can also get burrito bowls, salads, wraps, quesadillas, and sandwiches. The steak and prawns burrito I ordered was decent. There was plenty of juicy, well flavored steak, but the prawns were tiny and rubbery. As with all airport dining options, prepare to pay up the wazoo for something that should cost half as much as they charge.
