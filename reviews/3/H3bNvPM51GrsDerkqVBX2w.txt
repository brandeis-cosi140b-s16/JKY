This place is a little bizarre. Enter through the Mexican grocery store next door. The restaurant itself is WAY too big for what it is, and often empty. The menu could use some work, and the decor leaves much to be desired. The service is just so so. 

So why am I a fan? Because their tacos are delicious. Their tortillas are definitely the best in Madison. They're soft and warm and two tortillas per taco as it should be. Tacos go for about $2, and three tacos is more than enough for me. I had the carne asada, the chicken and the a pastor. The al pastor is not my favorite, but tasty and flavorful. The carne asada is among the best I've had in Madison. The chicken taco was quite dry even with a good dousing of salsa.

I took a quick peek through the grocery store next door before I left and noticed that they sold marinated pork in the meat counter. Hooray! I'm hoping they'll have carne asada too on some days.
