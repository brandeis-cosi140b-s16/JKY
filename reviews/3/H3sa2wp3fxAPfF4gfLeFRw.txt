I know this place gets a lot of knocks for not being authentic, but the service is good, the food's fine and the decor is interesting.  To me, anyway.  They have this odd mashed potato side-dish thingy that you'll either love or hate.  Chips and salsa are good and plentiful, and I had a superb mojito or twothree here this summer.  

Would I go out of my way to eat there?  Probably not, but if you were paying, I'd say, sure, let's go!
