We went on a Saturday night. 

Started with dinner - which was above average in quality. They serve simple plates of American and Mexican food. The band started as we were finishing dinner - "Easton Ashe" and they are an excellent cover band. The place was full by 10pm - we had a couple drinks and left to meet some friends elsewhere. Overall my first impression was good - as far as the older crowd goes - I didn't see many 20 somethings (kind of refreshing), I didn't see father-time either... mostly 30-50yr olds... Tom Chambers (Suns) was there hanging out...

We will be back to investigate further :)
