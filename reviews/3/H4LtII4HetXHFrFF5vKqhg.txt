Got the Chorizo Breakfast Burrito. It was ok, Just a little too greasy for my likings. And when I say greasy, I mean it looked like I killed someone afterwards. I know that the Chorizo is greasy, but I have never eaten one this greasy, ever! If I'm ever strolling by, I might give this another shot and try something else. 

Regardless, I still enjoyed the service.
