3 1/2, really.

Almost passed on this one once we found it in a sketchy neighborhood. Almost under the freeway, I first noticed the rainbow, marquee for Taqueria El Buen Pastor scrolling on a tire and lube business. Confused for a moment, we then noticed the busy taco truck parked on the corner. I echo others' observation about being on your gaurd around this area; I was reminded here that NV is an open carry state.

Warning: Very limited parking! We came around 10pm and had to park in the "gated" motel lot next door. 

Couldn't tell if the lady was being condescending or not as she lengthily greeted my white-face-and-red-hair in Spanish. My Filipino companion greeted her in English to which she answered in perfect English the remainder of our encounter...

Prices are higher than what I'm used to pretty much everywhere in CA. I'm not sure if it's just this place or LV in general but I was surprised. $2 for tacos, $3.50 for ranchero (super) which comes with cheese, rice, beans, guac, and crema. Of course, Ranchero comes with less meat in order to make room for all those extra goodies. Standard burritos $8. Ordered the pastor (of course). Best part of these tacos is the inclusion of pineapple in the pastor; The sweet-salty spice combination is tasty. The actual spice flavor of the pastor was okay, could have been marinated longer or been more generous with the spice. Portions are pretty good- this is a meaty taco. The tortilla is on the smaller side but pretty full with meat. They have a mexican fixins' bar with cilantro/onion, salsas, limes, etc. I'd say the ranchero isn't worth it but get the regular taco. $2 extra for "guacamole avocado"...(!) 

Good, cheap eats *for Vegas* and copacetic in the realm of tacos, although, not the best I've had. I think alot of these are drunk reviews.
