Went here the other night to pick up some takeout for dinner and I realized that I have never written a review...

I think this place has great homestyle Mexican food.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the food is greasy and so that is what keeps me from eating here too often.  But it is no worse than Losbetos, Filibertos, or Nicos or the other authentic Mexican taco shops in the valley, but they have more options than just burritos and tacos.  And I think that their rolled tacos are the best!

Definitely not the nicest place to eat at - not dirty, just a little worn out an not comfortable.  They are really fast with the takeout orders so I recommend just showing up and grabbing some food to go.  I noticed last time that I was there that they will give you a free dessert if you pay with cash so keep that in mind when you go.
