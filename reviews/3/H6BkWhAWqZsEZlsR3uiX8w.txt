The food: 

- Chips and salsa were excellent.  More than excellent.
- The ceviche was pretty good.
- The catch of the day (why the hell do I keep ordering the catch of the day in Arizona???  It's a habit from SF and Seattle, I know, but I must not forget that I am in Arizona and the catch of the day is at best, several days old.) was ok.  The preparation (jalapenos, white wine, and butter) sounded enticing, but the sea bass just wasn't fresh enough and it showed.
- The tortilla soup was terrible.
- The fajitas were good, but not $20 good.

The prices:
I don't mind paying for good food.  I do mind paying for mediocre food.  This is mediocre food (aside from the chips!).  

Will I be returning?  Unfortunately, yes.  I don't have many Mexican options in the corn fields next to my home and the next closest place, Serrano's is truly terrible.
