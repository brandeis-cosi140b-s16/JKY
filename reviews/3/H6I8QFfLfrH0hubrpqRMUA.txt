Lets be fair.  This is a new Charanda venue and its gonna take time to shake out all the new bugs.  I've frequented the venue in Rock Hill and it's a good Mex 'traunt.  the new venue has mediocre service, but is improving as is the food.  The Charro beans, for example, are thin and lifeless compared to the RH location.  However, the manager has gone out of his way to correct probs if brought to his attention.  Ypu can tell he cares if you speak to him.  Let him know of issues you may have.  i'll give them another couple of months to shake off the "newbies" before commenting on the general menu.  Try the RH location before panning the new place.  I am. . . Hope you will too
UPDATE 23 MAR 2012:  Wonderfully improved.  This is my third visit and easch time has been a little. Etter than before.  Speaking to the Manager has begun paying dividends.  Lunch #11, for ex, used to be watery and lifeless;  now firmly served with the whack of fresh jalapeno and smooth Charro beans inside,  More tea please!!  Even the surly Hostess seems to have cooled her jets . . . A MAJOR improvement.  I've bued it up a Star and hope to add another as time passes.  Keep up the good improvements, Mr Manager!  They're definately showing.
