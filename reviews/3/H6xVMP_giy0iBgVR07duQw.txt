The chips were delivered quickly and were light, crispy and warm, the guacamole made table side was awesome - fresh (of course) and very spicy! We each had a margarita on the rocks, one Corona and we split the steak fajitas - total bill $58 with tip - not bad but I would have expected a little less splitting an entree. oh well. 

The atmosphere was fun - got lucky with the leftover snow and ice outside b/c we were seated without having to wait even though the restaurant was mostly full. 

Service was excellent. Good casual date spot. 

My only gripe was that the fajitas needed a little more meat in addition to the ample amount of veggies - otherwise Cantina would have gotten 4 stars.
