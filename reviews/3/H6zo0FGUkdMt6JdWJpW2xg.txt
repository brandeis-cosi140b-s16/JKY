I was in the mood for tamales and eggs for breakfast. So I found this place and though they don't have that combo in the menu, the waitress happily made it happen. She brought me chips and salsa. The salsa was delicious and the chips were homemade; yet they were too thick. She brought me the tamales which I ordered two pork and one cheese, came with a side of beans and rice. The best beans I've ever had in a Mexican restaurant. The rice had too much garlic but still edible. The reason this restaurant gets three stars is because, the Tamils had little filling and were too dry. Overall I will be back to try other things on the menu.
