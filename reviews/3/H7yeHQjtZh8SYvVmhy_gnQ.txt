I wish there were half stars.

Chevy's has that perfect Happy Hour environment all day long.  Bright colors, fast moving waiters (even when the service is slow the waiters seem to be flying by!), plenty of activity, huge drinks, and food that all seems like it's an appetizer.

The chips and salsa are wonderful. . .beware you sometimes find the hot spot in the salsa and then burn for a bit.  If you are lucky enough to have an attentive waiter you may even get the basket refilled.

As I mentioned, there are always a bunch of waiters in bright red shirts flying this way and that, but they seem to rarely stop at your table to fill your drinks.

The food has the typical tex-mex flair...so it depends on your personal taste.  Being in Arizona, most seem to want that authentic homemade Mexican food taste...this is that more polished chain restaraunt taste.

This location is connect to Arrowhead Mall...so you can also sit out on the patio and people watch....
