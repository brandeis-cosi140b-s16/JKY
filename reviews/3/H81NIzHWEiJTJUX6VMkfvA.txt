I like the food here, and I love the house green ranch dressing (not sure if exact name). 

BUT-  the wait and the lines are terrible.  Not in a "wow it's so busy" but a "wow, they are slow" 
I keep coming back because I like the tostadas with the green ranch.  I would go a lot more if the wait wasn't ridiculous. 

Oh and NEVER do the preorder, never.   Both times I waited an hour after my pick up time. I would have left or gone through the regular line, but the preorder is prepaid.
