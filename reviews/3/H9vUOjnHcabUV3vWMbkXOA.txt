Good inexpensive Mexican food. I love their Chimichanga combo. Their portions are ample and I usually always have extra food. I also love their breakfast burritos and their tortas.

I am dropping my rating because you claim your business is 24 hours. I went to get a breakfast burrito before going to work this morning thinking you're 24 hours and you should have food available. I arrived at the drive through only to be told it would be 35 to 40 minutes before breakfast burritos would be available. I left disappointed. I went to another fast food place to get something to eat for breakfast. Please don't claim you are 24 hours if you don't have food available 24 hours.
