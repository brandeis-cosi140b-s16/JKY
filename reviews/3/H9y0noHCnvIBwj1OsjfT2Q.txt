Just ok, nothing to be amazed about but it wasn't terrible either. Came in for a quick dinner as my group had stayed at Mandalay Bay but were too lazy to go out to the rest of the strip for other, potentially better, food. This spot has quite a good amount of seating, along with a full bar and TVs if you wanted to catch the game.

Because I had already had my fair share of Mexican food just a few days and hours beforehand, only thing I haven't had was a tostada salad. I got it with chicken and it wasn't too bad. Also got to try their tacos, which were just ok. Nachos were pretty good though!
