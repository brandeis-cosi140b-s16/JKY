I liked the atmosphere but there aren't many vegetarian options, other than the 20 ingredient fried rice.  I was informed by our server that the bean and cheese taco isn't veg friendly as it is cooked in lard. Bummer!  

I know the airy margarita came highly recommended, however it tasted like a cloud of salt and made me extremely thirsty.  Seriously, after a few sips, I could not drink enough water to get rid of the "thirsty" feeling.  Don't say I didn't warn you.
