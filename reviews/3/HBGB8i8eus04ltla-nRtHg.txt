The food here was good. I had the Colorado burrito and it was big and yummy. My husband had the seafood chimi and it was SO TINY. He said it tasted good, but seriously, I have never seen one so small. It was like a baby chimi and it was over $12. My son had the children's bean burrito and it was spicy. He took one bite and freaked out. Being just a little guy and ordering off the kids menu you would think they would make sure it was either not made with spicy beans or warn us. As for the service, our waiter was fine but not being backed up by anyone. There were literally 9 people standing around doing NOTHING and we all had empty drinks for over 7 minutes. Even if it's not your job, you still work there, help the waiter out a little. It will not be somewhere we will visit again anytime soon.
