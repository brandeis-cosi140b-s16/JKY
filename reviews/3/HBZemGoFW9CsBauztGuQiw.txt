I met my wife for dinner the other day. El Santaneco is close to my work and across from her school (UNLV), so we decided to give El Santaneco a try.

I ordered the chile relleno de carne de puerco. It was pretty decent.

My wife got the pupusas with chicken and potatoes. She's a big fan of pupusas and was happy to find a convenient place serving them up. She said she's had better, but they're good enough to satisfy her craving. Unfortunately, they did not have flan which was listed on the menu and is her favorite, so that craving was unfulfilled.

We were given the requisite chips and salsa. The chips kind of seemed like half of them were store bought and half were homemade. The salsa was orangish. It was good and interesting. it reminded me of a cross between chicken broth and tomato soup.

The waitress barely spoke English and we speak minimal Spanish, but we got along okay.
