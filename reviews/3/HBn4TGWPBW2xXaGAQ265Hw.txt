DH & I went there last night, the margaritas were ok...we had the corn, carne asada tacos, and a torta. We thought the meat didn't have very much taste. Both of us liked the salsa that came with the chips, but the salsa that came with the food was not as tasty. The place was ok, kind of overpriced & over hyped.
