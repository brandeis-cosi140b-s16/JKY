Great place on the strip to grab a quick cocktail and people watch!
The cool thing they have here is a unique happy hr.
They spin the dial thing every 15-30 minutes, and the HH specials change. Could be beer, liquor, or whatever. But it makes it fun.
Food is overpriced, but the view on the strip makes it fun. 
I do make a point to visit here everytime I'm in Vegas. Just one of those nostalgic things.....
