Yup, it's Chipotle. The interior is nice and the staff are very friendly (Even for a cold dreary Monday haha). Despite getting a burrito with a variety of salsas and cheese, aside from the meat the burrito itself tasted a little bland. The pinto beans were especially lacking in seasoning. I had to pile on the hot sauce to actually get any flavor! The barbacoa was decent, and tasted strongly of cumin. On a good note the burritos themselves are a hefty size and they will gladly pile on various toppings if you ask (I was a pig and asked for pico, corn, and green tomatillo salsa).
