Went on a Saturday night and the place was more or less dead. Was later told by someone at our hotel that it is more of a lunch place. Margaritas were good for the $5 cost. We ordered several different items and all but one were good. This is more of a southwest grill type of place and not a place to go for traditional or tex-mex type mexican food.
