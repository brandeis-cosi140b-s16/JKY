The food is decent and service is friendly. The menu and pricing are on par with Roberto's Taco Shop. There's also a clean salsa bar with the basics for adding extra zing if you need it.

My favorite order to date has to be the super nachos. It's basically a whole mess of meat, guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream and beans over crispy chips. Warning: You may want to share these or you'll be unbuttoning those jeans. 

They have a Taco Tuesday special of $0.99 per taco (chicken & potato only). 

A good little hole in the wall if you're in the mood for a quick Mexican fix and are in the area.
