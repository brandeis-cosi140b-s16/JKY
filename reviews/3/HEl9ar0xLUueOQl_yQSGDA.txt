Pretty much the same as when it was Los Favs.  The night I went in though they had been cleaning, and the whole place smelled like bleach.  Really not very appetizing.  The beef taco was just how I like it, and the bean burrito was good as well.  I was getting take out, so I'm glad I didn't have to stay and smell the crazy amount of bleach in the air!
