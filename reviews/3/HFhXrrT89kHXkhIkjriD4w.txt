First time here, not impressed. Here's why..I sat in a sticky seat, service was ok, as in I would get once in awhile, rice @ beans so bland n dry. Good points, carne esada yummy n the nachos were tasty. The waiter kept too close my fave when asking me questions, I was getting annoyed. The bus boy, kept cleaning while I was eating, I get it but I was eating! This is why I gave this place a 3.
