Highly recommended to us and always packed, but it was just ok. The salsa and chips were good and if you wanted more, you get charged for it. Yeah, the normal chips and salsa that comes out to every mexican restaurant. It was slop on a plate and the seasoning was off to me. I had tacos and the flavoring was salty and my girlfriend had beef enchiladas and they were cheese with beef put on top. So now we go across the street to the blue adobe I think it is called. Across the street to the right.
