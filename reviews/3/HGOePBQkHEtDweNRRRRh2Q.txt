I haven't ever wanted to come here in the past simply because Mexican food in Pittsburgh has largely been a letdown for me, but I recently went for the Monday night $1 taco/$3 margarita special at the behest of my roommate and it was a decent enough experience. The atmosphere was very open, airy, and colorful. It definitely bordered on the kitschy, but most Mexican restaurants that aren't in California seem to be that way. (The d√©cor reminded my roommate and me of the TexMex places we ate at on a spring break trip a few years back.) The staff was friendly, albeit a little scattered and spread thin. Our server was new, so I can't really comment on him properly. 

The house chips and salsa we started with were free (a huge plus!) and quite delicious. The salsa lacked the complexity of Verde's, but it didn't cost any money so I can't complain too much. Once we ordered the rest of our food it came very quickly. I tried the chicken taco and the margarita. Only the hard shell tacos are $1 on Mondays which honestly should have been advertised since it caused some confusion, but a lot of that could have been due to our green server not explaining the deal to us at all. The taco was delicious and fairly simple...just shredded chicken fried with green and red peppers and onions. It was topped with lettuce, and they also offer cheese if you want. I'd eat it again but only on Mondays for $1. The margarita was clearly made from a mix, so I wouldn't waste my money on it if I ever came back here. (Margaritas aren't that hard to get right!) They have pretty decent beer prices, so I could see myself going that route in the future. Overall Patron is a solid place to get some very cheap tacos during a non-happy hour time of night with lots of available seating, so I give it three stars for that. Better margaritas would have been nice, but for $3 I suppose that's just too good to be true!
