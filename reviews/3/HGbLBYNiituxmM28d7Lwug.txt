Maybe I just caught them on a bad night, but the food was terrible. Came here on a Friday night at around 9:30. The waitress was nice, but kept disappearing for long periods of time. When the food finally came out it was cold, stale, and bland. Normally all friends rave about this place. One of the people part of my dining party let the manager know about the wait and food quality and he was totally understanding. Wasn't looking for a free meal, but he comped it. Great customer service, so I'll give them a 3, even though it should be a 2.5. 

Maybe I'll try it again for lunch one day.
