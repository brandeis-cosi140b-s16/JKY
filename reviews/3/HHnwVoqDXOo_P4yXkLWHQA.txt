My local Pollo Loco is always clean and cheerful. The staff are knowledgeable and even though they have to offer you desert with every order the food is great. Their tortilla soup is chock full of veggies and bite sized chicken pieces. If you join their email address they send coupons for new items  before the geneeal public gets to try and a free meal for your birthday. Fountain drinks are a plenty and the horchata isnt too sweet. Lastly the salsa var is well stocked with to go cups and lids.
