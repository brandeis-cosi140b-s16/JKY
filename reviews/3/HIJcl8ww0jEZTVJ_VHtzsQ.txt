I swore off Chipotle after my first experience several years ago while living in CA.  I finally gave in and gave it another shot. A buy 1 get 1 free certainly helps!

The burrito is average, but the meat is a bit chewy and salty (chicken and beef)  The quality of meat was the problem I had with my previous burrito and not much has changed in the many years since my last visit to a Chipotle. .

For similar chain burrito places, Chipotle ranks above Moes, but is behind Baja Fresh, Qdoba etc.
 
Our table had chips and guacamole. The guacamole was excellent!  

The staff was very friendly and our burritos were served very quickly.
