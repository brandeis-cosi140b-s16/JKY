It is little clean, there is some dirty tables, staff is friendly, and helpful. The menu seems old, the decor has inspirational quotes. The order is slow, we had to wait awhile, the tacos were not great, the grilled ghost pepper burrito was pretty good, was not particularly spicy. Quesoburrito was pretty good and worth the money.
