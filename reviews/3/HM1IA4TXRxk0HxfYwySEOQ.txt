Second attempt trying to eat at this place, finally got to try their food this time, the first time they weren't open yet even though it was already "opening hours."

Ordered 4 tacos, lengua, al pastor, carne asada, and chorizo. Got charged $9.50, which makes it easily $2+ per taco, pretty expensive compared to other places The tacos were alright, my first time trying al pastor and it was good. If there was a tacos el gordo on the southwest side I think this place would be out of business.

Would come back/more often if it wasn't so expensive, might have just been over charged because I'm not Hispanic but who knows. 

Their green salsa is the only reason I gave them at 3 star instead of a 2 star, it has a kick to it with a robust amount of garlic flavor. The rest of their salsa bar was decently stocked and was pretty much the average salsa bar.
