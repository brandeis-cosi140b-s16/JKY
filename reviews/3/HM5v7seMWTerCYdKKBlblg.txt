Stopped by for a shrimp burrito.  Place was empty which wasn't surprising for a Sunday night.  Not the warmest greeting but my burrito was done in less than 4 minutes.  Good size and a decent amount of shrimp, registered a 7.4 on my heat scale which was a bit more than I expected but good nonetheless.  $9.35 for a burrito and coke might make me think twice about coming back though.
