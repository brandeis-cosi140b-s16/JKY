We get breakfast burrito's from Caramba's occasionally and they are pretty good. Our standard b-fasturrito order is eggs/potato/cheese. My burrito of choice just seems a wee bit too pricey at this spot, at $5 a pop.

Caramba's cooks up everything good, including the taters and their red hot sauce is tasty. They've got a salsa bar on site too for scooping up some additional toppings of goodness.

We like the place, but we're still looking for that perfect breakfast burrito near our neighborhood.
