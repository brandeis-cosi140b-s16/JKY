Came here with an old High School friend to catch up.  We were there for four hours.  Prices were great.  However, we really felt like we were being pushed out by the waitress, whom we paid so she could leave. She was very pleasant otherwise and good for the first half hour.   Plenty of room in the place for more tables, usually the only reason one pushes me out.   No one bothered to come after that to see if we needed anything.  I would have opened another tab.  Stingy on the chips, no one even asked if we wanted to purchase more.  Margaritas were good. Food was so so.
