Met with friends for a birthday dinner. I had the guaca chicken which was very tender and tasty. I also had the upgraded margarita which was just OK. The chips were stale and given our group size we ran out and had to wait AWHILE for more chips and more salsa. The salsa was nothing special. The guacamole dip was nothing special (not even sure if it was recently prepared). It is a mediocre Mexican restaurant. I don't plan to be back, but wouldn't balk if friends insisted. Apparently there are coupons for this place (which I didn't know until one of the dinner guests shared with another) so I'd look for that as the prices weren't cheap but weren't expensive either.
