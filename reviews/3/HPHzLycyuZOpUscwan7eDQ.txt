Decent Americanized-Mexican food; if you've been to Laredo's, the food is identical - it's actually the same company/group. A solid option for lunch. Group of us had a celebration lunch here today; we have visited as a group several other times as well - experience is usually the same. 

+ Prompt seating; very spacious - good spot for groups
+ Fast service; chips/salsa/drinks arrive almost immediately; refills are fast
+ Table-made guac is quite tasty

+ Lunch specials provide a good value; I've never had one, but my tablemates have always enjoyed them. The Mexican Omelet looked especially good - eggs, bell peppers, tomatoes, chihuahua cheese, chorizo, jalape√±o sauce and avocado... 
+ I usually order the El Tesoro salad - marinated chicken, grilled asparagus, radish, cucumber, and mixed greens. 

- Chips during this last visit tasted off; the oil was either burned or old, and the salsa was extremely watery.
