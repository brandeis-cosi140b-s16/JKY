Limited menu, but at an airport that's expected. I had the Big Blue burrito sans meat (only vegitarian option was on their breakfast menu which they stop serving at 10:30). It was big enough to share.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Even though the burrito was plenty big, don't expect many chips - I think I got about 5.
