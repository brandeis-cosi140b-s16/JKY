Like any other Mexican fast-food restaurant such as Qdoba's or Chipotle. Self-serve salsa for your chips is different. You walk in and hear very enthusiastic welcoming voices shout "Welcome to Moe's!" A good-sized menu and outdoor seating with bouncy chairs. A good fun and casual place if you're craving Mexican food alone or with friends!
