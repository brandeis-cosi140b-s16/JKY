Holy greasy birria, burritoman! Another Pepe's! 

I mucho love cheap greasy Mexicanos food, so it's a given that I like Pepe's. I prefer the other location, further up Boulder Highway as I've always had consistently low-grade greasy food there. 

However, at THIS location, the food was SO greasy that it soaked through the paper AND the aluminum wrapped around the burrito. The tortilla barely held itself together and was practically translucent by the end of things. Delicious and totally satisfying? YES. Artery clogging and unfit for consumption in 'civilized' settings? YES.

This was the kind of burrito for when you are drunkski beyond all comprehension and need the perfect ratio of fat-protein-carbs to soak it all up & stagger through the night. 

Will I go again? If I'm in the neighborhood and need some cheap, filling, greasy grub. But chances are, I'll probably go to the one down the street instead since it's not only closer to home but has proven itself less lipid-drenched.
