The service is not very good. They are nice, but very slow. Guacamole and the cheese dip were very good and huge. But we went on a Sunday for the $3.50 Sangria special and were told they were out. I tried to bargain to see if they could replace the sangria special with a margarita special and they said "No, we don't do that". I almost gave them 2 stars because of that, but the food is good.
