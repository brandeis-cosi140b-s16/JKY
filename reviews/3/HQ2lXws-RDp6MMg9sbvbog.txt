I come here for lunch occasionally and get the same thing each time. The two beef or chicken taco's with rice and beans. Pretty reasonable price for the lunch combo's. The taco's are actually very good in both beef and chicken. Nice and greasy with a crispy shell, romaine lettuce and lots and lots of cheese, almost too much cheese in fact. The beans are ok as is the rice but i don't like that they put pea's and carrots in the rice. WTF? I hate peas and carrots and with all due respect, good Mexican food is not supposed to have veggies in it!!! Haha. I like that they have a chips and salsa bar and although the chips are decent and crispy, the salsa's really have no flavor to them I have noticed. All in all, this place is ok if you want a quick Mexican lunch of taco's but it really doesn't fall into my category of must go to Mexican restaurants in AZ. 

PS: The decor at this location is really funky and doesn't go with a Mexican theme. More 50's dinerish.
