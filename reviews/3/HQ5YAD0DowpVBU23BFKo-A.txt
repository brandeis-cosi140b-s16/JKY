Standard Chipotle- food is always good. However we always have issues with the staff here, I'm not sure if it's because they are always slammed (line out the door everyday) but if you ask for something they just ignore you and talk amongst each other.  They also skimp on the portion sizes here majorly. The only one in my area or I'd definitely find another location.
