Wow! This was the fastest serving of food I've ever experienced. I had my enchiladas faster than one can say "chimichanga". So an A+ for service. Food was good. Can't complain. Not outstanding but it was good. I cleaned my plate. I'd recommend this place if you are in the mood for Mexican. Ambiance is a bit blah.
