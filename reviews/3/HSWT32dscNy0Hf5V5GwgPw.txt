I may revisit this at a later time, as they have only been open a week and my habit of reviewing brand new restaurants is kind of a shady practice.

I'll make a few main points, but don't expect a full review until a month later.

*Their music makes me want to use that bio-degradable and fully recyclable knife to cut out my ear drums. U2, Sting, Creed, White Stripes? None of that crap is music.

*The girl at the counter stood there, like a dunce, waiting for us to order. She didn't say "hi" "how are you" "have you been here before" "do you have any questions" "thank you" etc. She stood there, like a lump. People like you need training, and the owner of the restaurant obviously isn't concerned with that.

*Tortillas were garbage. I wouldn't normally bring this up, but they kept bragging that their tortillas will be the best and better than Carolinas. Arrogance is one thing, but being arrogant about something you aren't will just get you in trouble.

*On my visit, the beans were bland as could be and the rice tasted like a butter ball. In other words, blech.

*$25 for two people to have an order at the counter, entree only, one beverage meal is crazy. Especially considering you do not provide chips, bread, or any other accompaniment.

*The flavor and quality of my Green Chile Pork was overall above average, looking solely at the entree itself and not the sides or tortillas. The pork was well cooked, and the chunks of green chiles were a nice surprise.

I'm all for this place succeeding, but it's going to have to do it by keeping the hipsters happy, or change it's tune (no pun intended) because what they have is an average to above average concept and execution. There is a lot of competition downtown for quick places, and there is even more competition in this city for Mexican cuisine. 

good luck.
