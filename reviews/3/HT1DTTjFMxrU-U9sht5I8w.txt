This Filiberto's almost got 4 stars from me and here's why:
1) The location itself looks "fancy" as another Yelper had mentioned, compared to other Filiberto's I've been to; and it seemed pretty clean AT FIRST GLANCE.  
2) I came in with a coupon (from Avondale) for the Big Juan.  It wasn't on their regular menu, the girl had no idea what it was, but she went to ask the cook if he could make it anyway.  I'm so glad they did that for me because it was a combination of mouthgasmic goodness! Carne asada, rice, beans, bacon, guac, sour cream, and ciliantro all in a giant burrito!  The bacon might have been a bit much, but it was good for the first two bites. 

But why did I bring them down to a 2.5, you might ask?  I think I must have been super hungry when I first walked in, because it wasn't until I was halfway through my burrito when I saw how filthy the lid was on my cup of horchata was... dust and particles that look like crumbs.. and colors of stickiness... Makes me question what kind of care was put into my food.  Do they just leave their ingredients laying around in the open for particles of random crap to fall into or let flies take their craps? 

Probably won't be going into a Filiberto's for awhile unless I'm being dragged into one. Bumped my rating up to 3 stars since this was my first disgusting experience with this restaurant... hoping they redeem themselves if I just so happen to pop in here again in the far future.
