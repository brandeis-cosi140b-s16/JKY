El Charro seriously lacks in the ambiance and decor department.  Its is pretty shabby looking...inside and out.  Its the kind of place that I would drive by and say...why would anyone stop there to eat?  But one night my coworkers wanted to check it and I was stuck because they were my ride.  I admit I was pretty skeptical and and actually a little pouty about their dining choice.  I kicked up the attitude even more when we were seated at a sticky table that wobbled.  I contemplated not ordering anything, but my growling stomach was telling me to shut up and order some damn tacos already!  So I ordered the shredded beef taco combo and looked on the bright side; if I get food poisoning at least I get the day off of work!  But let me just say, El Charro is a perfect example of not judging a book by its cover.  The food was very, very good.  Seriously the best hard shell taco I have ever had!  The shells are made to order so they have that fresh from the fryer awesomeness to them.  The beef was seasoned very well and a dollop of sour cream cooled down the tasty fire their red hot sauce brings to the dish.  I can't say much about the rice and beans because I didn't eat more than a bite...the 2 tacos were huge and more than enough to fill me up.  Seriously a 4 star meal...but I just can't bring myself to give El Charro a better rating.  They seem to do some pretty good business so my advice to them would be to sink some money into this joint and update it a little.
