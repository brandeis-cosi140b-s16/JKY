I originally tried El Pollo Loco in Tucson many years ago.  I recently decided to visit while doing a bit of horse trading at the Bookmans next door.  For  not much, I got a drink  plus a bean, cheese and rice burrito with a fire roasted chicken leg and a chicken taco that were tasty and filling.

The parking is ample it seems.  While it's not been dirty or messy, the decor is not very impressive.  Not bad, not great but a-ok.
