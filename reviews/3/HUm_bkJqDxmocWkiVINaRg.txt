Having to wait for the plane, I decided to stop by the place next to this to sit and get something to eat.  I didn't know at the time, but basically it was food from the Blue Burrito they get through a window and they serve their own drinks.  

It was well worth coming in and sitting down to eat.  The burrito was great and the salsa was excellent as well.  The chips were just store bought, but everything else was great.  I would say it's some of the best airport food I've eaten.
