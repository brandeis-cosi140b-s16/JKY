I just visited El Bravo for the first time.  I have mixed feelings about it.  I ordered the guacamole tostada with a side of rice and beans.  I didn't think there was anything especially tasty about any of them, although the tostada shell was nice and crunchy.  I love cheese, but even I would agree with fellow Yelper Cookie that there was a tad too much cheese for my liking.  The salsa didn't have much flavor, and just tasted like tomatoes to me.  However, the hot sauce made up for it.  Flavorful and spicy, it has a little kick to it.  You do have to pay for the chips and salsa here, $1 not a big deal.  Okay, now on to the best part of my visit.  The horchata was AMAZINGLY delicious!  Lots of cinnamon, just the way I like it.  To make things even better we were getting free refills on the horchata.    However, don't get too excited.  I'm not sure if this is always the case, or if it was because we were there 30 minutes before close and they were just trying to get rid of it.  The cinnamon chips they give to each guest at the end of the meal were amazing too!  A crunchy, little round chip (tortilla size) covered with cinnamon and sugar.  It was the perfect little sweet treat to follow all the hot sauce I had eaten.  I definitely see these becoming a new sweet bite that I crave.  The prices here were very reasonable, and I would visit here again, even if just for the horchata and cinnamon chips!
