It seems as if I cannot find a legit Mexican restaurant in Vegas, all the best ones are definitely in California! I came here because I had a taco craving. I ordered carne asada tacos to go and waited about a good 10 minutes, mind you there was no one ahead of me. There was limited seating since most of the tables were dirty and still had plates on them. When I got home, I was starving. I took my first bite and it felt as if my mouth was on fire! I usually like a little kick but this was honestly too much. I'm not sure what kind of salsa/sauce that was but I will order without from now on. Tacos were okay, not great. Probably will try something else next time.
