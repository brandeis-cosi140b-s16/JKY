Growing up in California  may have spoiled me when it comes to Mexican food, so I definitely was not a fan and quite disappointed with my food. So were most of my party (12 total). 

Tried the 
-guac (bland for most of our tastes)
-steak nachos (messy amd beans on the bottom?)
-queso (watery)
-steak quesadilla
-veggie tacos/rajas (meh)

Wish we had a better experience since we were showing first time visitors around.

Server was a bit short with the service he was providing  too, though management and hostess were extremely friendly.
