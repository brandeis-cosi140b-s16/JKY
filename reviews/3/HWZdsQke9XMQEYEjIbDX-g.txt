So I love me some Mr. Andres and was super excited to check out the new digs in Vegas, but I have to say I found CP almost *too* casual -- if that's possible. 

Don't get me wrong.. you definitely see (and taste!) the Jose Andres flair in the menu but CP just doesn't feel special enough to match the food.  It's a simple space w/almost a fast food feel to it... I half expected to go up to the counter to order.  Gladly, we did have waiter service and our waiter was pretty great -- answering all our questions and coming by to check on us quite often. 

The food prices also don't warrant the casualness.. I spent $70 on my half of the 'casual' meal which was well worth it in terms of the food, BUT for that price I'd like to enjoy my dinner in a space that makes me feel like it warrants that amount, know what I mean? 

As for the food, the duck tongue taco and the pork belly sandwich were the standouts. I thought everything was very good but the noodle dish was rather 'meh' and I also didn't quite see what the hoopla was about with the fish taco -- fell kinda flat for me w/not much flavor.  

I'd also skip the desserts...very lackluster. 

All in all not sure I'd return.. save your $ for The Bazaar in LA where the true JA style shines through IMHO. ;-)
