I wanted to hate this place more than I do, but it's not that bad.   Been here a few times and the food was average to above average.  Drinks were normal, but any specialty drinks or tequilas seemed expensive. The nachos were very good, and different than most places.  I liked the music, and no they don't play much Santana at all.

The staff is young and inexperienced, so service is hit or miss. 

 If I had to hang out at Tempe Marketplace I'd come back here I guess.
