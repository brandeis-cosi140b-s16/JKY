Went here when I was 39 weeks pregnant for a lunch date. I have been obsessed with all food Mexican for the past several months and am all about good Tex-Mex.  atmosphere was good, lunch crowd was busy but not overwhelming. Our server went over the specials and I decided on two tacos.  One was shredded pork and the other was chicken and they were both very good.  Nothing outstanding..... I would be open to trying a margarita there and another more authentic dish.
