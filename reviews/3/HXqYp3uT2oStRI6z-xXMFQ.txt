My husband and I used to eat at Macayos every week but the service and food has gone down hill so quickly, especially at this location! We stopped eating there for 5-6 months. A few days ago we decided to give it one more try. Ernesto was our server and oh my goodness he was fantastic. He was prompt in service. Carried great conversation and really took care of us. 1 star for Macayos overall satisfaction. 5 stars for Ernesto. We will only be back when he is working from now on. There isn't much of a variety of restaurants on the west side so what we do have, I expect to be high quality. The food is too greasy and don't as authentic as it used to be. Keep up the great service and we might stick around long enough to see a change in the overall restaurant!
