This is not our favorite Mexican restaurant but we have been customers for 12 or 13 years. If we want Mexican food we can get to this store in about 5 minutes. There is a decent selection of margaritas and beers but wine selection isn't great. My wife liked her large margarita. The wine I had was not too good but no worse than at the Mexican restaurant 5 minutes from our Oregon home. My fajitas were good and plentiful. I couldn't finish everything. My wife couldn't finish her pollo especial and liked it.  Unfortunately service was not too good. We waited almost ten minutes for water though we had chips and salsa immediately. There was a busboy but other than delivering chips and salsa I don't know what he does: water delivery and refill and removing dishes are apparently not in the job description. Our waitress was nice and efficient but was challenged by the number of tables. Fortunately she could multitask that is taking multiple orders or delivering drinks to several tables or handling our check between other tasks. However service is important and there were problems which dropped my review stars. We will be back. It is so convenient we return eventually.
