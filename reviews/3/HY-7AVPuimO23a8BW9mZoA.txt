It seems like the more Fox restaurants I visit the more I realize that the food is just second fiddle in their quest for hipness.  And since I'm not a hipster doofus a lot of their effort rings hollow.  

The location is cool and patio allows you to enjoy the unique Spanish influenced architecture of the Borgata.  The decor, like all Fox restaurants, is hip and well executed.  The ambiance is perfect for the happy hour crowd.  Unfortunately I typically don't number myself with that group.  The music was too loud and stiffed any attempts to enjoy the wider ambiance.

A highlight were the chips.  They were dense and very close to those that I enjoyed while I lived in the Mexico.  We tried a number of dishes and they were all perfectly above average.  The cheese crisp was good but only warm and not worth the $10.  The carne asada tacos were good, positive nod to the creamed rice, but the price once again wasn't truly justified.  The salmon was tasty and well presented with the spinach, corn, and squash.  It was very nicely cooked but a tad fishy in taste.  We wrapped up the meal with the tres leches cake and, like everything else, it was good but not especially memorable.

So in summary, Fox restaurants- Blanco included- are good places to be seen but not necessarily the best places for distinctive and memorable food.  The food is good but I doubt its the real reason why so many people frequent them.
