Panchero's is a nice place to stop in for a quick burrito or quesadilla. It doesn't measure up Qdoba in my book, but it delivers a solid, fast meal. I have been to this location a few times and the service has been good.

I like the quesadillas best, but the burrito bowl and burritos are good, too. The hot salsa has a nice flavor and may be worth getting a side order of chips with. The ingredients are not always the freshest, so I end up picking certain things out, such as fatty parts of the meat and jalapeno tips. Overall, the food has satisfactory quality and flavors. 

Most people stick to steak and chicken, but I really recommend trying the carnitas and barbecoa for a more exciting meal. I find these meats to have much stronger, spicier flavors.
