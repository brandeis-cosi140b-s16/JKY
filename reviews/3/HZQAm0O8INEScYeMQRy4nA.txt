Second stop on mini food tour of the Container Park.  We shared a combo plate of three tacos with chips and rice and beans.  For the tacos, we picked the al pastor, asada, and carnitas.  All three were good, but too drippy/runny to be great.  (Warning: Be prepared to make a big mess!)

The highlight was the horchata which was the cinnamon-iest I've ever tasted, and I mean that in a good way.  However, a word of advice.  As those of you may have tried the silly cinnamon challenge will know, cinnamon does not dissolve in water.  That means that all the tiny particles of ground cinnamon sink to the bottom pretty quickly.  Just be aware of that, and give it a good stir pretty often with your straw to avoid a sip of cinnamon sludge.
