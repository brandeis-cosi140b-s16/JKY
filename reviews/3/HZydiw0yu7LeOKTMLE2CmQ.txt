Picked Mexx32 over some other, more tried and true places on Yelp based on the "modern" atmosphere.  While it was good, I'd probably try a more authentic spot next time.

It was nice to eat outside...both the drink menu and the food menus were pretty robust - but our server told us we had to order the tacos...so we obeyed. Assortment of 3 - out of about 12 options...like brisket, fried cod, mahi, roast pork, carne asada, shrimp/chorizo & mushroom.  He spoke highly of the mushroom taco, so I got that, shrimp and carne asada.  They were open face, and loaded with tasty toppings...on a single soft shell. They needed to double up on the shell as they got soggy right away and fell apart. I'm not even sure they were corn...they could have been flour. 

I added a side of rice and beans. They have 3 varieties of rice and 2 of beans. I opted for the "amazing creamy white" rice and black beans and was not disappointed. 

Over all - atmosphere was very nice, the table was too small for all the stuff that goes onto a table at a Mexican restaurant. The servers were helpful - too helpful...he talked a LOT...and was a little too pushy at times.  The cocktail was great and the portions were good. I've had more authentic tacos in Harrisburg though...hope to get another shot at some Mexican food while I'm in AZ though ... since we are only a short drive from the boarder!
