Atmosphere- A+ I am...afterall a California girl so sand and water=WINNING! Food was ok. Something I try to remind myself is that places like these are more atmosphere and cocktails then food and the end of the day bar food is bar food, usually fried in some way and it hits the spot. I love their margaritas! The happy hour is good too. I went with a friend and we just hung out for hours talking and laughing. I really enjoyed that. The thing I didn't love was the service. Be friendlier ladies! Smiling is not a crime. I felt like we had to work to pull our server out of her shell when really it should be the other way around. All in all I'll be back.
