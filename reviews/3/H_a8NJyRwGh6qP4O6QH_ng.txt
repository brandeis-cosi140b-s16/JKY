My brother vouched for this place, but to say I was apprehensive is an understatement. It makes you wonder when you enter a dining room that's a big, empty space with no diners, and a stack of boxes and a car seat (?!) piled up in full view of the front door.

Ordered a chicken salsa burrito chimi-style, and my bro got steak, potato and cheese. We opted to take the food to go, because the seating area just wasn't inviting, and quite poorly lit.

Imagine my surprise when I cut into my chimi and found it to be hot and flavorful! I was worried it would be overly greasy and inedible (like my last meal at Filiberto's...yeeeeck), but I ate the whole thing and my intestines didn't protest! The side of Mexican rice, though, was old and dry and crusty and downright bad.

So while there were some negatives, I did get a decent chicken chimi for cheap. It may be worth it to go back and try out the breakfast burritos.
