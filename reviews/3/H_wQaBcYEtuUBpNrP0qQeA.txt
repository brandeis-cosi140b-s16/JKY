For a mexican restaurant, Salsa's was decent.  There food is good and their margaritas are tasty.  I love chips and salsa and thought they were good here.  I'm not a tortilla chip conseseur like Joseph L.  If the chips are fresh and cripsy I am a happy camper.

The fried ice cream was delicious.  Chi-chi's was about the last time I had fried ice cream at a restaurant.
