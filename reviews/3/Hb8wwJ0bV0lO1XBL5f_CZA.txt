Ok.. only 3 stars because half or order was no bueno.  First the service...I don't think the workers wanted to be there today.  The first Kay could hear me and I had to repeat myself but other than that...the young man making my food was nice & accommodating...made my food the way I want.  The cashier picked up my bag of food and dropped it on the counter...uh not sure why.

I ordered the taco salad..no beans but the works.  Got the creamy tomatillo dressing on the side.  AWESOME!  I loved that the tortilla was soft & not fried. 

My son ordered the sweet barbacoa.  He did not like it.  The meat wad soaked in an over powering BBQ sauce, little to no cheese on the tortilla. The foil wad messy due to the meat being place in the pan first (not sure why they do this ). He got rice & beans instead of the salad.  Looks good but too much BBQ, not enough cheese. 

We will go back though we will not order the Sweet Barbacoa again.  P.S. look at the meat before you selected it...most of the meat is soaked in thick sauce.
