Came into Chayo last night for their Latin night. I was impressed by the decor and interior inside the restaurant. My friends and I saw at the bar and tried their three margaritas: original, mango, and strawberry. Mango and strawberry were gross! Just tequila laying on top of frozen fruit concoction. The originals were enjoyable. We ended up staying an hour and a half before leaving to go somewhere else because the Latin night was amateur. The DJ plays mainly reggaeton, which was okay for the little crowd they had, who obviously didn't know how to dance any other Latin Dances like salsa or bachata. Anyways, I give it three stars. This place could be fun, but just seems like a little senior frogs...and I'd rather just go to senior frogs.
