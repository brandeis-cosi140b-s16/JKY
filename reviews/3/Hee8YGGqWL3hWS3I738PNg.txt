Haven't had Baja Fresh for some years. But was craving their burritos with the yummy chips and salsa bar. Walked in to see they have a LOBSTER burrito thing. Well that was easy.

We ended up getting that and some steak burrito, which I didn't care for. But the lobster burrito was delicious with lot's of great flavor and more lobster chunks than I had expected.

(Don't you hate when you forget to review after going to the place and then when you actually have time to write the review, you forget half the information?? Darn.)
