So how many of you actually went in for dinner "hoping" for good food?  From the sounds of it, most of you were as closed-minded as the "Scottsdale trash" you protest to hate.  YET here you are, taking your business there anyway... if for nothing more than to write a nasty review about it.  Self-fulfilling prophecy?  And guess what, they still got your money.  

I'll admit, the first time I ate there, I was underwhelmed by the food.  But in recent months, since they brought on a new menu, it's definitely on the up.  I am assigning three stars based on the tremendous improvement in my experience between the first time and the most recent visit. 

The energy in the room is great.  I want to be friends with the entire staff.  The music is fun, and played at just the right volume.  In all, it's a pretty stellar ambiance.  Want it quieter?  Head to the patio!

And the food?  No, we're not talking Michelin-starred cuisine here, BUT it's inventive, well-executed, and down right tasty!  I am salivating thinking of the Mexican Turkey Chopped Salad right now.  May have to head over for lunch.  

The pink tacos, their namesake, are incredible... though I hear they are different since the menu change, so I can't judge the previous incarnation.  They are perfect grilled chicken with just enough tangy contrast from pickled pink onions.  

My girl loves the lobster enchiladas, but they are a bit rich for me.  Who else has lobster enchiladas, though?!  And the mushroom quesadillas nearly left me crying, especially with that smoky little pile of whatever they are served with.  Is that chipotle jam or something?  delicious.  

Overall, it's going to be a great time if you are in the mood for relaxed, yummy fun.  Take off your pissy pants and head over to the Waterfront.  Otherwise, stay home and watch Bjork on dvd.
