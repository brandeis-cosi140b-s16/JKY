Classic margarita was 100% agave with housemade mix.  Too sweet, but adjusted to my taste on request.  It lost some flavor in the process.  Certainly not the worst margarita i've had, and it was only $5.  Wild mushroom enchiladas were nutritious and delicious, if not scrumptious.  Pinto beans were a tad undercooked, but in a positive way that added nice texture.  Lots of interesting pork options for next time.
