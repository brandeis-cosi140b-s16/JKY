I love Mexican which means I can be very picky about my Mexican food.  Casa del Sol did not disappoint.  Immediately we were served chips and salsa.  I was a big fan of the salsa, not a fan of the spicy carrots (?) and jalapenos that were put on the chips...too much hot for my liking.  I ordered a banana margarita and the three people I was with ordered margaritas as well along with waters.  It did take a while for us to get the waters, and even longer to get the margaritas, but they did fill up the waters quickly when we finished them.  I ordered the enchiladas chile poblano.  LOVED THEM.  They used real cheese, and lots of it, and the sauce was excellent.  I wish there was more of it.  The mexican rice that came as a side was also delicious.  My one complaint about the enchiladas was the the bottom of the tortillas were very tough and chewy, but overall, I would order those again.  All in all, I thought the prices were reasonable, the food excellent and the service average.
