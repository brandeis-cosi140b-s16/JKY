I would have to say one of the better designs of restaurants I've seen in the metro area.  Who ever designed this place I would give an A+ to.  The place seemed very sleek, contemporary and welcoming.  

Service at first was a bit slow- but that is expected when the restaurant is packed but once the person came to our table there was a friendly vibe and gave some of their fav recommendations which I can tell were actually genuine.  

Now the food on the other hand wasn't bad, but it was basically just okay.  Started with the calamari which was actually very good.  The light dusting of sauce made it very yummy, and not to much breading so that was delicious.

So next was the taco's which I was dying to try.  So we ordered 4 different ones.  The first was the Korean Beef Taco everyone was raving about.  Was good, don't get me wrong but seemed to lack a certain something.  The wild mushroom taco was our favorite as it was bursting with mushrooms, flavor and had enough creme sauce to take away any dryness.  Third taco up was the tempura cod- which again seemed to lack any flavor but the fish was cooked well as was the vegetables and guac.    Lastly was the Pork taco that looked the best but couldn't taste any of the pineapple flavor or salsa but only the pickled onion and guac.   

One the plus side, the cocktails are poured perfectly!  Won't give up since everyone has good days and bad days so there are lots of other items to give it a chance
