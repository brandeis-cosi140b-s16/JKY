KoMex is 0/2 for me, so far. 

First visit, I wanted to try their bulgogi and experimented with the Philly Cheese Steak with bulgogi. It looked amazing! It tasted pretty dang good. My problem was, I ordered a sandwich, because I wanted to eat quickly and without hassle. I had to eat the sandwich with a knife and fork - as soon as I unwrapped the sandwich, the entire thing exploded on my plate.

Second visit, I went for a burrito, again, I wanted something quick and easy to eat, what's easier to eat than a friggin burrito? Again, as soon as I unwrapped the burrito, the thing exploded, it had a rip length-wise down the burrito. Back to the knife and fork for a second time.

Flavor-wise, food quality, and service are all great there. I just really, really would like to eat my meal as intended. I get frustrated with pain in the ass food (I get hungry mid-meal, so the faster I can eat food, the better), hence the reason I order what should be quick to eat.Having to just empty food onto a plate and pick at it defeats the purpose of ordering certain items.

One more try, then I give up.
