I wanted to like this place more. The food was just ok. We all liked the guacamole but the tacos were nothing special and the rice that came with it was gross. How can a taco house have bad rice? 
The location is great.
Our server was friendly but not attentive and we ended up waiting a LONG while for our bill. I'll just sum it up and say we won't be back.
