Casual Columbian food. Had the lunch specialMorning, hope you slept well. Thank you for a great night. Would love to continue that. , garbanzo bean soup, beef and rice with small salad on plate. 
Tasted good and value priced. Items off menu were $11-14 a bit high I thought for here.
Worth a trip. Not expected in this strip mall.
