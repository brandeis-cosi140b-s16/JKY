Great burritos and they serve beer!!

However compared to the one by UNLV (Maryland and Harmon) its not as good. They hook it up with Guacamole over there, big portions and if you show your student ID you get a free drink. Bad ass. 

Still this place is great if you dont want Mall food or other crap near by. 
Oh and the price is not marked up at all even though its on the strip.
