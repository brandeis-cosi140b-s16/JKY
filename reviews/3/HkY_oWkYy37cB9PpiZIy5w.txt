Not the same quality food... Is there new owners?  The Shredded Beef Chimi was lacking  filling.  The taco meat was good, but the shell was cooked different. Chincy on the beans, rice  and cheese. The best part is the salsa, especially their version on "HOT".  Bill was $32.00  with tip, for three orders.  Free  chips.
