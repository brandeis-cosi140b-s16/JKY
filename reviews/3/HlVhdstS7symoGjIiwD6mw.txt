Difficult to find the first time as their.large lighted sign out mostly in need of repair. Parking is difficult in a crowded small strip center. The service was excellent even though it was understaffed. A lot of choices from a clean menu. Ordered tamales which were equal to something I could buy in the frozen section at walmart. Dessert was average, flan.
Two people two drinks two desserts total with tip $52.00
 Over priced under quality.
