I live across the street and wanted this place to be great so I could stop in for a late meal or a random lunch. In my humble opinion its average at best. 

Food is almost bland no real flavors as I think they want you to dump salsa or peppers all over it. 

Taco Bell is right across the lot if you are desperate but you will have to really have a taco craving that cant be satisfied for that.
