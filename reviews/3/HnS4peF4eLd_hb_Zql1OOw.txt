I love this place usually. However tonight when I along with 4 others dined we didn't have great service. Our server wasn't the friendliest. He tried to talk one of us out of getting an item. An item that he always gets. Then when we asked for an empty to go cup to pour our left over dressing we were told that would be a $1.35 charge. That is beyond ridiculous. I can not believe that we were charged for an empty to go cup. That blows my mind. I have never been charged to take home something I've already purchased. Very disappointed in this trip to chuys. Let's hope I come back.
