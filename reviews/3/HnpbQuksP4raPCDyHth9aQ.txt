If it is real authentic mexican food? I think not, more likely real mexican fastfood. You really cant compare it with Mexican restaurant in Belgium or Holland. More a McDonalds style cheap Mexican rip off. Wel the food it self was not bad, but it was fast food. And the place itself had seen its best years,  Manu years ago. It Needs Some restauration. The prices are cheap, and they are open 24/7.
