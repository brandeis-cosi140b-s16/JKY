So, I agree with several of the 3 stars here and I am leaning on probably a 3.5 for here but, I can't quite put a 4 down. This has been on my list to  eat visit for awhile because of its odd Asian/Mexican fusion which does not seem to make sense. The place itself is like an acid trip with videos on the walls, stadium seating at bar, and bike wheels on ceiling. 
The place is all small portion and sort of a tapas with large meal prices. 
My meal
Dan Dan Mian Noodles $12- really good with great flavor, a great soba noodles and sauce.
Chilaquiles $13- Which is basically tortilla chips, sour cream sauce, and a tomatillo type sauce. This is very close to a tradition version of this dish and it was good and rich.
20 vegetable fried rice $20- This was the best of them all, a great mix of veggies that I have eaten in such youthful form and great flavor.. However the size overall was probably 2 cups.

Desert- Mango rice $11- which was airy and very light with a cream rice flavor and cold mangos.

Drinks-Singapore Sling- Traditionally made and perfect! (where did these go America)

Salt Air Margariita- Crazy good with a salt flavored foam.

Overall a solid meal, however the bang for the buck is lacking. after tip this meal for 1 is over $90 and I can say I was not full in the end. So, the food is good but you are going to have to order 3 items per person to consider it a meal.
