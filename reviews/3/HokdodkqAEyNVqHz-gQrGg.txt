Called before I stopped by to confirm it was still 2x1 tacos. Unfortunately after I got to the taco stand and actually ordered is when I was told it was only for the al pastor tacos. Bummer. I switched up my order and took it home. Tacos were pretty small. Flavor was alright, but the meat has a little too much gristle for my liking.
