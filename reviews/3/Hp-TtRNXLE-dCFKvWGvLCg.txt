Really need to break this down:

Food Quality :  4 stars  food is excellent; however both orders were incomplete.

Service:  2 stars.  Not very attentive, but friendly.  Never had a chance to say something about the missing items.

This was my second trip to this place.  Now I will say I will return, but if the service doesn't improve may have to downgrade.  Hopefully can come back and give it a four star review.
