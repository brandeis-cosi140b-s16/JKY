Hmmm what to say about this chevy's.  Our waiter brought us out chips and salsa with two cups of salsa.  He informed us that he wasn't allowed by chevy's management to bring us 2 salsas unless we asked for them, but that he was sucha renegade that he had brought us 2 and damn the man.  We obviously assumed he had only told us this / done this to get a better tip, since bringing us 2 salsas is more work for him than only bringing us one.

Then we ordered guacamole, which he didn't bring us.  So, not good for the tipping there.

Then when we told him to cancel our guacamole, he said he would cancel it from the bill but bring it to us anyway.  This twist made us decide that probably he just hated working at Chevy's and wanted to screw them in any way he could, big or small, so we were back on his side again.

Then when he brought us the bill, he put it down between the two of us but said "Here you go, sir" to my friend, which was really weird (my friend always gets handed the bill when we go out together since he is a man and I am a woman, but it always cracks us up because it never happens to us except when we are in champaign urbana, and then it happens every time.)
