This place is conveniently located so that's my favorite part about coming here. They can be found most weekend nights in the Showtime car wash parking lot on Tropicana, just east of Jones. 

My fella and I come here when we want a quick street taco fix and don't want to travel too far away from home. The meats are a little on the dry side, but still flavorful. The salsa bar is limited to three salsas and some other fixings that didn't looks too appealing so I settled for some salsas and took them to go with us. 

They packaged the tacos well. They never spill or slide around on the plate during our drive home. My favorite was probably the asada. That's pretty strange for me since I usually prefer el pastor, but this one isn't my favorite. 

Still a solid choice in the area and the service is pretty friendly and efficient.
