Actually its the same menu as Loredo's, when this first opened alot of the same guys were at both places.  I have been noticing the portions for the Chicken Fajitas has been smaller each time, lots more onions and veggies and less Chicken.  But I always get the hot salsa ( by request only) and that usually makes the meal even better.  Still cant beat the value for the money, its my regular go to lunch spot
