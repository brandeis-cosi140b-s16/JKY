I am not one to normally complain about my food. 

I work in the mall and used to visit chipotle quiet often. Flavors started to be inconsistent way too often, so I stopped going. I decided today to give it a try. I ordered a cheese quesadilla to go. I walk right up to the register and she asks, "just the chicken quesadilla?" I was a little frustrated, I prefer their quesadillas with no meat. I said, "actually, I had asked for just cheese but it's fine." She tells me she can tell him and have him remake it. I replied no it was fine, I just didn't want to be charged for the meat. She charged me just for cheese. 

While waiting for it to cook, I saw the same gentleman that made my food, playing with the rice. It looked like to me he was trying to see how big of a scoop of rice he could make. I've worked in the food industry. Not the smartest thing to do in front of people eating the food you've been playing with. 

These are new kids since the last time I visited. I would just like them to know, and teach the employees making food to pay more attention. I did not see a manager around, or I would have spoken with them. I'm not mad, just think there needs to be a manager around to check on the guests, especially if someone has a concern made to the receptionist.
