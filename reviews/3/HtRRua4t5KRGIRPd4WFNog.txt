Another late night hunger fix. I was out and about last night near downtown, so this place was on my way home. I ordered the taquitos with everything (lettuce, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, slice of tomato and rice and beans) The menu is basically in Spanish... so I guess I shouldn't' have been surprised when the women could not speak or understand any English.  It was touch and go interacting with her... I'm shocked I got what I ordered. Without asking they give you two extra small green sauce and two extra small red sauce containers. I'd rather they ask my preference and give me more of just one, but next time I'll just ask for extra. 

I ordered the taquitos with beef, but I heard her say "pollo" several times to the cook... so at least 3 times I confirmed that I ordered beef. On the 3rd time she finally got it and started screaming a bunch of things to the cook, the only one I understood being "carne asada" so keep an eye on her. 

The taquitos and toppings were really good. Easily some of the best I've had. Green sauce was great. The rice and beans were absolutely terrible. Inedible. I know I shouldn't be expecting much from rice and beans at drive thru late night taco stand, but this was seriously terrible. 

There's a $1 charge to use credit cards, so bring cash. My total price was under $10 including the extra charge.

I would definitely return for the taquitos and/or to try the tacos next time I'm in the area.
