My sister and I decided to go here because we loved the previous mexican restaurant.  It was good, not fantastic that I am rushing back,but good.  The decor is a bid weird and not what I expected.  The service was very prompt.  We tried the Mango Cilantro Margarita, my sister loved it but I thought it was ok.  We ordered chips and salsa, they brought 2 types of salsa, I was in love with the green and my sister was in love with the red!!!  The scallops were AMAZING!!!  There was some heavenly green sauce they were in that made me want to lick my plate, definitely recommend these!  We also had the pork w/ pumpkin and some red sauce, it was ok.
