I lived in Austin, TX for a good while so when I moved I was bummed to leave behind all the awesome Mexican food the city had to offer.  My husband and I searched and searched for a good Mexican joint until we came across Los Gemelos--it means twins in Spanish :)

The food was average.  The staff was super friendly, but the food just didn't measure up (and yes, I do have high expectations but Mexican food is NOT that hard to cook if you know what you're doing).  If you don't have a car and live close to UW, then the restaurant's location on State Street can't be beat.  However, Cucos on Buckeye Rd in East Madison (off Stoughton) sets the standard for Mexican food in Madison.  This is the place to eat if you're in the mood for authentic Mexican food--ask for Diana!  She makes killer margaritas.
