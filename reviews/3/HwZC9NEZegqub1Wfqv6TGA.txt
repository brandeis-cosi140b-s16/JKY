Solid burrito, taco, quesadilla joint.  I generally put Chipotle above Qdoba, but the food and service at this location is quite good.  At $5 per, burritos on Fridays are a nice value (though I've taken to adding extra chicken for a bit more $).

My one gripe is that they don't put enough meat in their tacos.  However, that seems to be a Qdoba-wide issue and not specific to this location.
