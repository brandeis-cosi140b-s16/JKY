I think for a quick decent Mexican meal this is a good spot.  Not the kind of place you would go on a date but the food is good and the portions are good.  They make fresh tortillas right there and they're tasty.  I've had the enchiladas and the tacos here and they were good.  I think it is more of a lunch spot than dinner place but it depends on your mood I suppose.  They also have a great selection of hot sauces over by the soda machine so they are almost guaranteed to have what you like in that department.  I think next time I'll try the nachos because I am just a sucker for nachos!
