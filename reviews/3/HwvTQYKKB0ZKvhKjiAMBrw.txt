The chicken soup and grill shrimp are so yummy!!!! The plantain is sweet too! 

We went in late on Friday night around 11pm, and I got to say the area didn't feel safe at all around this time. You'll see a lot of random people on the street or parking lot. 

The service is ok, bc they have a soccer game on so the servers were more into the game than customer. However, the food is worth our time. 

Maybe, next time I'll go in during the daytime.
