Talked to the concierge at the hotel  and there were few options for us with the large group and wanting to eat fairly soon.  We headed over to Diablo's who could seat us right away.

Given that it was dinner time with a packed restaurant and bar our service was excellent.  I am not saying there were no delays, but they were minimal especially given the crowd and our group size.

Margaritas were average, but well made and quickly brought to the table.  The chips and salsa were average.  The chips crisp and nicely salted.  The salsa however, was only average. There were 3 different types of salsa but none of them were particularly memorable.  The guacamole was fresh and creamy but also did not stand out.

The chicken burrito was thick and you could order it "wet" or with a nice mole.  While good it was average, much like other tex mex places that I have eaten around the country.

The bet thing of the night was the wait staff who were quick, polite, and efficient with no errors.  The food only rates a 3 but the staff would get a 4 stars (I was not there for the dancers or the staff might get a 5 star).
