I am very confused how to review this place. 

Atmosphere: Rivals McDonald's (1 Star)

Service: Not very good

Cost: In relation to the area, seems a little expensive for what you get

Time to get food: Sooo long!  Took about 30 minutes to basically get fast food.

Food: Pretty darn good (4 Star)

The chips and salsa were pretty terrible.  My mom had the taco salad, it looked very fresh & delicious, but they brought it out without all the components (forgot sour cream and guac)  My dad had the hatch chili & pork stew, pretty delicious, but a little spicy.  I had the 3 carne asada tacos, pretty delicious.  I also had the plain fry bread, a lot better than I have had in the past, but different.  It was not greasy, but it is a little thicker than I have had in the past.  Next time I will get the dessert version.  

Will I come back? Very likely, but I will call in the order and do to go so I don't have to wait forever.    The food was the only bright spot (except for the chips and salsa).
