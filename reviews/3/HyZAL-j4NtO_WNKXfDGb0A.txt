I've been here a few times and never walked away thinking "wow, that was so amazing I'm never going to eat again."  Which is what I pretty much expect.  Ever.

The service was exceptional, the food was decent, but I'm just a wee bit concerned when I read all the dishes has some exceptional spices and "mom's secret spices" and then seemed....blah.  I ordered carnitas fajitas.  The pork was SUPER soft and melted in my mouth but I couldn't taste any of those secret spices or whatever that's supposed to be in the dish.  I thought onions and bell peppers were supposed to give flavor to the meat?  Whatever, I still ate it.  What's cool is they gave me two HUGE flour tortillas that were freshly made.  

We even ordered guacamole that is prepared fresh at your table...and it wasn't amazing.  It was good, just not amazing.  

I'll go back because it WAS a good experience, just don't expect 100% authentic mexican food :)  Not like I know what that is anyway.....
