It is not as good as it used to be, when the original owners ran the joint, for sure. You can tell that by the lack of business they have these days. Back in the day, there were always a few families at the tables, and the delivery guy was in and out  constantly. That is no longer the case. 

We went last week and just got some burritos - carne asada and machaca. Both were good, giant burritos like you expect from any of the "berto's" places around town. I prefer their carne asada to others in the vicinity, so we'll probably go back, but it is definitely becoming a hit and miss operation. I'm not sure they will be around for the long haul.

One day, I may have to journey up to Anthem to check out the new place the old owners opened.

Also, if you are from San Diego - take note that this place offers a very similar menu to those Roberto's, but it is not the same. You will know right away it's not, when you see the hot sauce.
