I have been on the search for authentic Mexican food in the Charlotte area, and this is not it. By no means is the food terrible but it isn't great great either, it is very Americanized. The first give away is when they offer you hard shell tacos, second when you get offered ground beef tacos, third their rice water is very grainy sort of like a rice water mix from Walmart. On a positive note their service is great and their portions are huge! But unfortunately not authentic :-(
