I enjoy eating here as it's always on the short list of a friend of mine.  While I have found lower prices elsewhere, I certainly wouldn't call this place expensive.  

I very much enjoy the fresh salsa and chips, and love their chimis.  You can't go wrong with this place.  And they always bring us a little desert at the end of the meal.  I don't know exactly what it's called, but it's fried tortilla with honey and whipped cream.  Perfect way to round out the meal!
