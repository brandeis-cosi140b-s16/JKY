I've been looking for authentic Mexican food and I was told that this place was legit.

I was looking for authentic barbacoa and this place has it on the weekends.

I tried several tacos, sopes and the barbacoa (I'd course) and everything was just ok.

It's with the visit but wouldn't crave it.

The horchata was the best thing they had and was a little too sweet for me.

Cheers
