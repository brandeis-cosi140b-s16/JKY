after having chipotle for many many times, then trying zabas. i must sayyy chipotle is for beginners! who would have ever thought that sour cream and cheese would taste amazing with rice and beans? well what i do love more at chipotle than zabas are their chips and guac! the chips have a hint of lime that when ordering, i sometimes only get the chips and splash some mild tabasco on them. mmmmm!
