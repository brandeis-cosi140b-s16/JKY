Like a Hawaiian Chipotle...pretty much sums the place up. Got a flyer in the mail about Braddah's and since I was wanting to try a place I'd never been to before, I decided to try them out with a to go order. Decor is tidy and clean, and the staff was friendly.

Now, even though this place is LIKE a Chipotle, you have to remember that Hawaiian food is not like Mexican food, and so you have to build your bowl a little differently. I, however, did not make that distinction initially and paid the price by ending up with a bowl of very random tastes which did not entirely play nice together. Cheese and Kalua Pig do not mix! And guac doesn't particularly work with the salsa I chose either.

I had one big complaint, and that was the container used for my bowl. I'm not a stickler for how my food is presented, but a change is needed here. My "bowl" was a clear rectangular plastic container. The server, bless her heart, crammed, and I mean CRAMMED, this cube as full of food as she could. The sight of all the food just smashed in there was just unappetizing! Then, when I got home, all the guac stuck to the lid with the cheese and lettuce as well. Ick. Hopefully the dine in bowls are better, but the to go bowls need to be more like Chipotle or Zabas.

Food quality was good, however, and I'd say most of my negatives were actually my fault for not asking for the right combination of ingredients. I'll definitely give them another try, as the chicken looked delicious.
