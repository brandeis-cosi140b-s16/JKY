Only tried 2 dishes - squid in ink and chicken with peppers. Squid was fine but it's just squid grilled. The sauce is ink sauce - not much taste. Chicken was obviously heated - sauce was hot but chicken was like warm. It tasted like tomatoe sauce without much more than that. Overall it was ok. Nothing special nor terrible. The bread was poor but the aioli sauce was tasty. They'd do better by serving tortillas or pita. My piece of bread was a bit stale.
This place is really close to where I live do was hoping it was great but it's just ok.
