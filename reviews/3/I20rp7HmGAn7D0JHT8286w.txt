I am rating Senor Taco based on 2 items: California burrito + chicken/steak fajitas.  I love the fact that they offer these two items and it's a great escape for me when I am craving them (which happens quite often).  However, lately I feel that their food has become overly greasy...which leaves a funny taste in the mouth that overpowers everything else.  Good portion sizes though and a decent salsa bar.  ~3 stars for now.
