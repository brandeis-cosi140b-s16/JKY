I've had better fajitas, but overall it wasn't bad. The service was very good. Chips and salsa were good and the beer was cold. The only bad part was undercooked fish. One of my friends had the fish taco and as I said it was not cooked. Still cold in the middle. The waiter was very nice and took the meal off the check no questions. I would go back.
