I used to be afraid of foil wrapped burritos after a painful experience a few years ago.  So, I would usually get the crispy tacos here or if I did order a burrito I would perform an airport-security like check of all the folds and creases after removing the foil.  Now that I have had all my old metal fillings replaced I can eat their burritos without having a mild anxiety attack but I still prefer the tacos for lunch because of the smaller portion size.  Either way it's darn good fast food.

If you were born after 1980, you probably have no idea what I am talking about.
