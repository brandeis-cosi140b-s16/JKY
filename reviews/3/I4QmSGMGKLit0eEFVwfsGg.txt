Mixed feelings about this place. It gets 3 stars primarily for existing; it is the only Mexican style restaurant in the immediate are I am aware of and being someone that really likes Mexican, I will continue to come. 
The service is great and the food is slightly below average. I asked for something spicy and they said they could bring me a spicy salsa, but did not have any spicy food on the menu (that blew me away and a huge negative). 
It is quite inexpensive and you get health lunch portions (healthy meaning you get how much one should eat, which is less than most other places). 
I had the lunch chimichanga with water for $7.09 plus tip. Overall, I would give it 2.5, but rounding up since have to do whole stars.
