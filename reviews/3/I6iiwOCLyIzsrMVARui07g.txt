I usually order the crispy chicken ranch taco, which im always satisfied with.. but tonight, I wanted to tried something different... ordered the crispy shrimp taco and it was alright. This was my second time having it and I felt like it tasted better the first time. There was more lettuce and pico de gallo in it this time and I barely tasted the shrimp. The churro I ordered could've been better. A little too hard for me. Other than that , its always a plus that theyre open late at night!
