I was massively craving Mexican food and I was going to stop by the Roberto's across the street, but the parking lot was too retarded to park in so I decided just to stop by here. I ordered a Diablo Burrito with steak and added 9000 jalapenos to it. It was not super spicy which I was craving, but it was satisfying. I tried the mango salsa with the chips which were pretty good. All in all a decent option, but I wish I could find amazing authentic local Mexican food here in Vegas.
