Have been twice so far. Decent meal. Not spectacular but not bad either. Guacamole was WAY overpriced for the amount you get. And it's a bit annoying that you've got to pay for the chips. Not a huge fan of the salsa's there. Only three salsas available the evening I went, but was hoping for more, given we had to pay to get chips to dip into them!
