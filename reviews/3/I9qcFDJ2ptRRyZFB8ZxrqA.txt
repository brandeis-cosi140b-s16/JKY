OK, I'll fess up, I was scared to go there.

I thought I would have to get over staring at "dead" Agave; my old reliable friend, poor dead Agave!  Plus, the word on the street has been none too favorable and annotated with eye-rolling and heavy sighs.  We didn't start out with it as our destination, but it did look rather cute and sparkly from the outside so we put our trepidation on hold, took a deep breath...f*ck it, I'm goin in!

9:00 PM and this place was near empty.  So now it's a question if it's sad, creepy, or both, but being lazy and already there overrode that.  We checked to see if they were still serving, they were, until 10PM and we were greeted and seated promptly.  Turns out reverse HH was in progress, I feel my fear slipping away.

The decor still mimics its former life, just less festive and browner.  A bit too brown and bright, but still comfy.  Cassette tape music that seems a bit out of place, but hey, I like Bob Marley and Depeche Mode.  

No HH menu, but our server, Leah was quick to point out all our options and offer tips, plus she was great throughout our entire stay. We decided to just HH and started with a really tasty pitcher of fruit ladened sangria and a standard Margarita.  

Chips with three salsas 
Queso Fundido-mexican- three cheese fondue served with warm flour tortillas
Albondigas Mexicanas-classic red chile meatballs in roasted tomato-habanero sauce
Beef Picadillo Empanadas-flaky beef-filled pastry with almonds, spices, and Dos Caminos house hot sauce 

Everything was OK, no major taste sensations, but OK enough that I would come back and try some items off their main menu.
