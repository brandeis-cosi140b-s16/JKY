The food was standard Mexican food served in U.S. restaurants to non Mexican people. With that said, the food was ok. It had too much cheese on it. It's surprising how much cheese was on the food. The food was also pretty greasy. It was a good takeout and the folks were pleasant. For under 10 I can't complain.
