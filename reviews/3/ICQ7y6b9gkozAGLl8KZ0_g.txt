I like the place... Very quiet. The staff is attentive. Other patrons are pleasant. Great menu... Something to please even the pickiest of eaters.

Totally not a fan of the ceviche. They do not cook the fish in lime juice...so I was told by a staff member. The shrimp delivered on a bed of rice was delicious tho!
