Purchased a chicken taco salad to go. It was ready within 10 minutes. It came with chips and salsa! The hostess was very helpful. When she noticed I did not want dressing for the salad she included a second cup of salsa. Portions are large for the price. I gave only three stars because the shell was pre made, the chicken was salty and the salad mix had carrots and red cabbage in it (who does that?). I have eaten at this location before and probably will again. It was not fabulous, just ok.
