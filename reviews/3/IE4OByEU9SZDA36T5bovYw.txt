It's ok. I love their competitors Roberto's so when someone at work told me this place was baically the same thing I thought I would give it a try since it was closer. Never again. 
The food was decent, the place was clean and staff friendly but it's just a cheap knock off. Must say the pricing  was really good.  One could get lunch for not too much cash out of pocket which is always a good thing.

I'll stick with my usual  place.
