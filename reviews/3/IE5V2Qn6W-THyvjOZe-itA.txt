Not impressed, and it does not take alot to make me twinkle. The burritos are half the size and twice the price.oh and if you complain , they act like Apple. Love it or leave, whats the alternative?..Taco Bell?..

I'll stay away for now, as always keep shopping around and don't settle for less. Vote with your dollar!!
