Went to Arriba today for my second time.  My first time for lunch and tried the $4.99 chicken chimi lunch special.  The service was good for the most.  Good salsa served with the chips.  Everything was good for the most part, Chimichanga was served with rice and beans.  Good enough flavor.  Nothing spectacular.  The Chimi was a bit smaller than it looked on the add and what I am used to seeing at other places(probably about the size of three tacquitos rolled together), but well worth five bucks.  Still I am not a fan of deception, speaking of which when I ordered I was asked if I wanted Sour Cream and Guacamole, which I thought was an offer not an upsell.  It ended up coming up to $2.25 together, nice job bumping up my bill by 50%.  Overall though I would return and just avoid the upsells.  The food is good, not great, but you will not find a whole lot better for $4.99.
