Customer service is top notch. Although the lunch hour rush gets hectic they still take the time to interact with customers. That being said, I have a couple complaints.1)I normally order for the office and fax it in about 2-3 hrs before pick-up time. When I arrive for pick-up the order is still not ready. It's tough when I only have 30min for lunch and have to wait extra time. This leads me to complaint #2: Because they're rushing to complete my order, orders get completed wrong. By the time I get to the office and my fellow coworkers open their food, it's made wrong i.e. missing ingredients and/or unwanted ingredients. 

I would go back to get an individual order, but wouldn't recommend for big group orders.
