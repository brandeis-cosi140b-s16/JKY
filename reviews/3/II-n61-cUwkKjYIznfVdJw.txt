A group of 14 of us date here one evening during our last visit.  Service was a little slow, but not terrible.  Food was pretty good, but not outstanding.  Nice change if you're staying at Red Rock for many nights, but I prefer Terra Rosa, T-Bones or Yardhouse, so probably won't make it back here very often.
