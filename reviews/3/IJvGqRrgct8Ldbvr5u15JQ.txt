The food was good. However, the service sucked, for me. I practically had to wave down a waiter/waitress to ask for another beer. When I did get attention, their first response was "check?" And then they brought it anyway. Seemed like they were trying to get me out of the way. Granted, I was by myself, eating alone and it was the start of the dinner rush. I don't think this is an excuse for the neglect of service. What little I did interact with the staff, they were polite. Atmosphere was pretty cool, bathrooms were clean.
