We used to go to this place when they had a location on Decatur/Sahara but it closed so we schleped to the East side. 

Up: Tasty little pockets of goodness.  I love the pork carnitas in green sauce and my son is dreaming of the carne asada even as I write this. 

Downside (and the reason for only 3 stars):  Not one person there would admit to speaking English.  This presented a real problem when we first called to find out their hours and when placing a to-go order.  
We each had 1 gordita while at the place and got a fairly hefty order to go so we could bring it home to the rest of the family.  The entire order was wrong.  We salvaged what we could from it but it was too far across town to return it. 

Our conclusion is that we will eat in but never take anything home.
