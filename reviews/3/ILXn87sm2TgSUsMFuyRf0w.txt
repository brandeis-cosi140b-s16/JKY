Went here on 7-29-11....since this was my first date night out with my hubby in over a year we decided t hat we wanted to go to a club/bar.
We did not eat here so I can't give a review about that.
We had alot of fun dancing. Music was pretty good and people were pretty friendly. We got there early. We arrived around 7: 30 pm and there was a guy and his guitar....he was pretty good. After 10 pm they clear tables for a dance floor. I was having a great time until some of the bartenders got on top of the bar and started dancing on it! I mean if that's your kind of thing then this is the place for you! I for one am a little on the jealous side so I was definitely not feeling this place because of that! If you are gonna have girls dancing on the bars with their asses  hanging out, at least have some eye candy for me!!! 
I only gave this place three stars because the dance floor is kind of small and I didn't like the girls dancing on top of the bar with their asses in my face!
