Its a burrito stand in an airport. Come on people, what do you expect. However, their chorizo breakfast burrito is pretty damn good. I've been known to schedule my eastbound flights to allow enough layover to have a breakfast burrito.

BUT!  They recently went from a good salsa in a small plastic cup to packets of Tapatio. BOOO!!     Nothing against Tapatio, but the salsa was what made their chorizo burritos worthwhile. Bummer.
