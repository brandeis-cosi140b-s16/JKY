The food here is mixed quality and a bit inconsistent. First some of the appetizers I have tried include the guacamole (pretty good), mushroom and vegetable quesadilla (also good), black bean tortilla chips (meh) and these little chicken egg roll things (just ok). For entrees, I have tried different types of tacos and all were lacking. they neede for flavor. The drinks are very good actually, including the margaritas, and the restaurant has a decent beer selection. The bartenders are also very attentive. So the place is just okay. My preference is to go during happy hours but I go elsewhere for dinner.
