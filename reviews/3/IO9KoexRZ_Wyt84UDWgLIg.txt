This place is different. Has good salsa, recently started serving them with refried beans. "chips and salsa" are really tostada shells and salsa...no prob

Really good shrimp tacos, the best I've had.

Service is so so, usually can find a seat, not a server. Sometimes I feel like the cook is going to come out and take my order.
