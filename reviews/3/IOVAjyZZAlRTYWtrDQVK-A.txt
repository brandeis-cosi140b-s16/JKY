Why this place gets a 3 is because I give it a 2 and the hubs gives this place a 4. Honestly, i hated my dish (some enchiladas) but the hubs' Pollo Ranchero was good.

I liked their salsa and the quick service.

Another thing to mention- i had a sneeze-attack as soon as I got seated. Not sure what the reason was but it could be because of the strong smell of salsa. Anybody else experienced this?
