Love that Valle Luna sits right on the lake, I enjoy feeding the duckies chips (even though I'm not supposed to) and sitting outside. The food is good, not great, but good. The bean dip is also pretty good, but not as good as serranos. We come here once in a while, but not a place I'd go out of my way for. Like I said, good, but not great.
