An average food truck. Tacos are tasty, but nothing to write home about. This is good location to visit if you are in the neighborhood but please do not make a special trip to come here. Lastly, I should point out the cleanliness of the place is a bit of a turnoff...at least for me (the guy making my tacos took cash with his bare hands and did not wash them before taking care of the next customer.
