Many of the options at Desert Ridge are lame, but we needed a place for a little pre-shoe-shopping pit stop. 

I can't say I was overly impressed, however I credit San Felipe for turning me on to the "skinny" margarita. I ordered the South Beach TAN -- TAN must be some type of shorthand for FANTASTIC. Agave nectar, fresh lime juice and decent tequila -- I would say it was among the best margaritas I've had ever. It certainly blew doors off of my boy's standard marg, which was rather syrupy. 

We ordered the chicken quesadilla which was pretty average; I give them points for not using liquid smoke on the chicken as so many mall-Mexican places seem want to do. Service was slow but friendly. It took a really long time to get our app. If we'd ordered a meal, we may have been there a while.

SFC is a locally-owned chain, so there's a plus for those trying to go local.
