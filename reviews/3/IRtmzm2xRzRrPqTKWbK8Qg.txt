I was in love with the LA location and was looking forward to eating at the Las Vegas location. Um, DISAPPOINTMENT! they didn't have the pink margarita, which was my favorite. I did get the margarita though, but it was more like a sugarita. I took three sips and was disgusted because all I tasted was sugar, water and lime. The nachos were good, but everything else was blah. The location also isn't pretty as the LA one. The Nachos and customer service earned three star because everything else sucked.
