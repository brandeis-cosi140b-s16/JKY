This Filiberto's opened a few months ago in an old Wendy's location. When I first moved in, it was vacant, but literally, over night, this place was a full blown Filiberto's.  Only in Arizona!!!  Anyways, place is full of space, clean, and for the most part, good.  It's not my favorite Filly B's, but dang it, it gets the job done!

This place has a drive through as well, along with a great salsa bar and a full menu.  Service is kind of slow, but you get your food in no time.  It's located right next to a Fry's Grocery, and I stop here from time to time for some shredded beef tacos.  Overall, I like it here, and you can get your taco fix just about any time you need. I think their 24 hours, but I'm not 100%.
