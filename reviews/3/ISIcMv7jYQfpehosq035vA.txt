I came here for my 1 hour lunch break.  I ordered the pork torta ahogada.  I was not too impressed with this since I though the carnitas were going to be pulled pork and not cubed pieces of pork.  The pork did not have a lot of flavor, and I kept finding a lot of fat pieces in the sandchich.  The sauce that is used to soak the sandwhich had a bit too much oregano and was too spicy( and I love spicy food). They need to keep in mind that not everyone can handle that kind of heat.  I also ordered 1 taco, and this taco was good(but not enough to be on my fav taco place list).  I had gotten a pastor taco.  The taco was not that bad.  I am willing to give this place another shot layer on.
