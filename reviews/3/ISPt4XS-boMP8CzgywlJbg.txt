Pros:
Free refills on pop
Salsa bar with a variety of options
Fresh made chips
Friendly staff (welcome to Moe's!)

Cons:
Guac was too tomatoey
Dining room was cold because of the location of doors
Constantly hearing "welcome to Moe's"
Odd names for all of their items

In general, I'm a fan of Moe's, but usually only when I have a coupon as the cost can really add up when you add on the drink, chips, etc.  I like that everything is made fresh and too your liking.  I was disappointed with the flavor of the chicken and found my rice to be fairly dry.  On a second visit, I had tofu as my protein and I thought it was a much better option than the chicken was.  My major complaint is that they try to be cute with the names of their food items so half the time, I forget whay my burrito bowl is actually called by the time I get up to order it.
