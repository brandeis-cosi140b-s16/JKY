While nearby and looking for a quick meal, I stopped by the outdoor taco stand to pick up a few tacos to go. Despite the chilly weather, there was a line for the tacos. As I waited, I watched the tacos being made. The meats are precooked and kept warm. When you order, the corn soft shells are heated and the meat of your choice is added. When I asked the options, I struggled to understand what was communicated to me so I simply asked for 2 pork, 2 ground beef and 2 chicken. However, there were about 6 options including what I believed to be steak and a fajita mix. I then went inside to the toppings bar and added what I believed to be Pico de Gallo and a creamy guacamole, unfortunately nothing was labeled. I tried to ask a few questions to the cashier but she had some difficulty understanding me. Seems they could really benefit from a few posted signs with the meat options, prices and toppings. I took the tacos to go and shared them with my family. Overall, I felt the taste was authentic though the meat was a bit fatty for me. I also felt it lacked some overall flavor. For $2.50 a taco, it was a great deal but I would not go out of my way to return.
