We've been here twice since moving to the area. It's just ok. The outside porch area is where all the fun is at. They had a live cover band going on Friday night that was great. Covered all the 80s hair band songs. The beer was not cold. It was disappointing. The food was just ok. Go here for atmosphere, not the menu
