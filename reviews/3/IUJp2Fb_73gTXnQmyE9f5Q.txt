So is this place called Mamita's or Mamacita's?!?! 

When you walk into this dump it's like Vegas and Mexico threw up on each other or something like that, it's very interesting to say the least. 
It's right across the street from El Cortez hotel, so that alone should give you a clue of what kind of place this is going to be lol. 

I noticed this place because I was outside on the curb of El Cortez waiting in line for my Punk Rock Bowling tickets in 90 degrees at 11am, drinking some hot Jack n coke in a plastic cup. My friend and I were debating whether to eat here or the cafe, and ended up here. I think at this point I would eaten anything lol. 

Since I was in Vegas I started off with a strawberry margarita, because well, I really love margaritas. Also, it is completely acceptable to keep drinking all day, even before noon in Vegas, so why the hell not. I then ordered a chicken taco and enchilada combo plate with rice and beans. It was probably not the best Mexican food, but it really hit the spot and plus they gave me a decent amount of sour cream, so I devoured that plate, lol. 

My friend ordered a Cuban sandwich and beer, but they were out of Cuban beer, so fail right there. Also, his sandwich came on some questionable bread, so yea overall fail on the Cuban menu. The bread in the picture looked way better. Overall, my food was pretty good, but my friend's not so good. 

The service was also pretty terrible, they take forever to take your order, get your order, and if you need anything else after your meal finally arrives, forget about it!!!! They weren't even that busy until maybe the end our meal. This place is cheap and convenient though if you happen to be in Downtown Vegas. 

Apparently that Selena live in concert DVD is constantly playing, which is only awesome the first time through.
