I tried Patron's for dinner a few nights ago, out of curiosity. Entrees were very good - I had shrimp fajitas and my husband had carnitas - tasty and large portions. However, I have to agree with some of the other comments that the guacamole was sub-par. I don't think it was a matter of freshness, it was just bland. We also had a pitcher of margaritas that was pretty bad - tasted like limeaide. I don't want to give a bad review because the main courses were great and the staff was super nice, but if you're going to claim to be a Mexican restaurant you've got to get the guacamole and margaritas right! Hopefully it'll improve in these areas - if so, I'd give it another try.
