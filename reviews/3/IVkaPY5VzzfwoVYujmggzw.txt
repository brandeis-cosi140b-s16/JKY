Q-doba is probably not a place you'd make a special trip across town to visit.  But if you're shopping in Matthews, give it a shot. Located in the Sycamore Commons Shopping Center, this place is between Jimmy Johns and Stool Pigeons.

I always get the taco salad.  They fill up a taco shell bowl with ROMAINE lettuce (not that pale substitute...Iceberg, is it?), shower it with spicy ranch, and your choice of fresh salsas.  Its a definitely a meal when you add the toppings.  

The service is normally good.  The young, fresh faces serving you haven't been stripped of all hope in humanity (yet).  The place gets packed at random times.  But its pretty certain that after church on Sundays (hey, this is Bible Belt), they will be a bit rushed.  A little pricy, but definitely worth a few $$$ more than Toxic Bell.
