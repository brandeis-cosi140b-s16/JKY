I love three amigos...Sabor wasn't as good to me. The prices are fantastic, great location and great for a quick lunch. The inside needs a little more sprucing up but, it works for street food. I had the Build Your Own Burrito with chicken, shrimp, rice, shredded cheese and cilantro. Everything was hot and fresh but lacking in flavor. The rice was "Spanish" style with tomatoes, corn, onions and other things. Thanks goodness I had the cilantro in there to add a pop of freshness and flavor. I was expecting a lot more Latin flare. One of my lunch guest had the Sabor burrito and felt the same way. Pretty bland. My other lunch guest had the shredded chicken quesadilla...left much to be desired. When I think "Latin", I feel like my taste buds shouldn't know what hit them!! They have $4-9 Margaritas and .99$ tacos Mon.-Fri. 3-5. Pretty good deal. Just pump up the flavor!!
