I really enjoyed this place!  The food was good... I didn't LOVE the chicken on the Willie salad... some pieces felt a bit rubbery, but everything else on the salad was delicious... their black beans are perfectly spiced, the queso dip is SO tasty with that just broiled crispy crust on top... YUM YUMMY!  I'll be back for a casual meal!  Small tip, please turn down the music a tad... we enjoyed it, but it made conversation difficult!
