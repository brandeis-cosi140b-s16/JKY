The tortillas were great. It's hard to beat Carolina's, but Verde has the closest I've tasted thus far to doing just that. I got the oregano-lime chicken and got to try the green chile. Both were very good. The chicken reminded me of El Pollo Loco (that's not a bad thing). It was fresh and when combined with rice, beans, salsa and a tortilla, my taste buds were very pleased. The green chile was the real winner though. The pork was flaky, tender, and loaded with flavor. I would have preferred more heat in the chile, but it was tasty nonetheless.

From what I keep reading, I need to try breakfast here. The next time I head to Verde it will probably be in the early morning for that.
