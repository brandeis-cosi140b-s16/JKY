Been to the one on Dunlap(ish) and 7th street. And i definitely like that one better. The tortas are both good, it's just they prepare some food a little differently. or it tasted like it.

Obviously i didnt have them side by side (that would be a heart attack waiting to happen), but from memory that's what sprang up.

A little far out of the way for me to go back to.

Good prompt service.
