I been to here a few times when visiting family ...I recently moved out here and been craving some Mexican food...I came by a few days ago and ordered..... My order came out as I expected...... 2 crispy beef tacos rice and beans yummy.....my wife order on the other hand was not that good.....she ordered a carne asada burrito.....first of all our server was nice my wife asked what came in the burrito....server said carne asada cheese & pico de gallo ...... Her burrito arrives and there lettuce in the burrito.....BTW who servers a burrito without rice n beans in it......it tasted like a wrapped cheeseburger.... Even the kids chicken taquitos were not that great.... Prices are a bit to high but depending on what you order food not that great....
