Typical Mexican fast-food fare at a reasonable price, Federico's hits the spot at any time of the day. Open 24 hours, they are there to satisfy your cravings, whether you are looking for a burrito plate, tacos, quesadillas, tortas, or even soup!

On my last visit I decided to try something different and went with their new "El Rey Burrito" - a hefty, fresh flour tortilla packed with carne asada, ham, bacon, guacamole and pico. Yes - there is a lot going there. Actually a little too much. As much as I wanted to enjoy this burrito, I had a hard time getting through it - the salty, yet varied flavors of the three principal ingredients seemingly battling my palate for attention. I lost. Alas, it was more than I wanted. I know that it's not "traditional" (but then again neither is bacon and ham in anything other than a breakfast burrito) but I think I would have enjoyed it more had the filling been blended with the contrasting, more neutral flavors of lettuce, cheese and (dare I say) sour cream. Actually, I think I would have enjoyed a regular carne asada burrito. Yeah, that's probably what I'll do next time.

Because there definitely will be a next time....

Nice fresh salsa bar, but they do charge for chips.
