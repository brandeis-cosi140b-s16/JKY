If you are in Phoenix for a layover on Southwest this is the spot. For airport dining this place is well above on food quality and quick attentive service. It's great for people watching and although much of the food is stylized versions of Mexican food, including a lot of quick prep, reheat and serve kind of food, it's actually pretty tasty. I've had the shrimp tacos and they are pretty tasty, a bit over battered but good just the same. The fish taco plate is actually pretty decent size portion (4 tacos) for the money.
Considering you are trapped for food choices the prices aren't too out of whack.
The only major downside, and it is out of their control, is the volume of a/c being pumped into the terminal creates cold/windy spots in the dining room.
