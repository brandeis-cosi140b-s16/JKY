Other than this Chipotle, I usually go to the Maryland Pkwy location in front of UNLV. I give this place 3 stars because of the service and the amount of food they give you lol. Chipotle is such a great place that has the fast food vibe, but gives a new spin on a fresh, fast food establishment. By all means I am not a piggy and don't expect large portion meals when I go out, but every time I have gone to this place, they give you half a spoonful of meat and you are digging through your burrito or burrito bowl to only find a lousy few cubes of steak T__T For a growing and popular fast food chain which is owned by McDonalds, the employees there should ration the toppings out better : )
