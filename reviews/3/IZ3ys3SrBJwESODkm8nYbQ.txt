Service gets 5 stars, but food has always been just barely above average.  Fajitas should come out hot but never do.  Chips and salsa are good once you ask for pico de gallo and chipotle salsa to add to the regular red.  The outdoor porch, overlooking the pond, is really nice, especially when there is live music.  Most weekend nights have some sort of entertainment.  Good drink specials, and plenty of margarita flavors (top shelf margaritas for $6).  While it's not the best Mexican I've ever had, it's convenient, got a nice atmosphere, and the food is consistent.  I have been here many times and will continue to go back, despite my lackluster rating.
