A fitting embodiment of It Is What It Is.

I've been twice, in 1991 and again in 2005. From what I can remember, it hadn't changed at all between then. Smoky in the bar area, though another review tells me that's old news now. I wasn't 21 for either of those visits, but I can imagine sitting at the bar for a couple of hours around lunch would give me the full experience were I to do it now.

Food-wise, nothing spectacular with the enchiladas I ordered the last time. But the beauty of El Charro is that it doesn't advertise itself as the best of the best, just a fixture at that location and a reputable spot to grab a drink or some acceptable Mexican food if you're in the area. I'm sure if I find myself near that part of town again some afternoon I'll stop in again.
