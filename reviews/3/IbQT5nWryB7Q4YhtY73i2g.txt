I don't think I've ever been here during daylight. Or even before 10pm. I'm thankful they are open 24 hours, as very few places close to home are (I think McDonald's is - on weekends). Greasy, completely bad for you, huge portion, cheap, but always tasty Mexican food. Decent end to curb any late night cravings on the way home from a night out!
