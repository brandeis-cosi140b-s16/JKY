I got the chimi, not bad, nice that it comes with sour cream and guacamole. Unbelievably, some Mexican restaurants here don't give you that. Sylvia is very nice waitress. Although, she isn't mine, she helping my waitress., who I haven't even gotten her name yet.pretty good iced tea and I love iced tea! Salsa is good. I like Garcia's salsa better, but still this one not bad at all. Ok, my waitress is Fabiola. She's not real smiley, but doing an efficient job.  I'm here at 12:51pm and overall it has been a pleasant experience.
