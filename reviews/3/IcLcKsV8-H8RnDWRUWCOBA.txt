The most common complaint that I see when it comes to a Mariscos restaurant is the noise.  Which I have no issue with because I enjoy some good Mexican music.  

As far as the food, it is pretty good and the seafood always taste fresh.  I usually get the coctel "Kora" which is their signature Mexican cocktail, has pretty much all the seafood you can think of!  Will definitely be back soon!
