Life is an adventure and I suspect I am now learning something new about Mexican food.  This is now the second restaurant in Madison that I have checked out because I am told, "they serve real Mexican food".   I am seeing a similarity in the food I am receiving and think that maybe I don't know Mexican food at all.  Because this stuff is different and I don't know if I really like it or not.  Just my honest opinion.   
 I stopped by here based upon the 4 and 5 star reviews here at yelp and also because I had thought about stopping by this place.  
It is really in a location that you would not expect there to be a restaurant.  
There is plenty of seating and could seat probably 25-30 people.
I ordered the chimichanga and received a lot for 5.99.  It was close to twice what I expected.   The chimichanga was good, hot and fried lightly and nice.  But the chicken was a little on the dry side but not bad.  The beans were soupy, the rice was good, the sauces were not as hot as I would like and thinner than I'm used to.  But they had a good flavor.  The sour cream was runny and should be thicker.
I plan to go back and try something else to try to get a better handle on what they serve here.
Pretty cheap and they play Mexican music in the background which is always nice.
