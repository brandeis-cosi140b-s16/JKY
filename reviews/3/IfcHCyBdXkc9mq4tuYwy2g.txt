Love chipotle but this location isn't my favorite. I ordered online and went to go pick it up, the cashier was confused on the process and the attendant next to her just grabs the paperbag that apparently was my order and just plops it in front of me. I'm standing there still because I also ordered a drink and chips and it wasn't in the bag, I stood waiting because the cashier was still trying to figure out the process, tells the attendant to grab my order and with an attitude she responds " I did it's right in front of him", and I let them know that I ordered chips and drink and it's not in the bag and the attendant rolls her eyes and grabs it. The chips were stale and my guacamole had huge chunks of avocado so it wasn't completely mashed up. They need to evaluate their team here, but still the food was up to chipotle standard.
