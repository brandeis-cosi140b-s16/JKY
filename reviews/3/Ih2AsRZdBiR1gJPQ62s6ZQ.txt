I stumbled across this joint one day while looking for something different to eat on my  lunch break.  The service is mediocre, the prices steep, but the food is good. The service has not been bad but the staff seem dull and unexcited, not that i can blame them. My last trip here i feel like they took their sweet time assisting customers, though. I think the prices are a little steep but you do get a lot of food.  I have only ever ordered the salad but it feeds me twice. I like their salad because you still get everything a burrito offers minus the tortilla. I dont come here a lot because of the price but when i do the food is always good.
