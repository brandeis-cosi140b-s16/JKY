I like this place. I am in this area about once a week and decided to stop in here instead of Del across the street. 
Jorge (an owner) was super friendly and made a point to introduce himself to me and ask about my work. 
I ordered the black bean and cheese burrito. I love that they have black beans as an option. It took a few minuets to get my food, but you can watch them make it from scratch. They were also making handmade taquitos while I was there. 
They were out of iced tea, Jorge promptly replaced it...although it was some of the most watered down iced tea I have ever had. 
The burrito was really good and it came with fresh chips. 
I will be back when I am in that part of town for work. It is definitely the best option for the immediate area.
