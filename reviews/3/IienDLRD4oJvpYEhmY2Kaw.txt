This place looks like Chipotle, but they've got a few other options like fish tacos and nachos. I got the bowl with shredded beef which was alright. The red salsa, I probably asked for four scoops thinking it'd be like chipotle. But it is actually  3x spicier. Yeah, I'm sweating from my nose right now thinking and talking about it because I was in for a surprise when I took a bite of my burrito bowl. So, that's an FYI for ya if you like spicy red sauce. 

The fish taco was oh Kay. The fried codfish was awesome, but the sauces in the taco were just average, and I especially wasn't fond of the tortilla. It's bought apparently, and you can tell.

Service was good, restaurant is clean. I was passing by and starving so I gave it a shot. 

I'd give a solid 2.5 stars for this place. Would I come back? I guess I'd rather go to a hole-in-the wall or taco truck. $3.45 for a taco is quite pricey when it tastes just OK. The question comes down to chipotle or this place, as that would be a fair comparison. 

I think the shredded beef was delicious and possibly tastier. The portion was a bit smaller, and price is competitive. I'm kinda sold on chipotle's red sauce, so that might tip me over a tad bit. But if you're looking for some quick fish tacos in the area, I'd give this place a shot.
