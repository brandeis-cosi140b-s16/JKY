I come in all the time. I love the salad, taquitos, nachos and the burritios is great.The shrimp tacos were horrible, soggy gross mess, don't waste your money on them.  I like that I can choose what I get in my dishes. They are a bit more expensive compared to other mexican restaurants that are near by. My biggest issue is the staff. They act as if you are bothering them. Out of about 20 visits, only 2 did I feel welcome and get a smile. They act as robots just going down the line of ingrediants. The day shift girls are so much nicer than the night. I try so hard to engage them hoping for a different experience but no luck. They do seem empty compared to the other busy restaurants that are right there. Would love to walk in and have someone say...."Hi, Welcome, How can I help you". Tries to order a Churro for dessert, they don't make them anymore.. Sad, a mexican restaurant without Churros.....WHAT!!!! They need to have more than just one size of drink.
