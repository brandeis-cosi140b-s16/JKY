This place is not bad. We went for date night. The food was good. Not great but definitely not bad. Seasoning was spot on. Plenty of options. Wish their happy hr extended to food items. Although prices are not too bad. Plenty of food per serving. I had the salad with the pork, and my husband tried two tacos. One pork one ground beef on hard shell. We went with my sister ava get husband who had 3 tacos and the mahi mahi. I tried the sangria which was very good. The margarita (house) however was blah...to much margarita mix...The server was slightly rude not really helpful. We asked that instead of having to get up every time she brought a chip refill if she would also bring the salsa that comes with it as well. She said no and that we could refill it ourselves. She could have been more customer oriented. That's a big thing for me is customer service ave she definitely failed. However,  The regular house salsa and pico de gallo were the best things on the salsa bar. Loved that we could grab radishes and cabbage for the tacos. I would go back to take advantage of happy hour and maybe have a snack.
