Tried this place last night based on the reviews...

The atmosphere is charming and feels like you are on vacation somewhere in mexico...nice getaway for 2 hours

For drinks I tried the fresh watermelon, cantelope, and pinapple all were good, especially the watermelon.

For appetizer I was hopeing for fresh chips and salsa...but they didn't have it so they gave us tostada chips with guacomole, red sauce, green sauce, and pico.  This was fantastic.

I ordered queso with mushrooms and peppers...this was just sauteed with melted chedder cheeze...not what I had in mind based on the guac.

She ordered cheese enchiladas with green sauce...she said it was good.

I ordered the lamb, it was okay but the meat had a funny smell to it that kinda threw me off.  The rice was weird with frozen veggies in it.

Overall the service is attentive and friendly.

The downside is the price and the non typical mexican menu items.
