Went here with friends tonight after trying to find it in Google search. I found 3 addresses. Very  confusing. It is located at 3515 W Northern if you want the correct address. The food was yummy and HOT! Not luke warm like many other places, but oven hot. LOVE IT! Had the cheese Enchiladas and the mini chimi appatizer, both wonderful. Great place, delish food. Will be back (Now that I can find it)
