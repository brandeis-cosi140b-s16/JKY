Sometimes it depends on what you order.

I have been to Don Jose on more then a few occasions and the quality of the food sometimes depends on what you decide to order.

However, I want to start this review off on a positive note.  The staff at Don Jose is very accommodating and friendly.  You will never have to ask for a refill on your beverage because the servers at Don Jose make sure your drinks and chip bowls are always full.

Today, my lunch companion and I ordered a pork chimichanga and red beef burrito enchilada style.  I have to be honest the food wasn't very good today.  The pork chimichanga was slightly over cooked the and the pork was on the dry side. The red beef burrito was a little on the fatty side, however, the red sauce was tasty.

The service is good, the prices are reasonable, however the food is hit or miss.
