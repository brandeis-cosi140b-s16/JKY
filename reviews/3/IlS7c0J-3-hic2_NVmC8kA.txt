One of the gals I work with had a horrible experience with the employees here when they first opened, so I was immediately turned off.  I, however, still wanted to try it out because it's near home and I love hot dogs.  I figured I'd wait a while for the bugs and bad employees to be worked out, as all new restaurants need, before I made my visit.  A Groupon became available so I used that opportunity to try out their food at half price and would be easier to look past any bad customer service that I may encounter.  
The woman working there was very friendly and helpful, so good for them they seemed to have fixed the customer service issues.
I got a hot dog and selected my own toppings rather than choosing one of their topping styles on the menu.  I also ordered onion rings and a fountain drink.  My Groupon was for $10 and I used all but a few cents of it.  I didn't think twice about it since I've been known to drop 8 bucks on a dog at the ballpark, until I got home to eat and realized the dog was smaller than the ones offered by Circle K.  Yikes! 9 dollars for a Little Slugger with cheese and bacon on it??  The onion rings were very delicious.  Worth $5?  Negative.  
The food was good, but overpriced for the amount received.  If the dog was Dback dog sized and I received the same amount of rings as one would at a restaurant as an appetizer, then I think the $10 would be a fair price for the food.  It's been 2 months since my visit and I have yet to return although I have been in that shopping center countless times.  Hopefully the other items are larger than the hot dog.  I'm sure one of these days I'll try again because the food, although small, was tasty.
