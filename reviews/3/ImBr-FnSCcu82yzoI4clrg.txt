staff was nice and friendly and organized. restaurant was fairly clean. a couple of messy spots but nothing out of the ordinary in a fast food place at lunch time but the men's bathroom was kind of destroyed. food was quick, hot but the fries could have been a little more fresh and the turkey tacos were tasteful.
