I'm up on Peoria Avenue this week for training, so I'm trying to go to a new place every day for lunch.  Mi pueblo was meh.  I ordered my food at 12:05 and it was in front of me at 12:10 which was impressive.  What was NOT impressive was the lack of carne asada in the burrito itself.  It had beans, and peppers, and onions, but VERY little steak.  The chips and salsa were ok, but with a drink I spent $11 and just didn't feel I got my $ worth.  My buddy got the fish tacos, and that seemed to be a better value - but I'm not in a hurry to go back.  Lociento mi pueblo.
