This place is...absolutely average with prices higher than average.  Honestly, I would not return here unless it was so close to the Galaxy Luxury+ Theater.  But, since it is right next door, I do manage to go here every five or six weeks.  So, just be prepared for some extremely average food and what seems like an extra $10-$15 on the bill.  Obviously I don't hate eating here, but it always feels like a compromise when I do.
