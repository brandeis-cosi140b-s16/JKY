overall a good place to eat. i just wonder why they would put hot tortilla chips, in a Styrofoam container? its melts on the chips, hey try a paper bag. i get the carna burrito, which is pretty good, and filling, the dollar tacos are gross, too much grease for me. if your hungry and don't expect too much , you'll like this place.
