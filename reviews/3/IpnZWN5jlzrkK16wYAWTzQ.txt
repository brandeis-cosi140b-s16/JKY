Tried this while on a weekend with my wife in Phoenix with friends that moved there a couple of years ago.   

Margueritas were awesome.   

Food was definitely very good, I had the enchiladas with the black mole'.  I ordered the red... but oh well, the black was over the top, I was happy with the mistake.   I agree with Lulu M... my wife (Latina Princess) is a fantastic cook and we usually eat Mexican dishes at home, but the mole, even from my tuned pallet, was very good. 

Here are my gripes:

1.) The neighborhood.  It's pretty bad for the price they charge.   Barrio Cafe suits the name perfectly.   I felt like the rental car might not have the rims on it when we came out. 

2.) Parking really sucks.   For what they charge, knock down one of the crappy businesses next door and turn it into some parking space. 

3.) It's pretty pricey for Mexican food.  5 of us, drinks not included = $160 with tip.   I stress.. .drinks were on a separate check and there weren't any desserts in that.   $33+ a head for beans, rice, tortillas and a little bit of chicken is a serious price point for the cheap-rent district. 


If it was more like $15-$17 a plate, easily 5 stars.   My ding is for the price for the neighborhood & type of food. 

Avoid taking the kiddies there.. it's very tight seating, a very small place, and very pricey.  Also seemed kind of "hot & bothered & busy" in there.
