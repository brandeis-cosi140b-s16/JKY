My friend lives nearby and really likes this joint. It is very convenient! We don't have drive-through Mexican food in Hawaii...lol. Anyways, I had combo plate of 3 tacos with rice (no beans for me!) I didn't pay attention to the "rolled" before the tacos and was confused as to why I had taquitos. lol. But my husband assured me that they had given me the right thing. 

It was tasty, nonetheless. Their guacamole tasted a little odd to me, and they plopped on a huuuuuge pool of it onto the tacos, so it overwhelmed the plate a little bit.
