Great service!  We had a sampler plate but did not try the green chile.  After reading Alex's review, I'll have to give the green chile a try before I can give Sylvia's another star.

We waved a server down to tell her that guacamole was missing from our plate and she quickly came back with a big bowl of it.  I left my designer sunglasses there one Sunday and they held on to it until I returned the next Wed.
