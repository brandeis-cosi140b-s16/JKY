Ok here is a shocker... I went to chipotle for the first time when I was recently in Arizona... talk about unexpected. But it was free and ummm yeah it was this or some other disgusting fast burger/taco joint...

Why are there no good taquerias in the greater Phoenix Metropolitan area? WTH! I would riot over that if I lived out there. Thankfully I do not...

So yeah back to chip-oat-lay. This place is the subway of burrito places. I doubt the tacos are worth it since they are small and the same price with much less food as the burritos I think... 

Pro Tip: Ask for stuff on the side, you often get a lil bit more if you do!

But back to the burrito... I got a barbacoa meat burrito. Not sure what kinda meat barbacoa is, but it was aight i suppose. It coulda been cat meat for all I know. 

This joint is absolutely overboard with regards to carbs and thick hunnies wanting to eat here. I think I was the skinniest person there and I dont think I am skinny. The build it up burrito/taco concept is solid and better than some other joints that I have been to. 

I consider the food fair, but nothing special. Just lots of carbs n meat in a burrito bun =P So yeah, not sure of a reason to go back unless everyone I am with must go here, but otherwise, its all good!
