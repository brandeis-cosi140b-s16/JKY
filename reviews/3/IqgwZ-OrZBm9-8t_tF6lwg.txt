I've been here twice now - the first time was during opening week so I wanted to give it another chance before reviewing.  The service has certainly improved, and i LOVE the apps (stuffed jalapenos, queso, etc.), but I have yet to be impressed by the drinks.  

The margarita menu is awesome (from the looks and details) - but I've now had a few different ones made by different bartenders - and the verdict is the same...
I have no problem paying top dollar for a great marg with good tequila, but if I keep returning and continue paying top dollar, I don't want a watered down, plain, weak drink :-/

Might try it again for the apps - or ask for a shot of tequila and assemble my own marg?  Idk...too bad because the ambiance and location are great.  

This place has potential.
