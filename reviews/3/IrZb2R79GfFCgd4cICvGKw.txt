Cash only, but there's an ATM.  Dirt cheap.  Just the basics here...tacos, burros, enchiladas, etc.  This is old school atmosphere here, too.  And by old school, I don't mean 2002.  Very bare bones.  In fact, I'm pretty sure I had been in the building before as a little kid in the early 70's.  I know, I look a lot younger don't I?  I felt like it was once the International House of Pancakes, before "IHOP."  Maybe a long-time Phoenician could tell me if I'm crazy.

Anyway, on to the food.  I think Don Jose's is one of those places that if you have a history with it, you love it.  For everyone else, it's just okay.  I had a taco, green corn tamale, and enchilada.  The taco and enchilada were pretty good, but the cheese inside the tamale was too stringy.  And not stringy in a good way because it's hot and melty.  Stringy in a bad way like maybe it was microwaved and then cooled off.  They do things the hard way and serve soft drinks in small cups, but I will say they were never empty.  The wait staff was all over that.  

But their cheese crisp is 10 stars!  Just the right balance of crispiness, yet still foldable.  And their hot sauce was pretty good, too!  I'm sure I will be back for that!
