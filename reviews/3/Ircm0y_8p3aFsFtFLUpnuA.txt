Very good Mexican food with some American options.  Service was good, food was delicious...nice, fresh and hot.  Bathrooms had a lot to be desired, they were a mess, but then we were there during Glendale Glitters so that may have been the reason, although they were limited to customer use only.  When the place is full, they really should clean up the bathrooms more often.
