Well, this was my first time in Vegas.   After having many drinks in our suite, my friend and I stumbled down the strip, and this was essentially the closest, not busy, place near our hotel at 10pm

We love Mexican so thought, why the hell not?  

Service was alright, but it wasn't really busy.   We both had a Pacifico and entree and it was reasonably priced considering everyone I talked to said Vegas was wayyy overpriced. 

I had a steak burrito and although the steak was overcooked it was doused in enough sauce to make it enjoyable. 

The location is pretty cool, and we got to people watch from our table - a Vegas must do.
