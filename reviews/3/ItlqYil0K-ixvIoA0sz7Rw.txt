Big portions for modest prices. I usually get it to go. Think of it as a better Taco Bell and you'll dig this place.

Fajitas dinner combo had 8 tortillas and a very generous helping of rice and beans, easy to split between multiple meals.

Half of their huge burritos could easily compare to a modest chipotle burrito.
