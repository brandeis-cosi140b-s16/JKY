I had lunch there on Monday afternoon and my overall impression was "eh, ok." It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't good. I ordered the two combo platter with a bean tostado and a chicken taco with rice for my side. My boyfriend ordered a bean and cheese chimichanga. Nothing was spectacular, nothing stood out, everything could have benefited from the addition of salt and fresh herbs. I didn't have anything there that I couldn't make better myself and that's why I enjoy going out to eat - to have food I don't have at home. I had enough iceberg lettuce on my plate to make a salad. There was hardly any chicken. I would sum it up as "bland".
