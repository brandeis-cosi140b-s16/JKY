Had lunch there yesterday very disappointed in the crisp meat taco 1st off  the shell was ice cold  meat inside was just luke warm .Has a few shredded pieces of cheese and I mean a few  and there was just a little lettuce .Not  very appetizering  .I like my tacos filled lot of cheese and lettuce plus the tortillas shell at least warm .
On the positive side they have a nice selection of salsa,s  all kind plus sour cream.My  husband had the tongue  was very soft and easy to eat he enjoyed that .
