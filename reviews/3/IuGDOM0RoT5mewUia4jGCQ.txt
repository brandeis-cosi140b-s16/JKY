The food was good - nothing extra special.  I like that you get guacamole with your meal and that they have lingua on the menu.  I will have to go back and try it.  

The things I did not like were they sat our group of 10 right by the server station.  It's awkward to overhear their conversations.  

The service seemed a bit lackluster.  It was almost as if they were not intrested in a big group coming in.  Our server was pretty good, but not overly friendly.  I will definately try this place again and update.
