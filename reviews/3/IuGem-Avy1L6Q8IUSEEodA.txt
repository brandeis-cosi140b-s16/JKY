Service was really slow, if menudo is all they serve then the wait shouldn't be so long.. As for the menudo itself it's just ok.. Growing up with a father who made menudo , this wasn't even close. The chili was a bit watered down and it lacked flavor. I ordered extra hominy since I'm not real crazy about tripe  , my dad use to use the large hominy and always added extra for me. This hominy was on the smaller side and it was ok.. We live WAY across town and came to this place on a friend's recommendation . We probably won't be back.. Boy do i miss my dads menudo !!
