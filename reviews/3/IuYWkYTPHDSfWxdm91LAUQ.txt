Ordered up al pastor fries and the chile relleno plate. The al pastor fries were good! I would give it a 4/5. The chile relleno, however, was not to my liking. the chile was too firm in my opinion. I am a fan of soft chile relleno. This chile was so firm that I had quite the difficulty cutting it with the plastic fork and knife. I will definitely try this place again I think, maybe explore the menu a bit more.
