Yelp 100 Challenge * 56/100

My girlfriend(s) and I like to come here for lunch during our break from Art Class on Fridays. 

Quality of their food fluctuates depending on who makes it. My friend prefers to not have onion on her veggie burrito (our usual order) yet sometimes, the staff unconsciously adds some in anyway. We've had oily burritos, some with too much cilantro (*cringe*), some with too little taste, some stuffed with fistfulls of cheese. Churros are occasionally coated in so much sugar that we'd have to scrape them off in the trash.

Only uppity to Maria's are their 'free refill fridays' where we take advantage of the opportunity and get ourselves a couple servings of thirst quenching horchatas. Watch out once again with who prepares your food because the horchata quality can range from super bland to too much cinammon. 

We've still got about 4 weeks to go before the semester ends. Guess that'll be how much longer we'll be checking Maria's out, unless we get another friday class in fall.
