For Madison, this is relatively decent Mexican food.  For Madison.

My husband and I have been there twice now, once for dinner and once for the weekend brunch.  When we were there for dinner, I really enjoyed my cochinita pibil (slow-roasted pork), but my husband was very unimpressed with his dish ("something with chicken" is all he recalls).  We also had an appetizer that was basically shrimp tostadas, but was so heavily saturated with lime juice that it basically just tasted like limes.  The margaritas were pretty standard, though appreciated (iirc, it had been a trying day for me).

When we went for brunch, I was very unimpressed with the huevos a la mexicana, but my husband's huevos en salsa verde (which I had also considered), were pretty good.  The pomegranate margarita was also quite tasty and not too sweet.

Overall, they just seem kind of hit or miss--and their misses aren't HORRIBLE, but their hits aren't really that impressive, either.  We might end up there again just because it's close and reasonably priced, but it's not somewhere I get excited about.
