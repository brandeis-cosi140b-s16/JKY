This looks like a cool place but it appears they're trying too hard. There is a lot of space to fill but I think it needs to be smaller - fewer tables and a smaller patio. We tried the guac and thought it was bland but the portion size was generous. We paid 13.52 b/f tip for guac, chips, and two ice teas. If the guac had been better, we would have proceeded to dinner.  If they can't put a great app like that on the table, not going to throw more $$ at dinner. The bar tender was attentive and accommodating which was a plus.
