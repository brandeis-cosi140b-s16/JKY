Very busy during lunch and dinner rushes, with lines that stretch out the door. 

I've been to Chipotles where the servings are nice and ample, where the servers frequently pile on two scoops of tender meat into a burrito stuffed with calorically-dense goodness. This is not one of those Chipotles. I expect that the hiring process includes harvesting new employee souls and grinding into their tortilla mix. The employees here have never smiled.
