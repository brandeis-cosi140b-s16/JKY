After reading the other Yelp reviews I had hopeful expectations to find a diamond in the rough. Unfortunately I was let down as the food was good, but not as great as Yelp advertised. 

We had the table made Guacamole to start off the meal and found the flavor had a strange after-taste. I believe they added the heat with a touch of Tabasco sauce an dnot the traditional pepper flavor. 

For dinner we had the Pescado Tacos which were good, but a bit on the sweet side. We also ordered the Chicken Pablano which was better and a very generous serving. 

Overall the food was good, but not great - and the bill for our dinner ran $50 with tip.
