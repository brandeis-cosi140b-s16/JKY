Did not know what to expect in a restaurant in the middle of nowhere. The sign said to wait to be seated but there was no host to be found. We then just sat at the bar with real saddles for seats which I thought was pretty cool. 

Had the Wisconsin Cheddar Soup and the Killer Chili Dawg for a light lunch while hubby gets a burger. The food was good and quantity quite filling. 

If you came to this little place called Tortilla Flat to be charmed, don't get your hopes up. Service here was fair. We were served fast and staff was friendly enough but charmless. 

"You liked it? Good. Here (the check)!" LMAO
