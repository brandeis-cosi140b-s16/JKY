Bradduh's is basically a Hawaiian style chipotle. I really enjoyed my first visit here. I was greeted immediately as I entered. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. When asked if it was my first time I was offered samples of the meats. I had a killua pork bowl. Although it was a tad salty on it's own (when sampled) it was perfect combined with everything in the bowl. If you're looking for traditional Hawaiian food then this isn't quite the place to go. If you're looking for a good, fun fusion then this place is worth a try. I'll be back.
