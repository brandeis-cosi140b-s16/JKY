Decent Mexican food at really reasonable prices. In my opinion the food is pretty mediocre when it comes to Mexican in Madison, better than (but more expensive than) Francisco's on the square but worse than(and cheaper than) Abuelo's in Middleton. I had the white chicken chile with quesadilla gill cheese (gluten free!), it was ok but I probably could have made the same if not better at home. The location at Hilldale mall is nice but if you are looking for great Mexican food in Madison look elsewhere.
