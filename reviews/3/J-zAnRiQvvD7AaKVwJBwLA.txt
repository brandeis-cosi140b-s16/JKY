We, too, had a coupon so we decided to give El Valle a try.  The outside look of the restaurant isn't anything to speak of, but the inside provides a nicer atmosphere.  The decor is more of a mix between an 80's restaurant and a Mexican restaurant, but it was better than a lot of restaurants do.  The booths are pretty private so you don't feel like you're dining with a large party.  

The chips and salsa they bring you to start were good.  They weren't anything out of the ordinary, but still good.  

We both ordered the chile poblanos and each received two HUGE poblano chiles stuffed with cheese.  They were very tasty.  The accompanying Mexican rice was bland (although the salsa I added on top helped) and the refried beans were a bit "lardy" tasting.  

I can't say I'd go there often or out of my way for the food, but for the amount of food we got, the prices were great and there was no wait on a Saturday night.
