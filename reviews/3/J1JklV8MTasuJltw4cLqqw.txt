Decent Cali-Mexi cuisine at reasonable prices. Don't come here expecting large plates, the servings are smallish. We've been a few times because a friend loves their bar-b-que tofu, and both their vegan(ish) burrito (the Green Burrito, if I remember correctly) and the Taco Salad with tofu were satisfying. Not outstanding, but consistent, with decent service.
