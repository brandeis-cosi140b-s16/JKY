Family and I use the Silverton Casino / Bass Pro Shop as our pit stop, when we travel to Utah.  It's convenient, easy to find and parking has never been an issue.  We were looking for an easy lunch, in a low-key, kid friendly restaurant.  

Found this inside the Silverton, as we were making our way from the parking structure to the Bass Pro Shop.  It wasn't crowded, and looked like it could be a good place to sit down for a quick lunch.

I ordered the Chile Verde for myself, husband order tacos and we ordered a kids quesadilla for the little guy.  The wait staff was very accommodating when we asked for a booth, instead of the table in the middle of the restaurant.  Our waiter was attentive and service was quick.

My chile verde was okay, arrived hot with tortillas - some of the pork was cooked very well, while some were a bit overcooked and dry.  Overall, it did the job and I enjoyed it enough to finish the meal.  The tacos were good, typical street style tacos - husband enjoyed it enough to not share it.  

Portions were big, service was friendly and seating was plenty.  Chips & salsa were good.  Only (small) bummer was that it was located in the casino - smelled a little bit like smoke (but, I have been to smokier places) and you can still hear the slot machines in the background.  With that said, we totally expected it and it didn't dampen our meal.  

We would definitely go back again, but would stick to simpler meal choices (like tacos, quesadillas, etc.).
