This place is a notch above most local chain Mexican joints- Better than El Torito, Macayos, Manuels, Gardunoas, and Garcias. Its a colorful place, reasonably priced, good atmosphere, and easy to park. I used to eat at Julio's To Go up on Camelback when I worked in the area, way better than fast food Mexican a la Baja Fresh or Chipotle. Its pretty good, better than average. I like this place.
