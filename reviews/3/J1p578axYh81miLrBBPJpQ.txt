I'm basing my reviews on my personal preference for Mexican Food-Yes, I'm one of those people who want rice and beans. Sue me.

This is really lovely ambiance-we took some friends who were visiting from Tucson.
I honestly hadn't looked up a menu, we went based on yelp reviews.
It was jam packed crowded-I loved, LOVED the live band. It was fantastic!!!
Our server was neither friendly nor rude, just felt rushed.
The prices seemed inflated to me, but the food had lovely presentation.
I had the fish in the banana leaf which was very good, and the guacamole was tasty, with the bits of fruit in it. Very unique.
My husband really loved it, so I'm sure we'll go back at some point, but it's really not my cup of tea.
