Happy 25 year anniversary, Ajo Al's!

Yes, it's a local chain with four Valley locations, and this is one of the two locations I've actually been to... but it's family owned and operated and still going strong after 25 years.  There's something to be said for that!

It's not at the top of my list, but I've never been disappointed by Ajo Al's.  I go maybe once or twice a year for lunch or dinner.  When I recently had a craving for Mexican food, I suggested this place to my friends and they gladly met me here.  

Our waiter was attentive, the atmosphere is fine, the chips and salsa are addicting, and the food is A-OK.  Portions are large.  I had a burrito (enchilada style per the waiter's suggestion) and a salad and took half of my meal home.  My friends went with a burrito and a quesadilla respectively.  None of us oohed or aaahed over the food, but we ate it and it was fine.  Prices are moderate.  Oh, and my leftovers were just as good the next day for lunch!

One weird thing: on their menu, they list several items with guacamole but it's funny... every time that guacamole is listed they put "(meatless)" by it.  Has anyone ever had guacamole that is not meatless?  I found that really awkward!

Anyways, if you're in the mood for traditional Mexican food, you can't go wrong with Ajo Al's.  I'm sure I'll end up there again in another six months or so!
