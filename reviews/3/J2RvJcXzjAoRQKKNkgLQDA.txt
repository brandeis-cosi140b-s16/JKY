I. Would have given Cabot 4 stars, but the 1st time we went for the 48oz margaritas for $10.00 they were closed
Last night we went for dinner. They still serve 48oz margaritas for $10.00
The food was very good, the service was friendly, knowledgable and fast.
Overall a fun dinner experience. The prices were very reasonable and recommend going
