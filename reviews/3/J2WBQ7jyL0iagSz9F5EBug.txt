First Impressions: Slow service, and seemingly inattentive waiting staff, always busy (in that "will they remember I am sitting here?" kinda way).  The patio is nice to sit at, but that isn't enough to keep me coming back. Maybe I would be more patient on another day, but today I had my five and six year old sons in tow. Don't the wait staff know what a chore it is to keep children seated and entertained while hungry?  There is a special place in hell for restaurateurs that make parents endure this trauma...

As I waited for food. I was getting more and more pissed, and I broke out my mobile yelp to draft a scathing review. BUT, then my food came out.  And damned if I wasn't pleasantly surprised.  All the ingredients were super fresh and cooked to perfection (no wilted veggies or overcooked/dry chicken here).  I've been here a few times and never remember being to so impressed.  Not that they were bad before, just not real memorable.  But this meal was _much_ better than the previous occasions. Did they get new kitchen staff? Are my taste buds off today? Or have I just been ordering the wrong entrees all along? Whatever the case--my food today was delicious (I ordered the chicken enchiladas BTW).  

SO... I have mixed feelings about this place.  Service did pick up during the end of the night, but at first it was abysmal.  Food was delicious, but previous visits didn't impress.  Drinks were passable.  Chips and salsa, also passable but not great.   Ambiance, very nice.  

Overall, I think I will be back.  Maybe it was an off day for service, or maybe it was an exceptional day for the cook.  Who knows.  But they've earned another try.
