I'm guessing we're not the demographic for this restaurant. It's super loud -- thanks mostly to the music- even though it's a Sunday afternoon. The number of times someone in my party has had to say "what?"is astronomical.

The chips/salsa is tasty but the houses margaritas are incredibly weak/watered down. The staff has been very nice, but that's not enough to get us to stay. After drinks/appetizers, we're heading somewhere else for dinner. 

I'm sure the usual crowd on Mill St enjoys this locale but it's not for me.
