BBQ Mahi tacos are the best (when served hot). Service is always great. I have visited Cabo a handful of times and about half of the time my food has come out luke-warm or cold. This usually occurred during their busiest hours. I got tacos to go late one night and they were the best I have had out of Cabo. I guess the secret is to go during off-peak hours.
