I only gave it 3 stars cause I am sad that Cravings or Gecko Grill is now gone from this location.  But I am happy it was replaced with another great restaurant I love.   Already been here multiple times but have to give Filbertos some love for purchasing such a nice location.  I always get the Arizona Burrito and then a side order of Three rolled tacos...and yes its alot of food but I will pound it like nothing.  The Arizona Burrito is my absolute fave but occasionally you'll find me ordering the Carne asada burrito.  Anyway great location, very clean restaurant, and as always great food!  Really wish they had a drive through though.
