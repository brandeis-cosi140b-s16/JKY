I have been here twice within the last 8 years. The most recent time my friend wanted to go here so bad, and I couldnt remember whether it was good or not which obviously it didnt make a big impression on me. While driving, I noticed that we passed a lot of little hole in the wall joints I wanted to try. Nevertheless, my friend was stern on going here. 

So we walk up and both place out orders. He orders a bean and cheese, and carne asada nachos, and I ordered the 5 taquitos (or rolled tacos as the menus says). My friend is a die hard Albertos fan, so once we came back here I realized that this place is pretty much that except a tad bit better.

I had one taquito and they hit the trash, wasnt feeling it at all. I actually started to feel bad for the hungry kids of america. So then I started on the nachos which we shared, and  they turned out to be really good. The aroma of the surrounding area smelled disgusting.

This is one of those places you go to after a night of drinking, I wouldnt recommend going in the daytime if you are hungry and want some really good food. When your drunk, this place is probably equivalent to Red Lobster or Claim Jumper.
