Late night tacos were almost as good as happy Hour prices. Make sure you request the free chips and salsa because the waitress does not suggest or offer them. The grilled chicken taco is more of an american version with guacamole, while chicken Tinga has that red semi-spicy stuff cooked into the chicken. The potato and green chili taco I tried was nothing special and the green salsa was off it's game on this visit. Still a good atmosphere, but stick to the basic tacos. Also, the side of rice I ordered was very mushy and overcooked - somebody needs to try the food in the back before it rolls out.  Taco Tuesday might be the ticket, but they should offer a choice of meat on that day, not just beef.
