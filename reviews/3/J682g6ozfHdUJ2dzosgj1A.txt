I wasn't sure whether to give this place a 3 or a 4, but went with the 4 because there weren't any negatives strong enough to offset the positives.  I had the chile relleno plate, and the chiles rellenos themselves are worthy of a full 5--the batter was light, the chiles were pasillas (not ortegas), the pico de gallo on top was beautifully fresh.    What brings the food rating down a bit are the salsa roja, which was quite bland, and the beans (I didn't bother--seldom do--to try the rice) which were also bland and garnished with shreds of mild cheddar cheese instead of tangier grated cotija cheese.  The order came with 4 thick, griddle-browned corn tortillas, which could only have been improved had they been hand-formed and made fresh less than an hour ago.  For machine-made tortillas, they were excellent.  For those of you who are extremely hungry and close to broke, you will appreciate the huge portions and low prices.  The atmosphere and decor are nonesistent; there are a few tables outside, pigeons roaming in search of crumbs and the traffic on Tropicana rushing by.  Felipitos is open 24 hours.

Reduce the rating to a 3 based on my most recent meal--a fish taco was truly uninspiring (but adequate--fresh radishes were a nice touch, but couldn't make up for the tough, coarsely breaded fish and bland sauce), and a quesadilla suffered from too much and the wrong (cheddar--should have been a mix of a mild Mexican cheese like Asadero and something dry and sharp like Cotija) cheese.  The only completely right item was the Jamaica aqua fresca--plenty of flavor, but still refreshing.
