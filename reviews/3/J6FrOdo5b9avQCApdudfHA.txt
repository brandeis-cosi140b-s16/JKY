Very cute,  brightly colored,  small establishment in Tempe. The service was friendly,  prices reasonable,  although we really felt the food was so so. Tamales were mostly masa, red sauce bland. This doesn't mean other items could be more exciting than our experience.  I think it's worth trying out.  Although,  I will look elsewhere in the future!
