Taco Bell, Taco Hell... Call it what you want but being able to get cheap, vegan-friendly eats at a drive-thru is a simple yet rare pleasure.  Taco Bell is extremely veg-friendly and this location always delivers solid and fresh (ish) food.  Just be sure to double-check your order; they do tend to mess up from time to time.
