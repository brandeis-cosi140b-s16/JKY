I'm probably not the best person to write a review for Mexican food, because I'm just not the biggest fan. Didn't grow up with it, so I don't crave it the way other people do. I've been to places that people tell me "are the best" and to me, they taste pretty much the same as every other place I've tried. What I do LOVE about El Encanto is the atmosphere and service. I've dined inside on a cold winter's night - and enjoyed the fireplace and live guitarist. And I've dined when it's warm, outside in the walled patio by the little pond. The service is always attentive and knowledgeable. I've taken people who say they know good Mexican food and they've said the food is delicious. And everything I've had has been good. Personally my favorite are the chips and salsas served free. The chips are always hot and fresh and the three salsas are super fresh and oh-so-good! I'm just not the right reviewer for the rest of it
