Tuesday is fish taco day in my family and that is because Rubio's has $1.50 fish tacos that day.  This Rubio's is very nice and clean and we always get great service.  I think it is a little larger than some of the others and there is even outdoor seating.  I also had one of there salads and it was pretty good.  The chips and guacamole are good most of the time (once it didn't taste like avocados were ripe).  Other than that I love this place and I like that the people remember us as well.
