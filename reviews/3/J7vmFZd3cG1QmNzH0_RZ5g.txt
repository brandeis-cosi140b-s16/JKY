I went here about two years ago with my nephew and some friends and the food was decent our waitress was simply amazing she was very friendly, wholesome and cute!! The restaurant's decor was rather plain, nothing impressive.  it was a huge room with tables and chairs.  I remember going to this place based on a recommendation from a drunken local.  I am planning to return to this place in couple of weeks at that time I will truly be able to rate this restaurant accordingly.  Las islitas are in the in the central coast of Mexico in the state of Nayarit.  A native dish of Nayarit is pescado sarandeado!!! it is an extremely delicious fish that is slowly cooked over burning wood chips.  This restaurant serves it.  Since on our first visit they were about to close they were unable to prepare this fish for us!!! I can hardly wait!!! I am not expecting it to taste the same as the one I had in my hometown in Nayarit, but if it gets somewhat close I will be ecstatic!!!

Was there this weekend and I returned to this seafood Nayarit style restaurant.  The infamous pescado sarandeado was good, but I don't believe I will be changing my rating.....This restaurant continues to be a 3 star, and I continue on my journey to find great pescado sarandeado.  No BEER!!! Mexican seafood with no beer????
