Tasty!

It's the Hawaiian version of Chipotle.
Fresh and you can pick your own toppings for your bowl, tacos, burrito or salad.

What you Really Really Really need to try is their coconut bark.  It is freakin' Awesome!

Service is really good and super friendly.  

I'd choose this over Chipotle if this was on my side of town.
