Was there for a Las Vegas trip and wanted some authentic mexican food and most of all, I was craving a michelada so bad. 
For food this restaurant is very good and tasty but the michelada was dissapointing. Took one drink and had to get something else. The micheladas I'm used to drinking have a nice spicy mixture with beer with a spicy salt mix on the rim but they don't make it like that there. It had no flavor at all not even beer flavor just tasted like water and regular salt. Not good sorry
