Went here with my friend during our vacay. I LOVE Mexican food and thought this place would satisfy my craving. 

The atmosphere was chill for the most part and our waitress was nice. The food was ehhh ok..I did enjoy the guacamole though. I ordered flour tacos and they weren't as tasteful as I had hoped. The corona-rita was ok.
