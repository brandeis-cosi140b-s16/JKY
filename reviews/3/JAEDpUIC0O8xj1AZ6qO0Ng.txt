food? 8 out of 10.  good chips.

ambience? weird, at bar, as view of other people across bar is blocked. odd design.

service?  hate to say it, but as disinterested as one could imagine. off-day, perhaps?

Love the advertising billboards for Blanco )more savvy Sam Fox marketing at work).  But this place is in serious need of a pulse.
