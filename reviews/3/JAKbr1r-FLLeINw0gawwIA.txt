Arrived last night with a party of six. We had a great server; she was attentive and always kept making sure we were okay. 
The food on the other hand was not that impressive. We ordered a lot of food, so here it goes. My dad ordered their shrimp cocktail/cerviche he said it was good but they didn't have any crackers to go with it for him. I ordered their chicken quesadilla and that was mouth watering delicious. 
My daughters ordered the children's quesadilla meal and that was not very impressive. Two small flat grilled tortillas with a small amount of white cheese. 
My parents didn't complain about their meal but didn't rave about it either. 
I had the dinner #8 which was a green chili burro. I am a sucker for green chili burros and then one did not take the cut. The sauce inside was more like a gravy then a chili mixture. I didn't see any whole or sliced green chili's inside of it. The meat was not tender and was just chunks of meat. 
This place has the potential to be a great Mexican restaurant yet they don't strive to be. 
I doubt I will return to this place again.
