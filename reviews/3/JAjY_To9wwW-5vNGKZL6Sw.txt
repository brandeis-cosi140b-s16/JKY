Here's the thing, when Mejico is on, they do a very good job with their food. I've had multiple experiences now where we have shown up and they have run out of particular menu items. Their food is good, but nothing that I haven't had elsewhere. Happy hour isn't that bad, but again they've run out of happy hour items before, and we got there close to the start.  If they were busy, I'd imagine this would be a good thing.  Since they are not usually busy, a friend in the food industry says this doesn't bode well for a restaurant, since it may mean they are unable to buy their ingredients.

I want to love Mejico, it is in my neighborhood, and it gives me an option beyond Binks. Reduce your price point, or increase the portions for some of your items, and you might draw more people in. This is Phoenix, and good Mexican food is everywhere, so if you're going to charge a lot of money for Mexican dishes they should be excellent (and available)...
