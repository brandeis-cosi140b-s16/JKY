We liked it but probably not enough to come back. 

We got El Presidente, which is a green chili and carne Asada burrito. It was spicy and a good flavor, but I wasn't loving the carne asada texture. And although the flavor was pretty good, it needed pico or guacamole or something to give you a break from the spice and the flavor. 

The carnitas burrito was better, and the carnitas texture was great. Love that. But again, it needed something to mix it up a bit. It was just meat and spice. 

Next we got the green chile tamale. That was very good. But usually tamales aren't enough alone for me to love a place. 

Really what Espo's needs is a salsa bar with limes, different kinds of salsas, but especially some pico. 

Finally, the folks at the counter were nice. However the table was sticky and there were several flies buzzing me. It had an interesting smell that wasn't Mexican food. Not bad, but didn't make it more appealing either.
