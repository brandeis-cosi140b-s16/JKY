The food ok, the atmosphere, frankly, awesome. I loved the decor, the redone retro house, patio, waitstaff... yelp, yelp, yelp. But at the end of the day, Best carne asada in Phx? Nope. The lady and I only ordered some tacos but since this was a taco shop, I figured the signature item was the best bet. Yea, I'll be back but not til after I really find the best carne asada. 5 years still looking...
