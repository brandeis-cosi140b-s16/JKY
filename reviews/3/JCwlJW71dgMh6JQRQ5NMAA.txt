3 stars. To be honest, I liked it before.  The new atmosphere is unorignal and nothing like the contemporary casualness of the old set up.  I miss the ordering set up, and the casualness of the restaurant.  The menu has changed, no more tamales. I was very sad.  The food portions are generous, and the salsa is still good.  Enchiladas were still good, I went for the verde with cheese.  They also seem to have more vegetarian options? which is a good thing.  But I am nostalgic of the old place.  The staff seems inexperienced, and the music they play isn't inviting.  I'm hoping they go back to their roots with some of the stuff.  It seems that they are more focused on drinks at this location, and I don't know how this will play out with the location.  I am partial to this old company, and hope for the best. But damn, I want my tamales back!
