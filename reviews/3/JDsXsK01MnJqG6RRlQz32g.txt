I will start by saying I love Chipotle. I do. I love the ungodly giant burritos you can get and I love the option for a salad. This place is constantly packed, which is really annoying if all you want to do is slide on in for a quick meal to eat in or take it to go. I know there's an option to call in ahead of time (I think), but I seem to forget to ever do that because I come here on a whim. While I do enjoy the food, I've been frustrated with the service. It seems there's always one, maybe two, people trying to help customers while other people are talking or doing something in the back. I understand there are other things that have to get done, but if it's so busy...maybe try to hustle versus texting? This is what I've witnessed and can't say it happens every single time.

After waiting in line a few times, I get up front to ask for a salad and have to keep asking for lettuce and some veggies as my to go order is being passed down the line. Same with the dressing for the salad. If I didn't keep asking, I'm pretty sure it would have been forgotten. I like the simplicity of the menu even though some people come up the line thinking they can ask for some weird concoction they don't even put together. Aside from my issues with slower service, I will say I've always encountered a pleasant employee. They're either smiling or say hello and I think that makes a huge difference. I understand they get slammed and a lot of the time they're trying to keep up with everything. I think once or twice I was able to get to Chipotle without a huge line and I felt like I just unlocked some sort of achievement in my life. Yes, it was that big of a deal.
