I only eat at El Pollo Loco during Lent, when I give up Meat.  I love their BRC (Beans, Rice, Cheese) Burritos....and the price is right, $1.

In addition to the BRC Burrito, I tried a Quesadilla for the 1st time.....pass on it, trust me.  The BRC Burrito was good, as usual....however, I think they're getting smaller and smaller.

Their complimentary Salsa Bar is pretty good, although they don't have a really Spicy option for us who love the Heat.

Overall, this past visit went OK.  The cashier was really slow at taking the orders and it took forever just to place one with only 2 people ahead of me.  The food was good and made up for the minor inconvenience.
