I had dinner Wednesday night at J&G Steakhouse and dinner Saturday at T-Cook's.  In between, I had dinner at Two Hippies.

I enjoyed a pork burrito stuffed with meat, cabbage, cheese, rice and beans.  The burrito was huge and tasted great.  It actually started to fall apart at the end because it was filled so full and that was all right with me.

Including a can of coke, the total cost was $6.  That was my cheapest dinner out last week by a mile!
