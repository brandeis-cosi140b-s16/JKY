Sadly, El Mas Sabroso is permanently closed. There is a new Mexican joint there now. They are good and the pricing is about the same. They did clean it up a bit and redecorate/remodel. Kinda like Filiberto's, but nicer and more modern inside. I think they were going for the Chipotle's look. 

Like Filiberto's, the burritos come with pure meat. Wanna add rice or beans? It'll cost ya! Wait... they have to remove meat to fit the rice/beans. Rice and beans are cheaper than meat! Why on earth would anyone charge more money when they are saving money??!?  Senseless.
