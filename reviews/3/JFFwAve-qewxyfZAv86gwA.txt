Food is maybe slightly above average in my opinion.  I have always had great service, however.  Reliable place to go if you're in the area.  It makes my husband's trips to Fry's Electronics across the street more tolerable for me.  Last time we went, we were seated in a separate building on the other side of the patio.  Was very nice and relatively quiet.  I'm not overly fond of the patio since Baseline is so busy.

I do prefer the Aunt Chilada's on Dreamy Draw-both the food and the atmosphere.  But I'm sure I'll be back to this location again.  Damn computer geeks.
