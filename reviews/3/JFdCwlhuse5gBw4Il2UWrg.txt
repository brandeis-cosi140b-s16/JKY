My old school late night 'bertos was in North Phoenix, but this has become my handy work 'bertos.  

Confession:  Every once in a while I get a hankering for a greasy quesadilla dipped in hot sauce - at 7am.  I know it's weird.  I can't even explain it.  But say 3-4 times a year the urge strikes and it strikes hard.  This place has satisfied that urge in style.  As a 'bertos quesadilla fan I have to say - be prepared to swab it down with some napkins.  Because it is 100% real cheese so it can be a greasy mess.  

The same could be said for much of their food.  It may be greasy - but at least it's real.  You know what you're eating.  One of their cheap combos is an easy 2 lunches.  And while this place definately falls into the "fast food, crap food" category vs. the "hole in the wall, heaven" kind of food - it's a great alternative to have.
