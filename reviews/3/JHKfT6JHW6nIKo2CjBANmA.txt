Ok...being from Mexican decent this is hard to give review...never been to New Mexico so I have to say the Chile Verde compared to real Mexican Chile Verde...this Chile Verde falls flat...it's ok but I had to salt it....the asada tacos were meh...the hero of this place is the sopapillas.
The service was good
