I've now been to Emiliano's twice, and have yet to be seriously disappointed.  It's no Mad Mex, but the food is decent, the atmosphere festive and the service friendly.    We arrived to a packed house at 6:45 on Saturday night and began the meal with Emilianos' signature chips and salsa - really decent and a nice way to start the evening.  Between our group of four we tried seafood fajitas, a pork burrito with sweet potato fries, the chicken quesadilla and something I forget and/or can't identify with red sauce. Personally, I think my fajitas were the best choice of the night, but that's just me.  A little on the oily side, but generally hot, fresh and plentiful with a full complement of mexican rice and guacamole salad.  3 stars, since I think "decent" isn't an ideal way to feel about food and the price is higher than Mad Mex for lesser quality.  But hey, Emiliano's truly is A-OK and I'll probably go back again.  Ol√©!
