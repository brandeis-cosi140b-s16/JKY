Second time here
First time disappointed in service, wasn't treated fairly as a single person, waitress paid more attention to bigger tables
 I always give second chances, so today 
Carne a Sada meat in taco was over cooked, OK well?  Let's move over to my shrimp taco.... Over cooked shrimp also  and rice wasn't fully cooked
Server/waitress was OK... Just maybe in a hurry all the time?
