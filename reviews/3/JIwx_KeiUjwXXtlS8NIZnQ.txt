I ordered the Nachos, they were pretty good.  I like the queso cheese on the Nachos, and the chicken is good.  I also like the portions.  For me, the chips are a little to salty, but I don't eat a lot of salt in general anyways.  The service was pretty fast and mostly friendly.  Me and a friend ordered together and specifically asked for 2 drinks.  She gave us 1 cup and when we told her again we needed 2, she said "I only charged you for 1" in a somewhat snotty attitude.  WTF, I don't care, charge me and give me another cup.  Other than that everything else was fine.
