I've visited off-and-on since opening.  Having tried several items, from "specialties" to "combo platters," I have to say that their offerings aren't anything to write home about.  They're not horrible, but far from impressive.  The portion sizes are right, the chips and salsa are okay.  Although I love me some guacomole, I'm not a big fan of theirs.  If you're looking for some mexican food that's just decent and filling, Nandos will suffice.
