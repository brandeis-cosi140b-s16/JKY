Chapala's Mexican Restaurant is a huge space where the interior reminds me of those El Torito Restaurants, but without the high ceilings and second floor.

Standard tortilla chips along with two kinds of salsa, one hot and the other mild, arrived at our table soon after we slid into our booth.  

The Husband order a platter that included a hard taco, flauta, and a chili relleno.  It was the first time he had a chili relleno, and unfortunately, it didn't leave a memorable impression.  His meal also came with a soup and coffee.

I ordered the shrimp enchiladas dish and it was really good.  We were both pleasantly surprised by the plump shrimp in my enchiladas.  Slices of avocado and tomatoes, along with a dollop of sour cream, laid on top of my meal.  The gooey cheese all over my dish made it very good.

Service was friendly, our waitress came by to refill our beverages without asking and also to see if we needed more chips and salsa.  We sat in a large dining room, but it looks like they have another room available for banquets.  Booths and tables are both available and there is a large parking lot.

Overall, Chapala's was fine for Mexican food.  It wasn't extraordinary, nor as awful as the other yelpers have said.  Then again, we got one great dish and one oh-so average dish.

They also offer an AYCE during lunch time, not sure when though.
