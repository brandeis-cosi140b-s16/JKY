This place was recommended by shaking up UrbanSpoon on my iPhone. 

The goods...super fast service...lots of salsa (both hot and mild) is provided and the tortilla chips were delivered warm.  Iced tea tasted fresh.  The glass was refilled quickly (I sat at the bar).  Very cool building, the blue windows are very cool, looks like a spaceship.  I order a chicken chimi, which was decent.  It was delivered so quick, I didn't think it was possible to fry up a chimi so quick.

The not so goods...
The chimi had a bit more tortilla than I usually like.  The mild salsa wasn't bad, but wasn't great.  It was a bit pricy for a lunch stop (for me anyways), not the best value.

I'd go again, but only if I was in the area.
