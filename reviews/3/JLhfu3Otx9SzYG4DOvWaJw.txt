Our family has been Macayos customers since they were called Woodys!  We absolutely love Macayos.  Our personal favorites include the Baja Burro and Baja Chimi.  

Unfortunately, we did not have such a great experience at this particular location.  The food was great, but the service was lousy.  Our waitress was unfriendly, pushy, could not handle multi-tasking, would not get refills (had to ask for them), and overall she was not what we are use to at Macayos restaurants.  We were very disappointed after a nice long day at Luke Air Force for Luke Days.
