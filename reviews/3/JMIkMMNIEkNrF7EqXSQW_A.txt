Last night was my second attempt at enjoying Los Cabos. Sadly, like my first visit, I was disappointed. My food was mediocre (not terrible, but nothing special) and overpriced. I'm glad they lost the Styrofoam plates since the last time I visited, but they still use Styrofoam cups which is kind of a turn off for me as far as restaurants go. 

However, as others have noted, their service is great and the employees are very friendly. And they offer free chips. Unfortunately, their great service is not enough to make me want to go back. Unless, of course, it's late on a Friday or Saturday night and I'm looking for some greasy food to satisfy my drunken appetite.
