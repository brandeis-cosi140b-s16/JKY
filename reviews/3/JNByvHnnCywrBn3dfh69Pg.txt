Good food, will definitely try again! 
I got a fish taco,  a shrimp taco, and medium drink. 
I loved the shrimp taco! It helped that I caught a glimpse of the cook placing gray fresh shrimp on the grill lol
I was not big on the fish taco, mostly because I don't like fried fish. 
The little condiment bar was nice but some of the radishes did not look fresh.
