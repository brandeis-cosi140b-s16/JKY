Ordered two different chimis.  Red beef and machca.

The red beef was ok.  Although be ready to taste it again in a few hours.  The machca beef was more shredded beef (not a bad thing) than machca.

On the menu both come enchilada style which, quite frankly, is something I don't get.  So we passed on that.  Otherwise it was served with melted cheese ( kind of a weird texture/constancy), sour cream and guacamole.  Sour cream was sour cream.  Guacamole was ok, although the avocados could have been mashed a little more.

Chips were good but I found the salsa to be a little hotter than I prefer.

Overall not bad.
