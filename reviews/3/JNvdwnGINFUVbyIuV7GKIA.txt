I want to dedicate these three stars to a waiter named Javier, because HE was four stars, the food was two, thus averaging out the star count to 3. This gentleman was what a good server should be: engaging, funny, polite and friendly. Attentive. Because of him, I had a very pleasant visit. I'm gonna be honest and say that I didn't really like the food although I really enjoyed the steak quesadilla I ate. Starting off with the chips and salsa, the chips are on point. Ours were fresh out of the fryer and nice and crunchy. The salsa, FAKE. No spice, nothing nice, and I felt like those cowboys in the commercial that say: "This stuff was made in New York City!!!" The queso fundido and the guacamole were outstanding though, and went perfectly with the tortilla chips.

Moving on to the rest of the food, AGAIN, FAKE BEANS AND FAKE RICE. BOO!!!!! You can't fake the Mexican, cause a real Mexican and real Mexican food lovers will know what real Mexican food is supposed to taste like and in all of my 37 years of eating Mexican food, I've never tasted rice like that before. IF you've ever seen buffets or cafeteria lines whip out a bag of pre-cooked rice and then pour it in to a tray, you get it and it has like a rubbery/plastic taste and texture, you'll know what I'm talking about. Puro Rice-A-Roni/Uncle Ben status. My wife and I shared a shrimp enchilada plate, and I felt that they could have been a little spicier, but overall were not bad.

My only real complaint about this place is that breakfast isn't served all day. It's only served till 12 pm, and I don't know about you, but who gets up before 12 pm in Vegas? I had wanted chilaquiles and a cheap bloody mary, but sadly, I couldn't get either because 12 pm had passed, sniff, sniff. Maybe I should get up earlier next time so I can try their breakfast. Overall, I think I'd come back because their drinks looked very tasty!
