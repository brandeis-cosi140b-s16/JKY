I'm really surprised this place doesn't have better reviews. I wasn't expecting much and I go more than expected. 
Simply put, this is a good ole' casual Mexican place. Nothing fancy, but quick, large portions of tasty Mexican tastiness which is priced very reasonably.
I sat outside and our waiter was quick.The guacamole & queso were tasty followed by their enchiladas. I will be returning for sure!
