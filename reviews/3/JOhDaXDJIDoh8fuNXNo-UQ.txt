I love Chipotle in general. I hate their anti-GMO stance and their inability to prevent horrible outbreaks of terrible diseases, but that risk is MINIMAL. Go ahead and take that as a given in all of my Chipotle reviews. I'm reviewing each of these Chipotles independently.
These guys and gals are always a bit stingy in their portions. Even though this was the closest Chipotle to me for a long time, I tried to make an effort to go to the PV Mall location instead of this one. Considering the crazy amount of money we're paying for each of these ingredients, I'd like a bit more food than they give. $10 for a burrito with guac seems like a lot when they skimp out. I imagine this is a local management issue since I regularly eat at a few other Chipotles (Yeah, I have a real problem)
