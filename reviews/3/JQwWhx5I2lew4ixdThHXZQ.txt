I fear the backlash, but I must be honest. I thought it was meh.

We managed to get in before the crazy line; it helped that it was raining outside.

Got the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada style as recommended.  Good quality meat; sauce was ok. I think I would have preferred the burrito dry but with their hot sauce.
Hubby felt the same about his Red Chile Burrito.  

I'm always happy to patronize a local mom&pop place, but I don't see all the hype.  Am I just spoiled by LA Mexican food?  Perhaps.
