In the area for the natural history museum and had a desire for Mexican. Yelp sent us to this location, is a site that sells tacos on the front sidewalk.  One main tip is that you pay inside each taco is $2.50. Then you proceed outside to pick the meat. Went with the steak and onions, ground beef, carnitas and chicken. I don't love the double soft shell tacos, they seem to get soggy and wet by the time we walked to the car. We loved the toppings bar nice and easy!! fresh and tasty.
