It's like Chipotle, the local version. The spicy pork is great. Food is all a little salty and there isn't a water service that I can see (bottles of water and pop in a case, lemonade and horchata machines). But the food is really cheap (and if you only want one or two tacos, you don't have to get three). They really need to put out some bottles of Chula. No real hot sauce here. Also, they serve beer.
