The Crazy Chicken is correct!  I usually hit up the drive-thru where I intent to try something different but always end up ordering the Pollo Bowl with flour tortillas.  You can't go wrong with chicken breast, pinto beans, rice, cilantro, onion, and Pico de Gallo all thrown together in one plastic bowl.  Mixed with their fabulous Spicy Avocado sauce it's true satisfaction.  

The few times I have ventured into The Crazy Chicken it has been a people watchers delight!  From the 8 employees they have sitting at tables talking numbers and signage to the guy I saw sipping on a helping of the Spicy Avocado sauce.  If you are going to dine in I would recommend holding that last hit in for awhile just so you can enjoy the craziness of the El Pollo Loco customers rather than be annoyed by their existence.   Be warned that weekends seem to be the time for families to head on over to El Pollo Loco for a family night out!!
