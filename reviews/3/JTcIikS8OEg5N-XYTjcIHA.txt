Call it three and a half.  I think I'm spoiled having Frotera Grill and Topolobampo here in Chicago.  Spotted Donkey was good, just nothing spectacular.  Their guacamole was good and the ceviche was tasty.  My wife had the shrimp tacos, which she seemed to like.  I had the carne asada, which was a bit overcooked and tough from the bad cut.  The sides were typical staples like mexican rice and beans.  There was not much creativity from the menu choices and again it seemed like typical mexican fare.  They also had some really funny pics of donkeys around the place.
