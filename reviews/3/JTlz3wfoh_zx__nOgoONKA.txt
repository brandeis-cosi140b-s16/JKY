this may be the fastest I have ever Yelped and it proves that I am hopelessly addicted to this foresaken site!!!

Was in the area and figured I would hit up this burrito place.  i was in the mood for the slop that makes a tasty burrito.  This certainly was not bad.

HUGE burrito.

lots and lots and lots of meat
tons of sauce, guac, cheese, pico, and more of all that too.

Pretty tasty and now I am stuffed. 

I am in the area from time to time so I think I will go back and kill some more burritos.
