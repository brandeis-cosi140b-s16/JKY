I had the 10 course meal. $50. First let me say the service is always on point and that matters alot when you go out. Damn near makes up for the food. 
Let me start by saying being the son of a mexican chef makes me very, very judgmental. But I can still be fair.
The pozole was good. 3.5 stars out five. Good broth and meat.
The hibiscus tacos were ok. 2.5 stars. Nothing you would order again.
The fig and panela salad was good. 3 stars. Cheese and dressing were great.
Shrimp and Papaya salad was ok. 2 stars. Shrimp was old (typical AZ shrimp)
Salmon was great! 4 stars. I would order it again.
Trout was ok. 2 stars. AZ Fish not very good.
Stuffed chicken was great! 4 stars. I mean its stuffed chicken, how can it go wrong?
Chile relleno with beef picadillo. Now the star of this show, 5 stars. The inside reminded of a desert they make in Sonora, MX. Its called capirotada. Its sweet and salty, maybe a hint a syrup?
Pork loin. 2 stars. Not very inspiring
Piloncillo Ice cream. 3 stars. It need something to cut the same flavor profile and make it a complete desert.
Look, I know people say its great, but Barrio Cafe is way better with the same $$ point and flavor profile.
I want to like it. I really do. But its not what it is cracked up to be.
