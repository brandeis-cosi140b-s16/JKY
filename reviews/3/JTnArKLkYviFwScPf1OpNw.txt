This is about your average Mexican restaurant.  One thing I need to recommend is that you do not get the Charro beans. .  In the description it says they are Pinto Beans with Chorizo and Sausage.  It is more of a soupy side of beans with hot dogs in it.  The other food there is great though.  They have lunch specials and they also have a few dishes from other Latin American countries.  


I will definitely eat here again as it is right across the street from my work.  However, there is a lot of competition here in the Pineville area.
