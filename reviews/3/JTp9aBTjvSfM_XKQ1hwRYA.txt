3.5 stars would be my ideal rating for this retro-modern casual Mexican joint... Their menu is chock full of yummy looking stuff.. I ordered the Fajitas (chicken & steak) which was a decent portion of meat, a HUGE portion of REALLY good beans, and nicely done rice.. I wished for more peppers & onions but whaa whaa #whitewhine... 
The food in general is similar to what you may find at a suburban sit-down mexican chain, with a bit more originality... lower prices, and serve yourself chips, salsa and drinks.. a much more sensible concept with this level of dining. I'm eager to return to Julio's Too (it had been 4ish years!) to try more stuff!
