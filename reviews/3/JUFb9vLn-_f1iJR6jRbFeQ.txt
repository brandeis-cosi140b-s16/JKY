Decent Mexican - in particular, Oaxacan-style cuisine.  As like every hotel/casino based restaurant, it is exceedingly overpriced.  Drinks are ok - I ordered a glass of $10 sangria - I've had better.

Prior to your meal, you get your chips and dip; but you get three different types of dip with an herbal/salt accompaniment.  It was generally ok, so it was fine to eat this while biding time for my entree.

The enchilada platter was pretty good, but again - I've had better.  My friend had chicken tacos - again, there's been better.

My last name is Diego, and so we had a fun time trying to convince our waiter to give us a discount because I share the same name as the restaurant (walking promotion, right?)  Of course, it didn't work.
