What makes Pancheros a unique burrito building and rice bowl consuming experience? A few things.
Mostly the tortilla. Its better than chipotle and qdoba. They make it out of a tiiiiiiiny ball of dough. Just for you. Right there. And its a real difference.

Second, they mix the burritos. Its a veritable marble slab of latin mixins. That provides a consistent burrito experience.

Third, they dont smile at you. They take their burritos seriously. Apparently Very Seriously. Ive met at least four employees at various times at this location. They are always calm, prpfessional and quick. They are not friendly. 
Other better than's: corn salsa. Queso (costs more).

Things they dont do as well-
I mentioned smiling. Just dont expect it. Bring friends to fill that void.
The chicken is fine but not Chipotle. The rice is meh.
All in all its a solid experience for the money.
