Decent local Mexican food chain: menu has plates, tacos, burritos, and chimichangas. Menu isn't much different from Roberto's but this location is a little less casual- shares space with a PT's next door.

Fish tacos are tasty, though the chunk of fish is a little smaller than other comparably-priced tacos in town. California Burrito is just about $6, which is decent pricing for a massive portion. Three-piece rolled tacos are extra crispy- a bit too fried, actually. The upcharge for adding guac gets you a ton, though. Too bad it isn't fresh, seemed to be a premade mix which is tragic for a Mexican restaurant.

Service was friendly. Outdated tube TV in the dining room. Lots of seating, including on the porch. Entrance is weirdly placed, go all around the patio by the Marie Callendar's entrance.
