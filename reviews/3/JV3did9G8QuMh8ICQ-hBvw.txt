Had lunch here last week.  I ordered the special which was fish tacos.  My husband ordered the shredded beef taco and red enchilada.  I didn't really care for my dish.  It just wasn't very tasty.  My husbands was good.  They refilled our chip bowl promptly.  Not very big but it was very busy.  Our waitress was attentive.  Oh yeah, an older gentleman (possible the owner?) offered us some gum from his large bowl on the way out.  Everyone was polite and I like that.  I will be back for the enchiladas next time.
