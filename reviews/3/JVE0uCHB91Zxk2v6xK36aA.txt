The good: tortilla chips, salsa and flavor of meats. The bad: portions and service. The service took so long and the portions felt a bit of a rip off. I was given a few spoonfuls (maybe 2 or 3)  of the rice for $1.50. Rice is not that expensive and I started to think of Maize and how I should have bought rice there! They give you a more generous portion. When I brought this to the attention of waitress she just mentioned that's how it is. She was nice but wasn't too helpful with questions. Service was a bit slow and waters did not get refilled. I don't think I'll be heading back here. Last time flavor was good but I'm toggling between the service and other options in area. I'll just go to the other options.
