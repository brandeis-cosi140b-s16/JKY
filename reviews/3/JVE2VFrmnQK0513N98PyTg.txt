This is a review of Great and really pretty poor.  Went to Chile Addiction on Sunday.  It was about 3:00 and the place had about 4 tables.  We were seated immediately.  Once we reviewed the menu, we ordered a bowl of soup to split between the 2 of us and an entree each.  The chips and salsa arrived pretty quickly.  The chips are "Christmas" (Red & Green) and nothing to write home about.  The salsa, however was complex and had enough heat to wake you up, but not so much as to make you want to run away. 

We waited about 15 minutes before asking our server if we were getting our soup.  He said he would check and out he came with our soup and the two entrees all at the same time.  We were told that they thought the order was for 3 people even though there were only two of us at the table.  I had to ask for spoons!!!  The soup was very good.

The pork chili verde was quite nice as an entree.  Complex chili flavors and a fair portion. 

I am not sure of the idea of every entree coming with sopapillas and having honey on the table.  They were OK, but ensured that we did not need to order desert.

As I said from the start. this is a review of Great - the food and the pretty poor - the service.  If you can get over the fact that it may take your server 3 trips to bring 2 glasses of water and straws for quality tasty food at a fair price, then this place is for you.  The owner was there,but she was either running the register or setting tables.  She did stop by our table due to the challenge with the food, but did not stop at any others.
