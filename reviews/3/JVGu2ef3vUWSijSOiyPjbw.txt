I've been here dozens of times. It's not my favorite Mexican restaurant by any stretch. But it's solidly average, it's close to my house, and sometimes I'm wildly lazy and don't feel like trekking far to stuff my face with copious amounts of free chips. So I keep slinking back to Patron for an adequate but not outstanding meal.

The first few times I went here, I sampled several chicken dishes that had their shredded, seasoned chicken in them (e.g., chicken flautas, chicken enchiladas). I found the texture of the shredded meat to be tough, stringy and chewy -- very off putting. So I started steering clear of anything with the shredded meat, and now I usually get their "pollo amigo" entree, which consists of chicken breast strips over a bed of rice topped with their cheese sauce. It's fairly tasty (the meat in this dish doesn't have any texture issues), although they could stand to be more generous with the cheese sauce. It's not overly spiced or flavorful, but it's generally decent (and that's pretty much how I would describe everything I've ever eaten here -- decent but not amazing).

Service can be hit or miss depending on what section you're in. I've always been seated right away (it's rarely busy in there), and free chips and salsa have always been delivered to our table with haste.  But beyond that, you can't always count on your server to promptly take your order, fill your drink, or check up on you with any regularity. It just really depends on the day.

Given the food quality and service, I think that they are probably priced on the high side. But like I said, when a craving for Mexican food strikes, they'll get the job done adequately.
