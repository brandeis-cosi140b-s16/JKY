Recently came for lunch to give it a try since the renovations and new owners. We came for lunch on Halloween day. We gave our name to the hostess and she told us it would be a 20 minute wait because they only had two servers on. Resturant was not full but for two servers, it was a lot and I didn't mind waiting for table; rather than being sat and having slow service/ bad service. There were others waiting as well, that were ahead of us. 
I was excited to sit down and order, seemed like everyone was really enjoying it. Then two men came in, went to hostess stand and a server came up and took them to a table. A couple came in behind them and server also sat them. It was obvious the people sitting in waiting  area by door and others standing were waiting on a table but she didn't seem to ask or acknowledge we were all there waiting. After biting my tongue & not saying anything we were sat about 10 minutes later. 
Chips were a bit on the salty side but certainly edible and tasty. My husband liked the salsa but I didn't really care for it but I really enjoyed that hot sauce. The food was delicious, not one complaint. Lunch portions were huge and it was so good that I couldn't stop picking at it even after I was completely stuffed. Rice and beans were definitely authentic. I usually am very picky about rice and beans but this place nailed it. 
My husband says this is our new go to place. I think so also because the food was very good. I personally think if they work on their service staff, this place would be perfect and there'd be no complaints.
