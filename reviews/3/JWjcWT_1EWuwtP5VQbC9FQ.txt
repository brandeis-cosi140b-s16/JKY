This place is certainly three stars in my book, but I plan on coming back.

The first time I got the carne asada chips/nachos.  I was pretty excited about the concept of steak and melted cheese served on chips.  Unfortunately, the blandness of the beans canceled out the delicious marinade of the carne asada; leaving me with a pretty bland dish since there wasn't anything else on the enormous platter to kick things up a notch.

They did a decent job on the quesadilla--so far the best I've had in Pittsburgh.  They actually put some flavor in there and crisped up the tortilla.

Most recently I got the chimichanga, which was a big step up in flavor compared to the carne asada chips.  It wasn't quite as crispy or overflowing with cheese like I'm used to with my TexMex favorite, but it was pretty respectable.  Peppers, delicious marinated beef, and pico made this a worth while adventure.

In the end, the food is good enough that I would come back--maybe during lunch hour--but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to take an out of town guest there.

And Yelp, CAN YOU PLEASE ADD COMMON MEXICAN FOOD TERMS TO YOUR SPELL CHECK?
