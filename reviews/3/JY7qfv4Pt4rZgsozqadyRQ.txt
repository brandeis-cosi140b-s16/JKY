Caramba Fresh Mexican Food would ordinarily get four stars from me but their recent increase in prices have really turned me away.

My family and I have been eating here off and on since the late 90's.  We love their cheese crisp and the bean and cheese burrito smothered with enchilada cheese sauce.  Their complimentary chips and salsa are great as well.

Their margaritas are the bomb and rest assure you will leave with a buzz !

Great place to grab a bite to eat.  Not the best mexican food.  This is more a fast food type place not a sit down restaurant enjoy a nice meal kinda of place.

Great place to hang out.  Have a great meal.  Drink margaritas !

Customer service is the best !
