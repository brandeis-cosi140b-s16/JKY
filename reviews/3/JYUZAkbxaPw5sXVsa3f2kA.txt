I think overall it was ok, but this is not a place that I would want to go back to.

Our server was ok but again nothing special.  She failed to tell us about the sharing menu or the all you can eat tacos ( which they advertise on Monday and Sunday's) until we asked about it.  She seemed bothered when we asked her questions or asked for modifications to the items we ordered i.e we wanted pinto beans rather than black beans.

The guacamole and chips are really good and had a lot of flavor.  Several people in our group ordered the unlimited tacos (swordfish, chicken, carne asada, shrimp, and pork belly) but I felt they were just ok and if I came back I would not order them again.
