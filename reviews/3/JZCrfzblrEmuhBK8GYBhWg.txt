New location, time to update my review.  I got fajitas and they were just...not very good.  Not bad, just not good.  There also weren't enough tortillas to use up all the filling, and I wasn't sure if I would be charged extra for more tortillas.  Ended up bringing the remaining filling home as leftovers and used my own tortillas so it worked out.  Food was served piping hot--no complaints there--I just felt like there was a complete lack of flavor.  Pretty disappointing, since I've never had a dissatisfying experience at El Toro before.  While looking at the menu, it also seemed like the prices had increased....not sure if I'm just crazy or if that's actually the case.
