We originally wanted Mama R's only to get there and realize it was a Prom Saturday, so we headed nearby to see what we could try. We get to La Paz and they initially quoted a 10 minute wait. We were starving, so this was music to our ears. Good thing we are pretty patient because we ended up waiting closer to 25 min for a table. Note to young host: better to err in more minutes and wait less , not  vice versa.  A fresh ( or seemed) salsa and chips are the start of the meal. Pretty tasty. He had the Acapulco Shrimp(mango salsa, avocado,onions, blk beans, peppers and coconut rice)and I tried the Tamarind Citrus Chicken ( marinated chicken, queso fresco, blk beans, coconut rice, avocado , mango salsa) He really cleaned his plate, but I could have left the orangy glaze from chicken. Tamarind and the glaze just did not fuse well for me. Will try something else on a future visit. Our server was ok and the prices were reasonable.
