We popped-in for a quick bite prior to a show over at the Monona Terrace on 4/12/14 at around 6:30pm.

+ Cozy little space
- No tap beers
+ Mediocre selection of bottled beers
+ Victoria beer available in bottles!!!
+ Prices were very reasonable

+ Great menu - full of true "street food staples"
+ Reasonable prices

- Chips were meh
+ Salsa was great - lots of cilantro, good consistency

- Tacos (pastor, chicken, steak, veggie) were good, but very bland - the meats had no real flavor, and the veggies weren't seasoned. After we added hot sauce, salsa, and some salt and pepper, they were better. I love me a good street taco - simple, clean, and fresh tasting... these were just so plain.
- It took a long time to get the tacos; like 30-35 minutes
- Service was very slow, despite us sitting at the bar. Two female servers seemed extremely disorganized and unfamiliar with things.
+ Servers were very friendly

I much prefer a traditional, honest Mexican street food meal over what you'll find at places like Laredo's and other TexMex joints. But the tacos we had were so boring, I'm not sure I'd be in a huge rush to return. That's not to say I won't go back, but it'll take a bit before I return.
