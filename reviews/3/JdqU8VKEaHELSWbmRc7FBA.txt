The food was okay.  I have been to great hole-in-the-wall establishments and this one is not...but, it is a friendly spot.  It definitely is an older restaurant that needs to be updated.  Because it's old, it seems to be dirty.  The food selection isn't vast but the prices are pretty good.  It's worth a try at least once or twice.
