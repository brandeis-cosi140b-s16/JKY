right off the bat, i wasn't impressed with the ultra-mild, almost bland, comp chips and salsa.  i did love the way they soaked my shrimp ceviche tostada in loads of delicious lime.  the amount of shrimp was generous, but the prices seem steep.  however, i will consider a return visit next time i get a hanckering for mexican style seafood.  the building itself was clean and feels wide and open.  the service was good and wait time was minimal (considering the food was prepared fresh)
