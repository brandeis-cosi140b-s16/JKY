Love OP for breakfast and the American food. The Mexican food isn't that great honestly. It's bland. Lacking in flavor. 

Get: Turkey Club, Blue Cheese/Green Chile Burger, Pancake Sandwich, Mexican Pizza (only Mexican thing I recommend). 

The salsa is sweet, but definitely not hot.

Service is hit or miss.
