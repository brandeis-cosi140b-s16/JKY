Waiting in a long line to order my burrito, I can almost imagine waiting here to see a bank teller. Instead of servers scooping beans behind the counter, I imagine bank tellers scooping up cash. This Chipotle gives off a banking vibe for a reason. It's a story of the circle of life, the circle of the life of a Mexican grill.

A few years ago, there was a thriving Blue Burrito Mexican grill in this location. It grew a bit old and stale, however, eventually closing. I still miss their multi-colored corn chips and salsa bar. The building was torn down and a modern Wachovia Bank branch rose in its place. Heaven knows that Phoenix can always use another bank branch! And what happens? Wells Fargo acquires Wachovia. But Wells Fargo management felt they didn't need three bank branches within a block of each other. Apparently two will do. So they closed this branch. Who comes to the rescue? Chipotle! Converting the location back into a Mexican grill, completing the circle of the life of a Mexican grill.

It is a nice location. Long lines at peak times. But I do have trouble getting too excited about Chipotle, a concept purchased, developed and expanded by - gulp - McDonald's. The success of which has spawned boring not-so-fast food chains in nearly every ethnic food category. I'd rather go down Cactus Road for some local Mexican flavor at our own not-so-fast food Carolina's.
