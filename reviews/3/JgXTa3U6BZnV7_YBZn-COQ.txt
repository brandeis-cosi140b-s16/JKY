I wanted to add this place to the Yelp community because of how new it is.  I think they've only been around for a few months.  They have a great spot... right in SouthPark Mall, next to Dick's Sporting Goods. They have a pretty good menu selection.  I went with some friends after work the other night and didn't eat anything, but my buddies got some dip and some appetizers and it all looked pretty nice. Authentic mexican bean dip and homemade tortilla chips. Not bad. The only complaint I would have about my visit would be the service.  Our original bartender was pretty cool.  Very attentive and thorough. But after the "Changing of the Guard" the new guy might as well have been a bump on a damn log.  They guy was way too interested in flirting with some chick at the end of the bar then make sure his party of 7 got taken care of.  Took him 20 minutes to cash me out with an empty bar. 
Other than that it was a nice time. They have a great atmosphere, soccer up on the big screens and Pacifico a-plenty. Nice place to stop by after a long day working retail.  So I'd say give it a try.  Don't sit at the bar, maybe.  You might get the pretty boy who's oblivious to the world.
