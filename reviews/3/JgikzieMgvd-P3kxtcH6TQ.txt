This will be a very mixed review.

Excellent: Chips and salsas. Yum. STRONG margaritas (I passed out so hard afterwards at the chairs outside Starbucks that my wife couldn't wake me up for like 20 minutes...at lunchtime). Nice server lady who came to ask us (4 Asians) how we knew what mole sauce was and was all impressed we had been to Mexico, etc. Oh and good mole sauce. Nice mariachi band.

Not so good: We kind of got deceived into thinking we were ordering 2 for 1 margaritas for $12. She brought it in 4 glasses since there were 4 of us (though we thought we had only ordered 2) so we thought she had split it for us on purpose. Turned out she charged us $24 for 4 margaritas. That sucked. (but like I said it was a good margarita). 

Though our server lady was pretty nice, the manager was not. Also, in general, the price was a bit painful. Plus, ambience in the Luxor is...well dark and cold...kind of like how dead Egyptian pharaohs would like it....not how chipper Mexican cantinas generally are.

I would come back to just have a margarita (ONE and only ONE) and those chips and salsa though.
