This is exactly the type of Mexican joint you would expect in a college town. It's fairly cheap, fast, and they are open late as fuck on the weekends so you can sop up all that alcohol you just drank. Although the burritos are their main advertising point I would say they are about on par with chipotle.

If you go on Sunday or Tuesday the beef tacos are on sale and you can get three for under 4 dollars, which is what I go there for. The hot sauce is really, really good so make sure you get some extra.
