The food is as good as any other chipotle. The problem with this location is the service. Absolutely horrid. I frequent this location because of its proximity to ASU, and the service is painfully slow no matter how long the line is. The employees have zero sense of urgency and move at a snail-like pace. I've been to many other locations and they all seem to handle long lines relatively quickly; not this one.
