I decided to come here because of all the fabulous reviews that I read on yelp.

It was okay...that's about it. The chips and salsa were really good...the salsas were actually good and the red one was actually spicy and not like a tomato/ketchup salsa like most places...

I ordered a ceviche de camaron tostada....and that was really good!

I Tried a fish taco...which I was surprised to see that it was more like a quesadilla de maiz with pieces of like shredded fish...I was expecting to see a fried fish taco but I guess that was my fault for not making sure it was what i wanted.

My boyfriend doesn't like marisco so he ordered the carne asada tacos...umm, ya that  wasn't really tasty at all. The tortillas were cold and the meat was over seasoned...

I would probably come here again for the ceviche but have no desire to try anything else on the menu.
