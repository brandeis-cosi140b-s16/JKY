We have come here a few times now.  We find that for the price it is better than KFC across the lot.  The service was good, as it usually is.  We came in the early afternoon so there was not a busy rush going on.  The dinning room was messy.  The dinning room is almost always messy.  Garbages can use changing and several tables needed to be wiped off.  It seems that the chicken was kind of dry also.  At least the chicken breast I had was.  My wife said the leg and thigh she had was very tasty.  The rice, beans, and mashed taters we good.  This was one of the times that the salsa bar looked half decent as well.   Usually it is disoriented.  The avocado salsa is good stuff.  To stop here for a better food option of real grilled chicken opposed to deep fried chicken.
