This is a good spot if you are craving Mexican food, but are in a hurry. When we first moved to town we ate half of our meals here. Café Rio was new to me as I'd never had one in other cities I'd lived in. 

The food is pretty good for fast food. Mt favorite meats are Pork Barbacoa or Chile Roasted Beef. I like that they have a wide variety of meat options. All of the meats seem to be well prepared and flavorful. All of their food options come in huge portions that are reasonably priced for the portion size. The tortillas are made fresh in front of you which is cool. You can taste that they are fresh too. The drink options are really unique. My favorite is the Mint Limeade. They also offer specials each day to keep the menu unique.

Café Rio has a punch card to get a free item after 10 purchases and sometimes they put coupons in the mail for BOGO which is cool. That isn't something you'll get from their competitors.

This location gets crazy busy on weekends and at dinner time. Sometimes it takes 20+ minutes to get through the line even when the line isn't that long. If you get something quick and the five people in front of you have an item that takes longer you'll get stuck waiting. One night the people in front of me were very particular and my quesadilla sat while they asked for ten different sauces. Maybe I'd recommend pulling someone with one hot item to the front if others are going to be awhile. It wasn't even the wait that really bothered me, but watching my food get cold while waiting was annoying.
