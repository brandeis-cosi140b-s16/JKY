Taco joint in a strip shopping center. Food is good and cheap. They actually have two menus: the one for the non-Hispanics and the real one. The English menu has all the stuff you'd expect. The real one has authentic down-home food (brush up on your Spanish, folks).

I suspect they do more business from the Hispanic community than from suburban-types like us. I've watched my share of soap operas I didn't understand while eating dinner. Great jukebox (occasionally there's a sing-along). Not unusual to be the only English-speaker in the place.

While they have a bar, I'd still call the place family-friendly. Heck, half the time the waitresses kids are playing at a back table.

Downside is they "renovated" a few months back and the place lost some of it's "hole in the wall" charm (which may be a good thing- the jury is still out).

Friendly, helpful staff (if a little language-challenged). Running joke is "I know what I ordered, but I wonder what I'll get?" We've never felt unwelcome or had what I'd call a bad experience.

Just simple Mexican fare. Decent quality. Good prices.
