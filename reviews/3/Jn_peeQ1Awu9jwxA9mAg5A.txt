I love Robertos. Been eating at several locations for a long time. I gave this location 3 stars based on service.  I live down and street and order here all the time on my way home from work. And everytime I call I get asked "Do you know where we're located?"   I say yes I order here alot. And they still contine to ask me "ok, where are we?" I wouldn't be ordering if I didnt know where you were located. Its just annoying to answer that question every time. Otherwise, the place is decent for a quick bite.
