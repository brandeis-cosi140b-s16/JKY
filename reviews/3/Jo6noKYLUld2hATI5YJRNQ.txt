Rice was bland, the salsa boring (their table salsa) refrieds were okay. I would give actually 2.5 stars overall. Service was good. Environment slightly leans more "TACO STAND" it would be a toss of a coin as to my return. Victor was great! Ordered ranchero tacos was suppose to be strips but was small cubes of meat very tough and chewy. Brought the one described - was tender but oily and lacked taste.
