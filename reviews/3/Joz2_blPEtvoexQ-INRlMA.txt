The food was excellent, the price was awesome and it was delivered hot in 30 minutes! Their chili was great and their fries were tasty.  The chicken tenders were overcooked and tough, but for reasonable delivery that isn't the usual pizza or chinese I would recommend them to everyone.  They have a wonderfully diverse menu.  I will be ordering from them again.
