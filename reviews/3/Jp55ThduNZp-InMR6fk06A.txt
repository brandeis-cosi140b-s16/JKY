Chronic Tacos is like Chipotle but with far more choices including seafood.  They offer a wide variety of filling and sauce options.  I like the grilled shrimp burrito.  They also have a small bar area with decent beer prices as well as a patio were you can escape from the somewhat chaotic main dining area.
