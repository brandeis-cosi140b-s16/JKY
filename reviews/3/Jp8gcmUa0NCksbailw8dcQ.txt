Stopped in here for a quick bite for lunch with a co worker.

I had their daily special of two tostadas which comes with a side of beans and rice. The tostadas were huge! It was nice light meal that filled me up just right. I also tried their pineapple soda since their fountain wasn't working. It was interesting but too sweet for my taste.

Not bad for a fast food place.
