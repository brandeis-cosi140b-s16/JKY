Stupid singing rat :) ...the entire reason I ever tried Pepe's Tacos was because the stupid jingle is so darn cute.  What is it about a singing bobblehead rat that makes me crave tacos at 2 am??!  It's like this Pavlovian thing with me...

Anyway, Pepe's is okay in my book.  It definitely fulfills my late-night Mexican food cravings more than, oh, say, NASTY Roberto's Tacos does (see inflammatory review).  I usually get pastor for my meat choice.  It's a little chewy but pretty flavorful.  I'm not so keen on the beans, but whatever.  It's a pile of beans.  It is what it is.

I haven't ever come away from Pepe's feeling like I had the meal of my life, but I also don't feel like I've had scary mystery meat either.  It's decent.  The rat is cute.  Trust me, his little bobblehead is engaging in some pretty powerful hypnosis...if you stare too long, I bet you'll end up at Pepe's too!
