The tamales are good. We tried spicy pork green chile, green chile & cheese, beef, and spinach. Spinach was the worst - hardly any filling. Spicy pork is seriously spicy. Beef was the best flavor and most generous with the filling.

Apparently the sizes have increased, but they're still pretty small - about half the size of the tamales I can get from my friends' nanas around Christmas!

Prices are a little high (~$2.50/tamale, no sides or drink included), but pretty good if you have a groupon.

There is a small counter with 3 stools inside the restaurant, so it's definitely a takeout type of place.
