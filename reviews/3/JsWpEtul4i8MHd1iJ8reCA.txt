Wanted to find a place to buy tortillas since I moved here. When I seen this place off of Grand, I had to stop here and try it out! I bought two dozens of flour and corn tortillas, one pork, one cheese tamale, and a bag of tortilla chips! The only item I was impressed with was their chips??? Their corn tortillas was OK, nothing special! Tends to break apart while trying to eat it. Flour tortilla had no flavor, just pain piece of bread. Tamale was OK. I could name four restaurant you can get a better tamale at. So, I was happy with my chips anyway! great flavor, not to much salt. Being from SoCal, their were plenty of tortilla shops better then here, hopefully I can find another place to try?
