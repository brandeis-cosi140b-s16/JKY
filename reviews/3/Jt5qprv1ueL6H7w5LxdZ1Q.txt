This was my second stop on my first tour of Tempe. I came here after I had visited Fat Tuesday around 10 p.m on a Friday night.

I really liked the setup of this place. Plenty of space to move around despite the large crowd, and there's a nice seating area in the back and on the side. All of the tables were taken unfortunately, but that was expected since there was a lot of people that night (this past Friday).

The music wasn't too loud so you could have a decent conversation. I showed up here a bit early, so there wasn't a whole lot of dancing (interesting that the dance floor was semi-roped off in the middle of the bar) but the music was putting me in the mood to get on the floor.

I didn't stay too long because when I asked what drink the bartender recommended she made me a margarita which was way too strong for me to down, and the cost made me think I needed to come back here during happy hour and not afterwards ($7.50). I drank about half and called it quits. Almost tasted like straight up tequila.

I'll definitely come back again during happy hour to see what else they have on the menu, both food an alcohol wise. Hopefully they won't make it as strong as the first time around.
