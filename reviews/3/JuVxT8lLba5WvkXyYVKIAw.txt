I remember this place being better when I was a kid. I will say I was impressed that they still had my picture on the wall from when we were sponsored by them in sports. I was not impressed by the food though. I remember loving to go here for the tamales, but they were average at best when we were here last Wednesday. The salsa was okay. The beans and rice were okay. Even the corona was just okay. Pretty disappointed but now I know what I'm getting. It's more of a place to have a drink and eat Mexican bar food; it seems hit or miss now.
