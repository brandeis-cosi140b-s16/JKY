Great Service.  You can tell they really take pride in their establishment
BUT...the food is not something i would recommend given the other options in the area. 
I would likely go back for happy hour only, and stick to the cheese crisp and ghost chili salsa(both good).  Beer is cold.
For really good mexican food i am sticking with Si Senior, El Charro and Elmers Tacos.
