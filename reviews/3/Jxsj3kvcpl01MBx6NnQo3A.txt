What we ordered:

- 1 fried avocado taco, 2 chicken tacos 

- chips and salsa

What we thought:
 
First, we didn't realize that the tacos came with default flour tortillas until too late.  We prefer corn and naively assumed that all tacos are served on corn tortillas.  I don't know why I assumed this.  Maybe because I've been eating tacos all my life and I've never been served a taco on a flour tortilla except at taco bell?  Nah, couldn't be that.  

They came really done up:  tomatos, sour cream, cheese, cabbage, carrots.  Very fancy.  Also very big.  I'm sure two would be enough for dinner.  We each ate one.  She said the fried avocado was gross, and that it was a great way to ruin avocado.  I thought the chicken sucked.  It was just boiled white meat.  Aren't you supposed to grill it a bit, or something?  

We would skip these if we came back and try something else.  

Also, tacos came with beans and rice.  They did this up a bit too, so the rice had like spices and veggies in it.  She didn't think it was an improvement on rice.  I liked it.  The beans had an off flavor, and were dry and too thick.  Looked like a lump off poo, to be honest.  And I don't like that kind of thing.

Chips and Salsa

Warning:  THEY CHARGE FOR CHIPS AND SALSA.  The nerve!  honestly.
