Well it's better than most of the fast mexican places I have been to but its nothing special.  My veggie burrito was huge and came with guacomole (ps. this is big deal considering most places charge up to $2 extra) but everything just tasted blah not very exciting. The black beans weren't cooked through.  A plus though the place was clean and service was friendly.
