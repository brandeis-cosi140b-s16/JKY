I fell in love with the Frank & Fina's on Charleston and Decatur and would go frequently then all of a sudden the building was gone!!  I was so excited to stumble upon this location!!  Well I wasn't so pleased but the food was ok..  The salsa pretty average!  I know to many better places to return here.
