Had expected good food from here. I've eaten at barrio cafe many times.  Food wasn't bad, my wife liked the egg dish she got.  I ordered the al pastor quesadilla.  The pork had good flavor but there was so much gristle I ended up pulling all the meat out and eating it as a cheese quesadilla.  Salsa was really good.  Server was great (Carlos). Although it took a really long time to get our food.  I'll come back to give it another try but if I wasn't a fan of barrio cafe then I probably wouldn't.
