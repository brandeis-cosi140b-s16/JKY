Food is better some days than others, Seems more fresh. My favorite entree is the  Aguachiles, yummy! Prices are pretty much as other Mexican seafood restaurants. But the servers/waitresses should smile more often as they currently walk around looking unhappy! LOL no really, the food is good, service not so much.
