I can't believe this place closed. They had fantastic service and a delicious chocolate mousse! My husband and I came here one night because I was being picky and couldn't decide what I wanted to eat. The night was already pretty terrible and not even the lively atmosphere of this place could cheer me up. We sat on the patio, which was deserted. (The real party was going on inside.) Honestly, I can't even remember what I ordered, since I was in a terrible mood, but after much indecision, I ordered a dish with shrimp in it. It was way too spicy for me and I was really upset about this but stubbornly wouldn't switch dinners with my husband. The waiter noticed I wasn't enjoying my meal and offered to make me something else. This was really nice of him and really appreciated. The night got better when I ordered dessert. They had this delicious triple chocolate mousse. It had dark, milk, and white chocolate in a martini cup. Super delicious!
