I had a girlfriend visiting this weekend, and we had lunch here yesterday.  I hesitated based on my first visit, but I did want to give Cafe Carumba a second chance.

It was really slow to get our drink order taken, but the restaurant was pretty busy.  Since I was with my bud, I didn't mind.  Our server was super friendly when he got to us as well.  We split the club sandwich and sweet potato fries.  The sandwich was really tasty and the fries tasted like little french toast sticks when dipping in the maple sauce.  

I was set to raise my rating to four stars when it sort of fell apart.  Our server did check on us once shortly after bringing our meal, but that was the end.  We finished our meals and were long out of beverages, but never saw him again.  After about 15 minutes, another server noticed our table and graciously took our plates.  He offered to have our check sent over as well which he did.  Our bill arrived, we left the credit card out, and it was picked up.  But another 10 minutes or so pass and our original server comes by and asks if we're ready to have him pick up the payment!  What?  We explain he already took it to cash us out.  Finally, he comes back with the credit card receipt for our signature.  Busy or not, this was not a pleasant way to end our meal.  I have noticed on occasion that tables for two sometimes receiver poorer service (smaller bill = smaller tip).  Perhaps that is the case here.

I'll stick with my original 3 stars.  While I may come back again sometime, it's not at the top of my list.
