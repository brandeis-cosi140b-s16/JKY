Great food experience with just a few service bumps.

Came here for a quick lunch w/ 5 guys and 4 of us ordered the Tres Tacos Especial. At $11 it offered great value for a choice of 3 impressive sounding tacos and 1 side (Street corn for me). 

While not a huge deal, a few bumps in the service lead me to drop the 4th star and give a 3. A mix up of 2 taco orders occurred (but was rectified in a timely manner). It wasn't until I began eating my tacos that I realized that mine was mixed up too (I should have caught it earlier, nevertheless, all the tacos were great). 

Considering the simplicity of what we ordered I thought it would have been nice if the server just automatically split our bill. Whatever...she didn't, but when the bill came all 4 taco especials came up as $12. I know $4 isn't much to complain about...but it says $11 on the menu. I mentioned it to the server and (in a friendly manner) she returned with a new bill. But all she did was give a discount to rectify the discrepancy...but the discount was only for $3...still charging that extra $1 for the 4th meal. Again...the money is not the issue, just the principle.

Other than that...a great place to grab some food!
