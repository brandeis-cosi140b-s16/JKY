First time in today.  When we walked in we were greeted and started looking at the menu.  After a minute or two I explained to the girl we had never been there before.  Normally this would be a chance for someone to really explain the menu or maybe recommend something.  Talk it up a little. That didn't happen.  After another couple minutes I asked her what she would recommend.  We got a really short answer, carne asada is good and bean and cheese burrito is good.  I was hoping for a little more.  Anyway, we ordered and got our food fairly fast.   I don't have any issues with the food.  It tasted good.  The complaint I have is on the price.  It was 8 bucks for a burrito and I really didn't feel like it was enough food for that price.  Anything else costs you extra.  On top of that a can of soda is 1.50.  A bottle of soda is $3.  Really?  I understand a company has to make a profit but I will stick to water for that price.  Not sure if I would go back.  I think there are places with just as good food, where you get more for less money.  The food tasted good and if it was less price it would would be worth it.
