This is THE place to go for a spectacular view overlooking Las Vegas. The food is award winning, I know cause I've read about it and seen the awards. I've dined at the one on Desert Inn and I think the one off Sunset is the same owners, but for some reason I am not a huge fan of Lindo Michoacon. The food just doesn't do it for me, and I try to keep an open mind. I guess it's just a different style or recipe? Where is the zip, and gusto? No taste of onions, cilantro, salsa is nearly non existant. I had a chicken chimicanga and the chicken inside was all red and diced up. No other flavors or fillers, kind of bland and no zip. Why? Porque???? 
Even the chips and salsa wasn't right to me. The red dipping sauce is just plain, the chips are different and the beans are a nice touch, but it had a off taste to it and I LOVE Mexican beans. We had regular margaritas on the rocks, but even that was just average. Put a good amount of salt on the rim, shake the ingredients to a froth! The sour mix was almost grocery store quality. The margarita is the flagship drink, why not make it with some flare?! To me I go for the nice view of the city that is offered in a surprising location in Henderson. The service is very good and that is a plus too. I like it, but the food isnt' my style.
