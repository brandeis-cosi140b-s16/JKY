Saw this place on diners, drive-in, & dives and been meaning to try it out. I got the 4 taco combo and 2 sides. Decided to go for the pastor, shanghai, texano, and camarones with black beans and chips & salsa. I was a little disappointed with the shanghai taco. The meat had a smoky flavor that made it taste as if it was burnt. Other tacos weren't bad, but also not super memorable. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back to this place.
