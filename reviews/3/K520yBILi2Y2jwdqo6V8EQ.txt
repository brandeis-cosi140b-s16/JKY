This place is pretty cool. The inside is pretty dark feeling. At night it can be somewhat difficult to navigate your way through or even read your menu. The best part is outside! Outside on the patio they have a pretty "stream/mote" whatever you want to call it, with the misters a great combo. The menus are on newspaper that looks like its out of a western which is cute.

My favorite dish is the chicken fried steak, it's delicious! As far as an appetizer the skewers are good with mean and veggies. My favorite, and most unhealthy, green chili mac and cheese. Yum! 

I have been 3 times and each time service has been slow. That and the inside being dark are my only complaints. 

Other than that this is a great place for happy hour or to grab some dinner with friends/family. One out of the three was a date and I wasn't impressed for a first date.
