This Rubios is a lunch-time favorite of mine.  I am always impressed at their friendly service, accuracy, cleanliness, and the good hot food served promptly!

I have become a real fan of their chicken tacos and would highly reccomend this place for a nice lunch or dinner.

Their salsa is really tasty too!
