Small albondigas? One meatball for you. Large albondigas? Two meatballs.

Friendly service, simple food, lots of grease. And don't take the grease comment as a dig: if everything you're eating has been piled high with queso or deep-fried, a little complimentary lip gloss should be expected. That might have provided too much of a mental image, please forgive me.

Tip: Bring cash. But you won't need much, the fare is pretty inexpensive.

There are velvet bullfighter paintings on the walls, which is awesome. And the stinginess with the meatballs? It just keeps me wanting more.
