I have seen a lot of these chains since I moved here and was hoping that I found my go to place for mexican food. 

I ordered a carna asada burrito and the meat was decent quality but way too much salt in on it. 

Maybe I got a bad batch but first impressions make a lasting impression. 

Might give it another go when I craving mexican and dont want to drive far.
