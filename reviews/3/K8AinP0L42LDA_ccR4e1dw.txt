High end mall food? El Segundo Sol is a nice place but it's comparatively priced to restaurants within the casinos that have GREAT food. Given the choice, I'd opt for something else but it is conveniently located. 

This is Vegas so pricing is going to be a little skewed. $19.95 for jumbo shrimp fajitas. ouch. It's a big platter with great presentation. The shrimp fajitas were light and hit the spot. The shrimp were a little too salty. The guac was great, wish they gave a bit more though. The cilantro rice was a little hard but tasty. Loved the lightly salted grilled corn. Overall, I enjoyed my entree and it was just the right amount of food. 

The service was just ok. We waited an abnormally long time to have our order taken and the place was not busy. Otherwise, she was very nice. 

The take-away:
The fajitas were good. The prices are a little steep. You won't have a bad experience here but it won't blow you away.
