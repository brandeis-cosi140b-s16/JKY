I was sold on the reviews from fellow Yelpers that this would fulfill my need to see New Mexico-style cuisine somewhere in the vicinity of its native environment. The menu did that kitschy-kootchy faux old-time newspaper sort of look, which wasn't necessarily entirely user-friendly, but was serviceable, and the indoor water feature wasn't necessarily all that great either, but the waiter was charming, and the selections on the menu seemed interesting. The food was decent; my salmon wasn't exceptional, the salsa was a little more watery than I like, and if everything overall was not exactly as hot or as spicy as I was hoping, it wasn't bad. Basically, it's a step up from Chili's and the like, if still something short of a genuine Mexican food experience.
