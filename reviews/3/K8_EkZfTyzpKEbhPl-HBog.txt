The food is wonderful if you know what you like. I always try something different when we go and have never been disappointed, even the hamburgers are enjoyable.

 Unfortunately the service is a crap shoot. Sometimes we will go and the servers are attentive and active; they make you feel almost like family. But others, usually when we end up in the lounge, can have large breaks where the server does not even appear in the room. I have witnessed times when the only server is the bartender who focuses on flirting with a few customers and leave the rest of the customers unattended for prolonged periods. Other times my table has waited close to 15 minutes for a refill.

If you go, try to avoid the bar. Either way the food is pretty darn good.
