I was pretty hopeful about this place but was a little disappointed. It was good but not great. It was a good place to take my parent but I won't come back. 

Dislikes: The dishes are not very creative. Lots of meat and no veggies. Food was too rich, no light options on menu. Salsa was plain. Salmon was a bit fishy

Likes: the sangria was fizzy which was fun, elote corn was very tasty, beans and rice were tasty and well seasoned
