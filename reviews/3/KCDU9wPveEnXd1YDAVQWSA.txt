There's a taqueria counter inside for your taco and nachos fix, but steer clear of their produce- it looks like it's seen better days. There is a massive selection of herbs and spices, and a decent seafood/butcher counter, with pre-marinaded ceviches, asadas, and fajita meats. Huge seasoning selection, as well as fresh mexican cheeses.

Pricing is mostly on the low to reasonable end, with the taqueria counter being the best bargain: the lengua and chicken didn't impress, but the carnitas and asada are good quality. Menudo is available on weekends, breakfast burritos for $3, and the nachos are enough to feed a family for only $5. Counts against them that their "fresh" guac is brown, though.
