Boy were we glad to see a Chipotle sign while walking down the strip of Vegas. Walked across the street and noticed that it was located in this ghetto little food court along with a pizza place and panda express.. oh and Micky D's right up stairs. I had the burrito bowl which was delicious. Prices are about the same as back at home so I wasn't throwing any fits about it. Fairly close to where I was staying and you betcha butt we came back a few more times to the food court.
