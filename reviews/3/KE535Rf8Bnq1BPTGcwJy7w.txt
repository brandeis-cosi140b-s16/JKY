We found the food to be adequate but not exciting. I did like that the chile Relleno had no breading. It was light and yummy. But there are a few kinks to work out. The server seemed afraid of us and that was tiring. We could hear the chef calling orders in the back and there was no need to be that loud. We heard chef and server have an argument over what we ordered.
