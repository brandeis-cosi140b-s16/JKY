I usually pass over this restaurant in favor of the Qdoba on Sixth. 

Nothing special and also the restaurant is very narrow and you have to squeeze pass people entering the restaurant to get to the fountain drink machine.  This Qdoba is poorly laid out and I never feel completely comfortable eating here. 

I often wonder if because of my size I get served less food. My tacos are always filled with the tiniest bit of filling at this Qdoba. Yes I may be a small person but I am paying the same price as the next person. So it does annoy me when I'm served less and this happens all the time here. 

I cannot get full eating even 3 tacos at this Qdoba, it's not a good value for my money.
