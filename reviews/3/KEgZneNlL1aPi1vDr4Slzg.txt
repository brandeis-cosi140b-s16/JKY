I have been going to Filiberto's for twenty years, and love the food, but this location seems a bit sub-par. I opened the door and was enveloped by a fog of dope smoke. I sat down and started in on my burrito, which I discovered was not bad, but not Filiberto's good. Strangely, the longer I was there the better the burrito tasted.
