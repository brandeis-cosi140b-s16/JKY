This review is for food only; this place is really only worth it for happy hour. 

Their regular food is way overpriced for Mexican food. Granted it is Vegas and it is in a hotel but seriously the ingredients cannot cost that much. The service was average.

$5 for select appetizers. We got the mango habanero buffalo wings, nachos and the quesadilla. The wings were good but more on the sour side. The nachos were actually pretty good because they have the thicker chips which don't get soggy nearly as quickly. The quesadillas were unimpressive so I don't recommend those.
