We ordered tortilla soup. Not very authentic but good. We ordered guacamole. It was made table side and decent. We ordered a plain bean and cheese burrito for a kid. It was retried canned beans with a little cheese. That was acceptable but what wasn't was the 15.95 that they charges for it. Yikes. Highway robbery.
