This spot is kinda hidden in the back of a shopping center with a 7-11 and the Lucky's Lounge. It's pretty much exactly like Roberto's with a different name. I think they might even use some of the same pictures on their menu. Ok, I'm kidding...but they are close! 

The food here is ok and they have a pretty good selection. I had a California burrito and my wife had a chicken burrito. They have really good tortillas and both meats were decent, not overcooked, tender, and had good flavor. I liked their salsa bar too, their green sauce is really tasty. They are fairly cheap but a little pricy for add-ons...my wife wanted sour cream and they up charged her $0.95. We also had chips but the store bought, runny guacamole kinda ruined them for me.

With Leticia's just down the street and a Roberto's not far either, I wouldn't pick Algobertos as my first stop. But they have good prices, the place is spotless and the food was decent enough to come back, especially on days they have specials!
