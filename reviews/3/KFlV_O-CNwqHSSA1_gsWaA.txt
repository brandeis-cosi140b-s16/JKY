Neanderthal roided-out meatheads wearing all-black Famous Stars and Stripes clothing and the Westside tanned bleached blonds who love them can rejoice now that there's a Salty Senorita in Arrowhead.  Imagine to not have to drive your raised red Dodge half ton truck clear across town to Scottsdale to get to your nearest chain Mexican faux-beach bar!  

I met my Westside ladies here last week to watch the NBA final Lakers game and marveled at how different it looks and a decent time was had.  

A quick look around and you'll see some of the changes they made to the old Monastery. The kitchen is now where the bar was, the bar is now in an indoor/outdoor addition to the east and the former self serve BBQ (which was a hallmark of the old Monastery) is gone.  One of the sand volleyball courts was paved over with a huge elevated wooden patio deck, but one volleyball court remains.

The cheap happy hour margaritas were decent.  We sat at the bar to watch the game and the service was OK...pretty aloof and vacant and first, but got better as the evening went on.  The mini burgers and fries were forgettable but edible - the nachos however, were soggy and drenched in Monterey jack cheese and onions. Not enough beans or pork...guacamole or tomatoes would have been nice.  Stay away from those.

If you can order something better than I did, get past the crowd and your fondness for the former Monastery that was here for a few years, then you might have a good time here.
