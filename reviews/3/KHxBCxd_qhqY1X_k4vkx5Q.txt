Pretty much the same as every other Chipotle which is pretty decent quality food at moderate prices. Not particularly large standard burritos but enough for an average person for lunch.

Visiting from Seattle, I don't know about the local availability of more authentic Mexican fare, but everywhere else I have been have had much better and cheaper taco trucks and restaurants.
