Service is BEYOND shitty, I've had my order messed up on more than one occasion (fortunately it's always been stuff I'll eat). That said, the Al Pastor tacos are ON POINT! The carne asada isn't bad either, and that is my sole reason for returning to this place. The other location(s) don't seem to suffer from the lousy customer service though.
