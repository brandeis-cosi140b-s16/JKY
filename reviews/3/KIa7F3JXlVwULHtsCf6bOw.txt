After seeing a huge sign on their building stating $0.99 tacos and drafts on Tuesdays and Thursdays I knew I had to check it out. Three awesome things... cheap prices, Mexican food and beer!

We arrived right before the Pirates game and the place was pretty dead. We decided to sit at the bar and the bartender/server gave us the remote to put the game on. Cool! Obviously we wanted to get right to drinking. I noticed there was probably about ten different drafts available. I decided to get a Blue Moon but figured I'd check first to make sure that BM was included in the deal. It wasn't. Only Bud Light, Coors and YL. Still a decent selection, but if I didn't ask I would have been upset at my bill at the end of the night. The beer itself was okay. It wasn't super cold and they serve it in a glass that's clearly not meant for beer. It's probably big enough to fill just a little more than a regular 12 oz. can of beer. They're $0.99, though. Can't really complain.

The tacos were decent. They are hard shells (no soft shells with the special) with an average amount of meat, lettuce, tomato and cheeses. The meat was better than I expected as I thought it was going to taste like fake Taco Bell filler considering they were $0.99. They also filled up our chip basket twice and the salsa is very yummy!

Service is so so. The server was away from the bar probably half of the night. The drink specials only last till 9, so my boyfriend was waiting for her to come over to get him a new one. Time kept ticking and she was nowhere to be found. At 8:57 she comes over and says the "special is over." No, it's not. We showed her our phones and she agreed to give him two more beers. 

I think the place is worth trying, especially considering how cheap their specials are. However, nothing screamed at me to want to return.
