La Hacienda is one of four restaurants located in the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Resort. Here are some comments:

Pros: convenient location for those staying at the resort, lots of seating, friendly staff, fast service

So-so: quality of food (since this "Mexican" restaurant is located in a resort, expect "Americanized" food that won't be overly flavourful or spicy)

Cons: the pricing is absolutely absurd for the quality and quantity received. I understand that the resort will charge a premium, a few examples of the rip off pricing are as follows from their dinner menu (http://www.scottsdaleprincess.com/var/cdev_base/storage/original/application/f48c77ba109d108991e0ec6df188a527.pdf):

Appetizer Tacos de Langosta/Carnitas priced at $19 and $14 respectively - for this price you get 3 soft "tacos" that are no more than 3.5" in diameter

Guacamole ranges from $14-$20 depending on which one you order.

Sopa de Elote priced at $10 - for this price you get a most, 1 "cup" (250mL) of soup

Filet a la Parilla priced at $36 - for this price you get a piece of meat that's about the size of 3 golf balls

Additional refried beans or rice are priced at $6 each, and extra tortillas will set you back an additional $4.

I found the "Spilt Entree Charge" at $5 to be extremely preposterous. This isn't a "fine dining" restaurant and this $5 charge is just another example of price gouging at this resort (other examples include paying $4 for a double espresso at the hotel gift shop, when street pricing is about $2.25, and $18 for a tube of sunscreen that anywhere else would be under $10).

I can't say I can recommend this restaurant since the cost isn't inline with what you get on your plate. The food isn't authentic Mexican cuisine and you'll leave with a lot less in your wallet.
