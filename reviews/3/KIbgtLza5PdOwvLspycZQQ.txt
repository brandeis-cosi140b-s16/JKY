this review is for happy hour. ooh, i like that the happy hour was available throughout the restaurant (some places just offer it in the bar). heres what i think of the appetizers we had:

shrimp tostada bites - okay good
spinach quesadilla - okay good
catfish tacos - okay
dumplings - good plus
cornbread - excellent

also tried a couple drinks - margaritas. this place is good for the drinks! also noticed that shortly after happy hour ended, the place emptied quite a bit. so it seems like a lot of ppl come here for happy hour. then again it was a weekday.. our friend, a local, did mention it gets pretty busy on friday nights..

last thought: decor kinda reminded me of a southwestern cheesecake factory.. go figure.
