I feel like a broken record when reviewing restaurants on the strip in Vegas, but La Salsa is no different, it was way too expensive for the food we got, however food we got was pretty good!  

We went with the pricey Patron margs (at $13/ea). They were tasty, but really just like any other margarita on the rocks you have every had!  We also started with their fresh made guacamole (they don't do it at the table, but instead make new batches every 3 hours). The guac comes with two salsas and a big basket of chips.  I loved the smokey chipotle salsa and the guac was chunky and tasty. The chips could have used some salt! 

For dinner I had the Green Chile Chicken Burrito (with a side of black beans and rice).  It was excellent.  The burrito itself was stuffed with grilled chicken, whole roasted green chiles and a nice red sauce.  It was crisped up on the fry top and served cut in half (made for easy eating).  

The restaurant itself was kind of forgettable as far as look and feel.  Honestly, while in there I told my husband it reminded me of a Margaritaville in an airport!  Huge bar, a few tables.  Also good to now that while it is in the Forum Shops, it is way down on level 1 all the way at the street (kind off to the side) as you are going out towards Joes (it looks like you are leaving and then there it is!). 

Service was attentive and the food was good.  The price was just too steep.  I mean guac, 2 burritos and a 4 margs was like $93!!!! I think it worth 1/2 that, so low marks for inflated prices!
