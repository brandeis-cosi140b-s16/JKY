Considering that the restaurant is kind of hidden I was shocked when I came here on a Wednesday night and saw that the place was so packed!

Everyone I was with LOVED the food. To me it was good, but I agree with some of the comments I read below, there is so much cheese in everything and it feels so unhealthy when eating it. 

The portions are so huge!! One dish can feed at least 3 people, it's ridiculous!

Nice staff, pretty decor, and the drinks are strong --- I would come here again, probably just for drinks though :)
