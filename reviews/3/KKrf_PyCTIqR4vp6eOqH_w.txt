I had lunch with coworkers here on a Thursday. I ordered the grilled veggie burrito. It had flavor and was filling, but it seemed a little expensive (more expensive than Chipotle), and in hindsight, I probably should have gotten a salad. The place was busy but not crowded. Service was quick, accurate, and friendly. The tables and salsa bar were clean and organized. It's not hard to find and parking is easy. They specialize in fish tacos, so that's probably the best bet for fish-eaters. Rubio's tries to market itself or seems to have a reputation as a somewhat healthy option, but that of course depends on what you order. My grilled veggie burrito had 770 calories according to their website's nutrition facts. Not terrible, but I also had some chips and salsa (they came with it free!), so not something I'm going to do everyday. I considered giving it four stars, but it seemed a little expensive, and it wasn't the best food I've ever had. Portions were big, but overall I think I prefer Chipotle.
