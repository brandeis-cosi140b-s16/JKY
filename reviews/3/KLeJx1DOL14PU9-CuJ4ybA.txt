My husband loves sitting on the patio. I love that the chips come with not only tomato salsa, but also chopped Pico de Gallo.
This is an old standby for us, as it's close by and they have a good health score. At times they have people going around with carts, making items at your table. I love it when they have the fresh guacamole: they know how to spice it perfectly and you can get it with additional fresh garlic or hot peppers if you like. It's served in the volcanic pestle bowl they make it in. The other cart they have sometimes is fresh citrus margaritas, where they squeeze the limes at your table.
Portions here are huge, so we always have enough to take home. I love the fajita salad. My husband usually has the Texcana Fajitas, which has a mixture of beef, chicken and shrimp with onions and peppers. It comes with tortillas, refried beans, yellow rice, sour cream and guacamole. The other meal I really enjoy is the Steak Rey, which has a glorious cactus salad as part of the plate. (I wish some of these places would have black beans instead of the refried.)
I usually come for supper when I have plenty of time to socialize, so I can enjoy taking my time then. If I am going to pay for a meal, I want to allow myself time to savor each bite. This probably isn't a good place if you need to eat and run.
And if you really want to embarrass someone, bring them here for their birthday. They will put a huge sombrero on their head and sing to them with a guitar :)
