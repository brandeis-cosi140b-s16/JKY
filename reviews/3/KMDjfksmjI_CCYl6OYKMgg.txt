It was good but not great especially given the prices,  I had the carnetas and I have better for much less then what I was charged here.  The rest of my family thought the food was good but not worth the price charged.  Did not have the margaritas. The guacamole I have to say was among the best I have ever had.  Did not like the salsa.  Service was so-so. Next time I want Mexican I will go elsewhere.
