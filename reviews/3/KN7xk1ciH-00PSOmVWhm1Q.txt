This place could have been four stars, but the service was so God awful. It took several minutes to be acknowledged and seated. It then took about five minutes to be acknowledged by a server and a drink order taken. Five minutes later she comes back with the drinks and takes our order. She brought out salsa with the drinks but no chips. I asked about them and she said they'll be right out. It took about another 15 minutes to get the chips. The chips and salsa were very good, not the best, but well above average. The food followed about another 15-20 minutes after the chips.

I ordered a carne asada burrito enchilada style which was excellent. My daughter got a machaca taco with beans and rice. My daughter didn't like the machaca, which I tried and figured out it was really carne seca. The waitress noticed my daughter didn't like it and I pointed out it was carne seca and not machaca. She apologized and removed it from the bill, which redeemed her some. My daughter ended up having some of my carne asada.

The ambiance is divey and it wasn't very clean, but not unhealthy clean.

I probably wouldn't go back if in the area again, but mostly due to the bad service.
