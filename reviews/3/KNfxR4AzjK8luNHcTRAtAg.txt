If you're a fan of Barrio Cafe, you may be even a bigger fan of Spotted Donkey. Prices are not the friendliest, but the gourmet Mexican food will make your stomach sing Mexican mariachi music. I started with a prickly pear margarita - que buenisimo! Even though you have to pay for chips and salsa, the chips are delicioso and homemade and the 3 salsas that accompany are very tasty. Their "chop" salad was on par with Cowboy Ciao's similar version, and for an entree the pulled pork chalupas were divine. I'll be back soon for more!

UPDATE: As of January '08 the quality has really dived at Spotted Donkey. The owners opened up a new restaurant next door and I think their hearts and minds are there now. We gave them 3 shots before writing this update which brings them from 5 to 3 stars.
