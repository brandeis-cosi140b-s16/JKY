I was a little skeptic of the pink rice but it's actually pretty good. Actually, everything I've ordered has been really tasty. 

I have one complaint and that is the tortilla chips they give with your order. Yes, they are complimentary but you get  5 and they are almost always stale. That being said, if you want chips and salsa or guacamole then walk on over to Qdoba or Chipotle,but if you want enchilladas or a stuffed poblano pepper, Veracruz is your place!
