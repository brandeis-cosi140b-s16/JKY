Came here yesterday for lunch. The food tasted fine, like normal taco bell food, but the place wasn't very clean. It looks run down and the customer service wasn't that great.

I'm still giving it 3 stars because the food was made like normal, but I will definitely find a different taco bell to go to next time.
