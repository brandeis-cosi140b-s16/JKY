The BF and I went here for lunch today because we had a living social deal that was expiring next week, so we needed to eat here pronto. Anyway, I was really looking forward to the 'amazing' carne asada. We ordered at the counter, I got the carne asada burrito, the BF got barbacoa tacos and we got a side of guac. The guac came out with three other salsas and some seemingly home made chips. The chips were good, as was the guac. The red and green salsas were too watery and not very flavorful. The chunky salsa with onion and peppers was very tasty, so I was excited for the meal. Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. I thought both the barbacoa and the carne was bland and too chewy. Both meals were in desperate need of salsa to make them taste like something. Pretty disappointing. The beans and rice were alright, but not enough to go back. 


PS although the people who worked there were nice, the lady at the counter complained to me that they don't make any money with LS deals.... Sorry, but I thought that was unprofessional. No one forced them to participate in the deal.
