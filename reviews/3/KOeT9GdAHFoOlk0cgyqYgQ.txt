Qdoba is a chain of burrito/taco restaurants in Arizona.  
They offer a savings card that allows you to earn points towards free food.   Tuesdays are the best day to go as it is double punch day on the card.  

The Mesa location has been open for a few months and I have to say the staff is very friendly and a few times the girls behind the counters have had me laughing.   I find that always important when I go out to grab a quick bite.

My favorite items there are their lime chips and their chicken quesadillas.  I like the fact they are not afraid to pile on the cheese.  I really like their chicken it's always tender and this is one of the few places where I like their quacamole.
