Service was great; food good! Patio awesome, sangria yea!!! They have recently been voted best in accommodating "large groups" but I may have to disagree on that... They don't even split checks, my biggest con. Especially since we had a party of 16, some ppl didn't even order entrees or drinks. So we split it ourselves.
