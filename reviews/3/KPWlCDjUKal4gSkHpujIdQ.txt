Despite living in LA, I've actually never been to the LA location and only to this one in Vegas. However, because of all the Mexican food I've eaten since being in LA, I'm feeling more and more confident about my ability to judge the cuisine.

For a chain, this place is not half bad. I had the carne asada taco plate with comes with rice and beans. I have to say, I enjoyed the tacos. The meat was flavored well and topped with some nice pico de gallo. The rice and beans were another matter. The beans were downright gross and obviously mushed up canned beans. Blech. No thanks. The rice was also dry and bland. I'd stick to just eating the tacos. 

Another good thing? The drinks. Lots and lots of options and they do have a particularly delicious selection of margaritas. 

The bad thing? The prices. They are ridiculously overpriced for Mexican food. My taco plate was like $13 for three tacos and crap beans and rice. There is barely anything that costs less than that and nothing is that good that it's worth paying more. 

My advice? Drink the beer, drink the margaritas, and maybe have an appetizer but otherwise your money is better spent elsewhere (perhaps on a "Pink Taco" t-shirt that you can giggle at? Ha...)
