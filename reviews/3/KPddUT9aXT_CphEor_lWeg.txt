I wanted to like Vida Vida a lot more than I actually did. I was excited for some great tacos and sadly didn't get great tacos. I got the Philly Cheesesteak and the Chicken tacos and found both to be vastly underseasoned. I gave up eating them before I was finished because I felt so bored with the flavor. 

All was not lost, though. The queso was wonderful and easily among the best I've had. I'll be back for the queso alone, and hopefully the tacos will have a bit more flavor on my next visit.
