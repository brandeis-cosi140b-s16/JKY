Honduran in focus, gargantuan in scope - Morazon has it all and in huge portions.

I mean, friggin' HUGE. Plates like movie props from some Roman Banquet, piled to overflowing teetery, waitresses wrangling the cramped dining space to get it onto your table before things start tumbling down. If you're a meater, these plates are for you - and there are a hundred to choose from. A fav at our table was the Pollo y Plantanos - green plantains piled high with roasted chicken, bone-in, sauced and covered with minced herbs, 14 bucks for more food than you could share between three. 

Veggies are going to have to do some picking and choosing, and will probably come away with a Chile Relleno, or maybe some papusas, and if you're lucky and your espanol es bueno, a Burrito Vegetarian. There's breakfast to be had, plantains both sweet and non, lots of cheesy, beany options, and the papusas aren't bad. But not amazing either.

Which is pretty much the theme - flavors, on the MexiEcuaHonduraCharlotte Scale, were some midway between Azteca's blandness and 3Amigo's sharp - so the salsa was meh, but the sauce on my Relleno, awesome.  

Cheap, quick, and decent. I'll be back.
