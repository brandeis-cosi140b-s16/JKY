Really no change in quality in terms of food, which is still pretty good.

They still have not changed the prices on the menus on their street shrimp tacos.  If the price on the menu says the taco is $1.89 then that should be the price when you get the bill. Instead, the price on my bill was $2.19 for the taco.
