I love Carlos O'Briens.  We've been going here since the 16th St. & Bethany Home location!  When the location closed at Bell and Scottsdale, we were bummed.  Then we heard about the new location at Mayo and 101.  Woo Hoo!

However, the aesthetics in this location are HORRIBLE.  We were seated on the "stage" and it was so loud that we could barely hear each other across the table.  It seemed they were short staffed as the tables took a while to get cleaned and getting more chips was a chore.  

Hopefully they will work out the kinks.
