We went there to try out based on yelp reviews...sorry to say  it just OK for me. My son loves their enchiladas... me and my husband had chow fun and stir fry beef  which is kinda no taste.  Don't get me wrong they give you pretty large portions with super cheap price you can't go wrong with it. But if you ever had tasty food elsewhere this is not going to be please your taste buds.
Really good customer service, super cheap on my $$ deserve 3 stars for me.
And BTW parking plaza was empty when we went there.
