This place is a combo KFC and Taco Bell.  I've eaten both.  The KFC is often a disaster.  The Taco Bell is...well, the same generic crap Taco Bell is known for, but not any worse than other locations.  If you feel like Taco Bell, then this is an OK place to get it in my experience.  Don't do the KFC here though, awful.
