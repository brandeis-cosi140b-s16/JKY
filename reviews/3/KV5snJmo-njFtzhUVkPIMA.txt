Ahh Taco Tuesday - a way to get you in the door and eat inferior tacos. The review for the crunchy tacos here still stands - those were pretty good. I guess there isn't much you can do to make a $1 ground beef taco special, so it was was it was - a flour tortilla lightly grilled with some beef and tomatoes and bagged cheese. The $3 happy hour beer (kiltlifter)  helped wash it down. 
    Grease factor - moderate
Other cheap tacos are available, but not in those "famous" crunchy shells. Those cost $11 each and every day. Part 1 of taco Tuesday exploring.
