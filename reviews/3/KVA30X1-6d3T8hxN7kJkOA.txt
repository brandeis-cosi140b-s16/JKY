Had made plans to meet with a friend to catch up. Thought this place would be good since it's close to where we live. 

The cigarette smoke completely wraps around you here. The smell is so strong we only sat here to eat and left as soon as we could. It was very pungent that just ruins the food. 

The waiter was very attentive and nice. The food was so so nothing amazing that I would go out of my way to get. I got a corona mixed with a margarita it was weak.
