I am a fan of Moe's, and it is slowly replacing Libretto's as my after-work quick stop. However, I think this location is laid out awkwardly. It's long and skinny (heh) and if you come in the wrong door, you have a maze to get through to work your way around to the line entrance. I think switching the end of the line and the cash register would help a lot. I actually have never tried out the magical Coke machine because I have not heard good reviews of the concept- everyone keeps saying that no matter what flavors you pick, the flavors the person in front of you picked linger in the spout. 

Noms At Night Grade: B+. Open til 3 am on Friday and Saturday, but only 9:00 during the week. That balances out to acceptable nighttime hours, especially once you consider what they must go through during the post-club hours on the weekend. Poor things. It was quite entertaining to park myself by a window seat and watch the drunks during Mardi Gras though. I think I'm going to plan to do the same whenever the EpiCentre has another party.
