The food is Good! I love the pink tacos, the sweet corn tamale and the guacamole.  The chips and salsa are great too.  I love the cadilllac margarita...OMG!! Talk about AWESOME!!  The set up is pretty cool...it has a large patio and it opens up the whole restaurant  The decor is fun and the bar is great.  I was staying at the Hard Rock Hotel for a business trip and my co-worker (boss) and I went here everyday!  We had breakfast here too.  They had this awesome yogurt and fruit parfait with fresh coconut  and this fantastic granola.  I wanted to try the breakfast burrito, but we did not have time to do the breakfast again.  The issue I had was the service. They were very understaffed and could not keep up.  I felt bad for the staff because they were so busy, but it was just very slow.  The bar tender was not very nice and acted like she could not help us.  The food was good, but service was definitely lacking!

I will be back because I like it and I love the HRH!!
