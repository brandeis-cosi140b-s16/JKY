I was really excited to try this place but was a little disappointed. The service was kinda slow but the waiter was nice as could be. Tacos had a good flavor but weren't served very hot. Same for the street corn it had great flavor and a unique sauce but was kind of cold when I got it. Salsa was delicious and on the mild side.
