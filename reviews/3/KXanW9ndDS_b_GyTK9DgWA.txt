Hate/love relationship here...

Love - I love the vampiros, especially bean and cheese.  Also, bean and cheese burrito is quite good.  The tortilla is dense and if held separately I would imagine it has some weight to it.  

I like that they have numerous hot sauces to choose from, and the salsa bar has several options.  However, their builder is an idiot because nobody of average height can reach under the (misplaced) viewing glass and actually reach the back salsas.  You have to put your head under there or go around the side.  Stupid.

Hate - it takes a long time to get your food even when they're not busy.  There's also a blond kid that works there who is a smug little (can't use the c-word here, sorry).  Seems to work at close which is when I would like to stop by, but I can't stand this guy.  Man he's such a C.
