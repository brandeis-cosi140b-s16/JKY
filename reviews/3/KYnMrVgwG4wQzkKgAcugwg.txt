The food was decent but the value was great! I don't know why anyone would complain that the food has too much guacamole and sour cream. Which some reviews of this place have done. Most Mexican restaurants charge an arm and a leg for a sample. This place is very generous. The $3 HH margarita was also really big and plenty good for $3 plus it came with a free mini shot of tequila on the side. The service was very friendly and they were so hospitable.This place didn't knock my socks off but for the price and value I thought it was worth the visit.
