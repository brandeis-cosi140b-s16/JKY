So I was going back and forth of whether to give this place three or four stars. I think is deserved 3 and a half actually! 
Well, I had somewhat high expectations. When it's been a while since I've had fast food mexican it always sounds so good in my head and then I get it and think meh that was ok. I'd say my expectations were about met. Was just a tiny bit pricier than anticipated, but not bad! The salsa bar was cool, liked that they had some other stuff besides salsa. I tried the mild, Diablo, and tomatillo salsa. 
I went right after work at 6 pm on a Thursday and there was no line at all, only one family dining in. Was great because I got good fast service. I got a veggie burro combo meal with no sour cream. I always worry getting food to go that I'm going to get home and think no they messed up my order! But everything was how I asked. People working there did a good job.
Food was not the best fast food Mexican, but also not bad. Beans weren't amazing, but I enjoyed the rice. Thought the lettuce on the burrito got kinda hot and nasty as I ate it, but the rest was pretty good. A big burrito too! The meal filled me up for sure.
