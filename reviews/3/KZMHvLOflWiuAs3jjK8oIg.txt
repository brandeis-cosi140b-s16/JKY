Not bad.  Place is bigger than it looks.  Nice patio area.  Long bar.  Good portions on food and the normal menu items for Mexican restaurant.  Also has some signature plates which are pretty good if your feel like stepping out of the box.   Usually busy and in the past, had problems with skeleton staffing, but it has improved.  Their is a sister restaurant in Arizona City turn off which is not that good as far as decor and staffing go.

I know some big local parties that have gone to have big dinners and lunches, and that sucks up alot of the wait staff.  It's a better Mexican restaurant in Casa Grande.
