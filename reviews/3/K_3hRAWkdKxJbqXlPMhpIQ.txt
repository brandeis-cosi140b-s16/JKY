My teammates from my MBA program were looking around at San Felipe option, CPK, or Cadillac Ranch.  We chose San Felipe, and we were quite pleased with our choice.  We were waiting around after we placed our order, and we were thinking we would get complementary chips and salsa like most places.  We later found out it was $3, and we ordered it.  I was a little disappointed that a place would charge for something as simple as chips and salsa.  The salsa was tasty and homemade, but I don't feel intrinsic value as a customer.

On the other hand, my chicken wrap was delicious!
