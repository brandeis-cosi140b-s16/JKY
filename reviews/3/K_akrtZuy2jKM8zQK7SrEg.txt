One of my fave go-to places after a night out on Green St.  Sometimes waiting in line was even more fun than going out - made friends in line, saw people throwing up, passing out, getting in fights.  Never go in the daytime though, the only respectable time to go is when the bars close and you're craving Mexican food.

Two words - SUPER NACHOS.  Steak is the best.  They put a bunch of toppings on there, it's well worth the money to get the super nachos.  YUM.  The best part is the CHEESE - it's this delicious white melty cheese they plop on top.  If it weren't for the cheese, we would never go to La Bamba's.
