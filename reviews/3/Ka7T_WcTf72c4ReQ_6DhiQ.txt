The food here is awesome. Fresh salsa that taste damn good and great vegetables at the condiments area. Very very good food, however the customer service reeks. Not only are they rude, asking an employee for a napkin turned into this awkward 30 second staredown... Other than the customer service this place is always clean and food is prepared quickly. Btw... Re read your order they tend to double charge or add stuff you don't order
