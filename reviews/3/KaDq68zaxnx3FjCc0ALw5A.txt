We ordered three of the $2.30 tacos - fish, carne asada, and adobada and a side of rice.  Food came fast and piping hot.  Carne asada and adobada were topped with guac and salsa, while the fish reminded us of good fish sticks with shredded iceberg and Miracle Whip.  Carne asada was a tad dry but the adobada was full of flavor.  Rice was insanely salty which made us down a huge cup of Horchata.

We ate inside which was pleasant and clean.  They're open 24-hours - a great late night alternative to burgers from other nearby fast food joints.
