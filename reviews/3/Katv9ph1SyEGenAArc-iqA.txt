I've been a long time customer, of cabo's, but feel that its gone down hill as of late. I used to think the food was excellent, but now it just seems to be at the level of okay.

Today I ordered the fish tacos with tortilla soup for lunch. The tacos were boring, just whitefish in a flour tortilla. They had very little seasoning, and could definitely have benefitted from some additional components. The soup has always been a favorite of mine, but today it just seemed kind of haphazardly put together.

The food is not bad, and I'm sure I'll be back, it just seems as time has gone on cabo's has fallen into a certain level of apathy.
