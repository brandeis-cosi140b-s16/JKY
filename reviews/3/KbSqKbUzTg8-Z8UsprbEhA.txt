It was early Sunday afternoon and we were out for an early dinner.  Tony's came up and we decided to stop in.  The place looked like they had had full house, every table was littered with dirty plates.  The staff came and cleaned one for us, and we placed our order.

The food was good, I have certainly had better, but considering it's closer to fast food than gourmet, it wasn't bad.
