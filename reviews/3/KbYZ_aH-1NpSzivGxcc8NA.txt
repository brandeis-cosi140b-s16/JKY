In a few words- a well-priced, convenient alternative to good Mexican food.

First time visiting. Have to echo the interesting/slow service experiences of others.

Food is decently portioned. Although, meat portion in tacos and rolled tacos could be better. Rice and beans (and the meat we had, chicken and shredded beef) are pretty bland... but then again, I get it. It's Gilbert, one of our nation's epicenters of whitebreadedness. 

I won't run back here. I think there's too many other places that are better.
