I read that they were closing another restaurant in TI because they could only have 1 Mexican place.  Se√±or Frog's is about as Mexican as Appleby's.  Don't go here looking for Mexican food - it just ain't.  You can get everything on this food menu at the major chain-in-the-box (Appleby's, Friday's, ect).  Funky and fun but not Mexican.
