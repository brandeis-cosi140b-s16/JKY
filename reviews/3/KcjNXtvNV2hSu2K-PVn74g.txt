The service is always good and the food is good to. Great for a quick meal when out and about, but maybe not a destination when craving authentic mexican cuisine. Would be nice if the kept the salsa bar cleaner or maybe served it as a side because the area has been a real mess a few times and is not at all an appetizing sight.
