While this place is better than most generic, greasy Mexican places that are popular in Phoenix (go figure), the only really great thing here is their carne asada tacos. The horchata is too sweet and kind of bland. Service is okay- they forgot my order but promptly made it when I brought it up to them. The salsa is BAD. It tastes like the pizza sauce that comes in Lunchables.
