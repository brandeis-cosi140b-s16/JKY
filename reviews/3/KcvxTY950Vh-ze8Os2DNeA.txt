Los Olivos has been around for as long as I can remember and I have been their many times in the past but it has been awhile... I am guessing somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 years!  so I guess today was my day!  We had a team lunch to introduce a new team member to everyone and this was the chosen destination.  Let me just say that if you have a large party of 10 or more and want the lunch experience to be handled efficiently this is your place!  Our waitress was so efficient!  We never waited for anything... our drink order was taken promptly and soon after our order was taken our food came right out!  Being that we had 14 people in the party I was pretty impressed.  Lastly to make things more challenging for our waitress everyone was paying their own bill (argh!) it could have been overwhelming.  The chips and salsa were very good for my lunch entree I chose the Mexican pizza with ground beef.  I enjoyed the Mexican pizza except for the ground beef part... they just dumped ground beef on top of the pizza... I thought it would be part of the pizza.  Anyway I would say we had a good experience at Los Olivos... high five to the wait staff!
