Coming from l.a we were looking for a great seafood place. We found this place with 5 stars so decided to try it out! We had a party of 5. Getting here the waitress took long to come take our orders. She wouldn't come ask if we needed anything. We had to remind her for our drinks or chips. First time being here and we asked what the burrito had and she didn't know. Bad service!!!!! On the bright side the food was bomb! A place like this with great food should have better service!!!
