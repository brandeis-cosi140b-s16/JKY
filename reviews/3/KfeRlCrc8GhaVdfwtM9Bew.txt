I stopped by here on a fluke as I was walking from NY NY to check out CityCenter last weekend. 

The food was ok but not realy anything special.  The large beer concoction at the table was a neat novelty, however, the tacos were nothing special.  It is what I could have gotten at any run of the mill mexican restaurant on any city in America.   The service was not very good.  Our waiter was not attentive and looked as though his mind was somewhere else.  It took 35 minutes for our food to come out, and one of the dishes was wrong.  All in all is was not an experience I enjoyed.
