The food is okay, but a bit greasy and overly salted. I like the Emerald Chicken the best. You can get a lot of food for not too much cash. My hands get almost slippery trying to hold a emerald chicken quesadilla from all the grease. The sugar cookies than come with all the meals are soft, but strangely salty? The restaurant itself is dirty (for example, when they mop, they miss the corners, so after doing this many times, the corners turn black). Take it to go if you want to try something new and don't mind the oily tortillas. No healthy options here!
