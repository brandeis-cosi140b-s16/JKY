Food overall quite good. Service good. But if you want to use Total Rewards point, don't come here. They claimed they are not part of the system but they ARE located in casino run by the Caesar. Took them a long time to figure out how to do it finally but we're told they need to charge double points. Very expensive meal and expensive lesson to learn.
