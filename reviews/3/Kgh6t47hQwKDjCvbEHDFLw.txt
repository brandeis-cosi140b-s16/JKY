Went here on the way out to the airport after our family holiday visit.  The place accommodated our large party with kids and the server was great to split the checks.

The food wasn't anything fantastic unfortunately.  I had a chimichanga and it was "okay" -- I probably wouldn't come back on my own, but was good for this group with some picky eaters who want things that are predictable.

I prefer my mexican to be more authentic.  The service was great though.
