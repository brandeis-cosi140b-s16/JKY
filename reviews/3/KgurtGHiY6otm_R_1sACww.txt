If Carlos obrien's was slightly more consistent with their food as far as seasoning, temperature, and timing...4.5 stars. Yet at times the pollo fundido is luke warm( amazing when hot), the tacos often under seasoned ( surprisingly good when proper), and the kitchen is at times a little sluggish... when restaurant is half full.

The two best things here are the chips and two salsas which are addictive and always delicious. And the botanas, their take on nachos, which are on my list of best apps in the area. At least go there for them, really.
