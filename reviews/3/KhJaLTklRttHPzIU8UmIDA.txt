3.5 stars

I'd definitely classify this joint as white-people Mexican food. The servers are Latino, but speak English well. Other nationalities other than Latinos eating there. Really clean space. Meat: not too fatty. See, white-people Mexican food! 

Loved their fries; not a soggy one in the bunch. Covered w/ pico de gallo, cheese, guac, & crema, I had to stop myself from eating the entire portion & making myself sick. So sad that guac doesn't hold up well in leftovers *yucky face* 

Order first, pay after you get your food. I got scolded for paying while I was waiting for my food...reason for 3 stars instead of 4. Don't get your panties in a twist, homie. It was my first time here (& it'll probably be my last), cut me some slack. other strikes: i didn't see Orange Bang in the soda machine & carne asada was a bit bland.
