Their Mahi Mahi Taco's.... :)

Tuesday all you can eat Taco's $10 bucks and $2 Tecates ;)

Service.... Kept you from getting 5 stars, The Server was super rude, had a hard time splitting the Bill, Gave him cash and cards, and some how bank statements didnt match up seems like the cash was treated as tip.... On top of the 18% Gratuity... However Owner was really nice, gave us free drink card for our next visit :)
