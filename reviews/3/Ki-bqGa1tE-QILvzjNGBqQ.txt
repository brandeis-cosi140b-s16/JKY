Trouble flying?  How about a little tequila to get you going?  Assuming you are not the pilot, there really should not be a problem.

Airline food has changed quite a bit - from essentially no food on the first flights, where most people were probably rather amazed to be flying at all, to rather decent food being served for the locale, then to cardboard variations that most would be hard-pressed to call food at all, now to almost no food unless you pay for it.

So these days, you will probably want to fill up before you get on the plane.  As such, you may want to make a decent choice, and this is not a bad selection - in the morning you do not have a lot of options, and when it comes to sitting down, there are even fewer.

It would be better if the service improved, and the prices were not as bad as they are, but you are in an airport.  That said, the selection is decent, if not outstanding, and the food is okay.  Just remember the tequila.
