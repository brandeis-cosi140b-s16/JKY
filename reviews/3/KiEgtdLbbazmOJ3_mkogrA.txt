I've been hitting Dona Maria's since they were located in a strip mall on 10th & Charleston, around 1981 or so. Over the years, they've delivered consistently decent food, with the tamales being their signature item. Nowadays I don't bother with anything other than the tamales, which I order by the dozen and take home. They're still a bargain at $20. Order the hot salsa, it's much, much better than the regular, which is bland, and watery. The hotter salsa is made with roasted chile's. It's texture and color are well balanced with a fiery kick to the palate.
The service at the Cheyenne location is fair, but nothing special, or outstanding, which is why I just do the take out option these days. Obviously, they're doing something right because I keep going back after all these years. Overall, they're worth a trip because the Summerlin location is around the corner from my house, but only a 3 star place, IMHO.
