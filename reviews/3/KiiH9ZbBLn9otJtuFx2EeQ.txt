I was craving a burrito bowl after a workout so instead of going to my usual stop, which was Chipotle, I opted to try Braddah's.  I love Hawaiian food so why not.

At 7pm on a regular Monday night, this place was just deserted. I think it was the location. There is only one other restaurant there in that plaza which was a Japanese place and even they do not look like there were getting a lot of business too. 

We walked in and were greeted warmly by everyone in store. They asked if it was our first time there and we said "Yes." They gave us a sample of each of their meats and recommended which sauce goes well with what. So we got two things: Huli Huli Chicken bowl with brown rice and a Pulehu Steak Burrito with the seaweed rice. 

Flavor wise, I loved it! Only concern - The food was actually pretty cold even though they prepared it in front of us. Maybe the meat was left out for too long? Given that they do not get as much business, the meat was a tad bit cold so I was disappointed about that. This has a potential to be really good but it just did not have that served hot and fresh factor that should come in all sit down places anyway. Even Subway offers to heat up your food, right? I do have to remember, however, that it is a fast food place.

So overall, I'd say meh. I would still give it three stars because of how nice the staffs were.  They even gave us free coconut bark for desserts.
