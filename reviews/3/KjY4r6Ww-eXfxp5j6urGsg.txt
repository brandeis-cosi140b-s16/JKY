Despite what the cups say this place is just another average "bertos". This chain may not be related the the rest of them but its still a run of the mill taco shop. Nothing on the menu really stands out as interesting or unique and nothing I've tried so far has been better than average. Tacos, carne asada fries, carne asada burrito, rice, beans, tostadas all are just okay. The prices arent too bad so thats a plus, and they have a daily special for every day of the week so if you like taco tuesdays or cheese quesadilla thursdays you wont be disappointed.  The staff is helpful and nice.
