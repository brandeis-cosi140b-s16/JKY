Friends and I went to the restaurant on a Saturday evening.  The food is outstanding; however, the noise level was deafening because of the volume of the music.  We finally got to the point that we stopped talking to one another because we tired of saying "What?"  When the server came over,  I asked for the check, forgoing dessert because we couldn't stand it any more, and she couldn't hear me!  I know that on a Saturday night a restaurant can be noisy due to the conversation levels, but lowering the music was something that was controllable.  This restaurant obviously caters to the 30ish 's or so singles crowd who started coming in to the bar after 9pm, but other patrons deserve an enjoyable dining experience.  When the crowd who wants to go to the newest "in" place moves on, how does Sumo Mayo expect to woo back diners who have had such a horrible experience.  The entire situation was nothing short of abusive (and expensive).  Never again.
