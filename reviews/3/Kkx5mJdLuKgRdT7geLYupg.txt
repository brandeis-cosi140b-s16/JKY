$12 Margarita which tasted very yummy and I don't usually like margaritas. Ordered a Burrito and was very disappointed with the size. but I didnt mind too much because i used dinning credit from the Monte Carlo. I asked the waitress if they could bring an extra plate because were going to split the meal and she went above and beyond and had the chef split the the entire meal into two small dishes which made it very convenient. the other good thing is that its on the strip and you can people watch. I you don't mind paying a little more than other mexican restaurants i would definitely recommend this joint
