I am not going to rave about 1900 as far as the food goes but I still like going there and I'm not sure why. Maybe the service and atmosphere  make up for the less than stellar food. Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad, it's just not great. I love fajitas so I usually end up ordering those and next time, I am going to have to tell our server to please ask that the onions and peppers not be overcook as they have been recently. I also wish that the refried beans were not so skimpy b/c I love refried beans but I guess I could always order a side of those. So all in all, I would recommend 1900 and I don't think you will be disappointed, you just won't be blown away!
