Taco Bell is Taco Bell! I mean that as in you get what you pay for! It's fast food I mean there isn't nothing spectacular about it but I will say that when nothing else is open and you're hungry this place definitely hits the spot! I never really go inside but the drive thru can get crazy busy and the time to get your food can be insane on the weekends! Or late nights in general! I have no complaints because they've always got my food to me fresh and the employees working have all be pleasant! That's all I ask for when ordering fast food! Even though it may not always be fast the customer service never lacks and that's key! On a side note that new nacho crunch wrap thingy is bomb for $1.49 yaaasss! Can't go wrong ordering that!
