I ordered the Carne Asada burrito and it's mostly beans and rice. I'm a little disappointed,  especially considering it's almost $10. I'm not impressed. The tortilla was dried out.  Although they give us a discount it's still not really worth it.  I guess they're charging for convenience. I hope they get better.
