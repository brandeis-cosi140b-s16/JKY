Every time I've ever eaten here I've gotten grizzly pieces of steak in a Steak Burrito. When you are paying double the price of Filibertos to come here it is pretty frustrating to bite into that. The price is competitive with other major chains. The environment inside is very nice and minimalistic. The chips are delicious but are caked in salt. The salsa is good. Look up the secret menu.
