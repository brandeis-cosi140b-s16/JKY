Decent food @ a decent price. Service was fast & attentive. Enjoyed the choripollo tacos w/ pico de gallo & chili/tomatilla sauce. Spicy!!! Gf ordered the chicken tortilla grilled sandwich- more of a "loaded" quesadilla w/ guac & cheese on top and she liked it. A nice alternative to southside chains.
