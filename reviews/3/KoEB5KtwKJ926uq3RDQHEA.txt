This is a Taco Bell alright.

I used to eat here every Sunday for a while when I lived in the dorms and the kitchen  was closed.  My standards were not terribly high, but I was never disappointed with the soft tacos or nachos.

I've been back a few times lately.  If you grew up eating Taco Bell, sometimes the craving comes back.

On this location:
The side door area kind of smells like urine but it is right next to the bathroom.  I've never used the drive through so I can't comment.

Going in the middle of the day on the weekend I have never had a problem.  The food is Taco Bell - you know what you are getting.  I am partial to the beefy crunch burrito right now.  It's a burrito!  With spicy Fritos on it!  There are days when that's what you want.

One time I had a very disorganized order, and the lady working the register organized it into value meals to save me some money.  I really appreciated that.

I usually get my food to go.  Last time they forgot one of the tacos, but when I mentioned it they immediately made it up for me.  Then I took 12 Fire sauce packets as usual and left to enjoy it.
