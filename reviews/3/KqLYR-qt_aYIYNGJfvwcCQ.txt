I would give this place 2.5 stars but I will round up to 3.

Very conflicted feelings.

I have gone here a few times when they were located on 32nd and Greenway. Every experience was a little different.

The good-
-Sometimes the service was good. Maybe it depends on their mood. When it was good it was usually the wife who was our server. She kind of reminded me of one my aunts. Warm, slightly teasing, calling us "bambinos". 
- I have always liked the food. I have had the chili relleno and enchiladas entrees. Both were a solid 7 out of 10. The beans are very tasty too.

The bad-
- When the service was bad it was usually the husband. Not friendly. Slow. Wouldn't refill our waters and soft drinks. Yet seemed attentive and talkative to other tables. Made us feel like total crap.
- Slightly overpriced.
- Charged for extra chips and salsa.
- My husband didn't like the food.
- Probably my worst experience was when I called at lunchtime to place a to go order. She said they couldn't take the order because they had a huge table of people. Just flat out refused. Guess what I wanted? Just a bean burrito! It takes 30 seconds to make.

I didn't miss them when they moved across town.
