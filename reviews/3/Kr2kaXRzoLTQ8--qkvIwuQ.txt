I am a HUGE Moe's fan but I just don't understand why this one in a high traffic, visible location isn't managed better.  The dining room is run down, unkempt and truthfully dirty.  Their employees seem more interested in each other than the customer.  I visited one Monday for their special, which means they are VERY busy and there was a maintenance working hanging a television in the midst of lunch rush. This just signals poor management to me.  Makes me wonder what else is going on....
