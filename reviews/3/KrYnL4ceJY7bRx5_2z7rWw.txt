This place isn't the greatest Mexican restaurant in the world, but it isn't the worst either. I  like Mexican food, but I don't care for the slow service and half warm food I got. I've been in a few times, which is why I give it three stars. The service could use some improvement. I don't think a smile would kill them. 

And since it's not all organic, I think the prices could be a bit cheaper. It's a hit or miss with this place.  Some days it's great. Other days, you wish you would have just let your 3 year old loose in the kitchen with last years leftovers.

Best I can say it try it for yourself. You'll either love it or hate it. Or like me, you'll deal with it when your in town.
