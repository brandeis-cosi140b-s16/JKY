Blue Burrito Grille in all its Southwestern, Arizona chain glory, is a shell of its self in the airport version. It is instead a haven for hungry travelers, all willing to pay the marked up prices while expecting a lackluster burrito. It is true when the food is neither life changing nor cheap, but this BBG will do when the pickins are as slim as Sky Harbor Airport.

More likely to be a coincidence of my flights, I seem to be around whenever there is a decent sized line of folks. Contemplating on ordering a burrito while your departing flight is boarding? Aim for the plane - BBG workers aren't going to assemble a burrito and dress it in the time that you need. Service isn't exactly bustling here and knowing the burrito is going to be subpar is going to make one why you bothered to pay $9-11 for it in the first place.

Instead of ordering the usual asada burritos, my secret weapon is to try to score one of their breakfast burritos during the morning. They're cheaper, the same size, and often more fresh than others since they have to be cooked on the spot. People who aren't fans of burritos can take their chances with a taco salad, which sits inside of a shell bowl, but is largely unappealing. Finally, the quesadillas are a popular option, but they cost nearly as much as the burritos with significantly less portion.

The sad part is the other options in the terminal aren't much better. It might be better to sneak out of the airport entirely for some tortilla action at Carolina's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/carolinas-mexican-food-phoenix). Your tastebuds and wallet will thank you for it.
