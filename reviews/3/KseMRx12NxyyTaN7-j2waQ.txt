$0.99 margarita specials, what more do you need to know?

That was pretty much all I knew about El Patron before I went there.  A friend of mine insisted it was worth going and, since I have fewer people out here to recommend places to eat, I decided to go for it.

Since I went for the margaritas, I'll tell you tis first: going there just for that really is worth it.  They're good, sold in the short highball glasses.  I only tried the traditional one, but it was surprisingly good.  I guess when you go in and you have to move tables and chairs around to find a place to sit, your opinion gets lowered a bit.

See, the place isn't much to look at, and on top of it, I think we caught them on a bad night.  Walking in the music was WAY too loud for such a small space.  Especially at 6 or so on a Monday night.  We actually walked out to the patio simply because of that.  And having a broken chair and a dishrag on the one free table, well, it happens.  Following that up with waiting quite a while to even place our drink orders and then get the food...  Maybe I'm just being picky.

The food was fine.  Decently good mexican fare, unremarkable besides.  If you're looking for a place to hang out and have a drinks with some friends, maybe have a bite, it's great.  If you're just looking for a place to have dinner, maybe less so.
