The food here was good! I had chorizo with scrambled eggs. It was good although I wished I had gotten the carne asada; that is one of my favorites.

My friend and I saw some characters at this place. I think they come out late at night.

1) A couple walked in and the lady yelled "ya'll busy" - if she looked, she would have noticed that we were the only [two] people in the restaurant besides them. #facepalm

2) A few minutes before we were about to leave two guys walked in with a 12 pack of beer!? I think they left the beer inside while they went out to smoke a cigarette.
