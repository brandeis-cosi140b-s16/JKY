I have frequented Rokerij for sometime, but this was my first time dining at Richardson's. DEFINITELY make a reservation (which we did) or you will be waiting a LONG time for a table. 
The atmosphere is lovely, though a bit cramped. I think it would be nice to sit outside near the fire in the cooler months. 
The food was good - not outstanding, but good. The seafood was fresh. Don't plan on dessert unless you like flan, since that is the only dessert on the menu. The wine and cocktails were pretty good as well. 
What was awful was the service. Our waitress acted like serving our table was an inconvenience. And it wasn't just her - at one point, before we paid our bill and while we were still talking, someone came over to our table, took our wine glasses and our placemats. We all stopped talking and looked at him. It was obvious they wanted us to leave so they could turn the table. I'll stick with Rokerij from now on!
