ahhh Filibertos (also known to our circle lovingly as Filiperros), what can i say about Fili's that has not been said already. This by far has been the nicest of the bunch. very clean and friendly staff. Food is OK what can you expect from Filiberto's its cheap food man. Its not Shea Filibertos on the sign. I Used to go to the one on Broadway in Tempe after hitting the bars, sometimes the most eventful part of the night was the Filibertos drive-through on broadway. seen several bumper thumps and several fights because of the fender benders at the drive-through.. ohhh Fili's drive-through and drunkass ppl.. thanks for the memories.. 
Oh yeah, so the food is cheap and decent.. - The End
