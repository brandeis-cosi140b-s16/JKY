Freshly off the plane and having checked in at the Palazzo, we headed over here for some lunch. I had read this place boasts of a nice view, so we walked over from the Palazzo. First off, it was quite confusing to get here, we asked for directions several times, since the path from Palazzo to Venetian is a bit of a maze. But once we walked into this beautiful fake piazza looking area, with bridges and gondolas we were in awe. 

We wished we could have sat right next to the canal at this place but they reserve the canal view for tables for two. We were still able to enjoy the "fake" sights "outside". We ordered a pitcher of margaritas that our waiter had recommended which had Grand Manier, and boy was that strong! 

We each got the taco platter which comes with three tacos you can choose from (you can mix and matches them too), and also comes with cillantro rice and beans. 

I got the pork, beef and fish tacos. The pork was a bit dry, but the mango salsa on top was to die for! The beef tacos were my favorite- moist and flavorful. The fish ones had the mango salsa as well and were also very good. You could also choose the kind of tortilla, but unfortunately, I don't think they serve hard shell tacos which I personally love.

Their tomato salsa was also very delicious (and cheap) so I would recommend putting in an order of those. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful for the most part, though they were reluctant to allow us to charge our bill on 6 credit cards even though we were splittling the bill evenly. Eventually the informed us they would accomodate our request "just this once", but that it might take them a while to do so.
