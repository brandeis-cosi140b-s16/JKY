Perhaps the flavor could be more intense, but based on my recent experience here, I believe some of the previous reviews are a little harsh maybe.  Service admittedly was a tad bit slow, but our server was both friendly and helpful.  The location is great and the valet parking just outside the door is convenient.  The space is nice and open and they can easily cater to large parties.  The guacamole was more than decent with a nice hit of lime and cilantro flavor.  The southwest chicken bowl could have used a bit more of both, but was overall quite tasty.  The serving sizes are more than adequate and the Tres Leches cake for dessert was incredibly light and moist.  Overall, I would definitely not hesitate to venture out here a second time.
