Wanted to watch the end of the USC game last night and sat at the outer portion of the bar. Was first served by Brandon and then Oscar.

At first they gave their back but they were kinda busy but once they noticed I was new they waited on me very well. Very attentive and always asked if I wanted anything else or how I was doing.

Ordered some DOS XX and a two item combination plate, went with a carne asada taco and a carnitas burrito. Opted for the black beans and rice.

The asada and carnitas meat were really decent, not outstanding. The beans and rice were okay.
