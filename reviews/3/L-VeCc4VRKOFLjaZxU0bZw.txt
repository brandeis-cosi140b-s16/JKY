Yummy! 

While waiting to get our nails done, my friend and I happened upon El Conquistador...I ordered the Carne Asada ala Tampiquena and horchata. 

The little lady (from previous reviews I'm assuming it must be the lovely Maria) that runs the place is a hoot! The homemade salsa is fabulous, and the flavor of the carne asada is incredible. She is a great cook! The atmosphere is pretty laid back, we were there around 6 or so on a Saturday night and it wasn't very busy...but it should be! Prices are reasonable, the food is delicious...I'm happy we wandered in!
