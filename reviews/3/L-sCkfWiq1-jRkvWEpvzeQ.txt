Decent food, but seemingly worthy o 4 or 5 stars.  The portions are large and the salsa are pretty good, but beans are out of a can...  if you want a step up from cafeteria food with a mexamerican flare, this is a good choice. They do server beer and wine, but no tequilla so those margs are either beergarita's or winegarita's.
