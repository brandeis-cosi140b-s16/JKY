What Lisa said.  It''s not too bad.  Two gorditas rice, beans and a soda ran me $8.65.  I had the chicken in mole and chorizo with potatoes.  Both were a little greasy.  Salsa bar was a little weak but I can deal.  Girl at he counter had to work a little with my english but the order came out right.  Floor was prticularly dirty although I went in late, maybe it would look better in the morning.  Overall I'd go back if I were near there but I won't be making any speacial trips.
