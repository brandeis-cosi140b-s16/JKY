I've been to this location a few times and have always had great service. Tonight was about the same, despite a slight attitude problem from the person who took my order. She got a little "put off" when I had to explain to her that I had ordered two LARGE Diet Cokes. She tried to pass off two SMALL ones, saying I had ordered those. I once again reiterated that they were indeed large, and yes, she stood corrected when she double-checked the order on the screen. She rolled her eyes at me, gave a loud, obnoxious sigh, and changed my drinks to a large. I certainly hope I don't encounter her again on future visits so she doesn't decide to spit in my food or something out of spite. 

Otherwise, this visit was once again fine. The food was excellent, and I even had enough to take as lunch the next day!
