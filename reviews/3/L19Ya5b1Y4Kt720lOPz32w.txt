The food here is decent and (like most Mexican fast food places) easy on the wallet. You'll find tacos, burritos, combo plates in all the usual meat varieties. As others have noted, the carne asida fries are freakin' crazy. This artery-clogging beast is served in a square to-go container and is piled high with cheese and marinated beef. Pair it with a six-pack of cerveza and you are good to go.
