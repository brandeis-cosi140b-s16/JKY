Not impressed. They messed up my order and had awful customer service(called to order ahead and they left me on hold then hung up on me, sadness).  My burrito was bland, and the fact that I paid extra for guacamole AND sour cream and received neither really grinds my gears. I'm sure I would've enjoyed my food much more had they not forgotten those key ingredients. That, and they messed up the two other items in my order as well.... , but I digress. I'm pretty sure they were upset about food truck Fridays knocking them out the park I'm going to give them another try, since I have always heard good things about the place, & I do so badly want to love them based solely on the name.
