The service...slow.  The food...tasty but spicy.  The atmosphere...quiet.  The drinks...excellent. They are slightly overpriced and if you have children in your party they may not be able to eat anything here.  I had the carnitas which was tasty but not tender and the more of it I consumed the hotter it got. Fortunately for my group our waitress was attentive and kept our water glasses full and we thanked her for it. Overall the food was good but hot.
