We went on Christmas eve & it was not busy.  I love Del Taco because of the food tasting fresh & somewhat better than taco bell.  

This night we ordered carnita combo burrito, 8 layer burrito & spicy Jack quesadilla.  The burritos were great (8 layer is way better than Taco Bell's 7 layer) but the quesadilla was gross.  It tasted like they gave me and old order from like 2 hours before.  

Because of my love for Del Taco I will go again but this time I will check my order before I leave.
