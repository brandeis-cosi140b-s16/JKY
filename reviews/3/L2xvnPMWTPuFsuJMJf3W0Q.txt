Located in the Miracle Shops and you can hear them play Top 40s and David Guettas' entire album while walking by. They have an outdoors area to sit and eat as well as space inside but we sat at the bar trying signature drink, the Waborita and boy oh boy was it tasty. Of course a camera girl walked p to us asking to take our picture for a discount and blah blah blah. We declined on buying the picture and she walked away frustrated, well why even bother?
