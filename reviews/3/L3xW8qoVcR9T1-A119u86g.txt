Ok, I agree the tortillas are awesome. The interior is kind of ho hum, and larger than it appears from outside. There is a side patio that looks incomplete but has potential if the owners decide to do something with it. I asked if I could bring my dog, and the waitress said she didn't think it would be a problem. But I was not there for the ambiance, i was there for the food. 

I started with a cheese crisp and it was loaded with cheese. I added the green chiles and they were fine but tasted like ortega out of the can. The tortilla was tasty. I also tried the chips and salsa, and the chips tasted like they were made there, a bit overcooked. The salsa was not spicy enough at all so the waitress brought us habanero  sauce to add, which helped. I had the pollo fundido and the chicken was nicely spiced and tender, the sauce was good but lacked the spiciness i prefer. The beans were again tasty but a bit salty, and the rice was a bit dry. I also had a carne asada taco and the tortilla was great and the meat was good, but a bit dry. 

My take on this place is that they might be looking for the tourist crowd and have taken some kick out of their food. I am not a heat freak but a bit of spiciness is to be expected with mexican food. The portions were generous and well priced, and the tortillas were awesome. I hope the succeed because I hate El Encanto where service sucks and food is overpriced and touristy.  I would probably say 3.5 stars if possible. I will try it again soon.
