I have been here three times now and I do agree- the tacos are tasty. The pork with pineapple are my favs. The guacamole is good but there is definitely better around town. My one main issue is the service. No one checks back to see if you are enjoying your meal or if you want anything else. They just seem to care about turning over your seat.  It is a tiny cramped spot but a little better service would make me want to go more. HH specials are good which has kept us going back but this last time was the absolute worst service so I doubt we will return.
