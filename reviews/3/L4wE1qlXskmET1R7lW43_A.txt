Food was great overall. Really tasty and loved spiciness of the different rolls we ordered. My only complain with this resturant is it took forever to take order. Was sitting at table for a good 15 mins before anyone acknowledged us and I had to get up and let them know "hey we are ready to order." Then the waitress proceeded to say oh there's a button you can press to call us. Ummm no one said anything about a button and it was hidden behind all the different hot sauses. Also don't come hungry because they take fooooooreeeevvvvvver to bring out your order.
