This location is hit or miss.
I've been here several times; the food is always good, and that's not the issue. The issue is what makes it into your bag. If I can give one piece of advice it's to fricken check your bag, especially if you have more than one plate of food in there! 
It's very frustrating to order something as big and expensive as Carne Asada nachos and receive 2 tacos, instead. That sucks. How does that even happen, if the rest of the bag had the right things?  I hate to even have to look through my things, because I feel like a dick, but now I have to.
