El Taco Tote
35th Ave & Camelback
Cost: $3.5
Service: 1 of 5, I couldn't understand the order person, took me 4 minutes to order a beer while one of the staff just looked at me. Actually gave us the wrong tacos.
Presentation: 4 of 5, can put on your own toppings, and some of the tacos are big, and some are small, we couldn't tell the difference in how to order the big ones since we got the wrong ones on 2 of 3 orders. 
Taste: 5 of 5, great taste and fresh. If the service wasn't bad I'd go back.
