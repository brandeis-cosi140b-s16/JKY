Went here for taco Tuesday and the carne asada tacos were good. The reason I didn't give them five stars was 1. Their chips were not that great. I think if they went to a better authentic tortilla chip rather than the hard thick ones they had it would make a huge difference. And 2, their guacamole was like a watery green paste squeezed out of a bag that was defrosted a week ago. Place has good potential but some things need to be changed.
