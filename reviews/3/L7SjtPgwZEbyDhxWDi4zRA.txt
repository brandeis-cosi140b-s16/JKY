Mi Case is located inside the Silverton Casino in the Southwest.  I have eaten at Mi Casa for the past 4 years and it was our favorite spot ever. In the 6 months / past year the management has changed and some of the staff including the chef. It seems to be hit or miss on the food and service as of late. I am hoping that it levels out and comes back to its former glory!  The provide free chips and 3 sauses on being seated and the have an extensive menu. Full bar service with good value. I usally order the cheese enchaliades or beef fajatias.
