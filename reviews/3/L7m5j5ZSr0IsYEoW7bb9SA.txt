Great happy hour deals, and as far as I can tell the daily/weekly specials look great. I only had a few appetizers and they were pretty okay. The guacamole order was enormous, but had a kind of odd sweet sauce garnish (some sort of reduced liquer with roasted jalepenos I think) that was just hard to get used to. The flautas were delish and margaritas (frozen) were of high standards.
