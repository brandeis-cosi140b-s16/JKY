I love a sketchy 24-hour taco shop, which is why Tacos Mexico has my heart. 

After a mellow night of sipping drinks around Downtown Vegas, my belly called and said, "put burritos in me", not one to argue with the body, I did as such. But instead of rehashing the same old spots near DT I was decided to venture down Charleston see what the, "hood" had to offer.

Enter Tacos Mexico, and old school spot complete with dated restaurant furnishings, a jukebox, and the savory smell of fried pork and tortillas, nummy numms. I went with the Al pastor burrito, filled with marinated and grilled pork, rice and beans. To be honest I've never had an Al pastor burrito with rice and beans, normally it's just meat, chopped onion and cilantro. This variation of the burrito was still tasty, but the addition of house made salsas was needed for that extra little kick. 

The meat was a little under seasoned and I could have done without the rice and beans, but I'm assuming they use these as filler for the burrito. All in all no big complaints and very fast service which is really all you can ask for from an all night fast food joint.
