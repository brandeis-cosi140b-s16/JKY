Filabertos has been closed for awhile now so I decided to try the nearby Armandos. To my surprise I was disappointed. I have been to this location twice and both times took forever. I used the drive thru and went inside the store. The second visit they lost my ticket and had to ask my order again. I had the carne asada quesadilla which was very dry and the chorizo breakfast burrito was just okay (the only reason this got 3 stars instead of 2). I will probably give it one more shot.
