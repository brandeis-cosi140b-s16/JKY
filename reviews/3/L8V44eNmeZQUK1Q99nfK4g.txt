Holy cow! We took on the El Bandito burrito. I wasn't expecting the flavors to be that great. Normally when places offer a 28 inch burrito it's more of a gimmick but this was surprisingly good. For 4 or 5 people it's a good hit and a cheap lunch. Can't wait to try more of their dishes. Salsa was outstanding.
