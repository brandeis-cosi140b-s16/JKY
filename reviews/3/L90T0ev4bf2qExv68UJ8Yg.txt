I ate here a week ago the tacos in my opinion where less than satisfactory.  I had 3 carna asda tacos the carna tasted a few days old nasty although the other ingredients tasted fresh.  I also had a fish taco it was okay and tasted better with their yellow corn tortillas which didn't go well with the carna. 

The service was fast and friendly. The restaurant decor was okay aswell

Overall I give them three stars this place seems like a white wash rendition of Mexican food little authenticity in my opinion although they had a Chicana in the kitchen
