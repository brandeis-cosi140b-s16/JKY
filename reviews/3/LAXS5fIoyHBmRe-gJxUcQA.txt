Too bad about Mandalay Noodle World. Maybe if they had stressed better service and played up the Burmese aspect they would have had better luck. Who knows?

Betito's moved in, and they're okay. The wife and I stopped in yesterday. I had a carne asada torta and a taco and both were about average. Their hot salsa took it up a notch though. My wife had something with diablo in the name (sorry, I'll have to look at the menu when I get home) and loved it. They do the usual menudo on weekends and the whole place is more or less along the lines of a Filiberto's--not that there's anything wrong with that. The whole bill was less that $20, so prices are good. 

Clean enough place, cheap, food is okay, and service is adequate. I would not go out of my way to get there, but if it is in your neighborhood it is worth a try. I'll probably stop here from time to time.
