Cinco de Mayo. 
Let's start off with the good. Rice and beans...exceptional. They have bottled water. They have kids' meals. Son loved his flautas. There are several booths and tables so you can dine in or take out, and the cashiers spoke both English and Spanish well. The tables seemed clean and had napkin-holders so you don't have to hunt down someone and beg for extra napkins.

Now the bad. My other son's fries were very salty, as was my hubby's burrito. My quesadilla was a special for the day, with carne asada. The girl said their carne asada was really good. It was not. I have had good carne asada and this wasn't it. The quesadilla was, however, full of meat, unlike one reviewer showed a picture of for his. We never got our drinks before the food came, and when we asked the kid who brought the food about the drinks, he smiled, walked away, and started doing some other chore. I had to go ask for our drinks!  Awesome customer svc, bro.

The extra salt, the underwhelming carne asada, and missing drinks plus the kid ignoring us all made this review non-5-star-worthy. I probably should not even give it 3 stars, but the rice and beans were that good.
