The place looks a little dismal from the outside but the interior decor is campy and cheerful with a the bar all light up in green, blue and red neon lights, it kind of put me in a good mood as I walked in the door.  


Maybe because I spoke to him in Spanish the waiter told to to wait and ran off to bring me the authentic menu, it's the one with a photo to show what each dish looks like -very similar to El Riconcito Mejicano, my fave Mex in Miami. Some of them looked killer, I told myself I want that ... then I saw that the price was $24!!  That's right, prices were $15 to $32 per dish!  It seems way excessive for the locale. The waiter told me the restaurant has only been open for 3 month, maybe they'll readjust the pricing. 

I ordered from the Americanized menu  the enchiladas in Jalisco sauce - they were ok - and a Bohemia beer . The salsa was exactly as described, but the Taco chips were very dry and hard, careful swallowing . And the flan was  ... flan. I like flan. The dinner was very reasonable, under $20 including tax and tip but I have to try the other menu one of these days.
