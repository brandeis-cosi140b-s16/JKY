This place is not too far from the east side of Madison.  The place is a great break from a place like Pedro's, Loredoes or Fridas.

The food is really authentic, usually served hot,quick and is not too hard on the budget.  The menu has a great selection and very user friendly.  If you have to kids along they have things like burgers and fries.  The drinks are not outrageously priced, they have specials throughout the week.  I absolutely love the margaritas. 

The service is sub-par.  The waitstaff is very friendly, but they are not too attentive.  That is too bad, I would give them a five for sure if it wasn't for the service.

The place is very cozy, but not small.  You can enjoy your company and have a great conversation without overly loud music or being interrupted too much.

I would encourage you to try this place, but make sure to order water with your drink, you might finish your drink before the server gets back to you. haha:)  The food is great and very authentic. I do go back, I just know what to expect from La Tolteca and I enjoy my time there.
