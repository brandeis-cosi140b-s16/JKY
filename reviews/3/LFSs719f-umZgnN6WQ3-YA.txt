It's not a 4 or 5 star place, but the girl behind the counter was very sweet, shy, but very sweet and the food was actually delicious! For a del taco I was impressed! It actually seemed like the lady makeing the food cared a little bit about what she was doing! Don't get me wrong. The place is a dive but I would eat here again!!
