Great location, nicely decorated interior and some good stuff on order, La Paz stands out from the usual Central American joints that dot the Charlotte landscape. Yes, they have the usual burritos and quesadillas (we had one of each), but the stuffings aren't the same boring stuffings.

For instance, I chose the Arizona Quesadilla which came with a tasty sundried tomato pico de gallo and fresh spinach. Very tasty. And they have both "half" and "full" size which was awesome since I could see that I was filling up on chips fast.

Yep, the chips are thin and salty and perfect for scooping up their salsa. I liked it, other than it needed more zing to it. Firm and not wet, easily scoopable.

Not nearly as cheap as the $6 burrito/rice/beans joints, but I think the quality is here.
