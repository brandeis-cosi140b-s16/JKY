Two and a half stars.

Decent cheap Mexican food with a lot of low-calorie options.  I ask for most of the burritos/tacos without the sauce since it saves calories (and also it is gross).  Half the items on the menu are no good but the burrito especial is tasty as well as the rolled tacos and the street tacos.  I do like the chips and salsas (they have spicy carrots, yay!) as well as the black beans.  They have tortilla soup now that is actually pretty good, too.  Most of the time I grab food to go since it is by my house but they do have a nice little patio and also they serve bottled Mexican beer so it really isn't a bad place to hang out.
