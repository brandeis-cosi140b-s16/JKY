Decent fast-casual Mexican food, although the "fast" part is up for debate. I like the breakfast tacos better than the lunch/dinner items. I waited too long for my chorizo/potato/cheese/egg tacos, but they were hot when they came out and the fillings were plentiful. The salsa is somewhat unique -- not chunky at all but tangy with good flavor. Almost a vinegary hint, maybe? The ingredients seem fresh and the food is presented well. I'm not a fan of feta cheese on Mexican food (or any food, really) so I skip the cheese on my tacos. I like the chicken better than the beef. Overall, a good place for a cold beer and a cheap lunch or dinner. I'd go here over Laredo's, which is (was?) just down University Avenue to the west.
