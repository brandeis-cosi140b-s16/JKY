went here instead of the old fashion as a substitute, i would say its an average place. i had orded the shrimp fijita, i would say its pretty good for a price of $11. it is something that ya could make at home for a few dollars extra that would last you probably two days. the gf seems to like the chicken tamale that they had. she said it was nice and moist compared to pedros, where we went the other week. which was dry. the wait staff was pretty attentive, the environment was pretty clean. i couldn't complain.
