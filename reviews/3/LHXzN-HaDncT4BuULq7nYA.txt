When it comes to the '-bertos' restaurants there is definitely a wide variety of quality between them all. I put this one square in the middle it's not fabulous but it's by no means one of the worst ones. I'd say it's average to good. When you roll up at noon on a Saturday and you're the only car in the drive thru that says something. The portions from this location are on the small side. An order of carne asada fries is definitely smaller than you'd find at Julioberto's and Los Betos. They do not use real guacamole here it's that weird green guacamole sauce stuff. if you're looking for quick Mexican and you're in the area it'll do.
