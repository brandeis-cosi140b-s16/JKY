Decor and ambience is nice. 

Food portions can be generous but the prices on the menu were higher than the quality of the food (latter of which was good). We wanted to know what the mole dish tasted like, and our waitress brought out a sample of the sauce. I liked that.  The yucatan pork dish was very generously portioned and filling. The plaintains were my favorite.

Overall service is unwelcoming.
