Gave it a second try after Michele w/Steel Cactus's management group invited us back to actually try the food. Thank you, Michele! This time service was extremely attentive and orders were filled accurately. Guac was very tasty! Veg entrees are a little limited and not creative, but the food seemed fresh.
