I consider myself a regular at Morenos (Chandler) since its opened. Never really thought much about writing a review until recently. I've tried menudo at several different places in Chandler and was really disappointed until Morenos opened. Now the problem , too me it has really dropped in quality. I've notice the past few months it has been a bit greasy (too much fat not trimmed) and the broth a little too thick. Its almost a lot like the menudo at Food City, greasy and not enjoyable. I live two minutes from Morenos and may be looking for a new place to purchase my Menudo or just make it myself. One other thing, I ordered a chili verde yesterday and was so disappointed! Strong taste of vinegar was overwhelming. I like this place for a lot of reasons, but it seems to be going down in their food quality. New cook?
