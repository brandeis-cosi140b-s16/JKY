This is not my go to mexican fast food but since I moved to old town this will have to do. I've ordered their carne asada burritos and they are okay. My favorite is the 3 rolled tacos with guac and cheese. I always ask for their extra hot salsa and boy does it have a great kick!
I still have to try other items on their menu to see if it will eventually become my go to place
