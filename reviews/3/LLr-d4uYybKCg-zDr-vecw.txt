This has to be the best lunch deal in Matthews: $6 or $7 for a REALLY good and copious Mexican lunch. There are plenty of dishes to chose from, plus the service was cheerful and eager too. 

When I think of the customers herded on line at the Chipotle franchise (only 2 minutes away!) to spend more and get so much less ...... I must wonder what's wrong with people!
