So excited to be closer to the west coast and a happy mexican food situation! 

After a shitty experience at RA, my husband and I continue on our food frenzy (it's amazing how much he can eat and still be thin) and hit up Canonita.  

We first sit at the bar to let the sushi digest and then order a couple drinks:

-Raspberry mojito, I love that my husband has no shame and says proudly that mojitos are his fave drink
-Sangria margarita, just skip this drink it was disgusting, I don't even want to get into the grueling details

We asked for chips and salsa and find out later that it's $2 for the first batch and $1.00 for each chip refill and $.50 for salsa refills. WTF, that's why I docked a point. 

We sit down at the table and order the chile relleno and the mushroom enchiladas. 

No joke, this is one of the best non-traditional chile rellenos I have ever had.  It had goat cheese, nuts and dried fruits inside the pepper and then it was breaded and flash fried.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it. 

The mushroom enchiladas were equally amazing, they had a green creamy sauce on top.  

No wonder my diet is sucking.
