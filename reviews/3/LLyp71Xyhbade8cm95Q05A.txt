Had some quick lunch here today and the Happy Hours 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. deal for the crunch wraps for a buck is an awesome deal for what you get.  We were the only ones in there when we arrived, which we figured giving it was Easter Sunday and all, so our food was made quick and my son and I especially enjoyed it.  Thanks Taco Bell.
