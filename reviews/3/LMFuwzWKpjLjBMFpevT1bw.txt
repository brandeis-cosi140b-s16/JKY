El Maguey doesn't vary too much from other Americanized Mexican places in the Charlotte area.  They have the complimentary chips and salsa and plenty of combinations along with some specialties.  It is probably a very slight step up from Zapata's and Charanda's but it's no la Poblanita.  The food was a little over priced.  $11 for about 5 oz of chicken topped with spinach and cheese and a side of beans and rice.  Our services was somewhat slow despite only one other tabe in thie place and three servers.  I'd go back but it probably wouldn't be my 1st choice for Mexican.
