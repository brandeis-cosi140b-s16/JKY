I have frequented this Chipotle 3 or 4 times now as school is not too far away and Chipotle study breaks rock! 

It is mostly your typical Chipotle. It is expensive and my biggest issue is that you have to micromanage the staff. They are more than willing to skimp you on the portions! Usually asking if you can have more works, but should you really have to do that when you're paying 10+ dollars for the meal?? 

The staff is adequate. They are not eager to be overly friendly or helpful, but they aren't rude either. 

Overall, I go because I have a deep love fr Chipotle and it is the closest one to school. That being said, they could work in their staff attitude and the portions....



Oh yeah, and the guac is a awesome.
