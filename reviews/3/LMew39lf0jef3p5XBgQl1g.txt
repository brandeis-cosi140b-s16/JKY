Decent mexican food, everyone in the group i went with enjoyed their meals no complaints. I ordered the chicken tacos on the lunch menu included 3 they were good. went here for lunch and their lunch specials were $5.95 which isn't bad. i'd highly recommend checking it out, its close to ASU, the only Downside chips and salsa are extra not something that is free. Plenty of TV's and outdoor seating to watch the game.
