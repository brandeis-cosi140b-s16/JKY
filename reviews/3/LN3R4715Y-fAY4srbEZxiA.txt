We went there last night for dinner - our first visit in probably a year. The food was still good and of course the margaritas delicious. And the service was pretty good. What I did notice this visit as compared to visits before was that the place was dirty. We sat at a table next to some shutters and they were covered with dust. The light above our table was dusty, and the restroom was filthy. Makes me wonder what kind of cleaning they are doing in the kitchen.
