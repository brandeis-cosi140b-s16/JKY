Everything I've had here is like an enchilada.  Even if it isn't an enchilada, it's a sloppy liquidy mess of food.  It's an enchilada place!  That's ok.

My parents are in love with Abeulos because they're from Connecticut and when they think Mexican food, they think enchiladas as it's all they know.

The place is pricey for what you get.  $15-20 for a couple mediocre, small enchiladas.  I won't ever be going here on my own.  When I go with them I order the cheapest thing on the menu.
  
Of note is something strange.  Abuelos has three salsas that come with chips when you sit down.  One is ok, and the other two are terrible.  They are very, very bad.  Here in Arizona, I can find the best salsas I have ever had.  But not at Abuelos.  Just everywhere else.  One is green and very sweet.  It must have a lot of sugar in it because no fruit is that sweet.  Weird.
