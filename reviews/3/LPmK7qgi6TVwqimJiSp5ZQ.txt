Eeek - I didn't know that Mamita's/Mamacita's was closed by the health department recently or I might not have eaten there! They must have cleaned up their act because they were open for business and about half full on May 12th.
Nobody seems to know exactly what the name is, including the restaurant itself, so I will post this review under Mamita's, which is what the sign says outside.
Overall, the food is decent and very well-priced. Chips and salsa are really important to me at a family-style Mexican joint like this, and Mamita's c&s were really good. They have both Mexican & Cuban food, but my party of 4 stuck to the Mexican side, so I can't comment on the Cuban. Taquitos, 'mexican-style' tacos (that means onions, cilantro, meat on soft tortillas vs 'american-style' which have cheese, lettuce, and meat in a deep-fried tortilla), and quesadillas were all good. 
Bonus for the random Mexican music videos they have playing on a large TV.
