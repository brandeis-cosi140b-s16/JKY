There's no use in pretending Pancho's is a haven for good Mexican food, you know it isn't, it's a haven for the fatties and college kids. I made many a stop at Pancho's during my college years, and on my most recent nostalgia filled trip I realized it just isn't the same anymore. Same less than good food, same little flags you raise, same sopaipillas you want to eat until you vomit, but now I have a steady paycheck and access to whatever food I'd like, so it's not all that exciting anymore. I didn't even eat until I thought I'd die... sad day. But look, Pancho's fills the niche it's shooting for perfectly, you're getting all you can eat Mexican food for a few dollars, you can't expect to be served food comparable to The Mission, it's going to be cheap and underwhelming, but TONS of cheap and underwhelming. I'll be stopping by here every rare once in a while, just for old times sake, but if you're in college and lacking money, or a fatty trying to support your habit, Pancho's is A-OK.
