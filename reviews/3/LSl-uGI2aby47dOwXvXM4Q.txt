According to yelp, 3 stars = "A-OK."  This place, for me, is exactly that because it's cheap, convenient, and surprisingly tasty.  How much can you expect from a bean burrito that is $0.99?  Not much, right?  Well, here at Del Taco, the beans are slow-cooked from scratch.  They're not a mushy mess.  Hubby likes the strawberry shakes -- there's REAL ice cream in them things! -- and the chili cheese fries (cardiac arrest on a plate, but you only live once).  It's a great option after a hike, when you're ravenous and want calories NOW.  

I've never experienced less-than-friendly service and you can get as much hot sauce as you want!
