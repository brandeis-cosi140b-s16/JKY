What?! Outta red beef tamales? Bogus.

My first experience at El Molino was really not that bad. Wanted a late afternoon lunch/dinner so I made my way over. Tip: the nachos are huge and one order was enough to share between myself and my girl. We ordered them with ground beef, which was tasty with a bit of a kick. They were also loaded down pretty well with cheese, refried beans, tomatoes and bite-size cubes of potatoes.

In addition to the nachos, I wanted to know what their tamales were doing. Sadly, they were out of the red beef tamales so I got a green corn one just to see. Not so much, not for me, anyway. There wasn't much to it, just a thin layer of green chile inside along with sweet corn. My special lady friend seemed to like it just fine.

I'll probably go back because the nachos were tasty, but I'd have to drive right past the new 2 hippies taco location and that might prove to be a difficult task.
