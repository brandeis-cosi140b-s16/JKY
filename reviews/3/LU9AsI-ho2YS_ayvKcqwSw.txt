My family and I went last night for late dinner around 8pm. The restaurant was not busy there were but a few patrons. We were seated rather quickly. We had our orders taken quickly and served pipping HOT you could feel the heat from the plates. My daughter had the trio (tacos and enchiladas) my husband had the shrimp tacos and I had the taquitos. Everyone was pleased with their food except me. The food tasted well except when I took a first bite there was oil still in the taquito which squirted out into my hand then burned my tongue! We had been here many times it was our favorite place but our server seemed to be the only waiter and was servicing 5 tables in all directions and often didn't check on us because he was so busy. I was disappointed, so sad because we really liked this place.
