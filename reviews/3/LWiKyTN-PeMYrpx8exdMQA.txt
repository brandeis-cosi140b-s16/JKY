Rubio"a is always a good choice when you want to grab some food quick, but you still want to keep it healthy.

I always order the same thing when I eat at Rubios. The Health Mex Burrito. It is pretty good and a much healthier choice than other fast food options. I have tried the fish tacos here before and they are very good as well.

This location is at the Food Court in the Red Rock Casino. The prices are higher than other locations, but that is expected of any eatery in a casino.
