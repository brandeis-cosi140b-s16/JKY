Was so excited to sample this restaurant and was not that impressed.  My partner and I showed up for happy hour and found the Margaritias on the rocks to be very weak - had two myself and both were identical.  The pork quesadilla was flavorless, however the Chicken Enchiladas had some descent flavor and the rice with corn on the side was very good.  It's worth one more try :)   If my next visit is anything like the first, I won't be returning or recommending this establishment.
