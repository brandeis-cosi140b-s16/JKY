seeings that it is located in an area where there is nothing good around here. it's pretty decent. the order taking line is sooooo far ahead of the cashier line its comical. (not really) they need a separate to go line for sure!! the decor is like the rest (its a chain) resembling a kindergarten class room. food is good, a bit pricey, but ok. 
it's really loud in there fair warning and turn up your hearing-aid and patience for the mass confusion in the ordering assembly line.
