By Default, the "-icos" and "-bertos" are two star operations, but this particular Federico's stands out a bit from the bunch in service, quality, and location and facilities.  Its a bit spacier and more relaxed than most.  Surprisingly affable and fast staff at this location.

In my opinion, there are one-star items and four star items on every icos/bertos menu, the key is determine which items are four star for you, and then try to not stray off the trusted path.  For me at Federico's, I can count on good rolled tacos and serviceable bean burritos, but I've been duped many times (while hungry) to delve into the numbered combos, and I regret it everytime.  The side beans and rice are just blah, blah, blah x 10.  The Carne Asada is pretty close to foul, and the shredded meats seem very canned and oversoaked.  

But its in the smaller treats where Federicos can win you over (nachos, maybe a flauta, simple burritos and of course rolled tacos), so the three stars is well earned in that regard.
