I hope this is not the best Mexican food available in the entire city of Charlotte and if this is what people consider authentic Mexican or even tex-mex - wow! However, the place is still fun and the food is belly-filling. The jalapeno cheese dips were crazy popular with my dinner mates - we ordered one with meat, one plain, and one with spinach. The spinach combo was addictive.

Service was fantastic and attentive and almost loving!
