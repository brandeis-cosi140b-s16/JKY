Located in the Orleans Hotel Casino, this is a Mexican restaurant that is pretty laid back not the festive craziness of Senor Frogs. The prices are very good and the food is not bad either. Is it worth a special trip, no. But if you are in the neighborhood, you could certainly do worse, at very least you can get a great Margarita. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
