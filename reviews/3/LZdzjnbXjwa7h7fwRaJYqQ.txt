First time I went to Qdoba's was on a business trip to California.  I told my husband when I got back, "If we ever pass by one of these, we should take you!"  Low and behold, we passed by one a couple days ago.  His repsonse, "It's good, I like it but wouldn't drive across town just to come here."  (We live on the west side and happen to be in the area.)

The food is comparable to Chipotle's but has a lot more different selections than just burrito's.  Had the nacho's and thought the cheese sauce they drizzle on top was delectable.  I gave them 3 stars b'c the food was good but not spectacular.  Also, the waitress totally skipped over my husband and went to the next customer in line.  Not a big deal of course but pretty carless, IMO.  

If you are a fan of Chipotle type "Mexican" food, I definitely think you should give this place a go.  Definitely "lighter" than "real" Mexican food but, I think, hits the spot.
