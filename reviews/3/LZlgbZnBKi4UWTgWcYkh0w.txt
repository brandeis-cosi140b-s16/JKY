I want to preface this review with two things; 1) I know nothing about authentic Mexican food, and 2) I am not very brave, culinarily speaking. Having said both those things, the BF and I like it here. The atmosphere is right up my alley; aesthetically pleasing to the eye and not too boisterous.  
I only will order a couple of things, but I really like those things. This night it was the Huevos con Chorizo (the other being the vegetarian sopes. SO good!) and it was pretty good. Usually it's just a lunch item, but they made an exception. It's chorizo and eggs and comes with rice, beans and tortillas. It's a really large portion and I made the rookie error of eating too much chips and salsa, so I couldn't eat most of it, but good none the less. The BF got a combo plate and was pretty happy with it too. It came with rice and beans as well. He likes the combo plates because you can get a variety of different things with a variety of meat fillings, i.e pork, chicken and beef all in one plate. I tasted his things- not a fan. I get people complaining about the blandness and things, but it there is a disclaimer of sorts that says (And I'm TOTALLY paraphrasing here) we cook our food mild to accommodate the masses, if you want it hot, we will make it hot. Like I said, not how they worded it but...for me, I do not like hot, so I'm fine with it. 
I have never had a problem with the staff either. They may not be as open or chatty as other places, but for most of them English is not their born tongue, so that's to be expected. If you don't like that, go to MadMex. English or no, they are always polite and attentive. There is also a nice seating area outside in the little courtyard, in which I love to sit and watch the crazies of the Waterfront.
