Stopped by for lunch with some colleagues and ordered my normal Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans, Sour Cream, Guacamole, Rice, Hot Salsa.  Since the weather was awesome, we sat outside and enjoyed the day.  The Burrito was actually kind of small for Chipotle....I guess they were stingy that day.

The only downside to sitting outside is all of the birds that bother you and fly overhead....you have to be careful.  Next time, I'll probably sit inside.
