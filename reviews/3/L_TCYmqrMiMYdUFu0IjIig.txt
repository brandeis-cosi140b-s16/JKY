I vacillate between two and three stars on this place. The food is OK, but only just. I had burger & fries and they seemed on a par with Burger King. The default is that they come with some sort of salad dressing added, so I had to request it be omitted. I admit I generally prefer only veggies on my burgers. I don't care for pickles, relish, or any sort of slimy crap. The manager seemed offended by my request.  There was no spicy mustard or salsa option. Fries were good, but not in the same league as Z's Greek just down the street. My wife said the tacos were OK, but not up to Julioberto's standards. The interior decoration was very good, a substantial upgrade from the prior incarnation. The place was very clean. The prices were high compared to the other referenced standards. We went on a Sunday, and the place seemed crowded with an obviously after church crowd with many church ladies and kids.
