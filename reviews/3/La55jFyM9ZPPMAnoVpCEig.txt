The wife loves their chips, cheese and guacamole. I'm a fan of their super nachos. Super nachos are great but the price is high. I wish there was a bit less meat and it was $1 or $2 cheaper personally.

Overall this is a pretty decent take out Mexican place. And somewhere that I visit fairly often during board game night at the nearby game store.
