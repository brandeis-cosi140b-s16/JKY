Dropped in for a quick lunch, and a quality check on this 4.5 star taco shop. Sunday afternoon, and AC must have died. Only there for a short time, no biggie. Chips came with a green, and a red hot sauce. Both delicious! Had a broiled beef taco, so-so, but the longanzia (spicy chorizo)  and nopales (cactus) was KILLER. One hit, one miss. Worth checking out!
