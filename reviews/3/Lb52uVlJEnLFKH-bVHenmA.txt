This opened in Bajio's old spot, and boy do I miss them!  That being said, I am hoping this place will get better with time.  Staff is clueless - couldn't  explain the difference  between the two types of shrimp they offered. Way too many staff crowding around and no one knew what the other was doing.  I was asked multiple times what I had ordered, and it was total chaos trying to get through  the line.  Very confusing because one section of the line is just  for burritos,  I think?  We ordered tacos and were told to move to the end of the line and the only option was salsa or no salsa.  Boring.

Barbacoa was really flavorful and tortillas were awesome.  Husband said shrimp was good.  Beans were ok, rice was bland.  We'll try this place again when staff get their act together.
