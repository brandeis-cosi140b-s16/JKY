Boy are those pictures deceiving! And Heather D. must be the owner or something because I was there just this weekend and the place DOES NOT look like that.  I didn't get to try the food but the chips and salsa sucked.  Even the salsa on a can is better than that!  Oh, and don't even get me started with the drinks.  They are lame, lame, lame.  I had to go to the bartender and ask him if my drink was a freaking joke.  No alcohol whatsoever and charged me $8 bucks for it.  The music and atmosphere was good but that's about it.  Hopefully I won't have to go there again.
