I've heard that this place is going to be taken over by a super-huge Circle K, so I figured I'd better try it while it's still there.  The service was super-fast.  Chips were warm, but the salsa was incredibly bland.  It tasted like plain tomato sauce.  I ordered the #2 combination: a hard taco and 2 cheese enchiladas.  The hard taco was a fatty, generously stuffed with tasty shredded beef, lettuce, tomato, and cheese.  The enchiladas were also generously filled, but the sauce, while tasty, was sparse.  The beans and rice were good.  They have fountain Pepsi, which earned them an extra star.  If you're the type who appreciates quantity over quality, you'll be happy with this place.  For me, the best thing about it was the murals outside.  The waitress gave me a hopeful "See you next time" when I checked out, but I doubt it.  Oh, and no bike rack.
