good food!! but the ppl putting the food together need to have more consistency.

I went a while back and they gave me a great amount of food for my money. I went back today and the lady was really stingy & pretty much gave me like half of what I got the last time. The food is kind of expensive so it would be nice to always get my money's worth.
