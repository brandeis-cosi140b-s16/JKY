I should have gone with a traditional roll. The  service was pleasant. The sushi maker was skilled. The ingredients were fresh. The plate looked great. The manager stepped in when things were backed up, checked on my dinner, and refilled my drink.

The problem- although well made and fresh, the sushi was confused. Japanese and Mexican cuisines are simple, which is not simple to do. A laundry list of ingredients melded into a roll where I couldn't pick out a flavor. I wanted to try the fusion. I had a good time. Next time, I'll do something simpler. Based on the effort they're putting in, it'll probably be better.
