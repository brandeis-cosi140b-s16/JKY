Let me start out by stating the food here was delicious . The service was horrible and i mean absolutely horrible! It has never been horrible like it was Thursday, Sept 21st. The wait staff was SLOW, Not engaging, Not present or friendly at all......UGH! I loathe horrible service, even if your food is good.
