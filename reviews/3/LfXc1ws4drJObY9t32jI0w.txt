Dan got the carne asada tacos and I got the rolled tacos but I feel like there were better things on the menu. My tacos were alright. $5 for three. It was a light lunch. 

Dan liked his tacos. He said 4.5/5 for the tacos.
Atmosphere and service is average. Wasn't blown away with friendliness or helpfulness but it was good. 
The chips and salsa bar was nice but I prefer thinner chips. That's just me being picky though. 

It was just alright. 
Wasn't in the mood for a burrito or chimichanga but maybe next time. They sound good. 

Food 3/5
Price 3/5 
Overall 3/5
