Had breakfast burritos here with the wife one Saturday morning.  We were the only people in the joint.  Roberto's food is never overwhelming but it's usually average.  This visit was no different.  The burritos are ENORMOUS, so you get a lot of food for your money.  I recommend adding salsa, they can use some additional flavor.  

This location was very clean, I'll give them that.  The salsa bar was clutter free and all of the tables were clean.  There are certainly better places for Mexican food, but Roberto's is reliable, inexpensive and quick.
