Fast service, friendly staff, and good food. I had the quesadilla since I am a vegetarian and my boyfriend had the Jack burger, which he said was the best he had in a long time. We came because we were going to a hockey game next door. Would have gave them 4-5 stars, but they didn't accept the coupon we had that came with our hockey tickets, which is the whole reason we came here. Not coming back because we don't live close, so the coupon was worthless. Not the waitresses fault, so we just paid for it.
