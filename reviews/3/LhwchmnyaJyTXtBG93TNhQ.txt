Was in town for a 2 day visit and stopped by this place for lunch with 2 guests.  We were in a bit of a hurry as we had a meeting scheduled in about an hour.  Food was quite good and fresh.  Service was excellent and speedy.  We had some of the lunch specials and they were very reasonable.  Would definitely stop by next  time in town.
