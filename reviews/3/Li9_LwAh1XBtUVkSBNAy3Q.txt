This place wasn't bad.  I actually ate here twice during a one week stay at the Stratosphere.  My biggest gripe was that the signs located around the retail shops at the tower advertised the Chile Relleno.  Both times though, they did not have the Chile's.  Also, the salsa bar only offered 4 types of salsa.  I'd loved to have seen a real variety here.  The food was edible though, and it's nice to be able to stay at the Stratosphere and  not have to be stuck eating the same things over and over again.
