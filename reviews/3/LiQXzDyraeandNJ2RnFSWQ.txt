I LOVE THEIR SIGN!  it stands out in that shopping center. I have been here twice and I have to say I really like the interior.  I especially like wood ceiling and the seating... so many options.  I sat with a group of 14 around the super huge square table and also sat at one of the marble high tables in the bar area as well.  Yeah... music needs some work.  I was thinking about dropping off a CD for the manager  Service needs work, but it is a new restaurant (though I didn't like hearing about how it would take 20 minutes to split a check).  I'll give them a little leniency with a 3 star since they are new.  Now how about the food? The mac & cheese is yummy, chicken enchiladas, and I like the mixture of chips corn and light/crispy flour!  Quesadilla is average.  I asked for sliced jalapeno and got their rendition which is regular canned and then tastes like they are soaked in sweet pickle juice.... didn't care for those.  

I am happy they have a late night menu so we have more late night options in the area.
