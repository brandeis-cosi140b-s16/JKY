The food has gone downhill recently. It used to be excellent, now it's only so-so. Meanwhile, the prices have gone up. I could understand the price increase, but not when the food quality has gotten worse. Lower quality and higher prices is not a very good combination. I feel like they should go back to the way the menu used to be. Or hire back the old chef. Whatever it takes to get the quality back.
