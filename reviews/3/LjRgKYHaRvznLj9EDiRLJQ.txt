I love how a taco shop that originated in San Diego ended up having three times the number of locations in Las Vegas.  Maybe it's because they realized the untapped potential of the drunk Mexican food market in the desert.  Maybe it's because they just can't compare to Mexican food in SD (ok this isn't really a maybe, it's true...more on this in a second).  In the end, I still appreciate that it's around.

Basically, the only time I've ever come here is one of two alternatives: (1) after getting back from a bender on the Strip or (2) after a bender the night before, struggling with hunger in the morning, and realizing that it's the cheapest and fastest food option available.  Regardless of the scenario, it always gets the job done.  Solid enough California burrito and super fries.  And most importantly, cheap!

But remember, don't expect the best Mexican food ever here.  You're only here because you needed to have Mexican food or else you would've died.
