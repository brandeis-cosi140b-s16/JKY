I still call this place Roberto's Taco Shop even though the cheap LED sign says otherwise.
     "Don Tortacos" is a very adequate and cheap alternative to high priced Mexican food;  knowing the area, there are quite a lot of them around. If I were to compare this place to other Roberto's Taco Shops, I would have to say that  this specific joint can't hold a candle to any of the franchises around the Las Vegas area.
     The quality of the food just isn't as great compared to sister franchises, and I really have no idea why. I could have sworn that restaurant chains were suppose to have the same recipe. One of my complaints is the very soggy refried beans they serve; the texture is unappealing and it's really more liquid than solid. I thought I was eating bean soup when I first tasted it. I also don't appreciate the lack of servings. If you're a Roberto's regular, you should know that the restaurant is very generous with their serving. This specific joint is not. I mean compared to other Mexican taco shops you still get a lot more, but it just doesn't live up to the Roberto's name.
     I don't want to sound like absolutely hate the food here, I actually like this place. I go here fairly frequently, given that I feel like eating Mexican food. There are a lot of things I like about this place. This specific taco shop's employees are really nice and helpful, and they're not dicks about hanging out 2 hours after you eat your food. This is also a great place for pre-drunk snacks, post-drunk snacks, and mid-drunk snacks. It's even next to a PT's Pub; get drunk then get fat. It's an amazing combination!

I suggest the Carnitas Fries, it's not on the menu but they'll make it for you. It's like an untouched potential.
