My biggest complaint is that the restaurant was FREEZING!!! I realize it's winter, but the AC was on inside. 
The pico and guac were delicious! I also got the fish tacos which were great. The ceviche wasn't what we expected... Not bad though. 
I wouldn't go out of my way to come here to eat, but I would come back again.
