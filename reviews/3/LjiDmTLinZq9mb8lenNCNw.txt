This is always a fun place to take the family and entertain some wild and crazy food options. Been coming here on and off since 1990 and not much has changed.

The food served here is an interesting fusion of Asian and Mexican with some hints of Jamaica. You basically walk up and fill out your meal ticket and hand it to the person at the counter. They are always very helpful and will even give you a sample to try out.

Normally order one of the spicy dishes. The Diablo Chicken and the Jaded Chicken or Pork are a couple of my favorites. I've probably tried everything once or twice and it is all interestingly good.

This is not a fancy restaurant and the strip mall that it is in is a bit ghetto. Inside has a large sitting area and there is a huge TV playing for those who like watch while they eat. Football for me today.

Come on over and get your groove on or check out their other Chandler location. It is much newer and not as dated as this location. Not everyone may like this place. It is surely a different spin on fast food and worth checking out. COOKIE!
