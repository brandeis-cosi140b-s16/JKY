I have been here a couple times and this is a really fun place!  The drinks are kind of expensive for what they are(Malibu and Coke) but the enviroment is so fun and they play really great music! I wouldn't sit down and eat here since I have heard the service is god awful but drinks with the girls is A-OK!
