I wanted to give Jalisco four stars, but my conscience just won't let me.  It's good, especially the carnitas and lengua tacos, but the refried beans were average and the carne asada wasn't as tender as it should have been.  Full of flavor, but a little chewy.  

Fast, friendly service, and the value is off the charts.
