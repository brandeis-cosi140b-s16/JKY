Pedro's really only deserves two stars, but more on that later.  Don't come to Pedro's in search of authentic Mexican food.  But there are some things on the menu that are perfectly fine should you find yourself here for some reason, at a loss as to what to order.  I would suggest avoiding most of the menu, which is essentially Tex-Mex T.V. dinner-type fare, except with molten cheese-drowned portions that could feed a T-Rex.  I would suggest, instead, the carnitas fajitas: the pork is very tender and flavorful, and the sauteed vegetables are tasty.  Not authentic--but perfectly fine.  They do have a good Tuesday/Thursday margarita special, though the drinks are too sweet for my taste.  I met my S.O. at Pedro's: hence the extra star.  It will always have a special place in my heart, and I'll keep coming back most Tuesdays for trivia night.
