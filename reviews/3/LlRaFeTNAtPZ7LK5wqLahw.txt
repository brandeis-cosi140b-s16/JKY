Closest thing to Taco Truck style.. I love the small tortillas and little scoop of meat, where it takes like 2 bites and off to the next one. I can eat these like potato chips!

Carne Asada: has got that authentic mexican beef marinated flavor, undoubtely savory in every way but ilve had much better!

Carnitas: quite impressive (I may just really like pork), again authentic mexican pork cooking.. 

I can definitely vouch for this place and its cheap! I think wednesdays they have 50 cents taco special too.
