Cute & Cozy little place to get Taco's downtown. The Urban location is creatively decorated with a spanish flare. It is very small inside however there is outside seating. They have a full menu including a variety of Chips, Tacos, Torta's and other specialties. Drink menu for those of you who like a little liquor in your lives. 

I tried two Chicken Taco's I will be honest they were ok. I am from here and have had good Taco's so I am picky. The taco's meat was kinda bland though they were garnished with fresh cabbage, carrots, radishes, green onion and cilantro. My taco's were fairly price for $2.50 each. Neatly wrapped in foil. They provide a full service salsa bar. Chips are sold separately. The food is cooked fresh to order and served fast. It is a nice concept with a friendly staff.
