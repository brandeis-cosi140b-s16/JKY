I don't come often, not because there is any thing I have against this place, there just is not much in the way of vegans eats. Their veggie fajitas are rather good. My omnivore friends have all seemed to enjoy their food as well.

By far the best two things about this place are; the awesome selection of tequila and it's proximity to The Visulite. I like to come here and try new tequila before shows at The Visualite.
