Notice LJ after last weeks visit to neighboring Long Jin - will LJ be our local go-to Mexican restaurant ?

simply place - order at counter then sit down for food to be delivered.  I was ordering lunch to-go.

Went with an asada taco ( $1.99), carnitas taco ( $1.75) and al Pastor ( $1.75) along with a beef empanada ( under $2) 

Food came out quickly, took home without thinking about salsa bar.  Luckily, server provided limes, green and red sauce.

The empanada ?  3 words - Where's the beef ?!?!  For some reason it reminded me of a puffy taco because it was 90% air and maybe, and it's a stretch, maybe 1 tablespoon of meat - not happy.

The tacos - all were decent - fair amount of meat but a slight ding for only one tortilla - and yes, the 2nd tortilla makes a difference.  I give a slight nod to the al pastor.

Will this be my go-to place ?  Not sure yet - I need to try a few more items and ask if they can add a 2nd tortilla to the taco.  overall, not a bad experience.
