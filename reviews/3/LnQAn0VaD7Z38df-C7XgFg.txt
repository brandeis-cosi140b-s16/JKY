Went in for lunch and got two tacos - one chicken, one pork. The menu is a little confusing and you're stuck gaping at the chalkboard on the ceiling while the workers stare at you, which is weird and not too flattering. I'd much rather have the choices on the glass in front of the toppings and myself or a menu on the side wall, so I can just pick what I want down the assembly line without having to listen to the explanation of each. I'm not a fan of Chipotle and didn't realize this is basically the same concept. 
As mentioned in other reviews, they didn't bake the enchiladas (my mom's choice) very long. I also had my tacos baked to melt the cheese which was a nice option. The tortillas were VERY good (we got the lard mix), the meat was a good quality and tasty, I liked the cabbage mix also. I added guacamole for $1 but it was little too spicy for me - most people would probably like it. The tacos were STUFFED and overall really good. I didn't try mom's enchiladas because she said the green sauce would be too spicy for me (I'm a wuss when it comes to spice, what can I say). 

Two plates with a soda for just under $20. Not the most cost effective lunch I've had, but seems pretty standard. Would love the menu location change/expansion, longer oven bake time, and a way to buy those tortillas to go.
