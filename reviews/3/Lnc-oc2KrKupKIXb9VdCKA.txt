Can I say delicioso!! The tacos are fully loaded with guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, and beans. There is a lot of Mexican joints around the valley that are pretty much have the same concept. This place is a little different its def worth the drive! The reason why I'm giving it 3 stars... The price. It's TOO over priced!
