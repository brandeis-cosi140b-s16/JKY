My family and I love Macayos, we eat at the Tempe location all to time. We came her for a quick lunch and ended up staying much longer than anticipated. The food was delicious like usual, the fried ice cream is great! But the service was terrible. We waited forever to get our food, even though there were only a few people there. We will not be eating at this location again.
