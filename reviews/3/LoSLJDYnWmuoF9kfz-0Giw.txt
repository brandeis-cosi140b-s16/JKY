This place serves great chips and salsa as a complementary starter. The disappointing news is that - that was the only good thing out of everything that we ordered for dinner. The chimichangas were bland - no flavor at all! Even the burrito did not have any spice or sauce in it which could make it more edible. I would recommend the manager to seriously revise the recipes to make the food more exciting and flavorful!
