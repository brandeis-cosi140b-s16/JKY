Normally when you go to a mexican rest. you order a margarita and it's just OK. Not the case here. Julio G's has the best drinks we've had at a mexican rest in the area. Reasonably priced too! (Would recommend the pitcher, it makes sense if you're having more than one drink). 
We're big fans of the mexican pizza with jalapenos and cream cheese too. It's enough to feed 2-3 people, and def fills you up.
If I could make one change, it would be the chips and salsa that's brought out before your meal. They aren't anything to brag about, and maybe a mean dip could replace one of the 3 salsas to switch things up.
