I had dinner here and it was totally overpriced and not worth it. There are far better places to eat at MGM that are overpriced and somewhat worth it. This place had strange strange service. This woman was so damn talkative, like talking to herself in front of us at our table, and would routinely vanish for long periods only to be seen chatting up various customers. I watched her chat up a table across the way for literally 10 minutes while we waited for the bill. She seemed nice, but it got in the way of reasonably timely service. The food itself was ok - more aptly - uninspiring. There's gotta be better Mexican food around. I know it. 
And guacamole 10 dollars? I don't care if it's made at the table that's highway robbery. On the other hand the salsa and chips they bring you are very good.
