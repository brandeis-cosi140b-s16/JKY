Let me start this off correctly: this is, by no means, a fine Mexican dining establishment. Going to FillyB's is less about the food and more about the experience. Well, I'd be lying if I told you that I don't crave the carne asada fries from time to time here. 

At end of the day, though, this is your typical late night munchies spot that is open ridiculously late and always has decent food. It's not the cheapest, it's not the fastest, but it's definitely a staple and something you need to experience after a long night. You haven't truly lived in Tempe if you don't have any great stories that ended with you at Filibertos. Just do it, but don't expect too much.
