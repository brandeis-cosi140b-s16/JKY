I finally tried Blanco last Tuesday night... there were 4 in our party; not enough to make a reservation.  Luckily, when we arrived around 7:15 pm, we didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes to get seated.  And we must've lucked out, because our service was prompt and attentive.

The guacamole is a perfect appetizer to share... and the chips and salsa are worth the splurge.  I shared a Caesar Salad to start, and that was quite tasty as well.  I was debating what to order for the main course and when I asked the waitress about the salmon she said she didn't eat seafood but that she's been told the salmon is 'buttery.'  Buttery salmon?  Really?  That didn't sell me on ordering the salmon, but it was what I went with after all.  And although I would not describe it as buttery, I will say it was good.  It was a generous serving as well, so I didn't mind when Jared started eating it off my plate.  The rice with veggies that it was served with was also tasty.

Overall, Blanco didn't blow me away, but I am sure I'll return sometime.  You can't go wrong popping in for a drink or two and some chips, salsa, and guac in a trendy atmosphere.
