Who the hell comes to Vegas for Chipotle? 
Why I write this review for Vegas? This place was the first time I tried Chipotle. I ended up ordering a chicken burrito with no rice and no beans. I was thinking to my self, "they call this a burrito?" 
Anyways, this place is empty every time I past by and I the food quality doesn't feel right. There's something in there that just doesn't feel right, like crack? 
Oh yea, almost forgot, the chicken was burnt.
