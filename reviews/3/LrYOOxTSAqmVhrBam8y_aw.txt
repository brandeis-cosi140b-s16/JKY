Okay, it looks like the other guy holding a beer in his picture already wrote an elaborate review.  So I'll keep mine short.

2:00am, headed home from downtown Phoenix with a friend craving carne asada.....  BINGO!  Great burritos 24 hours a day and a fantastic salsa bar, including marinated carrots.  That is all I have to say.
