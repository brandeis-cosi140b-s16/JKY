Definitely overpriced for what it is.

I had been to the Dilworth location before and really enjoyed it. This time i had a Creative Loafing deal and decided to try the Stonecrest location. I was definitely underwhelmed. We had a reservation for 7:00. When we arrived we were promptly seated. I immediately felt like i was at Chuck E Cheese or Red Robin. Kids Galore!! So much for date night. Our tables were so close together it was a little uncomfortable. 

We ordered the Fajitas for two with Steak and Beef. The little tapas they brought out were pretty tasty. The fajitas were a little overpriced in my opinion. We maybe had 10 pieces of chicken on a platter of zucchini, onions and mushrooms. $30 for some veggies is a little crazy. 

I would maybe go back but not likely.
