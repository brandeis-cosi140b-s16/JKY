I def had high hopes for this place from the hype they showed at Bite of Las Vegas & the reviews I read on here. I was pretty excited to see they had a burrito w/ chicken, steak, & shrimp, but they said they were out of steak. How do you run out of steak when it's a staple on your menu?!? When I did find something to order I realized that the setup is much like Chipotle. They did have an extra item which was the potato squares. I ended up getting a chicken burrito w/ the potatoes, cheese, brown rice, salsa, & lettuce. The burrito was a very good size, maybe slightly bigger than what you would find at Chipotle. Bit in & expected awesomeness, totally not the case. It didn't have the same taste as Chipotle, then again it didn't taste fresh. Not sure if it was the chicken or what, but if I do decide to try them again I would wanna try something else as it wasn't very tasty.
The establishment was clean & the staff was helpful & friendly.
