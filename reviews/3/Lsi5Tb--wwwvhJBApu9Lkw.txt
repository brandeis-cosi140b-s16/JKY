Food is pretty good.  Drinks and appetizers are kind of expensive, compared to entrees.  I've had the enchiladas and the pollo relleno, which is creamy and really doesn't take "mexican" to me compared to the entire rest of the menu, but tasty.  In general, this places tries to be fancy gourmet, and sort of succeeds, without the "oh my god" experience you get at truly amazing places.  Service is just okay both times I've gone.  Crowded, but in good way, both times.  I'll keep coming back, but it's never going to be one of my favorite restaurants.
