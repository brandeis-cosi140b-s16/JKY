I highly recommend the margarita sampler.  You will not be disappointed.    If you're going for Happy Hour, that's the best I can do for you, since every time I've been for HH, I get so frustrated waiting for a waitress, that I go sit a the bar or just leave.  The entrees are similar to Chili's, Chevy, or other Mex/Tex-Mex Fare.  Nothing particularly special or unique, but not bad either.
