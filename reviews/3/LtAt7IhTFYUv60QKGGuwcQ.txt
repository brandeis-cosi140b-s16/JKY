I would rate them 4 stars except the portions are small and the drinks are over priced. The beef rib entree was one (yes) one beef rib and dry for $24 and no sides. I am a big fan of tapas, but tapas are $8 not $12. No happy hour is a deterent as there is no house wine and the wines by the glass start at $9 for anything drinkable.
Great pork belly and 7 spice soup, but I have to say no to a $12 Arepa
(Argentine cornmeal sandwich) it's a sandwich.
Sexy Atmosphere Yes! But there are too many closed restaurants in Scottsdale to rely on atmosphere and high prices.
