I'd like to give these guys at least four stars, but they're going to have to refine a couple of items to get there.  Let's start with the food... definitely worth the trip.  The shrimp ceviche, which another person said 'tasted like limes', is an excellent starter... and tastes like limes because that's the way ceviche is made (with lime juice doing the 'cooking' of the proteins with the citric acids).  The guacamole is also quite good... no frills, just tasty.  The entrees that I've had there (been twice now), have all been quite good.  The Cochinita Pibil (pork dish) was great, while the lamb chops were slightly overcooked... but still good.  

My biggest issue is the presentation... of the food and the location itself.  The shrimp ceviche shows up on two fried flat tortillas... making it difficult to eat (can't pick it up, do I make this into a salad?).  The guacamole is spooned onto a plate.  The dishes come out without much for frills or presentation... and everything is served on big boring white plates.  The exterior has no sign, there is nothing in the windows, and the interior is fairly stark beyond the brick walls of the building.  I'm sure with some time, they'll step it up... but probably should get after it sooner than later.  

Overall, yes, I'll be back... as there isn't much for good Mexican in the area of the square, so that's a bonus... but I'll look to them to refine and improve quickly in the coming weeks before they fall off 'the list'.
