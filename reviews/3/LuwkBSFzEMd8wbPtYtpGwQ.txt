Me and the girlfriend decided to come here before seeing zumanity. This restaurant is right next to the grand canal shoppes. So we got seated and we ordered some chips and salsa for which of course they charged. I ordered the taco platter and my girlfriend had the burrito. The food was good but nothing special about it. My tortillas were a bit dry by the time they got to my table. Overall the restaurant was good but Im not sure if I will be coming back
