Decent food I thought overall. The warm chips and salsa was great. The huge margarita in a soup bowl sized glass was very good. The guacamole was more like an avocado style dip than being real smashed avocados with lime. The fajitas were decent, more veggies than meat but had a good flavor. What was strange is that I was there at 8 PM on Friday and the place was dead empty other than one other table besides me. Service however I must say was excellent.
