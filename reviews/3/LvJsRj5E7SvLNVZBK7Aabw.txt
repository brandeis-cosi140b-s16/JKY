Newly opened Mexican restaurant tucked away in the Dobson and Germann area.  I would give the place 5 stars for decor, the owner has taken such great effort to make the restaurant look like old Mexico on the inside.

The food was good but not great.  I did relish on the tomatillo salsa brought with the red salsa and chips.  The portions were pretty big, no room for dessert and had to request togo boxes.

Ordered:
Seafood Tacos (great with excellent presentation)
Tia's Plato de Carne Asada: Tres Carnes - beef, pork and chicken (huge)
Tia Rosa Burro (huge)

I will definitely return and review, but overall I did like this place.
