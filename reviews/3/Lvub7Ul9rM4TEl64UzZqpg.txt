OK, it's been awhile, but I have a happy memory of a green enchilada special. My co-worker insisted we had to go there. Nobody spoke Anglais, so it had to be good, and it was. While it didn't equal the old Restaurant Mexico in Tempe, it was a good time, and the old building was comforting. This is important in a city that doesn't tolerate anything old.
