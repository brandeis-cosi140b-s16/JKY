Stopped here on a business trip to Charlotte.   Great outdoor seating area that gives nice views of downtown.  The service is friendly and efficient.  The food is of normal bar food quality, but the price matches well with the quality.   Overall a great place to stop of you want lower priced, average but tasty food, and prompt efficient service.
