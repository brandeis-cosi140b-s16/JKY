So I went to lunch here on a Friday and the place was full, but then again it isn't all that big. The interior is fairly nice for a Mexican food joint and what first caught my eye was the salsa bar. At least 10 different kind of salsas for the taking. This is a good omen. Gourmet Taco's feels incredibly insincere. It is like when MacDonald's have "a la carte" on the to of their back lit wall menu. It becomes a joke. 

I had the shrimp tacos that comes when ordering some cheesy slur that most surely contains the words 'baja' or 'cabo' or something silly to that nature. I also ordered the horchata to go with my lunch. The order is two decently filled tacos with both double corn tortillas. The shrimp wasn't the long monster that I expected but instead three minor in each taco. This was OK. Then it was filled with some kind of cabbagy mass that was completely raw and tasteless - but would look good on a  picture. This was not OK - tasteless filler is pointless. The horchata was tasty, but way too much ice in the glass. The salsa bar did not disappoint - they have hot and mild and spicy and seasonal, in this case some strawberry salsa that was strangely tangy. But I love the variety. 

I liked the food. Not all of our party did enjoy their meal, but I did. But it is too pricey for Mexican food.. because it isn't that spectacular at all. The price would be the discouragement for me, when it comes to my return factor. I have had better tacos for cheaper. that is the bottom line - but it wasn't bad. Not at all. 

In summary; meal was good but too expensive.
