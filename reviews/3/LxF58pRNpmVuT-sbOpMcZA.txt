I've been going to Oaxaca for years and the place has always been known to be pretty rundown and shady looking but now it looks amazing! The remodel has made it much larger and the layout is modern featuring a patio and separate bar. 

Nothing else has changed so you can still count on the same all around good, dependable food but with a much nicer ambiance.
