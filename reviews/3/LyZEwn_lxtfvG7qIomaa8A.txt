Monday night I was craving carne asada so I stopped by Eribertos drive thru, since it has been at least a year since I last came here. They really need to fix the lil speaker you order through, I can never understand what they're saying! Any way, I ordered a quesadilla & a #8 for my hubby, which is carne asada tacos w/rice & beans, & myself a carne asada burrito w/rice & beans added inside of it. When I pull up to pay I notice a sign w/all their dessert choices. The tres leche cake looks yummy so I order 1 of those & pay w/cash since I already paid for our dinner w/my card. After I paid, the girl working the window informs me the only dessert they have left is cheesecake. I really don't want it but I already paid so I say it's fine. I am waiting almost 10 minutes for my food, which is a tad annoying, but honestly at least it's fresh. My burrito was good & not too big of a portion like some places. Hubby enjoyed his quesadilla, tacos & rice & beans as well, definitely made 2 meals out of it. The cheesecake was not very good & I only ate about half & tossed the rest. Not sure how soon I will be back b/c they are way overpriced for what it is, I spent over $21!
