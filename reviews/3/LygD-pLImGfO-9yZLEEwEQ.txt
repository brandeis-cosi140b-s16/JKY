Been here a few times since they opened and, unfortunately, am not bullish on El Guero Canelo taking the Valley crown for best sonoran dog. As pretty much the only good non-UA Basketball experience in Tucson, I had high hopes for EGC-PHX. 

Each time I've visited, the sonoran dogs were very mustard-heavy, the caramello was light on the beans, and the onions were charred dry (even the large ones, which are easier to prepare). Still, their carne asada is excellent and their salsas are as good as I can remember. Here's hoping this location is just having some growing pains because those of us who know the original are really rooting for this one to meet those high standards.
