Their burritos are HUGE!! Almost the size of my forearm! But bigger is not always better. It's slightly above all the -bertos places but I've definitely had better. The carne asada just didn't do it for me. I like my asada with nice grilled marks and I didn't find that here. Also, their salsas were boring; it was watered down and no substance. 

I've tried some of the Chorizo here before and that was pretty good. And I've heard the menudo was excellent, but I'm not a fan of menudo so that doesn't suffice.

From what I've read it looks like the Carne Asada fries are the business, which I might give a try the next time I roll through the drive-thru.
