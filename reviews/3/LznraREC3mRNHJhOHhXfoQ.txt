I am very mixed on this place. In some instances, I have had some great food and others, not so much. Here are some of the good instances: 
-Queso Fundido dip is pretty tasty and taken above the typical velveeta dip that alot of restaurants offer
-Arriba Taco Salad with shredded beef is actually  good and has a lot of veggies in it. I love the jalapeno ranch that comes with it. Its a pretty massive salad too! One of the less spicy items on their menu as well if you are not into spice
-Mexican Pizza with shredded beef - Not bad but definitely not enough guac on it. Either order with extra guac or sour cream, or do as I did and order the queso fundido dip and dip the pizza in it  :O
White Sands Chimi - Pretty good actually but extremely spicy for my taste. The husband loves this!
-Flautas plate - Not too bad and definitely not spicy. They tend to give you lots of guac with this  :)
-Chips, salsa, and bean dip - The chips, salsa and bean dip are decent. The only thing I would suggest is adding onion to the bean dip but then again, I am a total onion lover! The more onions, the better!
-Arriba red sauce - This sauce has a good flavor. I like to get a side of it and pour it on my rice
-Fried Ice cream with strawberries - By far my favorite item at Arriba!!! Everything else listed above has been good/ ok but nothing I would say is great. However, this fried ice cream is great! I LOVES IT and it might just be the best fried ice cream evar!

Here are the bad instances:
-Chili Poblano - Too spicy to where you can't even tell what your tasting. I ordered this the first time I came and was not a happy camper. Don't let the one chili on the menu fool you, it should have 3! Granted, I am a wimp when it comes to spice but I can actually handle spice if there is a good flavor. This was just knock your eyes out of their sockets spicy and my stomach felt like crap afterward
-Arriba sampler plate - Everything tasted crappy and old. Tamale was very dry
-Shredded Beef tacos - Flavor of the meat is blah and the taco shell always seems to be soggy when I have ordered these. I love tacos but not these ones!

Now about the service, almost every time I have been here, the service is not very good especially when it comes getting more water. For a place that claims to be spicy, you would think they would automatically be bringing you water but they don't, you have to ask for it. Then apparently, you have to ask for refills because they never come back to refill it. I always dread that when I go to Arriba. They claim that they don't bring you water because of the current drought situation, however, look outside. There is a giant water debacle that runs morning, noon, and night! WTF? 

I will say that they have a decent menu with many options and I love that there are pictures so you can see what everything will look like. That is the only reason I came back again after my first experience which was not pleasant. To sum it up, this place is simply ok in my book (except where fried ice cream is concerned, they make a glorious one!). However, you cant make a meal out of a fried ice cream. This is never one of the places that pops into my head to go to unless I want a sugar fix but I come here often since the hub likes it.
