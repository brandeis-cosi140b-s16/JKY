After sampling the guacamole, salsa and ceviche at the Yelp Event, I decided to give this place a try. I had not been to Bombay Spice so I actually enjoyed the decor (not having anything to compare it to).
The bar is pretty cool and if it wasn't for the previous reviews I would have had no idea that it used to be a Middle Eastern joint. I am pretty middle of the road with this review. It was good, but there were a few areas that could use improvement.

Pros
+ Snapper - Covered in tomatoes and peppers, very flavorful, but the sauce was a bit overwhelming... Still good though.
+ Bacon Wrapped Scallops - Dish came with 3 huge scallops, grilled veggies and rice. It was pretty delicious.
+ Build your own guacamole - Awesome that pomegranate seeds are an option (kinda lame charging extra for them though)

Cons
- chips (a bit stale)
- paper menus (when I am paying $20 for a meal I would prefer a decent menu)
- paper napkin roll ups  left lint all over my pants

I had received a $15 off card from the Yelp event. With this our bill for guac, two entrees and four margaritas was about $80. The server took our card and ran the bill, then she added gratuity to our bill when she returned. That bugged me... Auto grat for 2 people?... She would have gotten a much bigger tip if she hadn't had done that.. Her loss. 
Overall the meal was decent, but with so many Mexican options in the valley I can't say I'd return.
