This Mexican restaurant is actually inside the Red Rock casino. The menu has a lot of variety and there should be something for almost everyone. 

There are a ton of TV's so you can catch the game while you are eating. Strangely enough, there was actually a wedding in the back of the restaurant while we were there. The guests kept passing through the main part of the place. Interesting.

While the service is very good some of the dishes were not well prepared. Most of the meats lacked a lot of flavor. It wasn't an awful experience but it could have been better to be sure.
