Clear from the reviews that this is the "UNLV" Chipotle.  It is also pretty proximate to the Strip without being on the strip, so if you are looking for a low maintenance meal away from the bustle (and prices) of big time Vegas, this location is suggested.  The restaurant itself is just like every other Chipotle in the world.
