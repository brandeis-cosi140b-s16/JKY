Yuck! Shrimp Tacos not so good. Salsa not so good. Waitress was dumb as dirt. 

San Felipe's looks like a fun place to grab a drink but I wouldn't eat here again! We came here on a double date last night and it seemed pretty busy for a Sunday night. The atmosphere is crazy. They made it look like a cheap bar in Mexico and there is all sorts of things hanging from the ceiling like sharks, inflatable bottles of Suaza, and pinatas. 
As far as the food goes I knew it would interesting after I tasted the salsa. Our poor waitress didn't have a memory which made things interesting. More Chips? Sure twenty minutes later! Ketchup? Sure another twenty minutes. She was a sweet girl but it got really annoying.
