Inconsistent :( 
There are times when the food is good and times when it's not. 
I usually order the chicken poblano enchiladas, the general flavor is really good. There are times when the dish is drowned in sauce, other times just a sprinkle; sometimes the peppers are grilled sometimes they're raw.
Tonight my husband had to beef burrito it was literally just ground beef rolled in a tortilla with white cheese sauce on top... That's it!?
