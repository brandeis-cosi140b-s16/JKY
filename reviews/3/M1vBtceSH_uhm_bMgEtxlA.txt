Sat at the bar...great bartender, very friendly. I am a fan of sitting at the bar at most establishments whenever possible because I feel the service is better. Plus, if I am solo, I don't feel so awkward. The guac was decent. The short rib tacos were very good but tiny. My bloody mary was nice and spicy, just like me. The espresso churros I got to end the meal were a more generous portion and where quite good. I liked the decor of The Mission also. I would give it a 3.5, however I am rounding down to 3 because of the price (yelp should consider half-stars).
