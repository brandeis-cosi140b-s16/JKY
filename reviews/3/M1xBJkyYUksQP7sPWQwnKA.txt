Mediocre at best. Plate dinners average $10. Big turn off. They were understaffed and not that busy, yet it took them a while to take our order.
The food is ok, nothing spectacular to cause me to do cartwheels over. I know a better place just up the road from them with better prices, better selections, and fresher ingredients.
