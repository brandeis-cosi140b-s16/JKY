Oh how I so wanted to give this place more stars......But, first time here, and I asked for a recommendation, and the lady (owner?) said Steak Burrito. So that's what I went with, and I added all the stuff I love (cheese, sour cream a spicy salsa mix, fresh cilantro, etc.). 

First off, the thing is HUGE! Not QUITE "big as your head" huge, but quite large nonetheless. Second, the steak. It was unfortunately very tough and chewy. Kind of hard to enjoy when you have to chew the thing to death. Also, the steak was kind of bland. I was expecting that wonderful fajita flavor, but it was just bland.

The other ingredients were decent, but nothing out of the ordinary. I did love the fresh cilantro though.

It comes with chips, so my meal (without drink as I brought it home) was $7 and change. Not bad.

I will go back and try their chorizo or ground beef to see if that makes a difference. And I WILL tell the owners that they need to improve the quality of their steak.
