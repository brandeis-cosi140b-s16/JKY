So after coming here this is like restaurant style food in a fast food joint. It takes a little bit to get your food. They come out and bring you chips and salsa and silverware. I ordered a letter k burrito but had way more beams than green chili. The enchilada was ok. I was going to leave this place am4 stars until I tried my sons ground beef taco. Was very greasy I think the ground beef has been sitting in a vat of grease all day long. Might be back to try the chilireeno. Hate to give a new place a 3 in my home town. It's hard to get good new places. I think they are new and will figure out some new things to improve. I would try it has tons of stuff on the menu.
