Food was good, service was terrible.  I'd love to see this place get a bit of a face lift, the whole inside as looked the same since they opened the doors, and it is really starting to show.  For my money I think this location has the best food, but the worst service.  I couldn't believe how terrible the service was when we came in yesterday.  

Come on management live up your longstanding awesome reputation.
