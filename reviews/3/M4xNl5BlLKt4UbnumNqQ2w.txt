The size of the asada burrito in the first photo is very misleading. I ordered one and it was rather small in comparison to the picture, probably 1/2 the size, and much smaller than your typical Roberto's type place.

However, the carne had great flavor and the quality of the ingredients were quite good as well. So, definite plus on the flavor.

Staff we're friendly and speaking Spanglish was definitely a plus on getting my order placed. Salsa bar has a good variety but nothing is labeled and can be confusing.

If the quantity matched the quality they would've gained another star.
