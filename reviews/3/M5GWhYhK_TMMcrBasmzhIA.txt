First time here...came on a recommendation from a friend who was visiting from Florida.  I am a big fan of Mexican, but would say I had an average experience. The service was great but the food did not leave a remarkable impression. I did like that they used mahi in their fish tacos. My fiance had a beef burrito which she thought was okay.  The sauce bar was unique and gives you a good selection to please your palate.  Also, I felt the food was a little overpriced.  I'll give the place a second try...
