Nice place, good atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff. It was quiet when I came, so really relaxing. Good music too. The food was decent, but not many lunch/brunch specials. We ordered the braised duck taquitos and bean burrito. The sauce and spice kind of drowned out the flavored of the duck, but it was still good. Bean burrito was okay as well. A bit on the pricey side for lunch. Seems like a better place for drinks and such, since they have many more drink specials.
