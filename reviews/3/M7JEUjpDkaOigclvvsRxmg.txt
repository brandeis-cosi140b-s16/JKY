I would like to first say that I'm not really into Mexican.  I have a few staple dishes that I like to stick with...okay, it's limited to quesadillas and tacos, but a girl knows what she likes.  

I've been to Verde twice.  I've had their green chili pork and chicken chaquiles.  I like the pork, it was a bit spicy for me.  That really doesn't mean anything because I have no tolerance for spice.  All in all, it was good.  Loved the tortillas with the pork.  

The chaquiles were okay.  I like tortilla chips, so I thought I would like this, but unfortunately I didn't.  

All in all, Verde was only okay for me.  I'll go back because of it's convenient location and there are plenty of other things on the menu that I would like to try.
