I think the 3 stars kinda says it all really: I've had better and I've had worse.  Portions were generous for the price and the food was good, but there was something missing from the whole thing.  There just wasn't a punch to the food that made it memorable.  However the salsa fresca was great and the chips were warm and tasty.

Would I recommend someone go here?  How about this; I wouldn't recommend against it.
