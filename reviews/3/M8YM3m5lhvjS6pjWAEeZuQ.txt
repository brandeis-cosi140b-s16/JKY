Since my kids went to ASU I have wanted to try this place meaning the restaurant because there are many locations.   I know your suppose to go at 3am not 3pm but I got there. Shared taquitos with guacamole and had my first Horchada.  I usually don't like these kinda drinks but I enjoyed it anyway.  I would go back at 3am or 3pm .
