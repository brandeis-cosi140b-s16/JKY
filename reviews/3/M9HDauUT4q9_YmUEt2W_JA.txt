I was in the area shopping for a car and needed to grab a quick lunch.  I found this location via the Yelp app.  I ordered:

Veggie Works Burrito, $3.39
Bean Burrito w/Green Sauce, $1.09

The food was good for a Del Taco, you don't expect it to be top notch.  It did take a little while to get prepared.  I don't know why either, they weren't busy when I was there.  I'll chalk it up to fresh food.
