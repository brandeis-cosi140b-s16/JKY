Atmosphere and decor is awesome! 

My enchiladas were tasty I got the chicken and the rice and beans are really flavorful. The chips are really good too.

The queso was just ok and my husband wasn't digging the flavor for the tacos. So that was disappointing. I would come back but he said he wouldn't so we're a bit divided.
