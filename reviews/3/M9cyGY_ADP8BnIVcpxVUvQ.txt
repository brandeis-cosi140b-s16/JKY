Went here with the Supper Club in November for a 6:30pm dinner. Our table ended up being downstairs, and we had to go through the kitchen. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the ambiance downstairs - candlelit lighting, cozy ambiance, and menu specials written on the chalkboard (felt very New York).

The waiter was prompt in arriving to take our drink orders and to offer suggestions. I opted for the Prosecco ($10) since they didn't offer Moscato. 

We started off with the Roasted Garlic Plate ($16) based on the waiter's recommendation. I expected the garlic taste to be overpowering but it was quite subtle, especially when it was spread over a piece of bread and topped with the cheese sauce. I don't know where they get the garlic, but those things were humungous! (The garlic was almost the consistency of butter, the way it was roasted.)

For the entree, I opted for the Pasta Heidi ($15), which consisted of green chile linguine, chunky slices of grilled chicken, and a chipotle cream sauce, served over a grilled tortilla. The plate came out piping hot and smelled so good! The pasta tasted so fresh and although I can handle spicy foods, this dish had my mouth burning. I could only handle a few small bites before I got full; had plenty of leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day.

Two of the gals ordered the special of the night, something with bone marrow, an enchilada, a tamale, and a side of what looked like fettucine alfredo. The other gal ordered the Chimayo Chicken ($22), which is stuffed chicken breast with a side of asparagus. I took a bite of this and found it pretty spicy (stuffed with poblano chiles), but delicious!

We shared a chocolate dessert, which is decently sized and enough to share between five gals. I could only handle one bite as it was too rich and chocolatey. 

Our waiter was very attentive, knows the menu, and provided very prompt service.
