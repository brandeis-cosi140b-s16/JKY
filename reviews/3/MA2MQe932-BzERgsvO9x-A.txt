I've wanted to come here for awhile, and decided to do it for my birthday. For a Wednesday night it was packed, but we seemed to have gotten the last available table-woohoo! I didn't bother with the guac since the majority of the reviews don't really tout it, and chose to start with the langosta tacos appetizer. They were my favorite part of the meal! So good I could have eaten all four and ordered more, but instead I chose an entree. I had the poblano chicken and JD ordered the chile relleno. Neither of us were really crazy about either dish. Both were on the bland side and my chicken was totally overcooked. We kind of swapped food and I liked his more than mine just because it had scrumptious zucchini! 

All in all, we weren't really impressed except for the taco app. The service was so-so, not terribly friendly or outgoing and the entrees weren't memorable or delicious (or worth what they cost in my opinion) I'll probably not return, there are other places that serve better food at better prices and with much better service.
