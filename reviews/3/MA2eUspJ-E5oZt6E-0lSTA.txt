Great chips and guacamole. Thursday's special burrito was hearty but only filled with steak, no rice, guacamole and sour cream. Can't beat $5 special though. Shrimp fajitas ($15) were great. They didn't skimp on the shrimp at all. The churro arrived hot and was delicious. 

The demerit for stars is also because of its odd location in the lobby inside Doc Holidays. We did notice regulars come in who were greeted by their first nes, which was nice. We'll definitely be back to try more items on the menu.
