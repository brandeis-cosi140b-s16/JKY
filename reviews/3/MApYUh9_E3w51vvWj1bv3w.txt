the standard metro-phoenix fast-food taqueria, although this location has been known to have a "girls gone wild" element to it during certain times of day - due to its proximity to ASU. if I'm drunk and craving this genre, I personally prefer Texano's (a hundred feet west on the other side of the light rail tracks), but this spot is a little cheaper. Go with the Arizona Burrito (or the California at Texano's)... a giant flour tortilla stuffed with carne asada, cheddar, pico de gallo, and curiously, french fries. Just incredible. and stay away from the combos, which are basically just styrofoam containers filled with canned refried beans and day-old rice. Wash it down with a Horchata, then get to bed.
