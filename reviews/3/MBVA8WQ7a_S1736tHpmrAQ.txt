On this latest occasion I had a massive Wet Bean & Cheese Burrito smothered with Cheddar Cheese and overpowering Enchilada Sauce, along with a Shredded Beef Taco with tomatoes and guacamole.  Unfortunately, little guacamole was added to the taco, and it was of the creamy sour cream variety.  An excellent pliable fried corn tortilla was utilized in the preparation of the taco.  And, the Refritos were hot and smooth inside the nice flour tortilla casing of the burrito.  As always at a Roberto's Taco Shop, hot carrots and peppers and two types of hot sauce were on hand.  Paper napkins are tightly controlled here, even though a need often exists for multiple numbers of them.  

Overall, a solid taco shop, with 3-1/2 stars earned on this particular visit.
