This is my favorite hole in the wall Mexican place. Everything on the menu is super cheap & pretty big. The only reason why I gave 3 stars is because the last time I ate there with my husband, we ordered the usual carne asada burrito with cheese & ended up with really bad food poisoning later that day :/
