The white fish taco is so far the best. I've tried other things, but they are not as good. During busy times, this place is a headache. I ordered something to go on a late Saturday evening and went to Cabos to pick it up. There is nowhere really to stand and wait other than beside the bar, and some rude waitress yelled at me for being in her way. Other than having no designated area just for pickup, the food is good and I will be back.
