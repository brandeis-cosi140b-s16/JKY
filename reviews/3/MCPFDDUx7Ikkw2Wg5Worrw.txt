Great lunch spot.  Tacos are good and cheap.  Not your traditional mexican taco, more of refreshing americanized taco.  They are always fresh and refreshing.  My only complaint is often times they are too salty!  If they could figure out the salt, I might give it four stars.  Overall, a quick and easy lunch and you won't be disappointed.
