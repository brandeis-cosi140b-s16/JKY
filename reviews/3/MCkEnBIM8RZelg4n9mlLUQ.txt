Living in Tejas, it's easy to get good Mexican food. I'd say this is baja at best. The taquitos were ok...I'm not big on cheese rolled up and fried. The guac was fresh and very tasty. I had the Fish Tacos Baja Style and I have definitely had better...these were way bland. 

I had a bite of Michael's dish and it was FANTASTIC...the Sabana de Pollo with Chimichurri (paper thin seared chicken breast topped with beans, melted cheese, grilled onions and serrano chile served with rice and pico de gallo salsa)...and I don't like chicken.

And I've never met a fried ice cream I didn't like...this was one of the best.

This menu is hit-or-miss...the items are either incredible or completely blah. The service was great, probably due to who we were sitting with...i'll take it though.
