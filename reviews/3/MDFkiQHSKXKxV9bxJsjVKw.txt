Was at the Renaissance Hotel in Glendale for a scrapbook convention today. We were starved afterwards and not knowing the area, we stopped here cause it was close!

All three of us went for the lunch buffet and their house margarita on the rocks. $9.99 for the buffet and $6.50 for the marg. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, but I did enjoy what I ate. Tacos, enchiladas, salad, desert, fruit, a very spicy (to me, which probably wasn't too spicy) carne adovada, beans, rice and a whole bunch of other stuff I ate that I have no idea what it is.  All three of us enjoyed it much!

I had flan for the first time. I thought it was good, but didn't have anything to compare it to. The other ladies thought it was tasty too, and they eat it often.

Service was great. Thanks goodness my water stayed full. I needed it with the spice.

Place is beautiful and has some cool decorations on the outside, like the huge margarita on the roof!
