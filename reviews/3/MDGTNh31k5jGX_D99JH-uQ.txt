I used to go to this place all the time when I was in high school and living in Tempe.  The food hasn't changed much but the interior got a well needed overhaul.  This is just an average taco shop.  Good greasy food at very affordable prices.  Its nice that some of the combos include a drink and there is a soda fountain for free refills.  I always stop by the place when I'm home visiting when I get the late night munchies.
