My son and I are trying to find the best Mexican food around Surpise AZ. We came in around 3:30 so it was slow.  The service was very attentive, our booth was clean and the nachos were amazing! The chips were thin hot and chrisp with ample toppings. Yum, we loved them. The portion size was huge, we could have just ordered Nachos. Our meals were both good / average. I'd go just for those nachos again. We're curious if they are always that good
