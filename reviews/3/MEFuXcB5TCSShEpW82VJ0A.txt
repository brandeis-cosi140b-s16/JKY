Its good, never had a bad experience here. Good service, good atmosphere. Great for neighborhood walking. Nice bar. 

Nothing amazing. Overly americanized, and expensive for american-mexican. 

You're not going to be disappointed, but was I inspired, excited to go back to try something else?...no

For that go to Azteca on Woodlawn. As authentic mexican that your going to find in Charlotte.
