I was here a few year back, but I was not a yelper yet and I cannot recall how the food was.  My MIL loves this place and I a GC from the restaurant.com so off we went.  

The service and the food was better than I expected.  We ordered a manny's appetizer platter to share.  Not too shabby.  I got ordered the chicken chimi.  It was not too bad.  Good but nothing special.
