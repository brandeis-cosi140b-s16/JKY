As a long time Crue fan this place was heaven to me. Only because I loved the memorabilia and non stop videos playing the whole time we were there.
Other than that....the reviews are spot on.
Where is the service? Why aren't they seeing this and doing something about it?
No one at the front when you walk in. The restaurant was pretty dead on a Sunday evening.
Food was just ok. Mexican food. Nothing spectacular. 
We saw our server a couple of times but I'm glad we didn't need anything or we probably would've had to hunt her down or serve ourselves.
Would I go back? Probably. But just to have drinks and watch videos.
