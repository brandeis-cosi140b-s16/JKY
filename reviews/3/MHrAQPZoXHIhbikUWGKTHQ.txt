Mariachi Aguila plays here now only on Fridays, from 7pm to 8pm.  Led by Marcelino Cervantes (hijar), it is one of the best groups in the Phoenix area.  For decades this place had been the "planta" for Aguila, with three-hour shows on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.  No more. 

I used to drive to Glendale from Scottsdale every weekend for the mariachi show as well as the reasonably priced and reasonably good mexican food.  They cut the hours for the mariachi, dropped the sound system for them and  lost my business.

Weekends now you can dance to live banda, salsa and norte√±o in the "Mariachi Room" until late closing.  Not my thing but there are plenty of hot,  young latinas there that do.  

It is one of the oldest restaurants in the Valley, about 65 years now, and is a bit aged and tattered.  Another novelty about it is that the owners are among the 87 Republican, Mexican-Americans in Greater Phoenix.  I was tempted, but did not deduct a star for this.
