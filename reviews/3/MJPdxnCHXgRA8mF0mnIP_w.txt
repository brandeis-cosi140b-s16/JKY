We were out shopping, and something quick and simple to bring home sounded great.
I ordered the Bean Crunchtada...and I always ask for green sauce to replace the red taco sauce as my preference. We also ordered a Beef Crunchtada the same way, and then two additional regular crunchy tacos. 
Drive through was very quick. Probably the fastest we have experienced at a del Taco. We asked for the extra hot sauce on the side, and were given about 6 packets.
Food stayed hot for the drive home, and everything was pretty tasty. The only thing that I was slightly disappointed with was the amount of toppings on my bean crunchtada. There was enough of the beans and the green sauce, although there was not much lettuce or cheese. Not a big deal though, as the flavor was good.
