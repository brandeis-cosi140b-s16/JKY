Very clean restaurant not far from Surprise Ball field.  Horchata was too sweet, carne asada was pretty bland but it was high quality meat.  The chile relleno was quite impressive!  The chicken sope was decent but the masa was a little too firm to cut through without a knife.  Got our food very quickly.  Disappointed there weren't chips and salsa...I felt like I got half a Mexican dinner.  :). This was average Mexican taqueria to me...but I'm spoiled in California.
