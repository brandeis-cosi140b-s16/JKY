The ever climbing prices and dissapearing grillied onions have casued me to not visit here as much.

Luckily the light rail constrtion is a thing of the past and one can esialy approce this location.

The line to order inside can be a bit akward as there is not much room for it.

On my last trip I went with the grilled veggie burrito as the cheaper bean and cheese burrito now only exists in my memories. It comes with a few chips.

I do enjoy the salsa bar that has sweet and savory salsas cilantro and little peppers.

The food is decent but for a $7 lunch there are cheaper better Mexican options out there.
