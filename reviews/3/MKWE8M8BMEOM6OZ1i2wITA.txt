First let me say I want this place to continue to succeed.  Aliante and its restaurants are huge in giving this community some flair.  I had been to both previous incarnations of Mexican restaurants in this spot and will say that I found the food at The Salted Lime to be on par with them.  The biggest difference i noticed us the menu has been streamlined greatly.  I sat at the bar which was not very busy.  The bartender was nice and the service was good.  The highlight for me was the Navy bean dip that came with the salsa.  It was excellent.  I could have just even that and been happy.  I am not a fan of the chipotle salsa although I'm sure some will love it.  I had an order of Nachos.  The portions were huge.  The beans were okay and I could have done with more cheese.  But overall the taste was fine. I would go back with friends or family or for their late nite happy hour.
