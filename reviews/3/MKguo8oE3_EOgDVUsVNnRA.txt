Revisited Macayo's for a family birthday -- based on my past experiences and subsequent one-star review, I was wincing at what we might get.

The food is still blah. As I mentioned in my previous review, it's cafeteria-like and nothing worth writing about (ah, the irony). It was properly temp'ed, so there is that.

However, we seemed to hit a bit of a jackpot, server-wise, which can make up quite a bit of ground. Our server was a very nice person -- very attentive, nice to the kids, and hooked the birthday-person up with the free sweets and singing. I did see the manager wandering around and then sitting at a booth chatting with someone -- she did not acknowledge us even though I made eye contact with her a couple times as she walked by. I've always sorta liked the whole wandering manager asking if everything is okay bit, even if it's a gimmick.

A solid three stars this time.
