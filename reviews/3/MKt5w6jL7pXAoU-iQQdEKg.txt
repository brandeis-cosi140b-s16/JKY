The food was pretty good pub style grub. The service is friendly.

It is funny I have only been there twice and both times in a small group. Both times they forgot only my order and everyone else was done eating when I got my food, what are the odds.

Maybe I'm a sport but, I just can't trash a rating over a mistake. Too many Yelpers pan a joint because the waitress stepped on their foot...
