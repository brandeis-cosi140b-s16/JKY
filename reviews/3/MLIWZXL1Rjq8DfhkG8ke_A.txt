Carnitas Guanajuato is a very authentic Mexican restaurant. I decided to try them after driving by them so many times. We ordered the barbacoa, cheese enchiladas, and pork skin taco's. The food did take a long time to arrive even though it was not busy. It was actually comforting because it meant the food was made to order and not pre made and microwaved like most Mexican restaurants. The barbocoa was made with lamb and was super amazing. The flavors were truly divine. My wife had the cheese enchilada, not really my type of Mexican food but it definitely was loaded with cheese and she loved it. The pork skin tacos were good but not what I expected. I was thinking the pork skin would have some crisp to it but it was soft. It was definitely lacking in texture and appearance but not in taste. I probably would not order it again, but definitely something I am glad I tried. I would rate the food at four stars but the service was between a one and a two. The servers were not friendly and welcoming. They were also extremely slow even though it was not busy while we were there. Everyone has bad days though and I am excited to go there a second time.
