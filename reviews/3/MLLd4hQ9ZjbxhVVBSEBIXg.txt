This place is good if you want decent Mexican food fast, or just a late night bite to eat.  They will not blow you away, but certainly several steps above Taco Bell or Del Taco.  The prices are fair, ingredient quality is average (sour cream lacks flavor), and the menu selection is wide.  All and all you can't go wrong with a stop off at this Valley wide chain!

Good: any of their quesadillas.

OK: nachos

Avoid: Chimichangas
