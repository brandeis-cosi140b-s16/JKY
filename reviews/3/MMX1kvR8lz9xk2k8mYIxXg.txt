Tucked away in the shopping center directly across from the Hard Rock sits the Paradise Cantina.  The place is decorated like any other cantina with signage of beer, and the overall feel that you're in Mexico. There is a huge outdoor patio that offers a view of the strip in the distance and a big room inside. 

Stopped in here on Cinco de Mayo after driving by many times and seeing it kind of busy, but of course on this day it was packed and even featured a mariachi band playing outside! Ariba! 

Ordered the El Dorado margarita, which at $16 was a bit pricey if you ask me.  That's like something you'd pay for on the strip.  Also ordered the 3 taco entree plate, one chicken and one steak, which was A-Ok, nothing special.  The food is VERY american-ized Mexican food.  The rice and beans it came with were kinda disappointing.   All in all the food was... ehhh decent but nothing special. 

The ambiance and overall feel of the place was better in my opinion.  As well as our server, she was awesome!

Would I go here again or recommend to a friend to try?  Maybe just to get a beer or two but that's about it.
