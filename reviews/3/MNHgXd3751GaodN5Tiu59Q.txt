I agree with Kit's assessment - mediocre food in general, but much better than Qdoba and Chipotle, the only other options for Mexican food nearby.

The portions are pretty big - a grande quesadilla was almost too much for me to handle, and I was starving.  The sauteed veggies were a nice touch (black beans, onion & I think zucchini) but I would have liked a bit more cheese.  The Mexican rice was very authentic and took me right back to a little restaurant in Buenavista - pink, tasted of chicken stock, studded with peas.  The chips seemed a little stale and the salsa wasn't the greatest, but the entire meal (grande quesadilla with chips & salsa, side of rice, and a soda) was less than $7.

Even though it's not great food, it's cheap and a good value.  I would definitely recommend Veracruz over the chain Mexican places.
