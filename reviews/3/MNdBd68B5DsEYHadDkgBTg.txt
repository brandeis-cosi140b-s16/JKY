Love this place! Service can be pretty slow with the cocktail girls, but the atmosphere is like no other bar! Sand in your feet beer in your hand!  Literally!  We went for Halloween and had a great time! But there were some gross creepy crawlers around, and I don't think it was apart of the Halloween decor...anyways definitely a good time!
