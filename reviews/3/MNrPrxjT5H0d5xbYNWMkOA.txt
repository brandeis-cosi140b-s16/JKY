Just like everyone else said, similar to chipotle. Not great but not bad.  Came for their promo on Mango Mojo BOGO - salad or burrito. I got the salad with the tortilla shell. The girl serving didn't exactly look happy to be there and mumbled when she asked me questions but no big deal. Salad was good overall the pieces of lettuce were really big that you have to cut it into pieces yourself. For those who like spicy, their mango hot salsa is maybe closer to medium so those who like medium, order spicy. For those who like spicy, try adding their non-mango spicy salsa.  Hopefully that will help up it a notch.
