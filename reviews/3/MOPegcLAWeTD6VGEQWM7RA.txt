This small little eatery serves up huge breakfast burritos that are easy on your wallet. We shared a steak and eggs burrito (~$4) and a machaca and eggs burrito (~$3.50). The steak and egg burrito had a generous portion of meat and egg, with flavorful, thinly cut steak. I liked that the machaca had veggies in it such as tomato and onion, but I couldn't taste much of the machaca in the burrito, and the flavor of the other ingredients tended to drown out the beef.

They also have your standard fare such as enchiladas, various burritos, tacos, as well as menudo. 

We also tried some horchata ($1.70 for large size). It was cool and refreshing.

Condiments are basic, and they have a tub of individually packaged green and red sauce for you to go with your meal.

Overall, the breakfast burritos were good, but my favorite choice for a breakfast burrito is still at Los Favoritos.
