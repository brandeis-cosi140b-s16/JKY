Sooo first off it was really hard to hear in drive thru. Ceasar bowl i ordered had no cojito cheese, which i was looking forward to. It also had a tiny bit of dressing and that was it! It was so good the dressing too i wanted more! I ordered a hard taco which was not hard lol i dont think it was even fried. Oh and it came with shrimp on it which i dont know if thats the norm for a hard taco but i was expecting chicken. Brc was dank! Lol good flavor for a bean rice and cheese burrito. Iced tea passion fruit mango yummy
