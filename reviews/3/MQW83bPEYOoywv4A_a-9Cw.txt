Definitely an interesting concept of fusing Chinese and Mexican cuisine. It is an eating experience that you won't forget, and while I have mixed feelings on the experience, overall I think it was a good one. If you're a first timer to Chino, it can be a little overwhelming listening to their 10 minute introduction on how to order and combine the different foods. The lady was very helpful in her explanation, and I ended up telling her to give me whatever she liked best. The food itself was pretty good overall, I enjoyed some of the combinations a lot more than others. I think as you keep eating at Chino, you would eventually hone your choice of combinations down to what you would best enjoy. For a visitor, I left with an experience and some pretty decent food.
