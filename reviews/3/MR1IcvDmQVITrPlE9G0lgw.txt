Nice place to sit outside and watch sports if it's good weather! Service is a bit slow and the waitresses don't seem to care much.

Week nights its typical college hangout, decently priced beers and draft selection. The tortilla soup is HUGE! Don't plan on being hungry for more. Also, the tacos are a bit small but are great with some Cholua. I'd recommend the chicken.
