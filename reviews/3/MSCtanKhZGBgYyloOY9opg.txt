SumoMaya is very nicely decorated and trendy.  Acrylic chairs for the tables, sushi bar seating if you want, and then your standard bar seating.  The patio doors were opened for our dinner last week but surprisingly the restaurant wasn't hot at all (I can't image the AC bill).  

The menu was very interesting and it was hard to make a choice.
My opinion of what I ordered
- the Pastor Street Tacos (2 for $6):  The quality was great but they seemed smaller than street tacos which made me question the price.  Seemed very over priced to me, but yummy none the less
- the Green Tea Cocktail ($9): refreshing but wasn't really strong either
- the Pork Belly Ramen ($16):  This was fantastic.  Large portion, tons of pork belly, and just very well made.  I would absolutely order this again if I happen to come here again.

My friends ordered:
- Shishito Peppers: pepper roulette she called them.  Some where hot and some weren't.  I don't typically order these but that is the norm for this type of dish, so I learned something new.  I tried one and it was very tasty.
- Seasonal Mushrooms: Very yummy
- Tuna Tacos:  FYI the taco is deep fried and not soft like typical street tacos.  Also very small like mine.
- Bacon wrapped dates: there were about 6, maybe 8 dates in the dish.  My friend liked them.
- Sangria:  Not very strong but yummy.

I would go back to sumo maya for a special occasion, the ambiance warrants it, but I don't think I would go back for just regular dinners out.  Just too pricey for me.
