I was craving burritos so I figured I would stop here to eat since it was near my gate.

FOOD: okay
The GUACAMOLE was probably the best thing we had.  They make it fresh for you at table-side so you can request what you want or don't want in it.  The CHIPS are kind of hard though, so after awhile, my jaw started to hurt. haha! 

SERVICE: so-so
At first, the waiter was on top of everything -- friendly, patient, attended to our table quickly.  But after we got our food, the service was horrible.  Our water glasses remained empty, it took forever to get our check, and forever to get our card back.  The waiter seemed to be too busy flirting with the hostess or something.  I guess he didn't come here to work....

PRICE: typical for the airport
