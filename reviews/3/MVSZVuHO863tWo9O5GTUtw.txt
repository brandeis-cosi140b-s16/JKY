I went here last night and it is ok.  They fry their taco shells before preparing the taco.  It was something different from the others and overall I say this place is ok.  It is close to the house, the prices are good and they are open 24 hours.  If you are in the mood for some decent Mexican food, this is not a bad place, give it a shot and give your opinion.
