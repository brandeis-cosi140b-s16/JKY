Had been waiting for a good opportunity to try this truck out since I am a huge fan of New Mexican cuisine.  Enjoyed a sampling of pork tacos ($5), green chile chicken stew ($5) and a Sloppi Jo ($6).  The pork is very similar to carne adovada...tender with great flavor from the red chile sauce.  The stew was very good, although if you have spent much time in New Mexico it will probably leave you wanting a little more spice and substance.  The Sloppi Jo was definitely unique, incorporating the pork, a sunny-side up egg and pickled onions served with a tortilla and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again.  Although I didn't get the chance to try everything, the sopapillas looked authentic and they were even hooking up the Frito Pies.
I felt that portions were a little small for the prices, but I will likely be back thanks to the quality of food and perhaps a slight crush on the owner...lol.
