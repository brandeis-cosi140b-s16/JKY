Maybe if I write a review like Dallas G, I'll get ROTD.  Here goes:

"Who am I but a slave to the forces of nature?  As a slave, am I free to pass judgment on those slaves toiling aside me, dawn till dusk (at which point I go and fornicate with whomever may be willing)?  No, I am not, and as this commonest of men will tell you, no one should ever cast such noble servants of the world order to the depths of a poor Yelp review.

So I say five stars to any old establishment that can churn out even the most mediocre of food!  Qdoba is just such a place.  Good people with good intentions, making decent food for other ants in the giant ant farm we call life.  Go there, enjoy yourself, bask in the glory of it all."

But I am not Dallas G, nor would I want to be, because he is vegan and that makes life inordinately difficult.  It also means that his burrito had probably 900 calories fewer than my burrito, which was essentially the same except with two cups of queso sauce and a bunch of steak.

Of course, with queso and steak means that there will be at least a modicum of taste, and that is true--but I say that the food is average there, and only deserving of three stars, because I don't know if it was the salsa or what, but there was a strange flavor that permeated the entire burrito. Not a bad flavor, but not a good flavor--it almost was like eating two pounds of roasted tomatillos in a burrito.

Finally, I begrudge them for having water that came straight from the bottom of an overly-chlorinated pool.  Qdoba is decent, worth a meal once or twice a month, max.  But order a real drink.
