Went with a Groupon and won't be back. The food was mediocre at best.  The cane asado in my burrito was slightly larger than ground beef and not flavorful. My husband had tacos with crispy shells which tasted like store bought. Nothing seemed to have been made from scratch, seemed more store bought like the average chef would do at home. I has the mango Margarita and my.husband had a Cadillac both were too sweet. Our waitress was very nice and did try hard.
