The outdoor patio is so cute, but seriously it's waaaay too close to the street and parking lot. One does not forget that traffic is nearby due to the frequent noise and the persistent smell of exhaust.
However, the drinks are divine (lots of margaritas from which to choose) and apps are varied and pleasing. If the server warns that a dish is spicy, he/she is not messing around. I absolutely love spicy food, and I was not disappointed. 
Although I miss the old Carmen's restaurant at this same location, Wedge seems like a pretty good addition to downtown Champaign.
