Loved Chef when he was at House of Tricks. the food at Revival was good but we were expecting more. The menu is way too limited: sandwiches, a few salads and not much more. I don't believe Chef is living up to his potential or stepping out of the box. He needs more choices. I had the duck breast sandwich and it was good, but the homemade potato chips were way too salty (and I LOVE salt). my husband had the special soup: chicken asian noodle: was good but had a bit of a fishy flavor. They did have decent but not huge wine/beer choices. We enjoyed our meal but will likely not return or at least wait for several months to see how things progress.
