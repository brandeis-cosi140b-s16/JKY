I came here with my friend for lunch today; we both had wanted to try this place out for some time.  As other reviewers have mentioned before, the music is absolutely way too loud here.  I don't know if the owner reads yelp reviews but they need to change this; I honestly had a hard time hearing our waitress because the music was about 60% too loud.  You've been warned. 

We ordered the shrimp toritos for an appetizer and they were pretty tasty; basically a banana pepper stuffed with shrimp and wrapped in bacon.  I was relieved that the sauce they were served in was not too salty, but I thought that a spicier pepper might have complimented the dish better.  We both put a generous helping of spicy chipotle sauce on them to "perk em' up".  We shared the bacanora shrimp and were glad we did so because the serving size was more than generous.  The sauce was really unique and the shrimp was really flavorful; the rice and beans were both bland.  Speaking of bland....the salsa here was a joke, there is no way they make it there (super watery and not spicy at all).  We agreed that we would both come back and try new options because the menu is huge and looks really great.  Our server Heidy was super friendly and perky and was very helpful with recommendations.  Next time I come here I'll make sure to sit as far away from the speaker as possible and hope for the best!
