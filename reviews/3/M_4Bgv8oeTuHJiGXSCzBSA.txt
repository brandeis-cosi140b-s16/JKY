This place is great food and u have to wait a little longer than some other places but its worth the few extra mins.. The breakfast burritos r so yummy. If u have never been to a location just once hive it a try. U will like it, better yet get the fries and carnie asada or chips and carnie asada the best. I have not tried a lot of stuff on the menu but I am pretty sure everything is pretty good.
