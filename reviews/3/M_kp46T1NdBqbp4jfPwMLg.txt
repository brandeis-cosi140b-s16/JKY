Called in and ordered to go. Got a Grande Burrito, which I've never had before and it was good. Pretty big too. The Jalape√±o Cheese Fritters are a no though. They were pretty flavorless. The meal came with chips and salsa. They literally give you a big white bag FULL of chips and then like a shot glass full of salsa. Like....huh? Ok maybe not a shot glass full. More like two shot glasses. All in all it was pretty good. Was going to give the guy who brought out my food a tip but he put my change on the counter when I was reaching out my hand to get it which I feel is kinda rude.
