Great little hideaway place. Food taste great, great service. I gave this place 3 stars only because my soup had very little broth & was warm, but not hot. My hubby had the Carne Asada Tacos. The tacos $1.89ea. I'm used to paying a little less for the same type of Tacos but nevertheless they were good.
