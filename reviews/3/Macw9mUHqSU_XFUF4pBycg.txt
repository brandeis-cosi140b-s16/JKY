The grilled veggie burrito was decent, the salsas thick and delicious.  My criticism would be the yellow cheese in the quesadilla.  I don't think they claim to be authentic, however yellow cheese is a no no in my book.  I would have given it 4 stars however it was cramped, uncomfortable and cold inside...That is a fast food restaurant trick to get ya in and out quick..I guess they don't want customers hanging around too long.  Overall I would go back but I would take my meal home and eat in a more hospitable environment.
