You can't beat the Kids Eat Free on Sundays.  I can bring my three kids and they have lunch (more than they can eat) and a drink. My husband and I order off the lunch menu- a combo with rice and beans and with tax the bill comes to $18.

The problem is the yucky water- so any drink I try... water obviously or iced tea or soda tastes moldy/bad.

The free chips with salsa and bean dip is my favorite part. 

Spinach Enchilada- good
Chile Relleno- okay
Charro Beans- okay
Spanish Rice- yucky (though really it has to be awesome for me to like it at all)

If I didn't have 3 kids eating free I wouldn't eat here.
