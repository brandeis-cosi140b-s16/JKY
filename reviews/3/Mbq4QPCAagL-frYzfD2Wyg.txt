Their white sand burrito tastes like it was frozen in a freezer, then warmed up enough to serve. I decided to give Arribas the benefit of the doubt after my "gross" white sand burrito, and visit again. This time, my husband and I ordered the Mexican pizza (called Abodaba, or something?) I am not kidding... It made me want to vomit. I didn't want to make a fuss or anything because we were with a party of 10+ people. But, someone else in our party ordered a burrito with the same meat that we had on our pizza and said the meat was making her sick too. We told the waitress about it, and she brought out a different pizza, but with beef this time. I thought that was nice of the servers... except that by the time they brought out a new pizza, our party was ready to leave. We put it in a take-out box and finished the leftovers later. Regardless, I will not be visiting Arribas again and would discourage others from visiting too.
