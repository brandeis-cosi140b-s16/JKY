I like the food here but it seems as though it's hit or miss on getting it fresh. On one visit, I ordered a Baja salad and when I got home the salad looked like it was a few days old. I've also noticed with all the new restaurants opening around them they are a lot less busy and as a result don't have as many staff on hand so it takes longer to get your food. Dinner time there was one person running the register and serving and one person cooking.
Not a bad place if you don't mind waiting a while for the food if there are a few people in line.
