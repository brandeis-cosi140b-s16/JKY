Despite the outside appearance and strange large outdoor-style bench seating, this place was pretty tasty.  

The customer service was good, although they put my rice and beans inside of the burrito rather than on-the-side, as requested.

I ordered the carne asada burrito, which was huge and freshly cooked.  I was surprised that it tasted as good as it did seeing as it didn't seem like the meat had been marinated or seasoned thoroughly.  My favorite carne asada is marinated and freshly grilled, but this will do.  

I asked for the spicy sauce and that was really, really good.  I'll be coming back primarily because of that salsa.

They also deliver and serve a wide range of different menu items, both of which were very appealing.  I'll give it another shot.
