Mucho Taco falls closer to 2.5 stars-average.  The prices are very good and the staff was very friendly.

Let me start with some positives:  the salsa was fresh and tasty as in these were whole tomatoes 5 minutes ago.  veggies on the tacos were also fresh and crisp.

I had a fish taco & a carnitas taco-total about $4.50.  The fish was decent but the carnitas was pretty gristly.  I overheard the kitchen staff talking to a customer and found out that they make liberal use of the "L" word here.  That's right, old school cookin' for better or worse; Lard.
