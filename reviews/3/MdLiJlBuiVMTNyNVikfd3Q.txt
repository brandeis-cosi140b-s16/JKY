Ordered a cali burrito and had nothing i thought would be in it. Ordered sour cream and paid for it, but when order came out there wasn't any. I asked for some but person at counter didn't understand so i waited a few more mins to get it. Very clean lobby and salsa bar.  Sopapillas were pretty good for $1.99
