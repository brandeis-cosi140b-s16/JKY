OK, so I re-visited Some Burros today specifically for the Chicken Fundido special. Somehow they managed to pack a ton of flavor into this chimichanga-esque dish for the awesome price of $5.00, so much so in fact that i've gave them another star. This dish is great, no question about it, and for only $5.00 I might become a Wednesday regular.
