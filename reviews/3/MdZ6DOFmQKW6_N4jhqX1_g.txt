It's just your regular Filberto's but it's Julio's....

If you want the ultimate Filberto's/Julioberto's experience, hit up the Filberto's on Thomas St and Rural Road.  That place is awesome!  It's a nice restaurant experience with a kickass bar!  The people who work there are really what put it over the top.
