I'm not a huge fan of fast food, but the macho nachos here are trouble! Recently had a bad day and stopped in, devoured them on my own- no shame, eating the pain away.
They're good though- portion is HUGE and the dish is heavy. Initially they look to be swimming in sour cream, but the pickled jalapenos balance that out pretty good. Amount of beans and cheese is fairly low, so these aren't really a "heavy" dish that will feel like a brick in your belly afterward. 

This place also has pretty good fish tacos, served classic-style with corn tortillas with a nice sauce. Tasty, would order again- pair of tacos comes in a $3 order, upgrade to shrimp and the pair goes up to $5.

Service, even in the dead of night, is friendly. Have yet to dine in. As others have said, given they have the same price point, this chain is head and shoulders above Taco Bell's menu offerings and quality.
