Solid 2.5 stars as a water refill is as elusive as the unicorn.

The menu isn't extensive. I ordered chips and salsa (the hot is actually really good) and chicken enchiladas. We also ordered a Dos Equis Amber and a glass of chardonnay. Was anything overpriced? Yes. Are you in an airport and also in one of the most overpriced cities in the US? Yes. So for the quality the price was fine.

Our server was all over us to order but non-existent once we ordered and when it was apparent we weren't ordering more drinks. She was up at the bar talking up a customer while we sat waiting for water. By the time we received it we were ready for the check.

I'm giving a 3 as the food I had was good and filling but the service was spotty at best.
