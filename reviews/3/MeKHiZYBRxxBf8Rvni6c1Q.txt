I've had take-out from this location a few times since it's conveniently located next to my husband's office, but dined in for the first time recently.  A solid 3.5 stars.

The restaurant is nicely decorated, and we had excellent service as well.  While I enjoy the hole-in-the wall places with the best Mexican food, sometimes I want to read a menu that doesn't offer me the opportunity to sample the food the last patrons spilled all over it.  And sometimes I want to use a restroom that has actually been cleaned in the last month.  For this I sacrifice great food for good food on occasion and Ajo Al's fits the bill.
