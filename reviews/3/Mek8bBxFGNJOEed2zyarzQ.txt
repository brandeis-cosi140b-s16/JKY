The food was pretty good. The services was HORRIBLE! That's why this is a 3-star review and not a 4-star. The manager sat at the bar and did nothing else. The waitress came to our table twice (once to bring us chips/take our order and another to bring the food). We had to go up to the bar and ask the manager to get our check. No refills, no "how is your food", no sides that we asked for 3 times. NOTHING. We won't be returning. I'll check out another location instead.
