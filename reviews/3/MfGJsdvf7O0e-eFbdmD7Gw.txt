Customized hand-rolled burrito-style rolls in a fast-food environment. Definitely tasty, but don't come here actually expecting sushi grade quality. Also, don't talk about these with a real sushi chef, you'll probably get smacked in the face.

Expect a fast food environment with somewhat better than fast food quality service.

Worth trying if you are in the area and hankering for a snack that's something like sushi and burritos, but not really exactly like either. Basically, it's alright.
