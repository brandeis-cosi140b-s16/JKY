This place was ok; I like the more authentic approach to the tacos: using two corn tortillas. I didn't like how the beef and chicken was a little dry and lacked full flavor. They were generous with the cilantro which is always a plus in my book. I will say that it's nice to have an alternative to chipotle or qdoba downtown that's more authentic and not too overpriced.
