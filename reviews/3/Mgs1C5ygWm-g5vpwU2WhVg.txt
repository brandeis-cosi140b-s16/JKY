Nothing terribly exciting here. I had the chicken fajita, as did a friend, and we both agreed that it was rather bland. If anything it actually tasted pretty awful. My partner on the other hand had the Atwood burrito and he couldn't stop raving about it. To each his own. Their margaritas kept me happy, though. Oh! We did get free chips and salsa for checking in thanks to good 'ole Yelp! So that helped some.
