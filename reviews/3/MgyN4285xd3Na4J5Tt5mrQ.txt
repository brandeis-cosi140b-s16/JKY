Dick's Hideaway is adorable and charming, which is a rarity in Phoenix.  As I walked into the restaurant, I immediately saw it as the kind of place that I could bring out of town guests to in an effort to convince them that unique, soulful restaurants can exist within strip malls.

We sat at the bar and ordered a beer and a glass of wine - good selection at reasonable prices.  For our meals, we decided on the Chimayo Chicken and the Tamale Plate.  Unfortunately, both were mediocre.  The chicken was a little bland and sounded better on the menu than it tasted, which at $24 was annoying.  The tamales were dry, although when we got some extra red chile to put on top, they improved a bit.

I still have high hopes for Dick's Hideaway, but I'll need to hunt to find the best menu items before bringing guests here: 3 stars
