This place, according to what I have heard, was supposed to be like Globe-Miami mexican food.  So Megan and I make the trek out there, it's in AJ and we live in West Mesa, so it's quite the drive.   We are so excited., as I grew up in Globe and hardly ever get up there anymore.  And I LOVE the mexican food.  Irene's, Chalos, Libby's El Rey, etc.   It looks like a Globe place, and the people in there defintely have that small town Globe hick look about them too.  The food......just ok.  What was weird is that the taco meat was nice and warm, but the taco shell was cold.  For god's sake, heat up your taco shells, Elvira!  Megan got a combination bean and green chili burro enchilada style, and I got a combination red chili and bean burro enchilada style.  Both had one taco.  They were....ok.  Service was great though.  Not worth the trek though, won't go back.
