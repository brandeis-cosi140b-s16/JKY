If you are in a rush and need to get in eat and get out, Via is not the place for you!  I've been here 6-7 times and every single time the service has been so slow!  I'm pretty understanding when you are short staff'd and all, because one time it was pretty apparent no one showed up for work that day. Seriously, I saw our waitress once in 10-15 minutes, and it was during the day, so there were not that many people there.  It was a little embarassing because I'm pretty sure I suggested the place, to a couple of people who had never been.  That was just one time though, but I will admit, they are pretty slow all the time. I can handle the service so anytime I'm in the area, this is the first place I suggest, because I really do like the food though. Its similar to the mexican food I grew up on at La Palma, which is now a CSV, so any mexican place I eat at is compared to LaPalma.  I miss you LaPalma, especially your take home Hot Sauce mix!  I've only been here once at "diner" time, and it was packed!!!  I usually go for some lunch, to sit in the tiny bar area with my corona, lite of course.  I need to go back on a cool day to sit on the patio and try the margarita's enjoying the fact that I will not have a waitress/waiter bugging me all the time.
