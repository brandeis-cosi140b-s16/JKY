This place used to be located on N Tryon Street way back in the day (2009-2010) and it was pretty much the go-to Mexican place for UNCC students. Then it mysteriously and suddenly closed. Everyone was bummed.

Magically during my last year of undergrad, a new restaurant was being built near the boardwalk...and guess what it was? LOS ARCOS.

The anticipation was real. I drove by about once a month to see when the heck they were going to open!

Finally, I came in for my first meal. The chips and salsa were on par and the drink specials weren't bad either....it didn't feel like the old Los Arcos though.

If fact, in the years Los Arcos vanished from the scene, the other places triumphed over their absence. No longer were they the go-to Mexican place for UNCC students.

I then developed a love-hate relationship with the restaurant. Sometimes it would be good, but many times, I would feel like eating at another place instead.

I don't avoid Los Arcos, but it is definitely not my first choice for Mexican food in the area either.

Tori and I did get sick from eating here last year. It seemed to be mild, nothing that kept us home from work or school, but it wasn't pleasant! 
It was probably an isolated experience though.
