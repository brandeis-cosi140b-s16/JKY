For as much hype as this place got from my friends I was expecting some sort of flavor explosion to occur when I ate here. Instead what I got was a wait in a place with limited AC in AZ in the sumer for what was essentially a ton of different meats that weren't seasoned much thrown on a bun. 

While the torta I got, the del-rey, wasn't bad it also wasn't fantastic. It tasted like what it was a hodge-podge of meats one would find in mexican food all thrown on a bun. It was hard to distinguish any significant flavors and the one I got the most was that of hot dogs. 

I probably would have held this place up a bit higher if I hadn't gone to a torta place near work a few days later and had a very similar sandwich that actually had some distinct flavor and I didn't have to wait with little AC for it.

I might try this again if I lived closer but I am not driving out of my way for this.
