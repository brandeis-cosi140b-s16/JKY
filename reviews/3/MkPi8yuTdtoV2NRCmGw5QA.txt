Just had lunch here again and it just leaves you feeling like you are missing something.   Got seated outside right away, service was good through the meal.    I think it comes down to the food is just ok and portions are tiny.     I got the tacos with beef and one of the 3 tacos was not edible.   Entire piece of meat was just entirely fat..... I mean the whole thing.    Other two tacos were small and very little too them.   

Probably will stick with drinks from them going forward
