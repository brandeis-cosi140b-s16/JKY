Loved the food....drinks were advertised as  hearty & were weak as allllll get out.  And, they added a 5%  franchise fee  to the bill.  Seriously a 4-5 star until that.  Asked the wait person, who got defensive (want a manager to explain it to you?).  Always, great food held back by cheesy pass on of 5% franchise fee to the patrons.  Recommend you drink elsewhere.  Food very yummy.
