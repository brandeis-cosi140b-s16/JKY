We walked in and it's a very nice place, we get seated right away on a Sunday afternoon even better. When we sit down we weren't given any menus the waitress takes our drinks comes back and then ask if we wanted menus (which no I just planned on ordering random items I could think of) 
We got the food which it wasn't too bad but they do need to start using salt so that the food isn't too bland. 
All together it's an ok place I will come back and try it again since it's a new place and maybe they will get things fixed. 
The only thing that throws me off is the sign and posting in the menu that states in big bold letters that "they can refuse service to anyone they want" I mean c'mon now that's just a shame.
