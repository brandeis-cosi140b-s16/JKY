Nasty RESTROOMS! a real Mexican neighborhood type eating place.
Prices a bit on the high side but the food is better than average so i would say it is worth it.
nothing fancy, just bare-bones dining. good food though, lots of seafood.wish there were more grilled/roasted food.............cuz they got way too much FRIED food and as every one knows FRIED food aint healthy.
