Dined here on a Sunday afternoon. I was freaking dying I was so hungry. Nothing sounded better then some chicken and waffles. Sat at the bar, bartender was friendly and sporting a thick beard. *props brah. My lady and I ordered a couple beers...nice and cold they were. Ordered the waffles and fried chicken breast no gravy. Also put in an order of their avocado ceviche. Food did not take long, chicken was very good...but very small for a chicken breast, especially fried. Needs to be twice the size. Chicken and waffles, people are looking to feast. The avocado ceviche was very interesting...ceviche was placed on top of two halves of an avocado...the avocado was not sliced or prepped to be eaten and the chips were not pleasing to the eye. I basically had to finish the job of making the avocado ceviche. It tasted great but I shouldn't have to carve my own avocado out and dice it up and mix it up on a plate.

Lots of potential here. 

Recommendation: ditch the peel and cut the avocado up for the customer and place it in a salsa dish
