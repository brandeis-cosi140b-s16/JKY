It's a taco. I'm not sure what all the amazing comments are about. They are okay not amazing.  I guess I'm not a big taco fanatic. It took them about 10 minutes to make a couple of tacos. Place was packed full of people. Had no place to sit. It was loud and crazy. I'll give it another try eventually.
