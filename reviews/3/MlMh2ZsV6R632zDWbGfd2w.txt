A rating of 2.5 would most appropriate.  The family that owns this small, casual caf√©-style Mexican restaurant makes everything from scratch.  We had some difficulty deciding what variety of tacos to choose - eventually settling on (2) shrimp, a chicken and a Barbacoa (beef). While waiting for our tacos, we enjoyed the complimentary salsa (spicy) and chips.  The shrimp tacos were by far the best though the others were very good with each being served on a homemade tortilla.  Prices are bit higher than the comparison.
