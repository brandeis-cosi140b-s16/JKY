A three star review is perfect for this place. Very small portions for not a small price. I keep coming back due to the lack of great mexican food options in the area. I do also like the customer service here, without it I would never come back. The three taco combo is my recommendation, but you better get something else to avoid starving and punching a co worker in a ravenous rage.
