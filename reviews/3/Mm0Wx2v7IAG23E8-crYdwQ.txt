I came here today for a quick lunch. When we first decided on the place, we assumed it was a fast food place, but they actually have table service as well as take out. available. We sat down and were immediately handed menus and our drink orders were taken. 

I ordered a breakfast burrito and my lunch partner ordered the taco combination plate. The food came out quickly and it was pretty good. The tacos looked pretty good, but my burrito left a little to be desired. It was tasty, but nothing I couldn't get for better or cheaper at Roberto's. They offer menudo all week long, not just on weekends. That's a plus. They also had some tortas that I was interested in. Their menu is pretty extensive and they offer plenty of menu options, which I'm sure to try in the future. 

I would definitely be interested in coming back to La Cosina again since they had a lot of potential and the prices for most of the other items were pretty good. The service was efficient and timely, which is key in a quick lunch spot as well. For now, I can only give it three stars, but I will be sure to check them out again.
