The food was mostly good, but my experience could have been better. I ordered a California burrito with guacamole. About 1/3 of the way through my burrito, I found two pieces of inedible fatty meat but no guac. I politely asked if they had put it in and the cook said yes. While I believed him, I shouldn't have to all if the guacamole I paid an extra dollar for was there or not (I found a trace amount towards the last couple bites). The cashier was super friendly and offered top give me more, but the cook shot me a nasty look. I'll do without the attitude, thanks.
