I went here yesterday and it was alright. I went at lunch time and got the chicken fajitas. They were so big! I barely made a dent in the plate. The fajitas tasted good and had all of the toppings with them (rice, guac, salsa, etc) but the chicken had some really gross pieces in it. Some were really sinewy and just unpleasant. Overall, it was alright, but I wouldn't rush back here.
