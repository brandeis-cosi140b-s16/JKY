Ok, so let me start this by saying that I love the Top Shelf on 35th ave and greenway and when I lived in Seattle, anytime I visited I would go there first. I always got the same thing.... chicken fajita burrito fundido. Heart attack on a plate.... but  so worth it. 

So forward to now, I live in Mesa. When my friends suggested going to top shelf I was excited. We went and I ended up getting just the regular burrito fundido due to the 5 dollar price difference at lunch time between that and the fajita version. So it may be my fault for not getting what I know I like, but it just didn't measure up. I didn't think it tasted nearly as good as what I have gotten at the phoenix location for years. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything to write home about either. So I was disappointed. The chips and salsa was still good and the food still blew Macayos and Manuels out of the water, so I'll give it that. Next time I guess I'll have to drive an hour to get the real stuff.
