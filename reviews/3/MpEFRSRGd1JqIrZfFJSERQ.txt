We arrived just after 11:30am and practically had the place to ourselves. Our server was smiling and very attentive too!

Nice chips and salsa. Not much heat in our salsa, but full of flavor. Chips were very thin( but not weak) and fresh. 

We shared the combo fajitas and fish tacos. We added extra flour tortillas & had enough fixens' to fill them all. Some a bit too full!  The fish tacos had a great sauce that went well with the fish, cabbage and corn tortillas.   The beans and rice were a bit bland, but edible. 

Loco Patron has Free WiFi too!

We enjoyed our visit and look forward to stopping in for happy hour food and beverage!
