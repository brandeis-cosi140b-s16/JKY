Okay, this isn't usually our first choice for quick Mexican food, but sometimes you don't want to feel so guilty after you eat a burrito. The Blue Burrito offers a healthier version of classic burritos. Although it isn't as good as Carolina's it is a good choice if you are trying at least a little bit to be somewhat healthier. Yeah, we would much rather scarf down a Bean and Cheese at Carolina's, but not being able to run the trails in AZ in the summer makes Blue Burrito our choice every now and then. Love the salsa bar, good salsa options with warm chips.
