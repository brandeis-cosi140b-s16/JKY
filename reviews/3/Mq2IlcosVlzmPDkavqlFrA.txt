Me: Can I have a large order of fries?
Lady in speaker: we don't sell side of fries.
Me: oh ok (knowing I just got some the week before)
Lady in speaker: we have carne asada fries?
Me: No thank you
Lady in speaker: how about I just take the carne asada out?
Me: That would be perfect, thank you. (why couldn't she just do that in the 1st place?)

I get home.... theres road kill on my fries. 
If it wasn't for their delicious chile relleno burros, I'd still be going to Taco Bell. You get what you pay for though, and the service comes with it.
