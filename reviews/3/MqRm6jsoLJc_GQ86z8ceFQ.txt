There are multiple versions of this place (apparently), and this one is tucked into a corner of the Forum Shops.  While the others get roundly negative reviews, this one seems to be good all around - and we had a grand time.

Since it was lunch, they were packed, but we sat at the bar and had good - and speedy - service.  The drinks were decent, and while prices weren't cheap, the food was good, and plentiful.  While it's not authentic, the food is hearty fare, so you can eat up and have plenty to keep you going throughout the day.
