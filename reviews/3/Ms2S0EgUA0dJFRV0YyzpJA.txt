We sat outside since it was a nice night. There was a party of 10 outside that immediately started doing shots. Add that to the fact that 5 of them were smoking and it took away from the experience. Our server did his best but was a bit overwhelmed from the large party. And was asked to take photos by 3 different tables. Tacky on the patrons part. He was clearly struggling as it was. The food was good, even though one of our orders was wrong. We chalked it up and took it. It was close. Fajita chimmichonga instead of just chicken. Still was good. Would definitely go back.
