The Mahi tacos are wonderful and I would return for the food but not the service. The tacos were fresh, delicious, and came quickly but only when the waitress decided to finally take our order. I attended at a time when there were only a few people at the bar and one other table and the waitress was too busy talking to co-workers rather than helping customers. They were well staffed at the time especially considering the small crowd that was there. I'm going to try to go there again during a busier time and hopefully the service will be as good as the food.
