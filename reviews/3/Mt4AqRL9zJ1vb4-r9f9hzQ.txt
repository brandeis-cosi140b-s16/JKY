Diners, Drive in and Dives! A must try place! So we trekked out after work yesterday. I love the location, Love the style, people and atmosphere. The place was packed! Everyone seemed to be having a great time and the vibe was hip and cool!

Service was a little slow! Chips were average and not fresh, Salsa was nothing much to speak of a bit of a disappointment.

I had three taco's Mahi, Shrimp Tara something..... all were good Tara was #1 Shrimp was #2 and Mahi was #3. Mashed Potatoes were forgettable
