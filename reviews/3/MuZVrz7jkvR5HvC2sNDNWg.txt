Hubby being from Houston and me eating a lot of mexican/texmex while we were dating.....mexican food anywhere else is like a joke. Unless you are willing to try cantinas # something. Now those are always the best! Anyway there are days when Hubby gets really nostalgic and craves Mexican food so we decided to try Las Margarita because it was close to home and it always looks packed when we drive by. 
The service was awesome! we got so many refills of chips and salsa. The salsa was made fresh. The Margarita was really yum too. I ordered the chicken tacos and hubby got the fajitas. Both of us were satisfied with the dishes we ordered. Maybe there are other mexican restaurants that are more authentic out there but this place sure beats the typical on the border or chevys. But if you are about the ambiance rather than the food then this is not the place for you. Its a huge restaurant with great service and good food. Order a pitcher of Margarita and Enjoy!
