This review is only for those who want to try the En Fuego challenge.  I attempted the En Fuego burger challenge thinking "how hot can a burger really be?"  Let me tell you, this burger is HOT!  My first clue should have been when all the staff burst out of the kitchen coughing from the fumes from my burger.  See I thought that I would be eating actual Ghost peppers, but no, they just pour Ghost pepper extract into the meat.  This is something that I wish I would have known before I started.  I took 2 bites of this burger and and could not believe the pain I was in.  I have eaten a lot of jalapenos and suicide wings, but nothing could prepare me for the pain of this burger.  It wasn't that my mouth was hot (which it was!), it was my throat that was burning.  I never knew that eating something could make my throat burn so badly.  It took 3 large glasses of milk before I could even regain my composure.  The pain doesn't end here though.  Even though my mouth and throat calmed down, the real pain begins the next day.  My stomach was in severe pain as it processed the Ghost pepper extract.  I don't want to be graphic, but if you've eaten hot food, you know what happens the day after...but this was the kind of pain where you almost cry (no joking).

So in summation, the bartender was nice, service fine, and the other patrons of the place got a wonderful laugh at my expense, but seriously do not ever attempt this challenge unless someone pays you a huge amount of money.
