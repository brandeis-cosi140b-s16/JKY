We're out of towners, and we were looking for someplace to bridge the gap between fast food and real Mexican food.  Rubios. was a nice quick fix.  We split a two taco plate and thought the ingredients were reasonably fresh. (way better than that Taco Bell place) and the service at this location was VERY friendly and helpful.  We thought the serving of beans was pretty minimal, and the salsa was lackluster, but acceptable, but the tacos were great.  Wouldn't go out of my way to find a Rubios, but in the fast food market, definitely a strong option!
