My company hosted our holiday party here a couple weeks back. The food was great, but the service was lacking in a few key areas:

 A) I'd been working with the event manager for three weeks and when I showed up the servers were offering people Sumo's full menu instead of the 'closed bar' choices on the pre-printed menus on the tables. This could have cost thousands. 

B) Because Sumo does not offer centerpieces, one of our staff  members took the time to make them over the weekend, and dropped them off ahead of the event. They were intended for the party's attendees, (employees). Some of Sumo's employees took these centerpieces without asking, a couple took off with them. All this happened before the party was over. 

C) After your company drops 4K on a party you kind of expect some exceptional or at least decent customer service right? Welp... not so much. The founder of the company took a few of the company's Bus Dev team members to the bar at Sumo (five feet away from our tables), and tried to order Fireball shots for them. The bartender retorted with a yippy "we only serve drinks for grownups here".

In general this place has a cool atmosphere and a fun,eclectic menu (all delish), but may be growing a little too quickly for its "britches". Not sure I'd host another event here, but definitely a fun spot to take a foodie friend or significant other who likes hip and doesn't mind a little yuppy.
