First let me say, I love Macayos. I've been going there at least once a month if not more for almost 5 years. 

However, I'm not very impressed with this location. I was so excited when we found this one, because we thought the closest location was Awatukee.

 My husband and I have dined in twice and gotten take out once. Our first waiter was absolutely terrible. We were there for nearly 2 hours because he took so long with everything, the food was very good though. Our second visit was ok, the service was better, but the food wasn't as good. The mini chicken chimis I ordered had hardly any chicken in them.

 The same thing happened when we ordered take out, I was basically eating an empty eggroll. They also charged $3.50 for an extra small side of salsa, which they did not bother to inform us of when we placed our order. 

Their chips are always over or undercooked. Which is annoying, as chips are a part of the experience!

 All in all, I think we'll drive the extra 15 min. and go to the Awatukee location.
