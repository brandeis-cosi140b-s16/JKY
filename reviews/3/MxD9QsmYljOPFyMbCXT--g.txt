I can't jump on the bandwagon just yet -- at least not for lunch. I decided to host a business lunch for six people here and called ahead. The place was not packed so they did not have any issue accommodating us even though I called ahead. Despite calling ahead the seats were still not ready, but that's not that big of a deal. We had two servers and one was better than the other, but neither were impressive.
I opted for the watermelon sangria  to start. We also had two sets of spicy octopus which were SWIMMING in the ink/tar. They looked nothing like the pictures posted. These things were smothered and tar black, and bland to boot.
I had their carnitas enchiladas for $16 because they were out of short rib for my original option. For $16 their enchiladas looked slightly larger than two taquitos. One person in the party even verbally expressed this observation. I can understand the tiny portion if either the flavor was out of this world, or the price was right. That was not the case. One other person who did not want to appear ungrateful, later admitted they felt that the size of the enchiladas seemed like a cruel joke. The carnitas in my enchilada seemed dry and pretty ordinary. The presentation was lovely and I appreciate the fact that it wasn't smothered in cheese and sauce, but it was still severely lacking. 

Six people, the tab was $177 pre tip for lunch...umm ok.  I do see a few dinner items I am curious about so I would give it a chance for dinner again, but I don't see myself suggesting this place for lunch any time soon.
