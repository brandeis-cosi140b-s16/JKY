on our date night we figured last time we came to early so now its time for mexican! I had a diners coupon that was sent in the mail for 10$ off so it was really a no brainer :) i recalled they had an awesome salsa bar and i was right. I love sweet salsas and they had two to choose from a pineapple salsa and a mix of different fruits. but my fave was the avocado salsa and the regular chunky. 
 for my meal i opted for the appetizer beach platter. it had a lil of everything chicken wings with ranch, steak nachos, chicken taquitos, and a plain cheese quesadilla. oh yes i cant forget the awesome cup of queso they also give you!!!!  If you ask me the cheese quesadilla was a throw away nothing very special about it, it was bland except if you dip it in the queso. I would love to have had more chicken wings or taquitos. 
my fiance was thinking cheese so he ordered the cheese enchiladas, he is a manly man and sorry to say this was a puny meal for him. i of course shared mine :) Last time we were at cabo he ordered the shrimp tacos which he loved and he actually talks about from time to time so im sure he will go back to that next time around. 

our waitress was very pleasant and we will definatly be back for another trip to cabo.
