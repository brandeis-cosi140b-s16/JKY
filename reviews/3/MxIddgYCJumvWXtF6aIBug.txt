Spent the weekend and Pittsburgh and started out Friday night at Mad Mex for Happy Hour and some dinner. Happy Hour was a pretty good deal with half price wings and cheap drafts. The wings were good and the beer selection is above average.

For dinner I had the carnitas enchiladas (i think). It didn't taste bad but I definitely had better Mexican elsewhere even elsewhere in Pittsburgh.
