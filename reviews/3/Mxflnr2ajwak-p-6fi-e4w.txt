Wow, this place was pretty disappointing! 

I came in around 2 today with some friends, so it wasn't busy at all. I think, besides some people at the bar, we were the only people seated. With a check-in, you may get a free appetizer with the purchase of an entree which is very generous. That was the best part of the meal today. Because there was 3 of us, we got 3 different appetizers. I really recommend the corn! The portion size for the empanadas is quite generous, but it just reminded us of pizza rolls. Overall, appetizers were good. The water there tastes a little funky, I would get a soft drink. 

For entrees, we all got tacos and quesadillas. They have this combination of 2 tacos and a beverage (between 11-3) for only $8! I thought it was a great deal; however, the food was such a disappointment. I ordered a steak and deep fried fish taco. The steak was burnt for me and my friend so it was brought back to the kitchen. The taco itself wasn't really good, it lacked a lot of flavor. I didn't even get a deep fried fish taco, it was just seasoned so they went back and got me another one again. The rice and beans that come with it are ok, nothing special. 

We then decided to give dessert a try. We got the tres Leches cake which was good but very dense. We also got the churros. The churros are good without the chocolate dipping sauce. The sauce tasted kind of burnt. 

Comments on service: Our server was very nice, however she seemed new to everything. We had to repeat ourselves many times when ordering. She just didn't seem very alert or there. Someone from the kitchen came out and apologized about our food which was nice. I don't think I will be coming back here anytime soon. It's worth a try though, so don't let the review hinder you from going.
