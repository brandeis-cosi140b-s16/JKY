Had lunch here yesterday.  Been a while. I keep forgetting about this place even though it is basically across the street from my office.  But it is buried deep in a strip mall type area. 

Anyway the lunch was great. I had a deluxe beef burrito. It was huge. Otherwise nothing unusual at all. But very fresh, tasty, and satisfying. 

Service was friendly and prompt. Prices average for this type of spot. 

All in all a winner. Not a go out of your way place. But if you're in the area, and feel like Mexican food, worth the stop
