Place is pretty good.  Food is consistently good.  I would give a 4 star but they lose one because on our last visit they said they will no longer split checks.  Makes it tough when you out to lunch with co-workers in a Credit/Debit card world.  I'll visit once in a while when I have cash but gotta remove them from our regular rotation.  

4 star for food and service.  
-1 for not splitting checks anymore.
