Had an amateur roller today. The veggie burrito is made big and I messed up the rolling process by getting mas rice, light beans and the roller could not handle the switch. It was knife and fork city upon my return home. Guacamole is still great and really makes the burrito slightly above average. Chicken is poor quality and not white meat and beef looked bad this visit (once every 6 months). Did you know that this month is the chain's 20th birthday and the first one was in Denver, CO. Felt very safe as 8 cops were also eating dinner as I was getting to go order. Line moved fast, but if you want chicken, try cafe Rio, much better.
