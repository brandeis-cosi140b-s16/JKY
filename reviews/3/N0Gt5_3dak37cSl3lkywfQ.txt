On the rare times I get into Pittsburgh, I usually try to go on some sort of excursion to get food I can't find in Greensburg.  On this particular trip, I was coming in to get my car serviced around the corner, so without a vehicle, I wandered into Qdoba.

While I prefer the base ingredients and regular burritos at Chipotle, QDoba has one ingredient Chipotle does not: queso.  And their queso is delicious.  Other than that, I can't get too excited about it, although I do appreciate that guacamole is "free" now, and that they offer whole wheat tortillas so I can pretend my queso burrito is healthy.  I like their pork, but I'm not the biggest fan of their rice or fajita veggies.

Not the best, fanciest, or most authentic burrito around, but the store was clean, the employees were friendly and fast, and I got my fill of cheesy calorie-bomb deliciousness while my Mini was in the shop, so overall I'll give them an "A-OK."
