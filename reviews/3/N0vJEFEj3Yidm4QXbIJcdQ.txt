Realized I live right next to this joint so I decided to have a look. Upon first impressions, place looks like a dump and actually kind of smelled like one to be honest. I realize this is supposed to be a divey Mexican food place but I've seen better in worse parts of town to be honest. Ordered a couple tamales and some black frijoles. Food is super cheap.  Pretty delicious. No real complaints to be made, although no real praise to be heaped upon it either. It appeared as if no care was made to keep the beans from spilling out of it's container and one of the tamales was flat like a pancake. Honestly, my roommate's mother makes better tamales even on her worst day.

 I'll rate this place slightly higher than two stars just for location sake and because the owner was pretty cool even when this idiot walked in and asked like 40 questions and left. I seriously wanted to punch that kid.
