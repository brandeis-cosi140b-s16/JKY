Had the Al Pastor tacos. Cost about $10 for three small street tacos. A bit pricey but you're at the food court at the Ceasar's so can't exactly expect budget prices. The tacos were good and had a sweet finish due to the small chunks of pineapple get out on top. I would have liked the savory was of the meat to come through a bit more. Also, could have been a little hotter temp wise. An adequate meal if you want something fast to hold you over.
