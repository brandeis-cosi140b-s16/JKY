Very Good Service, I can't take the smell in here, maybe they need to re vamp the place a bit, its a little out dated but, very good food. 
I have to admit., Im a sucker for good atmosphere, I believe it adds to the experience of eating out. 
I would come back to this place because the food is very authenthic, however I will get my mind ready for the scent.
