Diego's, located inside of the MGM, has a sleek decor with a set of fake stairs that you'll want to climb after a few of their margaritas.  Lord knows why, but my buddy and I each decided to buy a specialty fruit-fused drink then dumb it down for a pitcher.  Yeah, we got wasted.  The tequila was of a decent quality, but trust me: we paid for it.

The restaurant is expensive, and the bang for the buck was unimpressive.  Complimentary chips are a no-brainer for any Mexican restaurant worth its tortillas.  The three salsas were nice, especially the smokey chipotle.  But you may wish to bypass the intriguing flavored salts if your flip-flops have brought you to Margaritaville.

Same goes for the Veracruz Seafood Pot.  With visions of lobster, prawns, clams, tomato, garlic, spinach, and other yum, I picked this over the tacos al carbon.  Very soon, I wished otherwise.  Saline overload!

The table-side guacamole helped a bit.  But to be honest, the avacados were under-ripe.

I know I'm hard to please with this cuisine.  However, when one's learned from a Mexican and knows what fresh is, there's a high bar to reach.

The service is excellent.
