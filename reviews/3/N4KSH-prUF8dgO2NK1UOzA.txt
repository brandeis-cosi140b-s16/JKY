THIS EPL needs works. it was very messy when we came in. i'm fine with a little mess in a chaotic place but this place was empty. not a single trash can to throw my try into bc they were all overflowing. yikes.

food is fine. like any other EPL. we had been traveling and would have liked just a slightly cleaner place to have lunch.
