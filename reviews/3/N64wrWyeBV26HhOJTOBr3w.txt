Promised the waiter I'd give him a nice tip if he gave me good service. He brought warm chips and replenished salsa + bean dip. Spinach enchilada dinner with queso spinach sauce was meh. Staff seems nice overall. Tipped him $15 on a $17 bill. Would be nice if service were just as good without having to make gratuity promises.
