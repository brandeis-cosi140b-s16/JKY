I don't come here often, but when I do I order their Chicken Nachos.  As I've mentioned before, after I realized how many calories are in one of these bad boys (2,020 calories!), I reduced the number of visits to Baja Fresh.  That's 3 hours on the Elliptical for me!

This location is convenient because it's in a shopping center with Walmart & Sam's Club nearby.....which are 2 places I frequent.  Of course, their signature Salsa Bar and plenty of seating is available.

Will I return?  When I'm in the mood to gain some poundage, I'll stop by.
