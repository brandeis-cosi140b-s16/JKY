I had breakfast here this morning and I didn't want to have a large breakfast.  I ordered the Anaheim taco which consists of Anaheim chilies, sour cream, saut√©ed onions, a blend of three cheeses, a slice of avocado all placed on a taco with scrambled egg.

The taco was not a flour one.  It was more like a pastry crust rather than a flour tortilla, but it was very good.  The menu says that all breakfast tacos are served with potatoes or refried beans and rice.  I was offered neither.  I did have a choice of mild, medium, or hot for the salsa and I chose hot.  It's mildly hot if that's not an oxymoron.
Breakfast was good and the server refilled my coffee when he saw I was getting low.

This place just opened a month ago and they're still doing work on it.  This morning, they were installing a garage door in the bar area that can be raised in good weather and serve from a counter on which the door rested today.

Part of the fun of eating here today was watching my server change the Coke cartridges.  The syrup now comes in super concentrated containers that look like copy machine cartridges and it was interesting watching him switch out two of the cartridges. The change in technology was interesting.

I parked underground in the Neonopolis garage and there was no charge.  I don't know if it's because of the time of day or that I was there less than an hour, but this is the second time that the cashier at the pay station just wished me a good day and opened the gate.

Nacho Daddy is worth a return visit when they get the kinks worked out. And gentlemen, aim for a field goal!
