As much as I want to give this place a four star I can not! The wait time is ridiculous!! Ordering system is so complicated. There's different lines for different types of meat. So if u want tacos de tripa, al pastor, and sopes  you are looking at three different lines ...to complicated! 
I waited more than an hour for some delicious carne asada fries and four tacos de tripa that were way too salty! Never again.
