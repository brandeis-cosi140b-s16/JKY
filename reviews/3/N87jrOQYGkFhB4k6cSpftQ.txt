This place was fine, I had a combo with a taco and two mini chimis.  They had it on special for $5.99, I thought wow-that's a lot of food for six bucks, but the mini chimis were more like cheese egg rolls.  Not that there's anything wrong with that :)
I wouldn't say the beef in the taco was the best, kind of blah, but everything else was decent and the beans were good (for once!!).
This place must be listed in the daytime drinkers directory as I think I was the only person in the restaurant not having a beer or margarita.  I'll have to go back when I don't have an afternoon full of appointments!!
