This chipotle is brutal when there are more than 5 people in line. The workers need to be retrained to move a little more quickly. Also, way too often the chicken is overlooked and you end up getting black crunchy pieces in your dish. This is very unpleasant and tastes horrible. The people are very nice and overall the food is delicious but a lack of training is evident.
