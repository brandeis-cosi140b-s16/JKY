I always forget this bar is here. It's in such a no-mans land, tucked away in the Scottsdale Airpark. 

The two or three times I've been here have been totally just.. Ok. I've only been for drinks and once i ordered some mildly disappointing nachos. 

I also don't understand the appeal of having a swimming pool at a bar. What do I do with it? Toss the dregs of my drink in it? Wash my feet in it? Push a Scottsdale d-bag in it? Cuz God knows I ain't gunna go swimming in it. For serious. 

I have no problem returning to this bar, but never on a weekend. I prefer things to be more calm and quiet, and that is totally not that case on the weekends. Beware the DJ and the primped and preening Scottsdale "elite" or whatever they are.
