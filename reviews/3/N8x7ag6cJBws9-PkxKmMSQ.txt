It's basic scoop and serve Fast casual Mexican food. Taco, burrito, quesadilla, and bowls. The same type of stuff you have seen from other chains. Their food is alright, not as bad as some write on here. I do like their hot sauce a lot, had some good kick to it.

Not a lot of choices in gate A, if you want a basic meal then this is fine.
