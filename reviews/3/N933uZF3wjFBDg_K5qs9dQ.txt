I stopped at Tres Pesos on my way home from work one night to get a delicious addition to dinner of chips, cheese dip and salsa. I thought it would be a relatively quick transaction; however, it took over 10 minutes for my to go bag to be brought to me. The chips were hot, salsa was pretty good, the cheese dip was average. Unfortunately, 4 days later, I check my online banking to see that my card was overcharged $5. After I had already tipped $2 for a TO-GO order! Unbelievable. I will definitely not be returning. If you do stop in, be sure to check your bank statement!


EDIT: After speaking with the owners of Tres Pesos after this incident, they did everything possible to ensure I was taken care of. I was returned the full amount and actually spoke with the owners several times to ensure everything was taken care of. I plan to return to give Tres Pesos a fair review. They definitely provided some of the best customer service I've seen from a restaurant and went WAY out of their way to make sure I was happy in the end. Thank you!
