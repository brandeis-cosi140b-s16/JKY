This place is about as sketchy as sketchy strip mall joints get! Heading in here for a late lunch on Sunday, the place looked like it was under renovations with paint being stripped everywhere and I think the AC wasn't really working either because it was pretty hot in there.

The food was very good with a variety of options for everyone, but I have a problem that 2 of our orders were brought out about 20 minutes after everyone else. Also I noticed their fairly low sanitation grade. Well I don't mind after having toured through SEA your standards change a bit, but some people are picky about that.

Go check it out, I don't have much experience with Mexican food but it seems quite authentic seeing as how most of the menu is in Spanish! It made ordering a bit harder than usual but you'll get huge portions of yummy food!
