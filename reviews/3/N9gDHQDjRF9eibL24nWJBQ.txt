I love the food because it reminds me of how I make my own tacos at home. The fresh chips and salsa bar is also a plus. The problem is that the prices a way to high for what is offered. If i wanted to pay that much for a taco platter I would go to a true sit down restaurant. This place is good for fast Mexican Restaurant style take out, but its too expensive to be an alternative to Taco Bell or Del Taco.
