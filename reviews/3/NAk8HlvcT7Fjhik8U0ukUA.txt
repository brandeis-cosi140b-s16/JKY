The food was very good. A little to pricey.  Not kid orientated. Me and my family went there for my Dads birthday and took my little girl with use thinking they would have somthing for kids and they didn't. They couldn't even try to accomidate for her. Not even make quesadilla. So we ordered some chips and salsa for her.($4.00 )and desided to share our food with her. The green chilli was really good. But the price was way to high. (18.00) also ordered carna asada plate that was really good too. (20.00) i would like to go back. But with the prices and not even trying to make somthing for kids left me with a sour taist in my mouth. So if you can afford them and don't have kids. I would say to try them out.
