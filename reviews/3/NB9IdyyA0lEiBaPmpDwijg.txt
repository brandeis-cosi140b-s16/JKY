Not the best, but it does the trick. 

I walk-in with sunglasses on, a hoodie pulled over my head, and a docile demeanor. Nope, I'm not trying to rob the place of money, just of it's delicious burritos and as many salsas as I can fit in my burrito bag. 

Robertos is not the best Mexican food in Vegas. Hell, if might even be number twenty-two on my list of "A-OK" Mexican fast food places in the valley, but what this Robertos location does have that I love, as they say in real estate... location, location, location. I can pretty much walk here from my house. I came here after a raucous night at Yelp club night event that ended up going back to Henderson and resulted in me going to bed at 4am. 

As I stare at the blurry menu, I zero-in on the Adobada Burrito. My main go-to when I need food meds to cure what ails me. If you haven't had Adobada Burrito it's basically chunks of slowly cooked pork in a red chile sauce, sometimes served with pineapples, and wrapped in tasty warm blanket of flattened bread, and paired with a guacamole/salsa mixture. This really is all you need, stop fussing about with rice and beans, pure filler! Stick with the basics, meat, veggies, and bread. 

Anyone who doesn't think this place is fast food location is wrong. By the time I put in my order and walked over to the salsa counter, my burrito was already wrapped up and ready for consumption. That's pretty damn fast to me and under $6, sold. 

BTW - The burrito was great and I took a nap immediately after. Food coma power down.
