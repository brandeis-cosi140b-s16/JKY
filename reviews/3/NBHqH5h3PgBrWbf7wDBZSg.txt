My boyfriend works uptown so I occasionally meet him for lunch, this time he chose Johnny Burritos.  They instantly could tell I was a newbie (I must have had a took of confusion)  They were super friendly and helpful.  

I had the Chicken Verde burrito which was tasty but missing the kick you'd expect with a salsa verde. It's insanely fast and the regular isn't so huge that you can't reasonably finish it, it's not a behemoth like Chipotle's.  You can mix and match all kinds of ingredients to get the burrito you so crave. I think they also change up the base meats and they have a tamale friday special.  and as a plus, guac isn't extra!  

It's a tad gimicky, they hand out fireball candies on fridays and you get chicket gum with every order and newbies get a bottle opener.  

They also have a great selection of old school sodas and a sun drop slushie.
