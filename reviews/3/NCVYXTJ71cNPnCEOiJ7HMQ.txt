It's exciting to see a new (well, new to me) Mexican restaurant in C-U, since I'm kind of over Dos.  The chips and salsa were...godly.  I can't explain exactly WHY the chips were so delicious - the best I can do is to say that they're like, two-ply chips?  And served warm from the fryer.  Good God, they were fantastic.  Service was quick and friendly, too!

The reasons this is a 3.5-star review, and not a 4-star review:

- Flautas were pretty average
- Music was TOOOO LOOUUUUD

However, I WILL say that my boyfriend's carne asada steak was fan-freakin'-tastic.  Next time, I'll get that.  Mmmm.
