We had our Christmas luncheon yesterday and ordered their $130 family pack. The lady told me that we would get a 15% military discount. So after tax I was expecting a bill of around 130. We got there and the guy tells me 152. Fine print on the receipt said 15% discount up to 1.50. Really?  I was mislead. I asked for a total and she told me she could nor ring it up until I came in. We had a limited budget so luckily I had an extra 20 in my own wallet.   Food and sides were good I just wished they would not have mislead me.
