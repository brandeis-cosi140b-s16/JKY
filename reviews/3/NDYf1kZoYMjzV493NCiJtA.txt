Despite the lack of service, I would definitely go again which I think is a rare thing to say on a first visit. The only thing that saved the poor waitress was that it was her first day and it was very busy nonetheless. However, if it's your first day, why are you not writing down orders? We had to wait 30 minutes for drinks, I was completely ignored at first. Then, we received the wrong appetizers and meals, as well as not being checked on more frequently. I understand that it was her first shift so I'm not upset with her but more so with her training or lack thereof. She stayed super upbeat and positive the entire time and once we showed that we understood why she was so flustered she actually got more comfortable. But still, who trains staff to not write down orders while I'm SURE newbies are still learning the menu? Regardless, the food was still great. Shrimp ceviche I highly recommend as well as the Ahi Salad.
