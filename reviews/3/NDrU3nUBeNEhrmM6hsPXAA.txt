Good Mexican Restaurant.  This was the 1st place that i experience where they make the guacamole right at your table.  This way you could tell they were using fresh ingredients. 

The staff were very friendly and came around often to refill drink and check if everything was ok.   

The food was good for east coast Mexican.  I still haven't found a place the serves green chili's they way they do out west.  The chili's good, but they just tasted different'.  

If you haven't been they are worth checking out at-least once.  Keep an eye out for groupons.
