Really poor service keeps this place from being 4 or 5-stars because the food is really good.

We had seen that Los Sombreros was called one of the best Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale by several magazines, newspapers, etc, but we were skeptical of coming here because of the 3-star rating on yelp. When we dug into the ratings it seemed like there were a lot of 1-star ratings because of bad service. After having dinner here, we could definitely see why.

The joint wasn't even half-way full and the waitress was already telling us we should get our order in quickly because there were big parties there that would take a while to make the food for.

We placed our order, had to ask repeatedly for the guacamole we ordered so we could eat it with the chips. We also had trouble getting our waters refilled. After we finally got our food it was lukewarm temperature at best. We considered sending it back but didn't want to wait any longer. My brother also asked for jalapenos multiple times and we never got them. 

The food was actually very good. I got the duck enchilada which was tasty and much more authentic than most Mexican food I had. My brother loved his salad with Oaxaca cheese, chicken and pumpkin seeds. My dad had a Lamb Adobo and the sauce was very tasty and not too rich. My mom loved her Hibiscus Enchilada.

We told our waitress that the food was cold at the end and she gave us a $20 gift card for the next time we come but it would expire in a month. This seemed a bit weak given that all of our food was cold. 

Overall, I would like to give more than 3-stars because of the quality of the food but can't given how bad the service was. Please get a new manager and we will come back!
