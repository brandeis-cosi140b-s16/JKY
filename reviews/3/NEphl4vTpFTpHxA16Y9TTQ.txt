Food was fairly decent however there were some things that would make us think twice about coming back.   First, the fact that they charge for extra chips and salsa.  At least they let you know in the menu, however they say the first round is on them.  The first round consisted of two measly trays for 8 people.  Also, the server dropped a place of food on the table accidentally and enchilada sauce ended up in the lap of someone in our group.  They didn't offer to take anything off the bill (didn't even give us our 2nd round of chips for free!).  They were gracious with a couple peoples dislike of the enchilada sauce and were quick to prepare something different.
