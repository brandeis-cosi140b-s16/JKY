We arrive late from LA and was tired and hungry. My wife likes Chipolte, so we stopped off at this location. On a Sunday evening there wasn't very many patrons, but they were trickling in.  I always get the pork burrito, my daughter and wife had the chicken. They filled it with so much stuff that we had it for two days, The burrito's were favorful and the black beans, oh so good. The restaurant was clean and the workers attentive. Always a great place for fast mexican food. One thing though, they should throw in a bag of chips with a meal.
