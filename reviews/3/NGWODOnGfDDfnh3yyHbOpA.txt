My husband and I were looking for mexican food outside of the Las Vegas strip. We are from San Diego county, land of the taco shop on almost every corner. We have plenty of Roberto's taco shops, so we wanted to try something new. Our GPS found this one close to the area we were driving so we gave it a chance. The food was good, I had a California Burrito and he had the Carne Asada Burrito. The meat was seasoned appropriately and the portions were a good size. The only thing that lost it for me was their aguas. (jamaica, tamarindo, orchata) Most people don't care about the kind of drink they buy with their meal. But I do. I don't care for that Ole brand of aguas, but I rather drink that than soda. I ordered their version of Jamaica and the water had a very gross taste to it. Not sure if they have cleaned their fountain drink filters lately. But I was turned off by the taste of the drink. It tasted like the water was stale and if a goat bathed in it.
I did like the food overall, & next time I'll just order a soda and deal it with it.

I am not sure how the Las vegas version of Roberto's is but we may try that place next time.
