It's a hit or a miss. I usually order some tacos and they are always great. Last time, I ordered an enchilada with mole sauce it was absolutely disgusting. They microwaved the meat and some pieces were cold. I usually love the chips but they were stale that day.
Pros:
The staff is very friendly and their food is 10x tastier and cheaper than Chipotle.
