Went last night with hubby and son (11). Great food, lousy service. 

The meal started out well with salsa and corn salsa that was out of this world. Asked for more corn salsa 3 times before we received it. 

Seemed that the servers were rotating around, and lost track of where were were in the cycle. Took a long time to get our food though it was not a busy night. 

Ordered the pollo con crema and it was absolutely delicious. The fajita steak quesidilla was a bit salty, but good. 

Service was not personal at all, beautiful atmosphere. May return.
