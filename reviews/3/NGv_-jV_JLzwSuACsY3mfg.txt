I have been wanting to try Mama Lupitas, because of all the wonderful reviews I have read on here. The food was fairly good; I wouldn't say it was the best mexican I have ever had, but still quite tasty. However the chips and salsa were absolutely phenomenal! The salsa was nice and spicy! The downfall was that our service was absolutely horrible! I don't know if we had a waitress who was new or just didn't care. I have read many reviews that say what great service they have received, so I understand this was rare. The waitress seemed to be in no hurry, there were only four tables in the restaurant, and still incredibly slow. 

I may give this place another try sometime, but the service really diminished my experience.
