Oh no. BF and I had lunch and loved the posole and the salsa that came with the chips. Decided to host dinner with others Friday night because of their non-GMO and organic selections.
We ordered the table side guacamole. ..it was terrible. The avocados tasted fresh but that was all you tasted. We asked for medium hot and it was zero hot. it had no flavor outside of the avocados.
Gorditas: Bad and they charged $9! Must have had a bad day. We ordered this based on rave review of a friend.
Carnitas: Very good.
Jalepeno margaritas also very good.
Flan was excellent. Converted a non-flan eater to fan.
The other 3 in the party had burritos...all okay but not enough to go out of their way to come back.
