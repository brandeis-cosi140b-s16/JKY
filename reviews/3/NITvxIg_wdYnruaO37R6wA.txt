I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the food, unfortunately it was plain and flavorless. I think that Roberto's would have been a better choice than this. The server was nice but you can tell he does not have that much experience as he was a bit clumsy and not very professional. The prices were pretty reasonable, I just wish it was better. 
Maybe it is a good spot for lunch but we probably won't be back for dinner.
