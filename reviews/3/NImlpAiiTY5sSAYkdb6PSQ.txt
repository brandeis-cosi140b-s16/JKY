Decent real Mexican food with great Margueritas. Started off with the guacamole and chips which were good noting that I am not a fan of the different Phoenix style heavier chips than the lighter ones that I like. Followed up with a roasted poblano which was excellent and chicken enchiladas suiza which were decent. Service was spotty.
