Here's what I think of when I think about Tres Pesos: Cheap. Good Food. Huge Portions. Strong Margaritas. Bright Colors. Fast Service. 

My friend eats/drinks here a lot and he took me with him awhile back. He told me that he and his friend were drinking here one day and they had quite a few margaritas. After a few, they asked the bartender to add some more tequila to their drinks. She did- then said, "Is that what you liiiiiiiike..." I dunno, I just really like saying that now-

Is that what you liiiiiiiike (in Spanish accent)
