I'm very mixed...  We dined on 1/21 around 6:30 pm.

5 stars- our server Mike was great-- funny, helpful
4 stars- the chile rellenos and carne asada were amazing; patio is beautiful
3 stars- guac and bean dip were a-okay.  nothing great, not terrible. fine.

1 stars-- there were a ton of heaters on the patio, but when we were initially sat , we asked our hostess to turn it on, she said they were out of propane.  When I asked Mike an hour later to be re-sat indoors when we were beyond freezing, he promptly turned one of the heaters on and lit a fire.  I HATE being lied to.  Also, it took about 10+ minutes to see our server at the beginning.  We had to ask 3 times for a high chair.  We also had our appetizers before we had our drinks and side plates.

It's sad that entrees are around 20/each, we had a bottle of wine, and 2 appetizers, and an otherwise good situation, but those blunders really soured me on the place.
