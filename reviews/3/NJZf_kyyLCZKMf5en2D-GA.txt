Get here early. That's my sage advice. For I don't know if it is always like it was on the night I was here- but there was a packed parking lot and a line that stretched all along the sidewalk. And this place has only been open for 4 days!

Maybe it was because the Iowa game was on (and this is an Iowa bar like it's sister location down the street.)  Maybe it was because it is new. Or maybe people in this part of town don't have a lot of options.  But whatever the reason . . . . .this place was packed.  Inside and out.

If you have been to any of the Sandbar locations, you will recognize all the signature signs- the colored lights strewn about, the beer specials, the sand underfoot, it's all there.  Couple that with harried servers just trying their best to keep up and you have a typical night at the Sandbar.  Service is pretty non existent so just squeeze up to the bar and shout out your order before some drunk kid yells something in your ear!

On this night- the crowd was a little young for my taste (the game may have influenced that) and the frat boy syndrome was in full swing!  If you can grab a table, the people watching is quite interesting just watch that you don't get beer spilled on you.

Don't get me wrong.  It's nice to have another option in this part of town.   I just wish the "grown ups" had found it before all the kids did!
