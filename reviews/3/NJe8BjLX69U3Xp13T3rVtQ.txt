BEWARE: Double check your receipt at this location when taking the drive thru. You might get cheated. I've been coming to this location probably 4 years now.  It used to be fine, but within the last 2 years, the majority of the time that I go here, I ALMOST always get charged for an extra item. Sometimes I get told the total, and get no receipt. The price sounds completely wrong. I'll have to ask for a receipt, and sure enough I'm charged for extra items. It's becoming extremely repetitive, and very suspicious. I hate to say this but I feel like some of the employees that work here are dishonest. I work in fast food myself so I get an idea of whats going on at this point. I have friends and family members who also have the same exact complaint with this location.

However,  this Filberto's is clean, and the foods good. It's by far my favorite Filberto's in the valley. Just make sure you dont drive off without double checking what you've been charged for!
