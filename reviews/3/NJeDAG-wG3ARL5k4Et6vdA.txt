After reading a recent review, and not having been to Maria's in years, I had to check it out. Upon arrival, we were greeted, seated, and served chips and salsa immediately. The chips were fresh & warm, however the salsa was a little runny, as was the guacamole a little creamy, for my liking. However, the fajitas, and combo meals we ordered were fresh, warm, and delivered quickly. The service was great and everyone is very friendly...and the prices are awesome. I will be back.
