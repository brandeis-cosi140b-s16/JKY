I came here two years ago and I loved it, apparently. But I went back today and was disappointing... The gordita was kinda sogginess if the tortilla was more crispier then it would get a pass but it wasn't. Okay flavor, but no. The Asada tacos were dry and the el pastor was just not all there. The flavor was off. It just tasted like freaking tomate and salsa. Definitely I will try another location.
