It has been a while since the Vegas StrEats food truck festival. To be honest, I want to forget most of that night. If it wasn't for the Sound Clash between The Ting Tings and Cee-Lo, I would have scrapped the night as a bust. 

The line was disorganized and it was obvious that none of the food trucks were remotely prepared for the onslaught that came their way. The line was hectic, people were cutting me left and right. I wanted to yank on some old witch's weave because she knowing slipped ahead of me and then had the audacity to look back at me like she did nothing wrong. Even more so when her and her friends were behind me continued to have their conversation over me.

When I finally got up to the front I ordered the green chile stew only to be told that they ran out. I went through this process for another two turns. Eventually I settled for the Sloppi Jo. Aziz B. ordered the chili cheeseburger. We were told that they had just got a new batch of the pork so they were heating it up. After waiting 20 or so minutes we got our food. 

The pork was moist, but it was overly seasoned. It was so salty that I ended up putting it over some rice from Island Breeze. The pickled onions helped cut the saltiness and that was probably my favorite part of the dish. A tortilla is too thin to even out the sodium from the pork. My friend enjoyed his burger, but it looked messy. Yet again a tortilla just does not soak anything up and chili was everywhere. 

Definitely grab some napkins and a fork.
