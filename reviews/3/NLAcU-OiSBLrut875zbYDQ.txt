I order here because it's right by my house. The food is great..but the customer service seems to get worse every time I go there! Be prepared to wait a long time for your order! This place charges extra for everything! I wanted an extra side of veggies and they wouldn't allow me to purchase it because I needed to spend more than 10 dollars on my card, even though I had just bought 20 dollars worth of food! Not sure if I'll be coming back again.
