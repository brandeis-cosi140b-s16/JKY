Chips and salsa is reason enough to go here. Tacos were delicious. Unfortunately none of us truly got what we ordered.  No cilantro means no cilantro usually, but at the guild it means extra I guess. 3 of us made small changes to the menu items and none of them were complied with. 

Also, refills were non-existent (water or tea).  The poor hostess had to come through with out only refill of tea as we were about to leave. I apparently forgot to ask for iced tea as all we got was warm tea in our cup.

So to recap, chips and flavor of food was awesome. Don't change anything on the menu. Don't expect solid service. Maybe they were busy. Or had an off day.
