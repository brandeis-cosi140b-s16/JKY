I used to really like El Toro which was in the same location.  Name change brought about other changes as well that I am not loco about.

The service and decor are the same.  It is a big restaurant and we were here on a Friday night of Moms' weekend and we got seated right away. Yay!

The chips and salsa were good and we ordered an additional appetizer.  The cheese quesadilla was on tortilla folded over some cheese.  It tasted like it had been heated in the microwave.  No sour cream, no lettuce or tomato garnish, no guacamole on the side.  Boo!  Who serves an appetizer like this?

My daughter and I both had the Carne asada which was pretty much icky.  Thin, dry and over cooked  even though I had ordered it medium rare.   This piece of meat zoomed past medium rare ten minutes before they took it off the grill.   I thought if I could put it in the tortilla with some other goodies, it might be a bit more edible.   It took forever to get anyone's attention to fill our salsa bowl.  We were both bummed and had coffee and split a fried ice cream to cheer ourselves up.  Didn't really do the trick.  :(

I won't come again, Champaign has other options that are better -  now I understand how we got a table so quickly.
