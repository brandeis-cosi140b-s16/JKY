This place has good food.  What I like about it is that it's spicy.  My favorite place to go is the hole in wall mexican place.  this is a notch above that. They have a bar.  They also have dietcoke.  Can't say there is anything I would particularly recommend.  I think I had a green or blue corn tamale that was outstanding.  I love the salsa it's unique. Not just red salsa.  My complaint is that I feel like they dont care about the food.  It's not really consistent.  There is little care to quality. The people that work there always seem like they are suffering being at work.  Not to say that the service is bad.  I have had much worse food.  I have been there a dozen times.  I have also had much better food in Arizona.  So 3 stars reflects that fact that it's average. if you love mexican food like me. Then you should try los dos molinos.
