As far as Chipotles go, the Market Square location is probably one of my least favorites, but if I'm in a hurry, it'll suffice. The staff always seems like they have something better to do and we are interrupting their fun. I've been there a few times now, and it's been the same every time.

The store itself is pretty nice and reasonably clean for the amount of traffic that it gets. It's nearly always busy, but the lines move quickly. The food is on-par with any other Chipotle that you'll go to, but just know that you may encounter long lines, sometimes limited seating, and a little attitude from the staff.
