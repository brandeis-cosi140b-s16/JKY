I want to start off my review by saying we really like the food here.  The chicken tortilla soup and fajitas are great.  Now to the problem.  We were given a $50 gift certificate to Cantina 1511 for xmas and went there Sunday 1-11-15 to use it.  After ordering a few drinks and fajitas our bill was $33.  We were told by the manager that the remaining balance of $17 was not redeemable and we would lose it.  Why couldn't they just give us another gift certificate for the balance???  The manager told us "she just works here and that's the way it is".  I'm not sure why they can't join the rest of the world and use gift cards, but it left a bad taste in our mouths and we may not return.
