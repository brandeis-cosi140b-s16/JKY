Pepe's is everything you would expect of a local non-chain mexican restaurant. Warm chips, good salsa, local waiters, good dishes, mediocre sides, and a south-of-the-border decor. I visited for lunch on a Wednesday and had no problem being immediately seated. We each had one of the lunch special dishes: burrito with red sauce, enchiladas with red sauce, and a chimichanga with red sauce - all with rice & beans.  Let me say that the chips and salsa were the highlight of the meal. Although it was good enough that i would go back to try a Mexican Pizza or a dish of chicken mole.
