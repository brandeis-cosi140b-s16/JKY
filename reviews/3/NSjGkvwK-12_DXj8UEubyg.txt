I've been here a few times already, usually for happy hour. Many appetizers are half-off for happy hours, which is fantastic, because you can order sushi tacos (mini tacos with sashimi) for just $4.50! And they are so delicious too! Who knew that sushi and tacos would make such a great combination? 

Another one of my favourites was their tamarindo lemonade. It's normally an alcoholic beverage featuring tamarind puree, lemonade, and some vodka. It's not very strong, and in fact, last time I ordered w/o alcohol because I had to drive, so the bartender was nice and didn't charge me the full price of the drink. I'm so sad though because they recently removed this drink from the menu! I was so shocked! Please bring it back!

Unfortunately, I was not very impressed with their dinner menu. I ordered their pollo con mango mole, and my boyfriend had enchiladas. Both dishes were too salty, and the chicken was dry and flavourless. The only redemption that night was their birthday brownie, which came with a sparkler instead of a candle, quite a novelty. The service has always been great, but I wish the dinner menu was better.
