i'm not sure how to put this... i don't know if i like this place or not.

the owner/principal comes from the laredo's clan, which means a lot of their dishes are presented with red sauce. but, it has a tangy-creamy-spicy taste, which hangs out well with the cheese enchiladas. i have also tried their bean tostada, and vegetable fajitas (not all at once!).

the staff's attention was staggered. we waited a while to be served, but were offered a "refill" of the chips and salsa. my fajitas were served without tortillas, and we couldn't get the attention of the waitress, so i ate everything with a fork. the seasoning was much too salty for my palette. my companion had the five-enchilada plate and finished all but the stringy pork one. the horchata has a little more cinnamon than i'm used to (i'm comparing to la hacienda), but it's still refreshing.

i've seen a review that their menu items lean too much toward seafood.. and i wonder if that person knows any spanish (hint: el pescador means fisherman).

i think we'll give it one more try before calling it a failure.
