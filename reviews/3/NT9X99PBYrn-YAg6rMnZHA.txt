Ok, I really want to love this place.  One downside to living in Matthews is that aside from barbeque, there's no great places to eat.  There are a host of chain restaurants, a few gawd-awful haunts, and then a host of mediocrity.  I had hoped Pure Taqueria was going to change that and maybe start a food revolution in Matthews.

To start off, this place is definitely cool.  Normally, you'd have to go to Dilworth, Midwood, or NoDa for a cool restaurantIt's designed to look like a taco stand inside of a former Pure gas station.  The building is new but they did a great job in the details to make it seem like it had always been there.  They also have garage door bays (like former repair bays) that can be opened for semi-outdoor seating. 

The bar is fairly upscale and modern and to their name, they serve tequila (i.e. margaritas) which were pretty good.  It would be sad if a place like this served bad drinks but many places like this serve lousy, overpriced drinks.  

The food wasn't bad either - but it wasn't knock your socks off.  I will go back again as I hope that the chefs were still learning the menu.  I had the fish tacos which I hoped would be amazing and they weren't.  Tilapia is a great fish but its lack of its own flavor means that you need to have either a rockin' batter or sauce to add flavor.  It had neither so it was just so-so.  I as debating on the tuna taco instead hoping it would have fared better and will try that the next time...at some point.  

I went on a Sunday evening and was seated promptly and the service was great.  If the tacos were better, I probably would have given it 5 stars as it has a lot of potential and I really do want to see this place do well as Matthews is really lacking great dining.
