I frequent this spot for its cognac chicken(highly recommend), carnitas and gulf shrimp dishes(the crema one is amazing). The food is muy authentico and the atmosphere is great with live music/great service.

Three stars because they have a disgusting salad option/(s?)... opting for something on the light side of fullness, last night I tried the seafood salad: an avocado shell filled with a cold mess of (too much) bland shrimp and avocados on a (mainly iceberg) lettuce blend. If canned shrimp existed, it would  taste like that in last night's salad. 

They do have a cobb salad that sounds promising. I have faith in this place(one of few good places to eat in my neck of the woods) and will try it soon enough.

Lately, the guacamole has been too chunky and bland(ask for much lemon and less texture) and I concur with Keith that the complimentary soup here is lame and should disappear.
