I have really enjoyed Dos Chandler for a few years now, I used to just drink their Negra Modelo and Dos X, but recently started eating the super ewey gooey chimi, which I would recommend to anyone.  Their quesadillas are awesome, they don't get much better than that.  (And I work in a New Mexican style kitchen). I feel they should offer more Mexican beers on tap, and definitely need more tequila options.  The frozen margaritas aren't anything to brag about, however.  The tables are usually sticky now whenever I sit down..and I haven't had a consistent server or bartender in a long time, there is always someone new, but they do a decent job taking care of me, but I can tell they don't have much support management-wise on the floor.  I give three stars due to dirty tables, poor beer selection on tap, and the usual generic tequila selection.  Being a Mexican restaurant they need to step up their game and clean the place up.
