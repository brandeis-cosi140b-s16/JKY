Giving these guys a 3 Stars reason food is good service needs work. 

Besides getting my food fast I wanted a custom burrito I wanted chicken lettuce tomato cheese and sour cream in the burrito. I got a chicken burrito sour cream on the side lettuce cheese and tomatoes under the burrito not where I come from that is not inside the burrito so next time I see you do this I'm going to make you fix it. You luck out this time because I was tired and wanted to go home.
