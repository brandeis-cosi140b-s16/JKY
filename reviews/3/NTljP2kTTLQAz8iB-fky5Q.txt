Good Mexican food at Garduno's at the Fiesta Rancho Casino!

I come to this casino every year to take part in my annual hockey championships that are held on the ice rink here.  Garduno's has become a regular postgame dinner or lunch spot for my wife and I since it is just steps away from the ice rink in the casino.

They offer up some good Mexican food here.  My favorite menu item in the 3 item combo.  You can build your own meal by picking any three burritos and enchiladas with different fillings, such as chicken, ground beef, or cheese.  I like to get 2 ground beef burritos and a ground beef enchilada.  It all comes smothered in either green or red chili (I like the green best) and also comes with a side of rice and beans.  I never fail to clean every last bit off the plate.  My wife likes their shrimp fajitas which arrive at the table sizzling and smoking.  The meal also includes complimentary chips and salsa on the table and you can refill at their chips and salsa bar.  We have yet to try their extensive list of margaritas, but they sound good.

As far as the decor goes, it's a little dark and dimly lit and pretty much just feels like you are in your everyday casino restaurant with a Mexican theme.  They have a sort of track that runs along the ceiling of the bar area that has countless different tequila and liquor bottles attached to it.  It's fun to watch the parade of alcohol make it's way around the ceiling.

Whenever I come to Vegas to play hockey at Fiesta Rancho where Garduno's is located, I am always happy with the meals served up here.
