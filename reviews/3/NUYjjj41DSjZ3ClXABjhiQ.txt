I generally enjoy a homewrecker burrito and it is almost two meals for me.

I would like to give this a 4 but I cant.  I went in on Cinco De Moe's and they ran out of pork.  The employees were rather tired and they let it show.  It was an hour before closing so I didn't think I was so late as to merit stock outs due to they were winding down.  Especially on a busy day such as Cinco de Mayo.

They didn't say welcome to Moe's and that is a little thing, but they didn't say it because they didn't want us there and that is a big thing.

The food preparation was acceptable.  They started locking things down as we prepared to leave.  The dining area was overrun and needed more attention.

I am not holding this place to a gold standard but I have been to Moe's before and this location on this day was lagging.  The place is usually better but having such a bad day can't happen at a 4 of a 5 star.

Sorry Moe's but if you let me down again you are getting less stars and more importantly I will stop coming.
