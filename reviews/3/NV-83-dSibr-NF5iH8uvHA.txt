This place might be challenging to really enjoy if you don't speak a little bit of Spanish. While the menu is in English and Spanish, I did a lot of translating between the waitress and my gringo boyfriend. ;) 

Food here is fairly authentic and so, so cheap. It's hard to believe the amount of food you get for the price. Papusas & tamales for $2, huaraches for $4, tacos for $6... Incredible! Quality is pretty inconsistent -- some dishes are great and others below average. The same dish might even be great on one visit and not good the next. 

Overall, worth a visit though, especially if you catch them on a good day! So, grab yourself a Spanish speaking friend and head to Lempira! I prefer weekend lunch when the place is full.
