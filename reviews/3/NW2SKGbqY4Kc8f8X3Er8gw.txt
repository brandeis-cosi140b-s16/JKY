Came here yesterday, while in town to visit my Girlfriend and her Daughter, bringing them and my Mother for lunch.  The customer service in this visit was great, but to mention we came early and it wasnt busy.  Here is my opinion of the drinks and meals.

The cadillac margaritas were good but on the weak side.  The chips and salsa were okay, as the salsa it came with was almost none existent on spicy.  However, the habinero sauce was great.

The tacos should have a bit more to them, but the burritos were good for the price and size.

They have this nice pond but would be cool if it was clean.
