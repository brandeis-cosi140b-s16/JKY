I think Abuelo's has a great potential to be an excellent restaurant and they just haven't figured it out how yet and I really don't know if they will someday.

It is a shame because Abuelo's is a beautiful restaurant and it has a great ambiance with that open space, high arcs, nice music, private booths and colorful decoration. They just need to work harder on their food PLEASE, I had not been there in a long time and nothing has changed, I really was expecting more. 

I always get their sautéed chicken zucchini and the last two times I had been there it has been kind of salty, today I tried a chicken enchilada with a green chile salsa and it also tasted salty, both dishes really needed a pick me up ingredient and that was acidity, I put some tomatillo salsa on them and they tasted better. They really need to make some deep reflections and make a twist on their dishes. I had a piña colada and that was nice. Service was good too.
