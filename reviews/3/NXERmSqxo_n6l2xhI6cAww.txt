Went in with no expectations and was pleased but not blown away. The atmosphere is bright and modern but not particularly attractive. Service is prompt and attentive. The food is a little overpriced but it's good. Nice fresh chips with a platter of different salsas to start (the menu makes it seem like you have to order this, for a charge, but they must have changed their minds). The burritos and tacos were tasty, as were the refried beans (not so for the rice). All in all, If someone asked me to join them for a meal there, I'd be happy to do so, but I don't know if I'd run back.
