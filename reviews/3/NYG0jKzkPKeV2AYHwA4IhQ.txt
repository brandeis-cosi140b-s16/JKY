This place is ok. It just opened a month ago so still time for improvement. I ordered a seafood chimichanga, with shrimp and crab and my boyfriend got something else that was fried...anyway, they were both overdone, like too crispy. I actually couldn't cut through the bottom of my chimi with a knife it was so hard so it went uneaten. Also, I neither saw or tasted any crab, but there was plenty of shrimp. That atmosphere was ok, nothing to complain or rave about. It is very cheap, and the margarita was good. Worth another shot because of the prices. It does not have a full bar either, the waitress told me it was only beer and margaritas.
