Good cheap lunch place, standard Mexican food and large portions. Plenty of chips and salsa. Perfect for neighborhood lunch when you want to pig out a bit. If you want something a bit better and you have some Spanish language skills head down to Central Ave. Just pick any of the places with the full parking lots; a few low riders in attendance should be a deciding factor.
