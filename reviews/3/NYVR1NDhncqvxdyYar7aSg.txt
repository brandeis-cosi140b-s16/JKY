This should be about a 3-1/2 stars.  It's a small chain, no frills, but it wasn't too bad.  I had the chicken chipotle and the chicken mole gorditas with rice and beans.  The chicken mole sauce tastes exactly like what I make when I am willing to spend the time to make it--and that rates 5 stars.  The chicken chipotle was a bit greasy, but not overwhelmingly so.  The beans and rice were ordinary, as were the salsa bar offerings.
