Please, do not fail to read the caveat in the second paragraph of this review.  Senor Taco is one of the best places in Mesa, AZ for Mexican Food.  My husband and I moved to Mesa in 2010, and we've been on the hunt for excellent Mexican cuisine since we arrived.  About six months ago, we read Yelp reviews and decided to give Senor Taco a try.  It is GREAT.

However, as the old saying goes "I'd rather have hamburger well served than a steak in the face."  Despite the good food, Senor Taco's service leaves much to be desired.  My order has never once been correct.  So on Friday, August 8, 2014, at 10:30 a.m., I ordered a breakfast burrito and **politely** mentioned my preference, citing my previous orders had been incorrect.  I received a not only a snarky retort, but it was delivered with a dismissive wave of the hand by the young man taking orders at the counter and the drive-through.  No amount of good food is worth disrespectful treatment; as if the customer is a burden to endure rather than someone to pleasantly attend.

We will certainly go back to Senor Taco, but I can unequivocally say that if the same young man is at the counter, I'll go next door to Lucky Lou's or The Thai Patio.
