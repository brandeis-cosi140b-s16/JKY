My son and I went here for dinner tonight. He had nachos that were pretty good. I had the 3 amigos enchilada dinner. Enchiladas, beans and rice were ok. Service was decent. I asked for tapatio or the like for my beans and rice, but they do not carry anything like that. Asked for a dinner salad, but they brought all the food at once. I like to have it before my meal when I go out, but if I would have eaten it first my hot food would have gotten cold. I was going to ask about when my salad was coming, but didn't have the opportunity. They are kind of spendy for the so-so quality.
