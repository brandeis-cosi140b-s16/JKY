Chico's is popular with me and my lunch clique from work. It's fast, cheap, pretty good, and in the same shopping center as Starbucks (perfect for a post-lunch stop when we want to kill more time before heading back to the office). The chicken soft tacos are kinda bland, but the quesadillas are pretty good. WAY better than Baja Fresh or a place like that. The salsa bar is definitely the highlight of Chico's with a good variety. I'm partial to the pico de gallo myself.  It's a good place to satisfy a Mexican craving when I'm sober.  The only thing I don't like about Chico's is that it's on the corner of McDowell and 7th Street, which makes turning left out of the parking lot almost impossible.
