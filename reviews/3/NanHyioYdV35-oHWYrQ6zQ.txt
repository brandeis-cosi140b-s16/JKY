Located in terminal B of Phoenix International Airport. I was a little bit wary, since it is scrunched in btw a coffee place and pizza joint. You could probably miss it if you were flying down the concourse. Thanks to Yelp though, it got the best review out of all the food places in terminal B. We decided to brave the Mexican place (we had been thoroughly spoiled from all the Mexican food we ate in Arizona that week). 

I got the veggie burrito and my hubby got the chicken burrito. They were warm and pretty darn tasty for airport food! Kept us full during our flight from AZ to Philadelphia...we weren't tempted to buy any of US Airways inflated snack options. Thanks El Bravo! P.S. And no, there were not emergency sky-high bathroom visits needed.
