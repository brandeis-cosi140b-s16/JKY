Santa Rosa's been hanging out on Basic for quite some time.  It's a staple in some Hendersonian's lives, and although I've sampled a few things from there I've never really embraced it like other taquerias that just constantly have me coming back for more.  I don't know if the grease they used for their fried things doesn't get changed too often or their preparation just doesn't get my toes-a-tappin'.  It's not bad.  If people were going there and bringing something back, I'd totally throw in for a little something if I were hungry.  But I'd never go here on my own accord.
