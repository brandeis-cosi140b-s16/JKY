Willy & Jose's is average Mexican food, with great happy hour prices.  Their happy hour is 7 days a week between 4-6PM, and they have both food and drink specials.  They have $1.00 off all cocktails at the bar in addition to various daily specials where you can potentially get a cocktail and a meal for less than $10.

The food here is okay, but nothing special.  I ordered a 2 item combination (which was a happy hour special) with a chicken taco and a beef chimichanga.  I liked both, but I didn't like the rice that came with my plate.  It was terrible, and by far the worst thing about my meal.  I liked the beans, and also that they had served us complimentary beans with our chips prior to my entr√©e.

Although Willy & Jose's is not the greatest, nor most authentic, Mexican food, their happy hour specials can't be beat.  I wouldn't mind dining here again for happy hour.  However, I think their regular prices are far too high for their quality.
