Regarding the food, we found it to be good.  We had the burrito California and Carnitas fajitas.  Both were flavorful and the portions were generous.

The low point of the experience was the service.  It was not at all busy, but we found ourselves searching for our server on more than on occasion.  When we were ready to go, we had to flag down the manager to get our check and process the payment.

Because the food was good, I think we will give it another try.  I don't believe it will be soon.
