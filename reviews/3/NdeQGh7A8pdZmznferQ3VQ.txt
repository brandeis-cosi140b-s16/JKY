Stopped by to check out this place for lunch today.  Very cute atmosphere  (think beachy). We opted to dine inside since it was a cool 55 degrees outside. Unfortunately the wait staff would leave the door open so that they could go in and out to serve people outside. It made it very cold inside and the food got cold quick as a result. We did ask if they could close it but as soon as they did another waitress would prop it open again. Now the food.....very good prices on apps and very good chips with guacamole. I had the three taco plate which was very good with shredded beef and husband had chicken tacos with rice and beans. He loved the tacos but not the rice and beans. Beans had a smokey flavor. We did feel the prices for the taco plates were a little high but all in all a good place, probably better when warm.
