I want to give this place 2.5 stars until I can try something different. Went to lunch there on a weekday. Apparently we were the first one there. I guess whoever orders first for the day gets the call on the special of the day. So for those of you that went Wednesday, sorry it's taco. Looking at the prices on the menu, this place is definitely overpriced for your standard Mexican fare. The average food (not ala carte) is about $10-12. Taco was a hardshell taco. I asked for shredded beef. Taco shell is not home made. Your standard taco bell taco shell. I really really despise that. I want fresh deep fried authentic taco shells! Otherwise I can go and buy some Ortega taco kits! The shredded beef however was moist, flavorful and good. It wasn't totally dried up and flavorless as someone claimed. So basically the taco shell sucked, otherwise it was alright.
