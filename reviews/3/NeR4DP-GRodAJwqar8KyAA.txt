Of course if they claim to have the best fish tacos-I had to try them. I liked the fish, nice large pieces, deep fried, not too heavy on the batter. Although I found the tacos a bit dry, and I didn't think their sauce was anything special-but at least they had sauce! I asked for just the tacos and they charged me and gave me the entire meal, therefore only three stars...and my search for awesome fish tacos continues.
