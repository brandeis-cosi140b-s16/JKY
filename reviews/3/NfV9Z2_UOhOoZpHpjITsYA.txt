We had lunch here a couple of years ago and were pleased and impressed so came back for an early dinner. On a Sunday night it was not busy though a half dozen tables came in at the same time as we did.  I asked about wine and they have a white and two reds.  My cabernet was Bogle which is ok. This place does serve beer and  mixed drinks too. Our server was friendly and efficient and others assisted her. The chips were not as good as we remembered: low on salt and harder to bite into. Salsa was very hot but clearly home made. We remembered the flour tortillas fondly and I think they are still good. The beans are still pretty good. My beef tortilla was ok but it was mixed in with the side of beans and side of rice and the lettuce didn't have a close relationship to the hard shell. The beef enchilada was ok with a red sauce that was not overly spicy, cheese that was not evenly distributed and spicy beef. I think the kitchen was efficient enough but the place wasn't busy.  This is a locals place. Everyone else was greeted by multiple staff as they arrived. I overtipped based on service not food quality.
