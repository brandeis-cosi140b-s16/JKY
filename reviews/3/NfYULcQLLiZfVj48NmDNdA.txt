Good, but nothing really outstanding.  Service is friendly and attentive here.  The salsa has quite a kick.  I ordered the Seafood Enchiladas.  Good flavor, wish they had a bit more of a cream sauce or something.  Unfortunately, they did a number on my digestive system the next day..  Good choice for Mexican but does not really stand out from any of the other various choices.
