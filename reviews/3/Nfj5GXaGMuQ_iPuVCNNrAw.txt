I'm usually pretty long-winded with my reviews, but this place can be summed up as average. 

It's your standard Mexican restaurant with colorful decor and Mexican mariache music playing. We went for an early dinner on a Sunday, and the place was just a little under halfway full with a few outside tables taken, too.

The margaritas are huge (even the medium), and the chips and salsa are free... and fine. The fella got a taco/burrito combo, and he said it was good. I got the fajitas carnitas, and they were fine. Our waitress was young and sweet but maybe just a little forgetful.

Charanda isn't going to wow you, but it isn't going to disappoint you either.
