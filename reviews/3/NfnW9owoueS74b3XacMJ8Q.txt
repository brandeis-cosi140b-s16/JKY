How many times have I rolled up on this spot at 3:30am to get a Arizona/california burrito.  hmmmm...  steak, cheese, pico, and home fried potatos and the thing is gigantic. $4 you cant beat it.

this place is EXACTLY the same as Rivas.  Actually all these 24 hour burrito places in valley are all the same.

love them.
