Like everyone else on Yelp, I've driven by this place about a million times without ever venturing inside; but when the 15yr old told me she really wanted some Mexican for dinner, unable to bring myself to go on yet another Filiberto's run, I logged onto Yelp, did a quick search and said to myself ... "oh yeah, I've seen that place a gazillion times, why not?"

I read that the place has recently undergone a remodel.  If that's the case, I'd hate to see what it looked like before.  Other than a thick layer of schmutz on the ceiling, there was nothing wrong, but certainly nothing inside looked remotely new.  

I walked up to the window and ordered the green chile burrito (my standard for all Mexican restaurants), my daughter ordered the machaca beef burrito and a quesadilla.  Actually, she ordered the pork carnitas burrito at first, but they were out, so machaca would have to do.

The food came up quickly, and while the tortillas were excellent, the green chile was average at best without the kick I expected.  The machaca burrito was absolutely packed with beef (had to have 3x the beef of the green chile burrito) and was pleasantly juicy.  The quesadilla comes simply folded in quarters.  Initially I thought it was just an extra tortilla, but sure enough, there was a layer of the standard melted cheddar inside.  Actually, it was kinda of fun to tear off pieces of the quesadilla and dip them in the red chile sauce they provide alongside.

Bonus points for having Barq's Red Creme Soda in the soda machine; otherwise nothing to get too excited about, but nothing noxious either.
