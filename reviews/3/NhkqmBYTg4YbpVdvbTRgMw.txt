This place is OK. Nothing phenomenal. The breakfast burritos are OK, which is weird as usually they are absolutely tasty. I eat here pretty regularly as it is next to my job. It is definitely not bad. Just nothing to really blow you away. I did have one of the shrimp specials ($11!) and it was indeed excellent. 

I wish they made their own horchata, or at least pretended they did. Watching them poor it out of the bottle I could buy is rather underwhelming. Not all of their Mexican coke is made with cane sugar (the number one reason I drink Mexican coke). so watch for that. 

If you are near and hungry, stop in! I wouldn't bring people or make a special trip though.
