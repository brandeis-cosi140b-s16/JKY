yummy! they brought back my favorite salsa...funny thing is i stopped going to BF because of this. i don't care for the other salsas, so i'd rather go to Rubios. but being as this place is so close to my casita, i'm lovin it! it has big chunks of jalepeno and its hot hot hot! i ordered the chicken taco (first time i didn't go with the fish tacos) and it was very tasty. not bad for a chain restaurant. it was overstuffed with everything delicious! i had to lightly top it with salsa, because it kept sliding right off. no complaints except for the guacamole. it was more like guacatomatoe. nothing to yelp home about. i don't care for tomoatoes in my guac, so i had to dig around them, and that left me with nearly a teaspoon full of guac. guess next time the guac will have to be homemade. one very surprising treat was the churro. it was very sweet and fluffy not the run of the mill under cooked center with crispier than crispy edges. i would definitely go back just for the churro with a cup of coffee...yummy i can just taste it now. hope i remember.
