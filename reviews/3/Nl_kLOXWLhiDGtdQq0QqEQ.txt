This place is right in my neighborhood, and I usually go for takeout. The food is good and cheap - think a slighly more upscale Filiberto's without the resulting stomach ache. Very casual, order at the counter and seat yourself. Try the lengua and the albondigas. My one complaint is the hours - 7:30am to 9pm. A place like this needs to have early morning hours for the breakfast burrito crowd and late night hours for the fourthmeal crowd. Not that there's ever been a crowd in the place - but maybe there would be if they were open later!
