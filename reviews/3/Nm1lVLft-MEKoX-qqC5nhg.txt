The biggest reason to stop here are the pleasant proprietors.  They were kind and generous.  I found the food unremarkable but I probably asked for the wrong dish.

After i ordered the 3 tables around me all asked for some quacamole dish and sounded very disappointed when told they were out.

Other than a pleasant stop there is little to recommend Sofia's.
