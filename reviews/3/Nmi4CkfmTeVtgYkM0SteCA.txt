First of all - They only allow 2 basket of chips definitely not what I am looking for when I go out for mexican food. 

The waitress that we had either was new or was not trained well because she kept forgetting everything. I asked her about an item on the menu and she didn't know so I asked her to find out exactly what it was. She comes back 15 mins later and she forgot that I had asked her a question. 

If you are looking for good mexican food don't go to Monterrey there are better places out there.
