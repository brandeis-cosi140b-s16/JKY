It's good, most of the time. You might find cripsy taquito's (rolled tacos, heh heh) or you mind find bendible taquitos, reheated and chewy. Let's be honest, most Las Vegans wouldn't know good Mexican food anyway, so Roberto's has nothing to worry about and I expect their brand of nothing-special to be around for years to come.

The best part about this restaurant is the salsa bar but be warned; The dirt-biker types that frequent this taqueria can be found LICKING THEIR FINGERS as they load up on extra-mild salsa and limes.

3 star median for 4 star freshness alternating with 2 star reheat.
