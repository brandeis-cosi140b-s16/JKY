Really 3.5 stars if I could give it to them.  If you like quality eats and super cheap you'll dig it.  90 cent tacos and 65 cents on Wednesday!   They're round and only about 3 inches across so order a few.  Had the goat meat sopes and they were solid definitely try the homemade drank they have in tubs on the counter - pineapple yes tamarind not as good.  Lotsa funky meats to try if you're adventurous like pork gut and tongue along with the billy goat.  Good cheap no frills food just couldn't quite give it a 4th star.
