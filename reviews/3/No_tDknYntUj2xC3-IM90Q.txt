My friends and I stopped by here one Friday before heading to a movie. Unfortunately it was the same night as the UFC fight and they almost didn't let us in until we promised them that we weren't staying for the fight and we'd be outta there before our "reserved" table was needed by the person who reserved it. 

The service was nice but slow which is funny because they were adamant about the fact that we needed to be out of there before 7.  The drinks were weak which was disappointing. The nachos were delicious though and the dinner selection was pretty good although it's obvious that the main stay of this place is the bar. Overall, it wasn't too bad and we'll probably go back another day when there's not a fight. :)
