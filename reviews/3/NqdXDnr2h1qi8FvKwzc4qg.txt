On a lazy Sunday, needed to get a quick bite for lunch and wanted to try something different.  Figured we'd give this place a try as my wife loves hispanic food.  I ran over for take out.  First the place is actually huge inside which is surprising and they have a couple of flat panel TVs in the dining area.  I grabbed a couple of their burritos, one with pork and the other with chicken.  They make everything in front of you and have quite a few options to put in the burrito.  I had the "spicy beans" in my burrito and they were anything but spicy.  The salsa provided also was bland.  Overall the food was OK, but nothing that is going to make me want to go back anytime soon.
