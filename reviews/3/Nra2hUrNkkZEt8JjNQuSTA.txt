Love the atmosphere but not the food. The only extremely good thing we ate was the salsa. The guacamole was sub par, bland and flavorless. The el pastor taco was the worst I've eaten. It's usually my favorite at other restaurants. The chicken taco was average. The fish taco was pretty good but I probably wouldn't order it again. I'd  be willing to give this place another try, but I'll stay away from the tacos.
