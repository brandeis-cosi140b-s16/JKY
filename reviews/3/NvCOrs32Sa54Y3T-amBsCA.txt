What's to say? It's a pretty expensive but homemade tasting food(Is that a good or bad thing - who's to say?) Like another review said - the cheese tasted like Sargento and I can't disagree. Because it tastes like something you could make yourself - its easy to say "whats the point?" I've had it a couple times and I appreciate the taste and price and its nice to goto when Ian's is full but don't expect to be Wow'd or something.
