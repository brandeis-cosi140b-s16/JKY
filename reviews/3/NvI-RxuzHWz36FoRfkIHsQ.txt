Nicely decorated, loud mariachi band, and female servers dressed in authentic Mexican dress. Had the baked seabass dish a la Veracruzana with the standard corn-embedded rice and refried beans with cotija cheese. I asked for a side of white rice since I was allergic to corn, and a few minutes later I was handed a dish of, wait for it, white rice with corn in it... Server finally realized what I had meant and offered to get some red rice, which I was later charged for. No worries.Most likely will go back as there are other dishes that sound enticing. I must say, however, that I enjoyed ten, twenty times over the simple chicken torta I had chosen at the Phoenix Ranch Market on Central and Southern a few weeks back. That telera bread was just divine!
