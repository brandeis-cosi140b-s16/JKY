This chain of faux-Mexican fast food joints will always hold a special place in my heart. After a night on the strip, my buddies and I were looking for something quick and good. This is not what came to mind for everyone else. I couldn't wait to have some chicken soft tacos! They had Raising canes in mind.

It was in sight and only after we arrived at the drive-thru and they were closed, we proceeded over to Del Taco.

We ordered $30 worth of food and scarfed it down licketly-split. The "beef" is sub-par but the chicken products are outstanding. Spicy Jack Chicken Quesadilla, the Chicken Soft Tacos, and Chicken Burritos. Brilliant!
