I guess I was in the minority of people who believed Caldero, the former occupant of the building, was the next best thing to sliced bread.  Actually I hate sliced bread.  Bad analogy.  Not realizing they had closed, I contemplated my order as I approached the front door.  But wait?  What's that?  A new sign caught my eye.  Filiberto's Mexican Food AND Bar?  When did FiliB  move in and when did he start serving alcohol?  Crushed and confused, we went in.  It's not that I don't like FiliB.  He's great for a quick drive-thru.  But what's he doing in this spot?  Well, he's suffering from an identity crisis apparently.

A hostess seated us.  Yep, a HOSTESS!  And brought menus.  But they're just folded carry-out paper menus.  Not the real deal.  Then she took our order.  Yep, TOOK OUR ORDER!  My husband was served his Micheleda in a glass mug, yet my Coke was reduced to a paper cup.  We ordered chips & salsa.  Remember, this is the same FiliB dirt cheap prices, so expect to pay for them.  The server never brought them.  Our meals were served on actual breakable plates.  Yet the utensils (NOT PLASTIC) were placed with care on these itty bitty pathetic excuses for napkins-the kind that usually sit in a dispenser.  The food was the same as any FiliB.  I ordered a green chile burro enchilada style, and foolishly expected enchilada sauce.  It had a pork green chile sauce over it instead.  No real complaints, but in my opinion, it should be either table-service or a fast-food place, not this weird hybrid of the two.  I'm more inclined to visit FiliB at a drive-thru location and go elsewhere for a nicer sit-down meal.

However, if you think I was confused, you should have seen the folks who came in after us expecting to walk up to a counter to order.  If you come in, which you must because there is no drive-thru, you will order at the hostess station and wait...wherever you want I guess.  But you can have a margarita while you do.
