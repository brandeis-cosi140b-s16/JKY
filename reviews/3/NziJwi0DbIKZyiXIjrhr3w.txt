Ate at the Border Grill at Mandalay Bay recently. 

Look and feel: Modern Mexican. It's bright, vibrant, and loud. Very Vegas.

The food:
They start you with chips and salsa, of course. The tortilla chips are great. Just thick enough to be crunchy rather than crispy, and the right level of salt. Two of the three salsas were pretty good, but not even remotely spicy so we asked if they had anything with some kick. Our waiter brought their spicy salsa, but it was really disappointing - kinda bland, not spicy on my tongue, then fiery in the back of my throat - all of the bad of spicy food and none of the good. We went back to the two that we liked.

Their guacamole was very good. Extremely fresh and flavorful, and they let the avocado shine.

Based on our waiter's suggestion, I ordered their Yucatan pork. It was pretty good, but not any better than I've had in family taqueria's in the bay area. Solid refried beans, completely unremarkable spanish rice, moist pork. The corn tortillas were dry around the edges so I stopped after eating one of them. Probably the best thing on the plate was the plantains.

The service was very good from start to finish.

My overall impression is that this was a reasonable place that I wouldn't avoid, but neither did it leave me with anything that screamed "I have to return."
