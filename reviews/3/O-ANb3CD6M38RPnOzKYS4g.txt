I went with a huge group, and since there was only one waitress there (they had to call another waiter to come in to help), the service was not great.  One group got their food, and when they were almost finished eating, our orders were taken.  They had burgers and fries on their menu which I thought was weird, under "Gringo Food."

I got their chicken picado, pretty good, sauteed chicken with onions and peppers, with rice and beans and a good, large flour tortilla.  Their chips and salsa were OK, pureed tomatoes, very spicy in little bottles.  I ate so much of them because my food came out so late.  The chairs were hard, it was a really large, empty restaurant with a somewhat bar-ish feel.

Good to stop by if you're in the area but not worth a long trip.
