I live near here, and was curious when it took over the building vacated by Mandalay Noodle World. I've stopped in twice- the food is very similar to what you find at Filiberto's, and the dining layout is almost identical to a couple of the largest Filly-b's locations. I've had a Chicken Quesdilla, a Cheese Enchilada and a Carne Asada Burrito. All three were C+ dishes, which is all you can really ask of most Mexican food. I like that it's nearby and open late. I'll definitely be back.
