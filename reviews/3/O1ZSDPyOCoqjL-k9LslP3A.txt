Is really 2 1/2 stars in my opinion...

I went here for a late lunch approximately around 3pm. Not many people so it was pretty much quiet and we had the waiter all to ourselves. The food is ok, not good not bad. It will cure your fix for Mexican food but won't exactly wow you or secure a return visit. 

The enchiladas barely had any filling, I had one chicken and one cheese and they were very skimpy just mostly sauce. The rice and beans were moist but tasteless with zero flavor. I feel that I paid 15.99 for bland rice and beans seriously. 

The best thing that was fantastic but impossible to screw up was the table side guacamole.

The liquor drinks are strong and good I have to say at least, however I think those are made and brought over from another bar on the property and not the actual restaurant? Not sure I can even give them the credit for the drinks.

Food is just ok and for the higher prices for mediocre, I won't be back.
