Was passing through the Copa on the way to San Diego and it was right about here that I wanted to eat something. ANYTHING, really. I quickly turned into a mall and drove around and Cilantro's was the first thing I saw that served food and had a sign that said OPEN. There was already a good sized crowd even though it was just after 11. I had a carnitas burrito with hot sauce. The hot sauce didn't register anywhere on the Richter scale (or was it Scoville??) so I grabbed a few of the roasted jalapenos they had in the salsa area and alternating bites between burrito and jalapenos did the trick. Now we were cooking with fire. Or eating with it rather. It was just enough to wake me up for a bit. Pretty standard Mexican joint. It hit the spot when I needed something to eat and that's all that matters. Plenty of parking as it's in a mall. Service is counter service - they make it right there in front of you. Will probably be back if I'm passing through town while hungry again.
