The pink taco specialty was soo good.A lil pricey for what you get though.I had the panty dropper martini delicious!! But small for $15.00.the decor is interesting  but cool nice atmosphere.They got slammed mid dinner and the waiter looked dishelved.He gave us the wrong check,didnt get refills or checked on.They have funny cute tshirts for $30.
