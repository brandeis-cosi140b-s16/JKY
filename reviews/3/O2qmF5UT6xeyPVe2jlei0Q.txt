I ate at Frank and Lupe's with a friend on July 30, 2011. The service staff was friendly but not very attentive as they were packed. The food came out and was piping hot and fresh. I had the Nachos Supreme and my friend had the chicken chimichanga with rice and beans. The Nachos were pretty good but the pico de gallo is full of kick. If you do not like super spicey foods. I advise avoiding the pico de gallo here as it does have a solid bite. I tried my friend's chicken chimichanga which was very good. The cook chicken with onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers. We got luck and did not have to wait for a table when we arrived at 6:30. However, people arrived after us and were told the wait was 15-20 minutes or you can go around the back and eat outside on the large patio. In Arizona in the summer not the best place you want to eat and enjoy your dinner especially if you work outside like me!
