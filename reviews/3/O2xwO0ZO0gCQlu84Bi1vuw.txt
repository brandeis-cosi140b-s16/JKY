Not sure if others have mentioned but they have ALBONDIGAS soup!!!! (vegetable soup and meatballs with a mild spice kick to it) It was sooooo delicious!!! Yeah, I come to vegas and go for the albondigas soup, go figure.

I was impressed with their complimentary chips and salsa. Other mexican restaurants would only give you one kind of salsa, but here at Cabo, they gave us a mild salsa, hot salsa (my fav out of the three) and bean dip. I'm not a big fan of beans but this was really good.

Prices were alright. Typical. My albondigas soup was $5.99...and it was a pretty big bowl. I ordered a shimp tacos combination plate and it was $11.99 i think.

All in all, I wouldn't go outta my way for this.
