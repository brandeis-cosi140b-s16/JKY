The prices are decent... The salsa bar was good probably one of the better salsa bars I've come across. I didn't try the Sonoran dog but I had a Caramelo which wasn't bad wasn't anything to rave about IMO. My son had a bean and cheese burrito and he was a little puzzled that they weren't smashed beans but they were flavorful and he enjoyed it. It was clean, spacious, portions were good... Guess I'll have to try the Sonoran dog next time to see the big deal.
