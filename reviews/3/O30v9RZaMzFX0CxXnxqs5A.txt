Our visit was on a Saturday afternoon. We choose to sit outside even thought is was a bit cooler outside. We were seated quickly, table was adjusted for the two of us and our waiter (Chris) was out quite fast. He was knowledgeable with everything from beverages to entries and didn't let us down. Food arrived fairly quick. It was hot, plentiful, and good tasting. The waiter even left us his iphone to help us find an answer to a trivia question we were discussing. All in all we were treated well and enjoyed the dining.
