I've come here so many times over the years I've lost count. Number of check-ins is worthless because I've been coming here since before I even knew what Yelp was. This place is a bit schizo though. On nights when it is slow, this is a pretty chill bar and a great place to hang out. On nights when it is jam packed, the douchebag index is off the charts. Food's ok - mostly stuff like fish tacos, nachos, cantina fare. Service has usually been pretty decent even when crowded. I used to come with folks from work on Fridays for happy hour but I think the dB factor became a bit much for all of us so we stopped. Same mall as BevMo so if you decide you want to bail and still have drinks, you can stop by to pick up your stash. Lots of parking in this mall.
