I frequent this Del Taco location as it is near my office but I have grown weery of them.  Increasingly I am getting the wrong order.  I use a coupon for buy 1 get 1 Double Del Cheese Burger, get charged for such, yet receive two single burgers.  I ask for no tomato on the burgers but I get tomato anyhow.  Today I ordered a four piece mac-n-cheese bites but received cheese cake bites instead.  I would not be so frustrated by this if ordering just for myself.  But I order for co-workers as well.  When their order comes out wrong I feel bad.  Perhaps if the staff behind the counter stopped chatting amongst themselves they would get the orders out quicker and more accurate.
