We went to eat Cinco on a Thursday for dinner.  The food was about average compared to other Mexican restaurants we have eaten at in Pittsburgh.  I ordered the Cinco tacos and thought they were pretty good, but my wife got the enchiladas and she thought they were just average.  We also ordered their chips and salsa which we thought were very good.  I ordered a draft beer that was flat, but it seemed like most people in the restaurant were drinking margaritas so that is probably the way to go.  Overall  service was good, food was average and the prices are a little high for the food quality.
