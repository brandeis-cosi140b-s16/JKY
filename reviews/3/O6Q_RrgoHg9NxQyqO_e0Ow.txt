Perfect place for a low-carb dieter since you can get 8 pieces of chicken with no sides and it will be a hearty meal (with leftovers) for two.  I also appreciate the fact that they have sugar-free lemonade and ice tea available.  I loved their new tropical habanero sauce.  So spicy!

This particular location was not the cleanest but ok for a fast food place.  The person at the register seemed friendly enough so I have no complaints.
