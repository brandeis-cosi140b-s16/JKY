We met up Friday night for a richly-deserved  family dinner of margaritas and enchiladas.  The weather was lovely so we sat outside to munch on chips and bean dip.

Our waitress was nice but missed an opportunity to recommend their specialty dishes.  I asked her to make recommendations on drinks and entrees, especially since this was the first time for most of us.  Having read some of the other reviews, I see some intriguing options that we missed earlier.

  My brother suggested this place because it has an array of vegetarian options and is reasonably priced.  We all ordered our faves: nachos, spinach enchiladas, chimichangas, chili rellenos, and cheese enchiladas. 

 I had my usual enchiladas with red sauce, which were accompanied by rice.  The red sauce was ultra-mild and lacking in spice which means I am still looking for the perfect blend of heat and flavor.  This sauce may have to be doctored up to fit the bill.  The bean dip was heavenly though.

All in all, it was a good meal with good service, great weather, and delightful company.   The check for 5 people was 68 dollars; it was reasonable for the amount of food we received.  This place is not big on ambience but was just fine for a family dinner and end-of-week decompression.
