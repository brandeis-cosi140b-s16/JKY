The food here is good, but for how pricey it is it should be better. I don't think its any better then any other Mexican place were you can get the same dish for half the price. That being said, the ambience is much nicer. But its pretty, loud, dark, and I felt like our waiter was rushing us.
I got the soft tacos, one steak, one chicken. They were nothing special but I like that they came with guac. You get comp chips and salsa which are also standard except the salsa was a little runnier than I like.
