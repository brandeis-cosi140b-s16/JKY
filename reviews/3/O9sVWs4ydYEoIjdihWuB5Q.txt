So my friend was convinced we needed to be at IMAX 2 hours before Avatar started and guess what?...we didn't. So to kill an hour  we headed to San Felipe's next door. I love the look of this place..it's flashy and fun.. tons to look at. On the agenda.. drinks..1/2 off anything normally $8 or under...Not a bad deal at all. My friend and I had the "Panty Dropper". You would assume this drink to be strong.. right? Nope..tasted refreshing but not potent. For food I ordered the "Shrimp PO Amigo" - 1/4 loaf of french bread, covered with shrimp cheese and garlic spread.. perfect. Summary I wouldnt go here to tie one on..it's typically pricey for drinks with low alcohol content..food is decent though. Great place to kill time.
