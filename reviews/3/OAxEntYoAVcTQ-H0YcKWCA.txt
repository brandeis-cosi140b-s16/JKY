Great breakfast burritos and strawberry enchiladas. I had the bacon, egg, cheese and potato burritos, while my fiancee had the egg, cheese and potato burrito. She found the burrito to be a bit tough on her stomach, but I had no problem. I would do t he breakfast burritos again but pass on the strawberry enchiladas. The strawberry enchilada was decent, just boring and a little soggy. The breakfast burrito was satisfyingly large and delicious.

The place itself was relatively clean and super casual (we took carryout but ordered in-store). There were a variety of drink options available for self-serve with free refills - soft drinks, "red juice" and horchata. There is a salsa bar with various salsas and pico de gallo. The salsa options can be packaged to go, as well! There are a few flat screens in the dining area that were broadcasting the news and sports while we were in there. Pretty rad! The service was as expected at a sort-of fast food spot. Nice enough, no frills.

Oh, and as mentioned... they offer Thrifty Ice Cream!
