The food was bland. The atmosphere at the bar was nice with half the bar opening up to the outside. The drinks were a bit pricy but well mixed. The night life is better then most places nearby. While we have not taken advantage of it, they have a jumpy house outside for the kids on most Sundays. I would give it a try for evening drinks but do not expect much from their food.
