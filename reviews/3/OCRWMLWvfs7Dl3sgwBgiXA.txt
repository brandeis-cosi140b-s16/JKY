What can I say?  It's taco bell!

When I have a craving for their hard tacos, it's hard to resist!  It's easy on the wallet and douses the taste bud's wants.

Another favorite is the cinnamon twists!

This restaurant location has never disappointed for lunch - it is well kept, clean and has friendly staff.
