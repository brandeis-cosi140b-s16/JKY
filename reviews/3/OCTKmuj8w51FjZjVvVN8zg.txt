I've never been to Chipotle, but I imagine this is what it would be like. It's basically like a Subway...but for burritos. And nicer!

On the boyfriend's recommendation, we split a Queso burrito with chicken. He declared that the burritos here were HUGE so we should just share. I've read about how a Chipotle tortilla was 300+ calories alone and was scared that Qdoba would be the same, so I agreed. I'm not sure if I would agree with his HUGE assessment. The burritos were pretty stuffed and fat, but not very long, if that makes any sense. I probably could have eaten a whole one on my own, but even after nearly 3 years of dating, I like to give the impression of a small, girlish appetite. Plus I ate most of a giant jar of chex mix prior. 

Anyhoo, back to the burrito. It was okay, nothing to rave about. I wasn't a huge fan of the liquid nacho cheese sauce inside. I'd come back, but would probably get something else.
