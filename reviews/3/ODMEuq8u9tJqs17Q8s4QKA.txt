My boyfriend and I were driving around last night and trying to decide where to eat when we came upon 1900 Mexican Grill. We were a bit leary as we'd not heard much about this place and felt like we would have if it was any good. Since I had a Citipass coupon, and we were both getting crabby because we were hungry, we decided to check it out.

The atmosphere is a bit generic but there were a ton of tables inside; it is much bigger than you'd expect. There was a bar in the back and quite a few of the tables were taken, but we were led promptly to a booth. Chips and salsa immediately arrived and they were pretty good. I decided to start with the orange pineapple crush, which was delicious but a bit pricey at $9. I saw a happy hour menu with prices listed that were the same as the regular menu, but they did have drink specials ($2.50 bottles of Mexican beer on Thursday nights). 

Our server, Karen C, was quite attentive (without being annoying) and even helped me choose my beverage. We got the guacamole made tableside ($9) and it was actually very good; I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars for how fresh it tasted. My boyfriend got the Enchiladas Verdes ($13), which came with only rice, so he had to order a side of refried beans (which ended up being enough refried beans for about four people). Being quite the enchilada aficianado, he said he enjoyed these. I ordered the fajita quesadilla, which was very good as well, but huge. I ended up eating a1/3 of it and plan to eat the rest for lunch AND dinner today...three meals for $10 is a great deal in my book.  

Ultimately, if you just have to have some Mexican and Cantina 1511 is on a two hour wait (as they are frequently on weekends), this is a solid back-up choice. Plenty of parking available in the lots behind and across the street.
