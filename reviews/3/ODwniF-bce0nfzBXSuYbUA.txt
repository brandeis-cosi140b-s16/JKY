If you are not staying at The Quad, odds are you will never find this place. Access is via a narrow escalator and you may chance on it if you are watching a show donwstairs. The place is awash in a red glow (lighting) with surfboards hanging from the ceiling and a spacious drinking area out front. The menu is typical - tacos, quesadillas, burritos, ensaladas. It was not busy on a Friday night, and mostly families and older couples were in the restaurant.

But we stayed because one thing caught our eye: $1 margaritas ($2 if you get the strawberry one). All night. No limits. Even on weekends.

No lines and easy drinks? I am set. The long drive to Las Vegas began to fade away after the 1st couple of sips. I'll make do with the acceptable food.
