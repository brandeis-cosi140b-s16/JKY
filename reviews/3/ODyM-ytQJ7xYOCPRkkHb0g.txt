If cleanliness is next to godliness and you see me here in the afterlife, you'll know you didn't make it.  This place was a mess.  Not filthy as in never been cleaned, just a mess as in what kind of people have been eating here tonight?  

There's a restaurant I love in Flagstaff called La Fonda.  So now I'll eat anywhere that shares the name, even if not the food.  This La Fonda I can't say I love, but I did like it.

The chips were hot and obviously made in-house given the nice coating of grease at the bottom of the bowl.  They serve two salsas, a mild chunky one and a hotter chipotle one.  Both were very good.  I just pretended I hadn't read the review about the reused salsa.  I had a red chile chimichanga.  The red chile was excellent.  A little hot, but very flavorful, and the meat was well-trimmed and devoid of excessive fat and other non-edible parts.  The tortillas are better than some of the places here, but not on par with Carolina's of course.

Our server was genuinely nice.  This and the rundown interior are a clue you've crossed the Scottsdale border.  Good enough I may come back sometime.
