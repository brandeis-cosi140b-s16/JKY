DANGGGGGGGGGGGG this place generally has terrible reviews. Why? 
I came here as a meeting spot to get on a party bus, and was actually surprised at how warm I was being that its generally an outdoor venue. 
My complaint: the bartenders werent very friendly. And we're very anti talking. Most bars I go to, when there's NO ONE at the bar, I appreciate not being rushed to order, here... They just want to talk amongst themselves as employees, very unprofessional if you ask me. The people that come here are pretty laid back, and a diverse crowd as well. 
I'd come back, but the drink deals aren't as impressive as other bars and their appetizers are mediocre. At least I can say I've tried it! Probably won't be back though, not unless I'm meeting friends who care for this place.
