I love that there's a drive through. You've gotta get lucky though at the time you come to this location though. I think some of the cooks care about the quality of the food more than others at this location. It's kind of a gamble to buy here when it comes to presentation. Sometimes the food is amazingly neat, sometimes it's not. Messy or not, it's tasty.

 If you're from California, do NOT eat a California burrito from ANY Roberto's location. You will be thoroughly disappointed. They don't put fries inside. Instead they put chopped up potatoes. Bleh.
