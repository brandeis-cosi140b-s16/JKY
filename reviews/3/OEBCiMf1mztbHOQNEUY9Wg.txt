Little hole-in-the-wall places sometimes have the best food around and questionable sanitary conditions. Chicken and Grill seems pretty clean as far as hole-in-the-walls go. The food was just okay. I ordered a Saturday special which is two tamales, rice, beans, three chips and a soda for $5.99. I was given a choice of asada, ground beef or chicken tamales. I chose chicken because I can't recall having ever tried ground beef or asada in a tamale. It just seemed strange to me. 

I took my food to go so I could eat and relax at home. While I was shown my food before leaving, I did not pay attention to it all until I got home. Even with the familiar shredded chicken these tamales were unique. Two tubes of masa cut open and topped with meat and cheese rather than being formed all together like every other tamale I've seen. The masa was a dense and a little dry. The moist chicken and the side of warm sauce helped. And the chicken really was moist and flavorful. The side of rice was good. Just a good standard Mexican rice with some mixed vegetables. It is something simple but I love it. The beans were meh. Runny refried beans with a bit of spice. There was nothing really wrong with them other than me not caring for refried beans in the first place. When I do eat them I prefer they be thicker so I can mix them with the rice. And the three chips I was given were stuck into the beans making them soggy by the time I got home. As for the soda, maybe they were low on stock. My choices were Coke, Diet Coke and Mt Dew. 

I might be back some day to try more food. Maybe a 3 taco special. It is close and convenient and the prices are fair. Service wasn't bad and my food was ready quickly. Its worth a second go.
