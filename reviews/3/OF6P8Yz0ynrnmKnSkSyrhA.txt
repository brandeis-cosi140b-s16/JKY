Near my lady's house so I've been twice recently. First time we ate in and it was pretty good but took forever to get our burritos. Two days later I craved it again and went back. First of all the phone number is WRONG so I couldn't order ahead, so I went in. They have me a punch card for a free burrito but this time the carne asada was too stringy and also a little cold. Meh. I will be back.
