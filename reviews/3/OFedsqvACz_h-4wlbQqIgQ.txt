After reading some of the reviews here you would think you're going to be blown away by something that would make you want to come back.

Don't get your hopes up.  For the prices here you can go to any federicos and get twice the amount of food.

No mini/street tacos....  Got the carne asada and chicken tacos and neither were great just bland fast food.

The hot sauce is actually hot though, I guess if you paralyze your tongue enough with that you don't notice the bland food.

Just ok.
