Pros: Awesome chile/salsas, probably the BEST green chile I've had in AZ. Red chile was great as well and so were the dips (with chips). Chile relleno (they use hatch) was awesome and my wife loved the chile con carne (green). Kid had a chicken plate and liked it and she is very picky so food was very good. 4 stars on the food.
Cons: Very slow service even to sit down. We asked for refills and chips a few times before they finally brought them and we are pretty patient. The place is HOT and it seems even worse when eating that spicy hatch chile. All the tables around us were using menus as fans. My michelada came with a nice fly floating right on top when I got it so they gave me a new one. No discount, no next one on the house but it happens. 2 stars on service.
