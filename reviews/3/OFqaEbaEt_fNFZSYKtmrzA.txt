I was in the area when this little cafe caught my eye.

It was early so they  were only serving breakfast.

Great menu selections at very affordable prices. Super friendly waitress, Fresh made salsa bar.....YUM!

I got the Huevos Rancheros I think it was $5.50 (see pics)
It was totally Delicious!! Loves that sauce with chunks of jalapenos, it had such a good flavor without being too spicy.

Guest had a breakfast Burrito Enchilada style with eggs, bacon, potato and cheese...$3.50 (see pics)

This location is only open for breakfast and lunch, but they also do alot of catering if your in need. 
I was told they bought another restaurant around the corner that will be open for dinner...coming soon.

I'll be back next time I'm in the area.
