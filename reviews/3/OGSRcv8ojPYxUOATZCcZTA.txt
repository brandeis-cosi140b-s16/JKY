Pretty decent fare. I ordered their special which includes a beef taco, cheese enchilada, tamale, and refried beans for about $7, pretty good deal, however soft drinks are extra and extremely overpriced so I paid about $10. The meal was decent, I'd come back if a friend wanted to eat here, but I really wish I would have shelled the extra $5 and went to the Macayo's down the road.
