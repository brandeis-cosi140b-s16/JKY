Today I ordered a Chile Rellenos Plate, and a Bowl of Hatch Green Chile with Chicken.

The Chile Rellenos had the red sauce, was flavorful but not very spicy.  Had a homemade taste to it which I enjoyed; beans/rice were excellent.  The Chile itself however was just ok.  It was more of an omelette with a chile inside.  It had a good flavor, but my wife is picky and didn't enjoy the omelette-style chile.  Normally it's a fluffy egg mixture encasing the chile with a crisp texture on the outside.  What she had was an omelette filled with strips of chile, not a stuffed chile.

I ate the bowl of Hatch Green Chile with Chicken, which was $8.25.  I ordered our meals to go, and I was surprised to see what I ordered in a 16-oz soda cup.  It came with 3 small tortillas (dipping or to make a taco?? tasty but wasn't really sure.) and that was that.  It was bland at first, but then the pepper and green chile builds as you eat it creating a peppery-heat that tastes good.  It was more watery than I expected, and the tortillas didn't really serve a place.  I was pretty disappointed immediately that I had just paid about $9 for a cup of soup.  I thought it was going to be more like a rice-bowl or something.

Now, to stay positive, my wife and I eat their Hatch Chile breakfast burritos regularly at the farmer's market.  We always enjoy them, they are $6.95 and delicious.  HUGE too.  I have to say though, I was very disappointed with what I ordered today.  I suppose I'll stick with that burrito at the market.
