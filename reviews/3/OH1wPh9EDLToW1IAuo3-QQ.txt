Felipito's is a good mexican restaurant, but you must know what to order in order to like it.  It's not the cheapest mexican restaurant in town, but there are certain dishes that make Felipito's one of my favorite mexican restaurants in Las Vegas.  
One of those dishes is their Carnitas Tacos.  The carnitas is the best meat at Felipito's, but is not just typical Carnitas.  The carnitas at Felipito's is big chunks of fried pork with a little bit of fat attached to the pieces to keep them tender.  
I also really like the carne asada quesadilla.  The quesadilla is stuffed with a large amount of cheese and carne asada.  Big portion, and great flavor.  
Another item I really like is their crunchy beef tacos.  The crispiness of the tortilla, and the juiciness of the shredded beef go very well together.  

One of the main reasons I started going to Felipito's is because it is open 24 hours.  While there are many choices for 24 hour food in Vegas, it is the best option on Tropicana late at night for authentic mexican!
