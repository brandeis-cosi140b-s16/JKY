Qdoba or not to Qdoba - that is the question here!

Looking for decent service and fresh food at a price that will not rock your wallet...then Qdoba is a good place to park yourself at. I have been here a couple of times and the service can be touch and go depending on who waits on you....but what is always good is the food. You can taste how fresh everything is in every bite.

Every time I go there I get the same thing : Mexican gumbo with pork and black beans. This is a definite comfort food. YUM! I have also had the cheese quesadila and the con queso - both were good.

Overall - it's a ok place to stop if you are not looking for top notch service with a smile and just want a bowl of warm gumbo to warm your spirit instead. Qdoba on your on risk.
