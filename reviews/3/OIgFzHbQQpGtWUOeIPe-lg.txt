I have been coming here for years.  Love the mellow vibe of sitting in the bar, sports is on super low volume and nice place to just hang out and relax with a quiet conversation.  Food is pretty good, won't knock your socks off or anything, but okay.  Lately, I think they have reduced their portion size and raised their prices, although I can't confirm that it just seems that is what they are doing.  Which is fine, not trying to pig out or anything, but then again, most people like a great bargain (and perhaps some leftovers for street tacos in the morning - if you are like me anyway).  

I did want to add something.  I think I have talked about this before, but not sure.  Their cheese queso dip is the BEST IN THE VALLEY and you WILL NOT BEAT IT.  Recently, they started servicing sonoran hot dogs (awwww yeaaah, you know that's Attorney Steve's weak spot).  But anyhow, instead of ordering the hot dog their way, order it PLAIN with a bowl of the queso cheese sauce.  Then, when your dog comes, dip it into the cheese sauce with each bite.  If that is not the best thing you have ever had, respond to me on yelp telling me ATTORNEY STEVE YOU ARE A TOTAL MORON!!  I will deal with it if you do.  But yeah, that is DA BOMB sonoran dog.  

That being said, I always speak my mind.  The hot dog bun itself is a bit dry.  I really think they should serve those wrapped in aluminum to keep the bun soft and fresh. Also, ARE YOU KIDDING ME $9.99 FOR THE DOG ARE YTOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?  

Anyway, we always go back, but based on their pricing schemes we are not regulars.  Still a great place to drop in, but that's a once every other month deal for me.   Keep in mind, if you have business clients, it is still a good place to take them.  Easy parking, good service, etc.  

Have fun, and find your sizzle!
