for a airport restaurant it is pretty decent

we got three tacos per person, 

first off the service is friendly but forgetful, after waiting 20 min for our order, i had say wsup to the counter folks and they said they never received my order, slightly annoying, we had to another ten min to get our food

after specifically asking for NO CILANTRO(vile weed!), they loaded me up with cilantro, ewwww. i didnt realize this until i was at the terminal trying to scarf this all down before boarding. so that was not pleasant. on top of this, the tacos are tiny! they tasted decent but i could've ate 6 of those things and then maybe be full, i got the chicken and carne asada for those who would like to know
