My family and I have always love Ajo Al's on camelback they are great! Good food and good service. Recently we visited the arrowhead location and had to worst experience. Terrible service, terrible food and we waited forever for a bill. Definetly visit the camelback location and forget about the arrowhead location. Just my 2 cents!
