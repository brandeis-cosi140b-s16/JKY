Not wanting to drive all the way to Dick's for Sunday breakfast I decided to Yelp places close to my house I came upon El Mesquite, and decided to give it a try. It is located in a strip mall and I would have never heard of it if it wasn't for Yelp. I was pleasantly surprised by the food and the staff. As soon as I walked in I knew it was going to be good because the place was packed. I found the only table available and took a gander at the menu. The chips were crisp and the spicy salsa was delicious. I ordered a quesadilla and the steak ranchero. the steak was cooked in peppers and onions and came with a mildly spicy sauce. My meal was pretty delicious and so was the $3.25 Negro Modello. I looked around at the entrees that sat in from of the people around me and everything looked good and the portions were huge. The food overall was a little greasy, but it was definitely some home cooked mexican (which I could eat every day of my life). I'll have to keep this one on the radar for cheap and good south side fare.
