I love hole in the wall places - this one is definitely it!

I am very tempted to give it 2 stars - but because the food was very hot, fresh, and good, I had to go with the 3 stars.

We met after my grandson's baseball game for a quick lunch on a Saturday. This place is nothing to look at from the outside, looks like a Taco Hut right off the beaten path of Apache Junction. 

There are about 5 tables total and a little bit of standing room at the counter. The best part was that they spoke English!

We ordered our food and pulled some tables together since there was 7 of us. Here is where my problem started, BIG SIGN says "NOW WE HAVE AC!" Thank goodness I thought since it was 90 degrees outside!

NO AC working today - Yes there was a wall unit AC at both ends, but I think only one of them was working partly.  Just sitting there eating I was in a sweat! I can't do that, no matter how good the food is.

My advice - come and take your food home! Or better yet eat outside if it's cool enough.
