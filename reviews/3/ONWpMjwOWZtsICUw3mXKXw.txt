I like Chipotle. The food is always the same and sometimes just hits the spot. The 3 stars are for the food. 

The problem is the employees at this location. There was a young women starting the orders. She was very friendly to the party in front of me but walked away without offering me all the ingredients. Then the cashier, Deondra, was also very pleasant with the group ahead of me but obviously didn't want to deal with me. Then she put on a big smile for the lady behind me. I watched and saw this pattern continue as I ate and other customers came through. It appears as though white people aren't very welcome by the young black staff but black people get good service. It's sad really. I hate seeing young people behave this way.
