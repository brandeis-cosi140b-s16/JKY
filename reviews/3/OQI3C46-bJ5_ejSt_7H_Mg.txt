This place is poppin' during happy hour on weekdays and early evenings, until around 9:30ish.  Happy hour prices are good.  I've personally only taken advantage of the $2 street tacos and $5 rockaritas deal.  I like the carne asada and chicken street tacos.  The house margarita is pretty weak but tastes good.

I typically only go there to listen to the live DJ, and grab a drink or two.  They have a good variety of margaritas & cocktails.  The most recent cocktail I've tried is the Around the World Tour, which is composed of like 4-5 different flavors of Stoli, sweet & sour, and Sprite.  The bartender warned me that that was their strongest drink.  Of course that only made me want to try it even more!  And she was right.  I had to drive to Scottsdale to meet up with some friends after, so I only downed half of it.  It was good, fruity, but super strong.

My favorite drink there so far is the Devil With a Red Dress On.  Love the blood orange-acai flavor.

Overall, I think this is a good place to go when you have the munchies or just want to chill out with great music, good atmosphere, have a drink or take some shots!

I think adding happy hour over the weekend and reverse happy hour would definitely benefit this place.
