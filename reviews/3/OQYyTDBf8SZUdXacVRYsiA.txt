This was my third time here and for every time I would give this place 3-stars. They recently added a new family style menu with different price pp options. We decided to go with the $20 value pp which included:
2-guacamoles (to share)
2-salsas (unlimited)
2-sides (to share)
3- different types of tacos (each person gets three of the same kind)
For an additional $3pp you get one dessert each. Beware of the menu it's a bit confusing; there's a lot going on. Overall the food is always good, not amazing, but good. The dessert menu is horrible!!! Only three options and what's supposed to be there best, soaked bread topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, isn't even that good. Their "second best," chocolate cake, is horrendous! I don't even want to try the coconut flan. But as far as the tacos go, I've tried almost all of them and the best would have to be the Pancita. I feel like the menu and food need improvement. For "high end" Mexican food and what they charge you'd expect a lot more. We come here because our kids love playing in the arcade and Mercadito is one of the better options inside RR. On a brighter note, the staff is great and very friendly!
