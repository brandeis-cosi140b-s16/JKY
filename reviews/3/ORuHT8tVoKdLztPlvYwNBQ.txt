Love Moe's in general! Their food is always delicious! This particular location always gets my food correct and it always tastes great! The service isn't the best though. Most of the employees look as if it was a drag to come in to work and like its killing them to be there. I dont know if morale is down among the staff or what, but it definitely projects towards the customer. The poor morale is made up for by the cool coke machine and the cute outdoor seating area. Moe's in Dilworth is the closest to my job and is about 15 minutes away, but I make the trek a couple times a month for lunch. I can overlook bad vibes as long as they get my order correct and in a timely manner and I'm satisfied with my food at the end of the day.
