I really like the burritos at Chipotle. The barbacoa is an excellent combination of both tender and spicy. I like that I can order online and pick up my food at the register. I hate standing in line, and the line at Chipotle can get really long at peak times. The guacamole is also excellent, unless it's browning (more on that below). 

Lately, however, I've been annoyed with the service. I always order a burrito and chips with guacamole online, but when I pick it up at the register, they just hand me a burrito. I hate having to look through my bag and hand it back to them. Also, the guacamole I've been getting has turned brown! In my mind, that means it's not fresh. If I'm paying $3 for guacamole, I want to be able to eat it without scraping brown chunks out of it. For these two reasons, I'm giving Chipotle 3 stars.
