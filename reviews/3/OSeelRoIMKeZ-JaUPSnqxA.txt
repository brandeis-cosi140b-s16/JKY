Perfectly ample and fine Moes located at the Epicentre area.  For those that know the chain, know that the food is sub par and nothing really to write home about so what makes the difference is the people behind the counter of course.

This place has some friendly individuals working behind the counter the day I popped in but something a little unsettling was the lack of a manager I think.  I can tell it's a fun and lively workplace but there was a lot of horseplay going on in lieu of paying attention to me as the customer.  No biggie really, but for you that have ever walked into GameStop, it's that same feeling.  Like it's being run by 5, 17 year olds.  Hmmm....anyway, it's a good solid choice for food.  I particulary like the Joey Bag O Donuts.
