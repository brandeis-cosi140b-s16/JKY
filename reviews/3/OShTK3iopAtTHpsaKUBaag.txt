It's a Roberto's. I used to be in love with the food here. Over the years that has faded. I also think the overall quality of food has as well. There are several locations all over Vegas. I do think Roberto's is better than a lot of spots you can eat. But after trips to mexico and a few out of this world food truck street tacos robertos is just average. It is average that I like to eat from time to time if I am craving it. I like it, I used to love it. It's still good just not great in my books.
