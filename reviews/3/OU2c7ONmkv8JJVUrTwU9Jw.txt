I dislike it when people try to give these mediocre establishments a horrible rating for service or food quality..here's the bottom line you get what you pay for so people you are acting snobby when you're trying to give a review for this place. Basic Mexican food but I will tell something that stands out here..they offer desserts like tres leches and chocolate flan..amazing desserts so expect decent Mexican food. Great desserts bad service depending on whose working.

My go to items..
Bacon breakfast burrito
Carne asada nachos or plate
Chimichangas
Fish tacos 
Shrimp tacos
