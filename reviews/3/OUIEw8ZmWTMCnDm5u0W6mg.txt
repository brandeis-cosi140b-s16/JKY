Here is my average review, for an average restaurant. We've been here a few times now and I have ordered something different every time. This is due to not being able to find a dish that wows me. I'm not saying that Nacho Daddy is terrible and you should avoid them. I'm saying that they are decently priced and you get a good amount of food. 

On my most recent visit I did try the cheese steak sandwich and it was better than I expected. Next time however, I will not order the garlic parmesan fries. I like garlic but this was too much. 

This was also the first time we tried the guacamole and chips appetizer. Worth every penny. They give you plenty of guacamole and plenty of chips.
