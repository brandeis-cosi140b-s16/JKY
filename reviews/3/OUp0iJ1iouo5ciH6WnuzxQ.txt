Quick and easy review: 

Very clean place to eat. The price is quiet the catch too. And friendly staff. We usually come here just for a quick food and it never disappoint. The food is well okay, but it's ways better than MCdees. There's also seems to be more choices on the drink fountains. They also occasionally offer some kind of deals, free food and stuff. I will definitely keep coming back to this place especially for quick lunch/dinner.

A bit more detailed:

This place is a bit on a awkward position, tucked in on the corner of 51st ave. Upon entering the place it's obvious that the staff keeps the place Clean and dry. In my visits here, I have been greeted nicely and never been rushed not like when going to something like mcdonalds. They also have tons of fountain drink, they have mixed tea and a mango flavored drink! How awesome is that. Now with the food. I always liked their cantina and it has not disappointed me yet. The hard tacos are very good too. The only thing I can't seem to like here is the soft tacos. It's okay but not much. Promotions and deals are frequent check the mail or newspaper.

:) happy yelping!
