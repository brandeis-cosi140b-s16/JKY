The place is no frills.  The tortas are football sized, the fillings tasty but the bread just wasn't a torta.  Those who want street tacos will get them, but I can't say that they are better than Gallo's.  Over all, good for a quick meal, but I wouldn't say its a huge destination place.  Hard to find seating, definately a  to-go place.  Trendy and super cute.  Good service.  Limited menu.  It is nice that they have a little salsa bar with fresh salsas and crema that you can try out for yourself.
