$7.95 lunch buffet! I got here at 11:30, right as the buffet was supposed to start, but I was disappointed to see that the only trays that were set up were the beans and rice. They did have the tortilla chip and salsa bar available though, so I munched on chips and salsa while they got the rest of the trays ready.

The spread was pretty nice, once it was all set up. My favorite was the smothered chicken burrito. Other options were various chimichangas, hard shell tacos, and enchiladas. My least favorite of all the buffet items were the cheese enchiladas. It didn't have much flavor aside from the brick of cheese inside the rolled corn tortilla.

Overall, an inexpensive and gut-busting way to spend your lunch!
