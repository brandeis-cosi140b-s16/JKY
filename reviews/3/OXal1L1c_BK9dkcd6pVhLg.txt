I'll second the thought that the decor isn't much, because it isn't.  But I'm not sure about the idea that they don't speak much English.  While this isn't a Taco Bell, and definitely is place more off-the-beaten path than your average Americanized Mexican eatery, they speak better English than a lot of places you might find.

Interesting because of their locale - in this section of Central, you're just as likely (if not more so) to find a place that doesn't speak any English at all - for instance, the Casa de las Enchiladas right down the block.

In any case, the food is decent, but I didn't find it all that great.  If you're at the Central Avenue location, I'd go the extra half a block and go to Casa de las Enchiladas - though you might want to brush up on your Spanish first.
