Grabbed some nachos before the trip home.  They were good not great not really even good but it was food in an airport so there! Waitress was super nice and efficient.  My husband broke a bottle of hot sauce and she didn't even care. Ha.  Place is crowded because people really don't want to sit at the gate.
