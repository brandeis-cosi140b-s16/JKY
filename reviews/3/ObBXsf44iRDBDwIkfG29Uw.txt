For the food I ate I have to disagree with the previous reviewer about Santa Rosa Taco Shop being better than Roberto's.  I ordered a large salsa, a beef tostada, and a tamale.  The salsa was rather bland.  I would not pay $3 for a large again.  If I am inclined to make salsa I think mine is better.  The beef tostada was good and inexpensive but if there was a Roberto's around I would rather go there.  The beef used in the tostada is better at Roberto's.  Finally, the tamale was fine but the favor of the filling was lost.  Maybe due to the red sauce.  My meal was $8 and though not outrageous I think I would have a better and cheaper meal from Roberto's.
