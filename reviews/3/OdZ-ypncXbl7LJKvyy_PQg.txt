I cracked up at all of the bad reviews this place has, lol.

My experiences here haven't been terrible but they definitely could use some improvement. My biggest gripe is with the service. There is NEVER  a host or hostess standing at the front and we ALWAYS have to go looking for one to be assisted. The employees standing at the bar will even see you looking for someone and still won't greet you or come over to you. I guess they have adopted the "that's not my job" mindset. This is so odd to me.

The actual wait staff is decent here, and are always prompt with refilling drinks and honoring whatever requests you may have. They do take forever drop off and collect your tab, which is my biggest pet-peeve at restaurants because when I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go. 

The setup of the place is really roomy and is arranged well. The booths are comfortable and the tables and chairs are always clean. They have these pretty cool decorative fans on the ceiling, and--much to my disdain--they have Motley Crue videos playing on every TV screen in the joint. Shoot me, now. 

The food is pretty average here. I've had the carne asada wet burrito, chicken enchiladas, beef & chicken taquitos, beef & fish tacos, chicken tortilla soup, and chips & salsa. They all hit the spot and left me satisfied, so no complaints about the food. I am not picky when it comes to Mexican food but apparently, other reviewers are. lol.

The prices are "meh". For what you're getting, everything should be under $10 but you're looking at more of the $11-$20 range, which kind of irritates me everytime and makes me reluctant to even order. But it's Las Vegas and everything seems to be more costly here everywhere you go. 

Vince Neil's Tatuado Cantina is pretty good though, overall. Anytime I'm inside or near LVH, I'd hit this place up for some decent Mexican.
