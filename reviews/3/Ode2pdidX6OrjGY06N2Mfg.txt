With an ambiance on par with un Hardee's or--if I'm feeling generous--un Country Kitchen El Pescador doesn't start off with a bang.  Since this was a late dinner, there was no wait and my two co-workers and I were seated quickly.

After the slightly dimmer of my two co-workers finished a painfully convoluted drink order, I indulged in an orange colored, allegedly lime-flavored margarita on the rocks.  The taste wasn't exceptional but wasn't entirely lost either.

Upon receiving our drinks, I immediately ordered the chimichangas; an order which was immediately plagiarized by my two co-workers.  Before any of us had finished our first drink, the food was on the table.  Two long and slender chimichangas were topped with the usual lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and guacamole fiasco, flanked with your standby bean accompaniment.  Ever-demanding, my co-workers requested a side of guacamole and a side of sour cream and promptly received each.  The chimi's themselves were excellent.  Deep fried as per standard preparation and served in a red sauce, the chimichangas were by far the best part of the dinner.  The beef chimi was significantly better than the chicken but neither disappointed.  The guacamole was almost pure avocado and delicious as well.

The quality of the food made up for the non-existent ambiance, indifferent service, and my dreadful dinner company.  Though it won't be my top priority, I'd likely return to "go fish" at El Pescador.
