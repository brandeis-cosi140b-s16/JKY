Before I begin, let me explain: 3 stars is a good rating! Sure, 4 is better and 5 is the best, but 3 for C4 is equally impressive. Allow me to elaborate. After a brief stop at Red Hot Robot to check out the toy art selection, my friend and I ventured to C4 to grab a drink and bite to eat. Immediately when we walked in and were shown to our table, we noticed an array of toy art on the restaurant side. This place also supports local art. Awesome. The other side, where the bar is, is very chill and inviting, with plush seating if you'd rather avoid sitting at the bar. 

But, my friend and I wanted something to munch on. I ordered a Sapporo, the miso soup and their signature C4 roll. The beer hit the spot. The miso me so didn't like. I picked out the tofu and avoided the tomatoe-y based broth. The c4 roll was anything but hot. I expected hot since it came with haberno salsa. Wrong. It was bland with entirely too much cream cheese in the middle. I ate it anyway, trying to gather an affinity for cream cheese. It didn't work. Yet, I give kudos to C4 for offering four sushi rolls on a reasonably priced menu. Next time I'll have to try one of their sandwiches. 

Service was okay. The waitress was attentive and didn't mind my friend and I hanging out to talk the night away. I guess I subtract a star for service, since it took a good 10 minutes between the time we ordered our drinks and when they arrived at our table. Something to mention: the bartender was friendly and made sure to notice us upon entry and exit. "Enjoy your night. Come back and see us!" Yes, those are the words i like to hear. 

Like I said, 3 stars isn't a bad rating. Sure, you may think it's average, but this place is above average. I just felt like something was missing. Perhaps it was the vibe, the personality, the chill factor. I dunno. I'll probably drop back by, though, esp since it's like a hop, skip and jump from where I live.
