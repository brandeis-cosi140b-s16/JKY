I've been here a few times and the food has been great. The staff are usually nice and the line is as slow as every other chipotle so it's probably not avoidable.

The only thing that's gone wrong for me so far is ordering online but it was awful. I wanted to get my husband lunch before class and so I ordered online. Website informed me that my food would be ready for pick up in 30 minutes which was acceptable.

My husband stopped by to pick up everything after 45 minutes and they hadn't even started the order. The girl at the counter got a little defensive and so the interaction got combative and snowballed into a really negative experience. 

If you can't handle online ordering that's perfectly understandable but accepting and ignoring orders is just going to continue to lead to negativity and dissatisfaction. It would help to receive an apology instead of defensive excuses. 

Stuff goes wrong just apologize and fix it and people will chill.
