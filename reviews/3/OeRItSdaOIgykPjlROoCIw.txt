We had a sampling of appetizers including taquitos, skewers, and chips & salsa. 
I had the chopped salad which was chock full of turkey and was pretty tasty!
The shrimp tacos were the best of the lot we had. Beef tacos were OK but I didn't love the fruit pieces (pineapple?) on them. Their salsas are pretty good too. I stayed away from getting any drinks cause they have a "revolving" happy hour policy which is a crock so better to just boycott it completely. I like my method of going to the poker bar near Pink Taco and getting a martini to enjoy with my meal and this time I got lucky and didn't lose money! 
Innovation, my middle name.
