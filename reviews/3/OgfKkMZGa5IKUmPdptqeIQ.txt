I ate here for the first time today, I really like Mexican food so I was looking for something good. Well I've had better, I got chicken tacos, black beans and Mexican rice.  The rice was so hard it's like it was Mexican fried rice....wow.  Any who the tacos were ok, some of the chicken pieces were a little hard but other than that they were ok. The beans were ok nothing to exciting, the place looked better than the food taste. Not sure if I'll go back, the lunch menu is very limited. Oh well.............
