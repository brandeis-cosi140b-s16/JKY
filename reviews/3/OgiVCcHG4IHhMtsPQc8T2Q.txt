This is another place that came from Iowa City that I ate at all the freakin' time in college. This place is like Chipotle but I think this has better ingredients: tastier meat, fresh pressed tortillas, creamier cheese, and a quesadilla option.

However, I don't think they captured the magic of the Iowa City versions. I think the owner needs to come and figure out what's going on. I still would rather go here for a burrito than Chipotle.
