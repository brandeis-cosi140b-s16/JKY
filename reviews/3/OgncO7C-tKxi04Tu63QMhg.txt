I went to Moe's for the first time last week - in the middle of the lunch rush.  The service was quick and we scored a table outside.  

I got the taco combo with chips and queso.  The tacos were so stuffed, I could hardly eat them!  Great food but a bit messy. 

There are tons of food options and rumor has it they have a decent happy hour.
