Went to lunch here with some coworkers. The design of the place is a little awkward to me and the music was loud. The line got very long, which is expected around noon on a weekday. I got a bowl with rice, black beans, barbacoa, cheese, and sour cream on the side. Chipotle has its own outdoor patio seating, but we sat at this long table in the communal area shared with a few other restaurants. The area was shaded, which I appreciated. As for my food, they filled that bowl up! And it tasted just as it should.
