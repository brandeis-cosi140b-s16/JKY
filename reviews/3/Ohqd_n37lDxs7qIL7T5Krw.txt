I've been here a couple of times and some old friends love this place and have them cater their parties all the time. I've had tacos and enchiladas, but the Pollo Rico (crispy chicken burro with jalapeno cream cheese and cheddar cheese) is by far my favorite. 

The food here tastes lighter than most Mexican food places.
