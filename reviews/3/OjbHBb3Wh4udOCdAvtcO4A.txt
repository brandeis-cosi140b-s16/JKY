Come here often and every time I wish I hadn't. The best time to go is right at opening 11 am. For some reason everytime we go we get the same RUDE waiter "Jesse" who is ALWAYS in some kind of rush and spills when he is refilling drinks and never let's us finish a sentence before rushing off. The salsa is always great and consistent but the food is mediocre. I need to keep that in mind before we go back.
