I ordered the taco/enchilada combo. The rice, beans and taco was great (the taco shell seemed really fresh!), but the enchilada (my favorite Mexican staple) was drowning in sauce and cheese, and the sauce was extremely bland so it wasn't even enjoyable.

The portions were huge and the price was great. I'll go back, but not for an enchilada.
