After hearing about the deliciousness of Del Taco for some many years from my friends, I finally tried it since I now live out west..... Whelp, it wasn't as epic as I hyped it up to be in my head *Deep sigh!* 

It was just typical tacos from a fast food chain. Don't get me wrong it was decent, but really just a middle of the road taco. That is what I get for over hyping something I've never had  and need to keep my fast food expectations low! Hahahaha.
