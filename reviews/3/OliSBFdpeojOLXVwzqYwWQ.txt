I heard that "The Earth without Art is just Eh."
Well there is no art in this cooking but it is cheap and a "real" neighborhood experience. I eat here every once in a while and though I wouldn't recommend it to people, I would bring them there with me.

These people have been here forever and when they run out of something they simply tell you "nope". When they run out of lot of things... they close.

I hope they are here forever and ever.
