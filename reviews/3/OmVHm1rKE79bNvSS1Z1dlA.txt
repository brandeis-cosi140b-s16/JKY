I had high hopes for Gran Agave due to all of the 4 and 5 star reviews. JB and I went for lunch this weekend, there were no booths available so we were seated at a table which had what has to be considered the most uncomfortable chairs ever. No cushion, just wicker. But we weren't there for comfort, we were there for the food so let me move on. 

The complimentary chips and salsa were good, chips were warm and not greasy. For my entree I ordered the vegetarian sopes, I got 3 of them and a bowl of rice. The rice was teetering on the dry side, but it was edible and the sopes were a bit bland but nothing some salt and hot sauce couldn't fix. JB opted for a beef burrito which he liked but wasn't blown away by. 

The service was slow, maybe better categorized as neglectful, our waiter walked by several times without taking our order even though our menus were on the table signifying that we were ready to order. When he finally came, he skipped us and went to the adjacent table instead. No smiles, no "thank you for coming", the waiters were just turning tables. 

Despite uncomfortable seating and lackluster service, we'll most likely give Gran Agave another try.
