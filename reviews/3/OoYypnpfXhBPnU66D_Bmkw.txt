Filibertos has mediocre food. This quality is to be excpected for a fast food. The prices are higher, but they do have a daily value item for $1.29 which is a nice option. The salsa bar is an added benefit and staff, although hard to understand at times, are very nice. I recommend the super nachos or the chicken taco.
