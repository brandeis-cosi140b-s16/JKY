Food was excellent! I would definitely recommend the Cochinitas Pibil, the Suardo Azteca, and Carne Asada Steak Huitalocoche y Champinion wre all very amazing tacos. Typically the deal is choose 3 tacos for $10; however since happy hour started at 2pm today, the happy hour deal included 2 for 1 pork tacos so I had 4 tacos today but they were mini sized. 

House margaritas were included in the happy hour specials so my friend and I enjoyed our margaritas with are street tacos galore. 

We also ordered tableside guacamole, which had a unique blend of jalenpenos, citrus, cilantro, lime, pomegranite, fig, and cotija cheese. However, this guacamole came out prepared and not made table side. We were confused by this since we saw a table close to us have their same table side guac actually made table side. We were disappointed by this.

Although our waitress was so friendly, we seldom saw her except when we first ordered and long after we had finished eating. I get that we were being lazy on a Friday enjoying margaritas and eating, but it would've been nice to see her a little more so we could at least get water refills. I had to ask one of the guys busing tables to get us water, but he only got one water for me and not for my friend. I just expected more for service when being on this side of town. 

On a plus side, the small but delicious churro dessert was excellent as recommended. Only 2 churros on an appetizer sized plate with 1 half cut strawberry drizzled with a sweet sauce come with this dessert, but it was a way to get a sweet tooth fix without being overly indulgent. 

My hubby and I got much better service with amazing food at their heart location Barrio Cafe, so I will most likely return there instead of here next time.
