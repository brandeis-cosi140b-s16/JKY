Food was your a little above average, my wife and I enjoyed our dinner.  The location is very cool, great for a quick meal before heading downtown.  The setting is great!  Very roomy and cozy!  I am not sure what is up with the Mexican wrestling masks on the wall.  LoL, the place is big enough to put a ring in the center and have some authentic Mexican WWF wrestling!!!!  Booya, bring it!
