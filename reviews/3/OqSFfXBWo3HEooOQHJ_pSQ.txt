Even though I live relatively close to this Taco Bell, I rarely come here.  Had a couple of meals here recently and got my fav's...

7 Layer Burrito, $2.29
2 Bean Burritos, $1.98

The restaurant is kept clean and unless it's the lunch rush, it's always fast.  Nice cheap option when you're hungry and on the run.
