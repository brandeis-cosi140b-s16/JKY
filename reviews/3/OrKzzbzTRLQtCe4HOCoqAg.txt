I could give it 3.5 stars, but couldn't do 4 stars.  This location has always been clean when I have eaten there, but I normally get a burrito to go. I do find their chicken burrito with queso sauce very tasty, but I think the price is a little high (very similar to qdoba and chipotle). Also, extras (queso,  guacamole, etc) are costly. But I have to say, when they make your tortilla in front of you and when they mix up your ingredients after they make your burrito, that sets them apart from their competitors.
