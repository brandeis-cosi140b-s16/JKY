I rarely do fast food, but every now and then, I find it convenient, cheap, and oh so appealing, especially when fast food drive-thru windows exist!

So, on a recent Sunday, upon realizing that I had two hungry kids in the car and nothing too appealing at the house to eat, I made my way toward El Pollo Loco, entered the drive-thru, and within 10 minutes, was headed home with a feast for all!

I ordered a salad for myself, some chicken nuggets and sides of mac and cheese, corn, broccoli, and french fries for the kids.  However, I arrived home to find that they forgot to include the broccoli.  Bummer.

I liked my salad and the kids liked the nuggets and fries.  The other stuff, not so much, but there's always something that doesn't get eaten at my house with 2 little ones that are hit and miss picky eaters.  

I noticed El Pollo Loco offers some family style meals and everything is moderately priced, so I may just return again soon to try more from the menu.
