I decided to try this place based on the 4.5 star rating it had on Yelp.  After eating here I don't agree with the general consensus. I'd give it 2.5 stars if possible. 

Food:
Shredded beef tacos - good but not great. 
Menudo soup - bland broth, small amount of meat, and massive amount of barley corn.  It includes a side of lemon, cilantro, and chives, but this didn't really add enough taste to the soup.  I've had cow stomach before (in Mexico and in Taiwan) and it was much spicier and flavorful. 

Drink:
There was a 99 cent special on margaritas so no complaints here. 

Service: 
Average. 

Atmosphere:
The restaurant is in a small strip mall. It's pretty sketchy. There was a cop on duty in the waiting area. Other businesses in the strip mall include a pawn shop and a liquor store. 

The menu also includes a note that the restaurant isn't responsible for lost or stolen items. 

Pretty certain I won't be back here.
