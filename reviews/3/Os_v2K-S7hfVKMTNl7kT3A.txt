First of all, I have to say I didn't even realize there was a Mad Mex location in the South Hills! The location is a little hidden at the end of a shopping center off the main road. But I'm very happy this is here! I foresee myself meeting for margaritas in the future since it's so close to home!

My friend and I came here for our annual Gobblerito Friendsgiving meal. The Gobblirito was good as it is every year. I wish there had been a extra side of gravy or something since it did get a little dry. I'm not sure if it's a new thing this year or just something they do at this location, but there were black beans mixed in with the mashed potatoes, which I thought was a little weird.

I also got a strawberry margarita. I asked for it frozen, but the waitress said their "frozen thingy was down" so that was a little disappointing, but it was still good on the rocks. 

Service was okay. Our waitress took awhile to get to our table but our food came out fast. I'd like to come back tho this location again to see how the normal menu items are.
