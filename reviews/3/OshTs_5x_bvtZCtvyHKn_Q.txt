It was good. 

Customer service was excellent, wait staff was on point and did not complain after several items were taken back to kitchen at my comrade's request and brought back out. Food didn't look messed with in anyway. lol

They have cactus/napoles!  I've never tried this, and didn't want a full portion size meal (since I ate before I came out with my friends); they were very accommodating. I was able to order a side of cactus, they brought it out in a fairly full salad with red onions, cilantro and tomatoes. Cooked cactus tastes similar to cooked green beans. One of my friends didn't want her sides of rice and beans so I munched on that as well.  I took my leftovers for dinner today at work.

Great outdoor seating area!
