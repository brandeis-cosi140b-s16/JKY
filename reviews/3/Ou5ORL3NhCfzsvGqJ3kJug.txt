Went with the entertainment coupon- buy one dinner, get one free.  It took $8 off our bill.  We ordered the guacamole appetizer.  The guacamole was very good but you get a very small portion size for $4 and I wouldn't order it again.

My husband and son had the Chili Colorado since it was gluten free.  The liked it and my son even said the beans weren't bad.  He is not a fan of bean. 

My one daughter who never gets excited about food raved about the chicken taco.

I really enjoyed the cheese enchilada and the beans.  I didn't finish the chili relleno,  it was very blah... to egg tasting.

We won't go back only because it is way to far from home for us.
