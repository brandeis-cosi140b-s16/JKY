This restaurant is in the location of the old Loco Lime.  We decided to give it a try on a Friday night.  The staff couldn't have been any nicer or more welcoming.  In fact, they were nearly tripping all over each other to serve us.  Two women attempted to take our drink and dinner order.  A nice man  came by to ask if everything was good.  We also liked that the restaurant was playing authentic Mexican music in the background.  It doesn't have the same effect when an ethnic establishment plays American pop music.  
Tortilla chips and salsa was brought to our table.  We were given two salsas, one which was described as mild and the other labeled hot.  I immediately went fir the hot one and found it to be mildly spicy.  The mild salsa tasted like canned tomato sauce,
We both ordered the number two vegetarian.  It came with a bean burrito, chalupa and quesadilla.  The quesadilla was like the best Mexican grilled cheese ever, and I appreciated the crunch and flavor of the chalupa.  The burrito left me flat.  The sauce tasted like an Italian topping, and the cheese was minimal.
The prices were great,  it was nice to get two meals and two drinks for under $30.00.  And I definitely will return for more chalupas and quesadillas!
