I like this place.  It has so much potential.  The concept is 1/2 Fast Food & 1/2 Full Service Restaurant.....it's a 'Tweener'!  Let me explain......

Fast Food Elements
+ You order at a counter, menu on boards against the wall.

+ They call for your number & you pick up your food at the counter....food is served on plastic plates & trays, like many fast food restaurants.

+ Food comes out relatively fast.

+ Self Serve Salsa Bar

Full Service Restaurant Elements
+There's bar seating w/Alcohol service.

+ Food quality is a notch above Fast Food.

+ Food prices are nearly the same as full service restaurants.

+ Complimentary Chips & Salsa.

The food is pretty good....not great.  I enjoy coming here to grab a quick bite.  The other big bonus for me is that they have Arizona Gunslinger Hot Sauce available here....

This Hot Sauce packs a nice punch and I pour it generously on my food....yum!

Overall, it's not a bad joint......way better than Taco Bell, just under Full Service joints.
