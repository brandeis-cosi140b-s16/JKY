The food is great but how come you don't fill my bowl.  In fact, at my most recent visit, I asked for them to fill my bowl.  The response wasn't a polite and curteous one, it was an informative and rude to me as a customer.  They did proceed to fill my bowl but the proportions were way off.  The guy behind the counter said that I received the correct amount but my buddy got a different amount than me, so which is right?

When it comes down to this place, I love the food but I need a full bowl.  I ordered a burrito bowl, not a burrito half bowl.
