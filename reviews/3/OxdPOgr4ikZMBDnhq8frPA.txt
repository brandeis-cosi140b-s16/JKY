My family and I came to Scottsdale for vacation and went to the Tortilla factory for our first  meal. I'll start by saying that my 19 year old daughter liked her enchiladas. We also chose to pay the $6 for chips and salsa ($6! Really?). The salsa was really good. As other reviews have said, they serve you tortillas with a yummy butter of some sort. I'd rather have chips and salsa. My husband and I both got the Old town taco plate with all three, steak, chicken and shrimp. I liked the shrimp, the steak was just OK and the chicken was dry. Our waiter was very nice and the patio was beautiful but that's the most I thought it had going for it.
