I first went here about a year ago and had a very unimpressive enchilada - the experience was enough to keep me away until yesterday. Having gotten tired of the tacos at nearby Chipotle, I decided to give Veracruz another chance. I got chicken tacos which were made quickly and came in double corn tortillas with a small bag of delicious tortilla chips. Certainly not the best tacos in town, but passable! I will probably be back for more on a semi regular basis.
