Came here for lunch today and to be honest I really wasn't impressed! They were super busy which yes it was lunch hour however I think the service could've been better! They were clearly short staffed as the manager actually had to open up on a register to help with taking orders! I know a good quality bowl when I taste one so me wasting my $9.99 on the "double shrimp" bowl will never in my life happen again! I got the bowl and to my pleasant surprise it wasn't anything special! I thought to myself what did I seriously just order! There were about 6-7 shrimp in this huge bowl and they were the tiny ones! I'd hate to see what the normal bowl with shoring looks like as mine being the double was lacking seriously! On top of them being stingy on the shrimp the rice seemed dry and unseasoned! Most definitely not worth the price! I'll never return!
