Ochoa's is a Casa Grande standard that's well-known to locals and impossible to find to out-of-towners. It's not really near any other restaurant clusters in town such as you find on Florence or Pinal.

The food is good, the service is adequate, and it's not that much more expensive than fast food. The refried beans are excellent (people come by and order them to-go) and the family that runs the place is known for their tamales.

One thing I've always noticed here is that, like pretty much everything else in Arizona, the temperature is always about 10 degrees warmer than I'd prefer, being a Michigan boy. 

If you want some good food cheap, and don't mind eating in a balmy 80 degree dining room, check it out.
