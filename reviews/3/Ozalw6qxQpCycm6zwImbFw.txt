Usually, it is on the spot.  We are regulars and tonight we just did not have a good experience.  

My wife went through drive thru and there was quite a line.  No big deal.  Good things for those who wait.

The problem was the food.  We both ordered Carne Asada Burritos and the tortillas were very tough on both.  The meat was very salty.  Just not good.

We expect more out of you, Federico's.
