I don't know how people can order carne asada every time.  it's overcooked low quality beef and they don't season it at all.  Maybe they just don't know any better.  my recommendation is the breakfast burrito with chorizo or sausage and a pina or pineapple jarritos.  Goes perfect.  Don't forget the salsa and lime bar.  Just a note, the smaller container of salsa is the HOT or pipe cleaning salsa, which I prefer.  Good ole robertos.  Probably healthier than taco bell.  The cleanest, best, most amazing tacos are waiting for you on tropicana at taco tijuana.

Usually tho, in a joint like this, simpler is better.  For example, bean and cheese, bean and rice, bean and egg, bean and... whatever you can think of.  Don't forget the salsa and lime... and jalapeno if you're man enough.
