So tried to do something nice and I'm not sure it got done. Went to Cafe Rio, on Blue Diamond for lunch on 07/18/2014 at 1145am.  While in line, I noticed two soldiers in uniform walk in. They looked young and I wanted to say thank you for your service. They were two people behind me. When I got to the register, I asked if I could pay some extra on my bill to be used toward their bill. This is when it got weird. I got nothing but attitude, a roll of the eyes and a huge sigh. So, because I was paying with my ATM card, I asked if it would be easier if I put cash down to use for them. That was accepted with a little frustration. I went to sit down and watch to see if the money I left was used as I intended. I honestly couldn't tell. I am blown away. I tried to do something nice and help out with what I could and I feel as if it was only an exercise in futility. I am upset that the staff at Cafe Rio was not a little more accepting of my gesture.

To top it off, my four year old spilled her drink, which I wore.  My friend went to ask for help and alert them of the dangerous wet spill on the floor.  They acted as if it was some sort of intrusion and huge inconvenience, (excuse me but I AM the one wearing Orchata).  Then when someone came over, she used napkins to clean up (which left everything still sticky) and ignored me completely as I apologized and attempted to assist in cleaning up. (it was my kid that did it after all)  

In conclusion the food is great but the staff is disgruntled at best.  Not an ounce of friendliness among anyone working the front line.  The cashier blew me away with her attitude.  it will be a while before i go back and I will not go during the lunch hour ever again.
