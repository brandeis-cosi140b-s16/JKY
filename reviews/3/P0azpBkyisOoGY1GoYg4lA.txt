This was my second time at this location, for the most part I like it.  Almost killed myself on the tile floor with the film of grease, but some of the best places I have dined at we're grease joints.  Ordered the frozen strawberry margarita, nice size, but had to order another shot for it.  Dinner was good, portions were huge but presentation weak.  Server was friendly and quick.  Will visit there again
