Went here this evening with my family and was pretty typical Mexican fare. Had the chimichangas along with Mexican Rice. Very quick and friendly service. Pretty extensive menu overall with mauve a few too many items. Has pretty decent seating with booths and tables. Overall pretty solid for Mexican food in Sun Prairie.
