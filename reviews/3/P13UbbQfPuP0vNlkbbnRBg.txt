This is simple the food is awesome. The service is kinds lousy and for that -2. Every time I go I see my self getting almost the same thing(carne asada burrito add cheese) unless hungover I get menudo.(very seldom) but every time they forget that cheese I am all like I paid for it, so I want it. The food is awesome. :)
