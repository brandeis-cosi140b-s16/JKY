Some times this place is a step above Filibertos and some days it is a small step below. Essentially the same menu. We used to LOVE their tacos (I would get chicken and my husband beef), but they are too inconsistent, so I think we kind of gave up on them after a few not so great times in a row. 

They are the closest cheap Mexican takeout for us, so we end up grabbing something every other or every third week, but not something to go out of the way for.
