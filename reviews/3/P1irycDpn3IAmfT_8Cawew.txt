the service sucked....
being young i feel that some waitress don't expect tips from a young group of people but we all work in a service field and know what its like. it took over 30 mins just to order had enchilada nachos they were ok but the filet migon nachos were fantastic and i would recommend i would go here again but definitely a different location.
