Any place that has a huge sign that announces "no split checks" gets under my skin before I even sit down. This restaurant is walking distance from Downtown Phoenix, which means a large lunch crowd. If most are like me, I go to lunch with a group and I never have cash. Restaurants that are not willing to split checks usually move to my 'do  not visit again' list. The food is average, I have definitely had better in the area. However the lunch specials are very affordable and for the price, the food is not that bad. The staff was friendly and we received our food fairly quickly. The part that takes longest is paying the bill. Not only will they not split the check, they have one cashier that we all must walk up to and pay. If my arm is twisted, I may return but definitely will not be disappointed if I forget about this lunch spot.
