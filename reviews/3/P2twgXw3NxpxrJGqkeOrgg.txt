I had a perfectly nice evening.  I'm not a big fan of the Fox restaurants and it is getting to the point that you can't eat out in Phoenix without eating at one of Sam Fox's restaurants.  

We have been in several times because it's casual, close to home and the bar staff is friendly.  I'm a fan of the Shrimp Salad and my partner usually goes for the fish tacos.  The food is good.  We keep coming back because the wait staff is friendly.

So why only three stars.  On our last visit there was weird burnt stuff in my salad that turned out to be charcoal.  The staff was accommodating about the situation, took the food back, and bought us a round of drinks, but yeeech...Anyway, it's a good casual place for dinner.
