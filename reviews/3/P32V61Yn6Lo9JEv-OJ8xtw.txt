Had a Groupon to here, went on Friday night with wife and kids. Walked in and sat ourselves in restaurant area. Ordered some Margaritas for the wife and myself. Frozen Raz for her and On the rocks for me. Those both came out good. (though i had to pour my shot in myself which i thought was weird)

For Food she wanted to order 3 different Tamales, which led to a bit of disappointment as the server said the only ones they had tonight were shredded beef. She got 3 of those then. I ordered the Tacos Tijuana off the specialty plate. Taste wise both were good, though both of us liked mine better. For the kids we ordered one grilled cheese, which was pretty sad actually for $5.99. Decent size, just cheese was barely melted and hardly toasted for the bread. (though i dunno how much i can fault a Mexican place for a poor grilled cheese). 

The kids menu also came with an ice cream, which server was nice enough to bring out one for each kid even though we only ordered one. That upped her tip a bit for sure. 

All in all this place would have gotten a solid four stars for taste and service, but had to deduct one for only one choice of Tamale.
