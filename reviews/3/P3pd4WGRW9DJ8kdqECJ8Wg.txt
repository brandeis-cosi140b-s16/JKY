A little greasy for my liking.  And on the pricey side compared to similiar buys in Phoenix. But as far as late night grub (3:30 a.m.) it was decent.

The staff was great, even though I couldn't understand a word they said (a mixture of the alcohol in my system, and the Spanglish that was spoken) and the salsa bar was great.  Couple of sauces in there blow my mind with how fresh and tasty they were.

I'm glad I have an iron stomach. This was one of those "I might have made a bad decision" nights, but thankfully wasn't the case.
