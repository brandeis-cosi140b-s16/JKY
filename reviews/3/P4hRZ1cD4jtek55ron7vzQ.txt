A great late night spot when you're looking to stay out of Old Town, but not a place that I would make it a point to dine at otherwise.  For several years, "The Bat Cave" has been our late night stops after concerts, shows, etc. as they have a slightly abbreviated menu, but still offer many of their New Mexican dishes and drinks at a reasonable price.  The crab cakes are a great appetizer and are served on a bed of fresh greens with a very spicy habanero aioli.  My favorite entree is the green chile carne adovada burrito, of which I've also had a vegetarian version.  The carne adovada plate is good too since the meat is typically quite spicy, however, on occasion it can have some dry, leathery chunks of meat that seem like they've been severely overcooked.  In fact, there were a few times that I probably looked like a member of the Griswold family as they were trying to gnaw on the overcooked turkey at Christmas dinner (come on, everyone knows that scene!).  The enchiladas (one chicken, one shrimp) are so-so as there really isn't much spice involved and they tend to be oily and heaped with cheese.

The food always comes out quickly, but the service in general is slow as we normally have to flag down a server passing by to get another round of drinks and the bartenders seem to be moving in slow motion when making a drink or opening a bottle of beer.  The atmosphere is unique (I said unique, not upscale or even overly clean) and the outdoor patio offers a nice waterfall for scenery.  They do at least make an attempt to segregate smokers onto one side of the divided patio so there is some chance that people can enjoy the patio without shortening their lifespan, but wind direction plays a critical role here.  If you set your expectations correctly, this place has some redeeming qualities and is worth stopping in to at least try it out.
