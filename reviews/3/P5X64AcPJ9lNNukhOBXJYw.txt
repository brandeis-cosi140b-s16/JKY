This is a pretty good little Mexican food place. I've eaten here twice now.
  The first time I ordered a carne asada burrito. The meat was tender and flavorful, but seemed over salted. There was a LOT of it. Which is great since most places want to stuff t me burrito full of other ingredients and skimp on the meat. 
   The second time I had a carnitas plate. The pork carnita was a tad dry, but full of flavor. The refried beans were over salted and the guacamole was a bit thin for my taste.
   The prices are right on! 
   If they can stop over-salting the food, I'll give this place 4 stars. Until then, it's a solid 3 for me.
