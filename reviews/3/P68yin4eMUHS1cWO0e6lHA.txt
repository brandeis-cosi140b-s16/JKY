Zapata's definitely has an accurate 3 star rating on Yelp.  It is far from authentic Mexican food, but it is inexpensive and ok.  

The "World's Best Taco's" had little flavor and the steak was very tough.  Honestly, I would eat a Taco Bell taco over these.  Most of their other dishes, however, are better.  The enchiladas are very good.  The service is always quick and friendly.

Zapata's is not a bad option for an inexpensive meal out but it is far from the best Mexican in the area.
