Not bad for Mexican fast food. The burrito with "everything" in it (and the kitchen sink) are decent. My only gripe was the long wait when we went through the drive-through. We only had one car in front of us and waited forever for our turn, then when we ordered (3 burritos), we were asked to pull over to a parking space and waited forever again!
