The food is amazing here and they never mess my order up. I always get extra cheese and little odd things like that. After about 6pm and later the drive thru line is so long. It takes anywhere from 10-30 minutes to get your food. For that reason I am giving them three stars. They need to pick it up in the drive thru. The staff is very friendly although they stand at the window leaning on the counter waiting for the food to hand us. Speed it up and it's 4 maybe 5 stars!
