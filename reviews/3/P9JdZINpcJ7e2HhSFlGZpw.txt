So I have lived in San Diego for 15 of the lat 17 years.  Therefore I have experienced excellent Mexican food on every corner.  Tried El Sombrero for the first time and It was  good for non-border mexican food.   For some reason I love the sign telling taxi cabs where to drop off passengers. I just can't see someone taking a cab there.  It just isn't that good.

What is good?  The service is great!  The chips and salsa are plentiful and not stale.  One salsa is spicy and the other on the sweet side.

The Camerones had good flavor but way too much sauce.  The shrimp were fresh and large but slightly tough.

My biggest complaints are the flour tortillas which were stale and possibly even packaged.  Also the rice and beans were bland.

We had a good meal but it didn't knock my socks off.
