The wife and I and my sister and her boyfriend had dinner here 9/11/15.
We started with drinks-Texas size margaritas for them, a peach margarita for the wife and I tried the homemade sangria. All drinks were good and the sangria was not to sweet as some can be.
For dinner my wife  ordered a veggie quesadilla and the rest of us got Tacos De Brisket which was shredded beef brisket with a great grilled flavor served in warm flour tortillas with pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole and shredded lettuce for toppings. Its was also served with rice and beans, The rice was ok, the beans were bland and needed more seasoning.
Where this place lost points was the service. it seemed like we did not have a specific server, just who ever was walking by the table. We had to flag down some one several times and the busier they got, the slower the service got. We asked for take out boxes that never came, so my sister's boyfriend had to go get them.
Overall, the food and drinks were good albeit higher priced than other Mexican restaurants in the area. The service, at least on the night we visited, leaves a lot to be desired.
The food and drinks are worth a return visit, but at the higher prices if the service does not improve on the second visit, there will be no third.
