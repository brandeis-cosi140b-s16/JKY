El Burrito should have a much higher rating. It has a few problems though.

Most of the staff seem very impressed with themselves (with the exception of one very nice older lady who I have seen mentioned in someone else's review elsewhere) and there's general awkwardness thanks to a few messy situations, such as pre-added mandatory tips when using discounts, coupons etc. 

The food tastes good (the deluxe bean dip is spectacular!) but the prices are quite outrageous for Las Vegas. $18 bucks for a plate of Nachos when I can get a larger serving elsewhere for almost a quarter of that price and it would have to be stellar food to win me over.

Worth a look, particularly if you have a coupon, but there's a bit of a weird vibe to the place.
