Like most American "Mexican" restaurants, Charanda is American-Mexican, not truly Mexican.  In other words, it has food that you are quite unlikely to find anywhere in Mexico.  That doesn't mean that it isn't good, it just means that it isn't truly authentic.

Charanda has a good variety of flavors on their regular menu, and the ingredients taste fresh, if a bit heavy on those American ingredients - cheese, sauces, sour cream and such.  They would do well to cut back and let the pieces of the dishes speak for themselves rather than dousing them so heavily.

You also might want to try and get a glimpse of the large margarita before you order one for yourself - they are pretty large, indeed.  Even the regular is a nice size.  Consider yourself warned.
