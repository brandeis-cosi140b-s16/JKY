I want to start off saying that the service was very friendly and will probably get us to come back for a second chance. With that said I really wasn't impressed with PHX Burrito House. Now I tried the breakfast burrito with bacon, yeah I'm a real health nut, and was really disappointed with the quality. I did like the tortilla, but I found the eggs tasted like they had been sitting on the griddle for awhile and the bacon was so little I think it was only in one bite. Never a good sign when you have to slather the Cholula sauce all over your meal.  I have had much better around the valley and maybe it was just an off day seeing the reviews, or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.
