Your typical Mexican spot.  Not bad not exciting. Basically you take your tortilla and the man well put anything you want in it.  I was bsing with the owner and by them time we were finished my burrito was the size of a woman's purse.  It was friggin gigantic.  Though, I don't expect this to last long as it was more of he was looking for repeat customers.  Otherwsie I would give this 4 stars.
