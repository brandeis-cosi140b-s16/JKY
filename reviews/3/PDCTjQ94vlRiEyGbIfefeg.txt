The flavor of the carne was good but mine had a couple fatty/chewy pieces that I thought were kinda icky. My husband have his a 4/5. The green chile cheese tamale was flavorless. We could taste Ny. Hole or cheese. Salsas were pretty good but if spice isn't your thing, they have a kick. 

We should've asked but had already sat down when my husband said we are charged $22. 2 burritos with a couple added toppings, one tamale and 2 drinks. Unless they drink were $4 each, we were over charged.
