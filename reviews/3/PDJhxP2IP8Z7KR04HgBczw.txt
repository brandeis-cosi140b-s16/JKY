Not the best, but good. Guacamole was really very excellent, but at $15, I would expect it to be.

The physical plates appear to be the same as they use at Oyamel in DC, but I can't be certain. Waitstaff was great -- very patient (we had a couple members of our party come a bit late), and took into consideration our dietary concerns. Unfortunately, that really consisted of leaving off the bonita flakes on one dish, and just informing us of which dishes weren't vegetarian friendly (and there were a lot).

Overall, I like Jose Andres' restaurants quite a bit, and while China Poblano was decent, it wasn't anything to really write home about.
