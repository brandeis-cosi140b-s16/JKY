Happy Grill Mexican Restaurant had good food but not the best service or decor. Chandelier with only four out of nine lights working, sticky table and straws but no water. When asked for tortillas twice, we finally got them when we asked a busser. Even though the service wasn't the best, my boyfriend and I agreed that it still was good food for an affordable price.
