Came here for lunch with a friend. Cute, quaint little place. There were only two other tables dining, so it was not overly busy. However, it took a little bit of time for someone to come over to us ... But our server was nice, and we were not in any rush so we did not mind. 

Their menu is small; I hate when a place has  pages upon pages - it's too overwhelming. I went with the vegetarian enchiladas rojas with a Pacifico. (They have Pacifico and Modelo Negro on tap, for those who are curious). I saw they had Horchata on the menu as well, so I also ordered a glass of that. I was a little disappointed by the flavor of the Horchata; it wasn't very sweet and needed more cinnamon :( 

The food came out fast. It was hot and seemed to be fresh. Perfect sized lunch portion, too. You get a small basket of tortilla chips and salsa (I noticed on the menu that if you want an additional basket of chips or more salsa, there is a small charge).  But for my friend and I, this was the perfect size!

Overall, it was pretty good. Fair prices (for lunch, dinner entrees are a little more pricey), and our server was friendly. I enjoyed the relaxed and quiet atmosphere. It's nice to go out to dinner and not have to scream over the loud music or chatter of 100 other diners.  I would like to come back and try a few more things on the menu, maybe go for a mojito or margarita next time, too :)
