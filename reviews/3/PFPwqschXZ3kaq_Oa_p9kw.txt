The food was mediocre. Our waiter took our order and he was clearly forgetful, yet didn't think it would be a good idea to write down our order, so of course my order was wrong. After the busser gave us our food, the waiter didn't come check on us, we had to flag him down to let him know the order was wrong. After that we never saw him again, it was just the busser helping us, who was very nice, if he would have been our server from the beginning our experience might have been different. *****Also I had regular beans in some type of small nacho bowl yet under my lettuce my rice was mixed with refried beans which doesn't make sense unless they are using other peoples unfinished rice and beans and hiding it under the lettuce.
