We decided to try this place on the recommendation of a friend who loves it.  Though it has a certain local charm, I found the food to be average.  I ordered their Chimichunga with beef, which is one of their specialties.  The beef was of good quality and prepared well, though there was no seasoning to speak of.  It was tipped with guacamole and sour cream.  The beans were excellent and the rice had a good flavor, if slightly undercooked.  My wife had fish tacos, one batter dipped and one regular.  She really liked the batter dipped one, but didn't care for the regular one.  The server was friendly and the service was good.  The pricing was fair and the food acceptable, but nothing about the place stood out that would make me plan to come back.
