It should be said this review is only for their chips and salsa which always hit the spot. They aren't supremely special or anything just consistently tasty. I do t really like anything on their menu so I usually order rice and beans leave a big tip and eat lots of chips and salsa! Oh and margaritas if I'm not driving!
