Typical bland Phoenix style Mexican food.  It wasn't fantastic and wasn't awful.  I had the Relleno and Enchilada platter.  The enchilada had way too much red sauce, and the relleno had cheddar cheese-I'm use to having it with asadero.  The Caldillo sauce had greasy ground beef in it.  Would of been 10x better without the ground beef (Gosh at least I hope it was ground beef).  The rice was standard Macayo/Garcias type and the beans were really good.  I would go back but not on my oh my gosh I have to go there again list.
