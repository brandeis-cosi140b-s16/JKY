PROS: I love Mexican-American food. You know, with that black bean and cilantro rice kinda twist? Yup. I had shredded beef enchiladas and Coronas galore. 

CONS: My poor friend had a steak tostada and I guess it was terrible, so maybe don't order that. The service was non existent . . . it seems the only qualification is that you have to be pretty to work there.
