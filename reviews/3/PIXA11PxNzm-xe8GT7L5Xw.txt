I will stick to Don Camarones, this place was decent, the service was good but the pulpa was overdone and too chewy and the shrimp was too fishy, like it wasn't even close to fresh. HOWEVER, the yellow peppers wrapped in bacon and doused in soy sauce were the shit! The Michelada was warm and basically all clamato. So, it's your basic Camarones dive. Probably won't go back, and I don't like saying this at all bc the service was good for sure.
