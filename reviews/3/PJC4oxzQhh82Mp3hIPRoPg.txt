I usually love this place, but today I left irritated.  The food is consistently good. The employee preparation of the food can be hit or miss. Today it was a miss.  I came in around 11:30 and there were about 5 people in front of me. When the lady in front of me ordered, she ordered 4 salads to go.  All of the warm tortillas with melted cheese that were sitting on the grill got used up.  My turn to order, I also ordered a salad only I didn't get a warm tortilla with melted cheese.  I got a cold tortilla with cheese sprinkled on it and my rice and beans thrown on top of that. Really?  You couldn't take the time to grill me a tortilla like you're suppose to? I was hoping the rice and beans might have melted the cheese, nope.  I always rip a piece of tortilla off first thing and it was disappointing. It was cold, not warm like it should have been. The employees on clean up duty in the dining room are also very grabby.  On 3 different occasions I've been mid-meal and had my half full salad dressing cup sitting on the tray right next to me and an employee will grab it without saying anything and throw it away. This location is newer and I hope they get their act together or I will be going back to "the other place."
