I was excited to find a Mexican shop that sold chamangos, Mexican chips, and candy being from San Diego and close to the border I miss those kinds of things out here. Their chamangos weren't what I was expecting. I'm used to it being blended with pieces of fresh mango with chaca chaca candy pieces and chamoy. 

They just put pieces of mango and chamoy with mango ice cream. It wasn't as great but the ice cream itself was really good! 
Big black guy was super friendly overall decent experience
