Time to update after coming on Tuesdays for a couple months.  First, if you come for lunch hit this place early.  We usually get here around 11:30 and there is no line and plenty of tables, by noon the place is generally packed.  Also while it doesn't happen every time there usually is quite a few kids running around while the parents couldn't care less.

The menu is more or less what you'd expect; tacos, burritos and nachos with a subway style setting for picking ingredients.  Everything I've tried has been pretty good; only complaints is that they leave the fat on the chicken, sodium levels are pretty high and they don't have cucumber like Moes.  If you have a Ballantyne Corporate card you also get a discount, a burrito bowl and drink with discount comes up to $6.99 which is pretty good for the area.

General cleanliness is pretty good, haven't seen the bathrooms but I do always see someone walking around cleaning tables and taking care of people's trash.   The music selection is also always changing, one day it'll be all Spanish music and the next some sort of indie hipster stuff.  The only constant is that it is always too loud.
