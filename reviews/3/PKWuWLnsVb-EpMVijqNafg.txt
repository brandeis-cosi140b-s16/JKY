BIG, THICK, BURRITOS!

OK, so I've had the carne asada fries which are totally BOMB! I ordered a california burrito this time, I was pumped... and let down! WTF! ANY Calif burrito I've had included : fries, carne asada, sour cream, guacamole, and cheese (pico if you like it) This one only had cheese and freakin carne asada! I was pretty pissed! I ate only half because the tortilla tasted sweet and was just irritated! I really dont want to pay 5$ for meat and cheese! UGH! 

Go for the carne asada fries! The plus is they are open 24hrs and have a drive through!
