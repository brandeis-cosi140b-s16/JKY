I've visited this location 3 times in the past month or so.  The first visit was perfect, but the last 2 visits on Saturdays have been horrific.  The food would have been acceptable if it didn't get ice cold as the staff prepared our entire order.  We are a family of 5 so I expect it to take a few minutes to prepare our food, but 10+ minutes, come on!  They appear to be either under staffed or just don't give a crap.  Not sure what to do, my boys prefer Qdoba over Chipotle, but this service is making it tough to come back.  At least with Chipotle, we know our food will be warmer than room temp.
