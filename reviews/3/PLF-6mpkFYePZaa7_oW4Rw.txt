Good for lunch but be warned the portions are large.
I asked the waiter what the place is known for and she recommended the Pollo Blanco.  Good call on her part but I could only eat half.  It was had a mild spice/heat and nice jalape√±o cream sauce. I would order it again.
The chips and salsa are good but if you like more flavor in your salsa just ask! We did and she brought us a stronger and thicker batch which beat the initial watery offering. we gobbled that version up and she kept bringing more!
The service was perfect for a fast lunch, attentive, quick, and our iced teas were constantly refilled. We wanted for nothing, well, after we asked for the better salsa that is!
