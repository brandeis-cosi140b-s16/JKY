The Q, in a nutshell, is a Mexican fast food chain, like Chipotle, but with a more flavorful and a more varied menu. Which is great in theory. The problem is that once you've had some great Q, it leaves you craving for more. And this particular location seems to me to suffer from the sub-par franchisee syndrome. Let me explain: You know how you can have good Subways and then the not so good Subways? Same chain, same meal, but very different experience... Well, same thing here. Specifically, my former co-workers and I used to freqent another location, close to my old office in Los Angeles. And when I say frequent, I'm talking almost daily for a few months there. Or so it seems. We loved it. But the food and dining experience at this here location just doesn't seem as good. Maybe the lower volume of customers means that the ingredients are sitting around longer. Maybe it's the staff. I'm not sure. So, in conclusion, better than Chipotle, but not as good as some other Qs.
