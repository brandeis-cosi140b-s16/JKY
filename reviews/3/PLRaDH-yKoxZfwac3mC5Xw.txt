We stopped here for a quick drink inside the Miracle mall while waiting for the Marc Savard comedy show.  We sat down, spoke to the bartender for a bit, and ordered Waboritas, very good btw.

However, yet another camera lady came and took a picture of us.  When I told her I did not want to buy the picture, she stormed away with a pretty bad attitude....

Dear Cabo Wabo / Planet Hollywood, please do not allow rude photographers ruin the experience of your guests.  

Cheers
