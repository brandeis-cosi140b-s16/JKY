Habanero's has fresh, reasonably priced tex-mex food. My veggie burrito was pretty good - the black beans have a nice flavor, the bell peppers & onions were sauteed nicely, a light sprinkling of cheese, but there wasn't enough pico or lettuce. The cheese enchiladas were a little below average in my mind - really small & the sauce was kind of bland. I found their mexican rice to be on the bland side, but that can be fixed with salsa. Overall this is a good place to go in & grab a quick meal - the food is on par with a Rubio's or Baja Fresh but you have the opportunity to support a local business which wins in my mind.
