Nothing really stands out about Casa Grande.  It looks like a lot of Mexican restaurants located in strip malls.  I stopped there for lunch on a Saturday because I was craving Mexican.  It's a nice place, with a friendly staff.  It is definately authentic.  Brush up on your Spanish as the menu's, at least the one I got, are mostly in Spanish.  I ordered the enchilada potosina and while I watied my server brought out some chips & salsa.  It took a little bit to get my food.  There was a lot of food on the plate and it looked tasty.  Enchiladas potosina is more like an empanadas than what you'd traditionally would think of an enchilada.  They were a little bland though for my taste.  My server asked if I wanted some spicier salsa and brought out a bowl of salsa verde that had a nice kick to it.  Over all the service was good, but the food was a bit bland, though the salsa verde spiced it up nicely.  I'd try Casa Grande again but probably would choose something different.
