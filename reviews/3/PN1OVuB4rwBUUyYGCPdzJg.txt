Amados may not look like much inside or out , but after a nite out or next day headache u just can't shake, this is an excellent cure. Not sure I would come here by myself, but then again I don't ever eat out alone. I've tried a lot and the carne Asada burritos are HUGE and soo good. Can never eat a whole one. Breakfast burritos are amazing, especially ham and cheese, and rolled tacos with guac and cheese are a must! They have really good red and green sauce, and a condiment bar with peppers, carrots sauces and more. Like I said its kinda sketchy, but get past that and It's a pretty great place! Much better then fil- yuckos !!!!!
