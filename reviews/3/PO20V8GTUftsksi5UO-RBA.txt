*update below*

literally right under my office building! so glad something finally opened up in this space.

today i had the flank steak with grilled veggies. it was ok! i thought the price was just a wee bit high so i probably won't be ordering it again but i will be coming back to try other things. most of the items on the menu were fairly priced.

our waitress, yvette, was the best! our drinks were always filled. she was hilarious and did a great job answering our questions and making special requests. one of the best waitresses i've had. 

*update*
we called to-go today. the girl taking our order wasn't familiar with the menu. we ordered a few tacos and after each taco she'd be like 'is that one of our tacos?' then we ordered the green chile pork. she said they didn't have that. we told her it's on the menu and she asked where so we told her. 

i get they're still new so i'm not super annoyed. the part that bugged me after all that was that my food had hair in it. there's nothing worse than taking a bite and having to pull a long hair out of your mouth. 

probably won't be coming back for a few months. i'll let them get settled and learn the menu and figure things out.
