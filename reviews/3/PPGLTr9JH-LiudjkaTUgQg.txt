I wanted to love this place, because it is really close to my house, and it would have been great to have a good New Mexican place close by.  The food here isn't bad, and if you prefer Sonoran Mexican it probably fits the bill just fine.  For my taste, everything was way too bland, nowhere near spicy enough.  Granted, I've been spoiled by Los Dos Molinos, but regardless I expect to see some fire brought if I'm eating New Mex.  This place couldn't quite deliver.
