I ordered a drink that I stumbled upon at another restaurant by accidentally mixing horchata and Jamaica and I really like this drink.   I ordered it at this restaurant and the server, who was Diana made faces at me and asked if I was sure that was what I wanted and I said yes, that's what I asked for.   Then when she brought my drink she told my friend that speaks Spanish that she has never made a drink like that and laughed about it.  Her attitude completely ruined my experience.  I couldn't even enjoy my food (which was good) because of her facial expressions and remarks.  And I must say, that she shouldn't speak in Spanish to my friend and belittle me.  Have the nerve to say it to me in English, so I can defend myself.
