This was an odd experience for both my Fianc√©e and I. We both love Mexican and Chinese food so to find a restaurant that fused the two cultures together should have been a home run for us.

It sadly wasn't. We ordered a sampling of dishes to share and the only one I liked was the shrimp mojo. It was sweet with a hint of smoke and tangy spice. I liked them a lot. Our Sui Mui had a weird fishy aftertaste and made us both a little nervous. The Taco we ordered was a good weird. I'd try it again if I had an opportunity.

Price was to be expected being on the strip but I'll never get used to paying $5 for an 8 ounce bottle of Coke. 

I'd stop here again if someone else said they wanted to try it or we had tickets to a show at the Cosmopolitan but all in all its not someplace I'd highly recommend.
