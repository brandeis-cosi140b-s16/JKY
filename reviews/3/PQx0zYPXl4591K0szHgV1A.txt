Homestyle Mexican food- the only thing Americanized about their namesake steak burrito is the flour tortilla. It's packed with a bit of Spanish rice, a not-overwhelming amount of beans, a good portion of slightly-charred steak, and a handful of cilantro and onions. They also offer tacos and a breakfast menu.

The other star here is the pupusas! Window art states they were once voted best pupusas in the city-I've only tried the revueltas, but they're spot on. Thick and filled without being skimpy or overpriced (about $2/each), good-sized and not too greasy. Several varieties to choose from, too.

Service is adequate- wait might be a bit longer than you're used to, but they make their pupusas fresh which is way better than any other option that may save you a few minutes. Dining room looks like it's furnished with the tables and chairs from someone's own dining room, which gives it an oddly homey feeling.
