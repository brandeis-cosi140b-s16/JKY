I love margaritas and they are pretty generous with the tequila here. I've tried a few different flavors (frozen and on the rocks) and they've all been tasty. I stay in the bar area so I can't recall what the rest of the restaurant looks like, but the service in the bar area has always been great. Only things I can remember trying here are the chicken flautas and one of their quesos (sorry can't remember which one). And both were pretty good.
