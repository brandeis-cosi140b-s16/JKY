This is a great place for happy hour or late night drinking in downtown Chandler: awesome bar, live music and a fantastic patio.  I finally had the full dinner experience here last Friday and I actually thought the food was pretty good, too.  The hubby got the chicken mole which was very tasty.   My fish tacos were good but nothing special.

Their chips and salsa are really awesome.  The chips are hearty with a good flavor even on their own.  They are thick enough to stand up to the bean dip which is a must try item.  We love that they have Pacifo on tap but my husband was disappointed that they don't have Bohemia (even bottled).  The other stars on the drink menu are the margaritas in various flavors but since I don't care for tequila I can't comment on those.

On the night we ate there we experienced similar service issues as other reviewers... long wait for a table due to lack of bussing, no silverware until after our food arrived, etc.  Our server was busting her hump but they were just way understaffed.  She managed to stay cheerful and friendly so that's a plus.  To be fair it was Third Friday that night.
