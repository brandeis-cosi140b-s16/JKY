Having grown up around hole in the wall tacquerias (with the best food in the world), I still haven't caught onto the sterile Chipotle style Mexican joints. I know I know everyone says Zabas is better than Chipotle, but it looks and feels very similar. Thankfully the menu has many more options. I opted for the fish tacos, which were tasty, but not super good. I don't know it just wasn't my thing, but I can see the allure of a stylish fast food taco joint.
