Decent food and priced well.
The service is a bit lacking but not due to lack of effort.
The person working the counter is just not very restaurant savvy. He lacks experience. It made the ordering a bit rough but everything worked out. He is very nice but just was not so familiar with what came with each portion, etc.

You might want to consider eating here if you are then en-route to a hotel. Not straight to the airport. Might not be best to fly right after this meal. Just saying.
