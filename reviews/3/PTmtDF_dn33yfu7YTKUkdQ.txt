Good place if you are trying to grab a quick meal. I expected flavorful food but instead ate some good tacos but nothing remarkable over the rest of the taco places in Vegas like Robertos or Don Tortaco. So without further ado, here is my review:

* Food: Pretty good. I had a chicken taco and a steak taco with guac and pico...not bad. They have the sauce bar with the average green and red sauce.

* Service: Friendly staff willing to answer questions and made a combo suggestion!

* Overall experience: Good. 

Conclusion: This is not a place I will be craving anytime soon, but I am willing to eat there again if I am in the neighborhood.
