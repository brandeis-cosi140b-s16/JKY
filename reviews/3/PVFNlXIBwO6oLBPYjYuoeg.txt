Really easy place to find and stop by if you're passing by Casa Grande. Not very far off the freeway and easily accessible. Food is a little overpriced for what you get, but is always very tasty. Their quesadilla is huge and fish tacos are great. Service is always fast and staff is very friendly. Definitely will continue to be a patron.
