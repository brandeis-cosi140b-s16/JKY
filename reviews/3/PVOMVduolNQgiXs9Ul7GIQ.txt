Why the hell does everyone have stuffed animals?!

Apparently, they give you a stuffed animal after taking your order so when you're seated, they know what table to deliver the food to. I thought it was a just a nice gesture so I said 'No thanks' to the dirty stuffed animal. Then I wondered why the food never came.

Chuy's reminds me of the surf n' turf taco shops by the beach. I like the meat and seafood options and especially the smell of grilled food but the flavor could use a lot more spice. The menu was expansive and offered a lot. Too much to list and I think they even have fried chicken? Weird. 

I ordered the Broiled Whitefish Taco Platter ($6) with a side of Shrimp Skewers ($4). The shrimp skewer was awesome, sprinkled some lemon juice on it with some hot sauce and that was a better meal than my taco platter. The fish didn't taste 'fresh" and I'm not exactly sure what whitefish is either. The rice and beans were standard. The cabbage salad could use some help. It was chopped cabbage with a vinaigrette. 

I was not impressed by Chuy's but I could go there again. It's a safe option, maybe next time I should try their $2 margaritas that they serve all day, every day. Now we're talking!
