I keep coming back to this place because I have heard so many positive reviews; both from my friends as well as fellow Yelpers. This was my third visit.  I just don't think any of the food I've ever tried there was that delicious-none of it, except maybe my child's cheese quesadilla.

I do however, appreciate the staff-the are super courteous, friendly, and seem like they really "want to be there."

Great Margaritas-Great.  I wish more restaurants would use the age-old margarita formula of basic quality ingredients: FRESH lime juice, tequila, simple, orange liqueur=Boom!  Life's too short to ev-uh use a pre-mix.

Summary: Go there for drinks and maybe chips n' salsa.
