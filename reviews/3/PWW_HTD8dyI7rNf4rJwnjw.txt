I thought the food was good and service friendly and quick. I enjoyed the enchilada style Theresa's special--certainly kicks ass on fajitas from a chain restaurant. It tasted fresh-made; ingredients were all flavorful and it was neither over nor under cooked. The margarita was flavorful too--not watery or over-sweet as many chain restaurant margaritas are. My one reason for not rating it higher is that the menu did not include some of my favorite Mexican dishes such as mole, chili verde and tamales. Maybe that's because Sonoran style food doesn't include those, but that's my preference.
