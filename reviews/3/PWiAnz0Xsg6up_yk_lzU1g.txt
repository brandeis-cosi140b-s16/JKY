I am giving the Sheep Camp 3 stars based on the fact that it was a true authentic Buckeye experience. A hole-in-the-wall establishment, looking outdated and forlorn, it was exactly what i would expect (and hoped) to find in downtown Buckeye. Food was very average, but about what i expected. Just wanted to grab some greasy breakfast, and i achieved that. Service was friendly, and i would definitely go back again if i'm in the area and need a cheap place to grab a bite.
