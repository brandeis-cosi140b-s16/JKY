Drive by this place daily and decided it was finally time to give it a try. 

They offer about 5 lunch specials, I went with the beef Sopes. 
Two beef Sopes served with rice & beans and a soda for about $7. 

The beef was shredded beef, some still in tender chunks that was very flavorful. It was on top of a sope then topped with lettuce, tomato, cheese & sour cream. The only drawback was the sope was very tough, you couldn't cut it with the plastic knives they have... 

The beans and rice were typical. Everything tasted very fresh and the portion was so large that I had to take some home. 

If you're looking for a quick fix on Mexican food, this place will have the cure!
