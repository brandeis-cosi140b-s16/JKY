I liked this place -- I need to go back and get the street tacos because apparently those are the best. I had trouble ordering -- the menu leads you to believe that any burrito can be ordered as a bowl but the cashiers were very confused when my colleague and I tried to do so. We were actually told we couldn't. So my colleague ended up with a burrito and I did get a bowl but it was what the cashier told me I could get and I added chicken and bombero sauce. It was good. Nothing spectacular, better than Chipotle. I want to love this place because the prices are more than reasonable. Next time trying the street tacos. Would also check out happy hour.
