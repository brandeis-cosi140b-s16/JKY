Mexico City is probably one of the best of the bunch of Pittsburgh's Mexican restaurants.

The new space they're in now is larger but still nicely decorated.

Service here is generally pretty good; I've had long waits and shorts waits.

The food is good, not great but good. The portion sizes are large enough. The chorizo or beef can be a bit dry at times. I do like the black & gold chimichanga - half of which is nacho cheese.

Last time I went, I had the super burrito, which is a 1/2 a burrito mexico city and 1/2 black & gold burrito. And the salsa verde enchiladas are pretty tasty.

The chips & salsa are good and unlike Las Velas, they don't charge you for them.
