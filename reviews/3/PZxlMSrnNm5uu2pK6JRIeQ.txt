This is a tough one.  On the one hand, the margaritas and food are 5-star. Really good stuff.   The menu is also very very well done (Imo). 

Atmosphere- "Festive" Mexian (as opposed to upscale Mexican)
Food- 5 stars
Drinks-  5 stars for taste.....2 stars for price
Service-   based on our experience (twice)....2.5 star

The bar service was pretty average to slightly below average (just my experience based on TWO visits).  Also,  the prices are pretty steep,  even for Vegas.   $12 or more for a margarita in a smallish glass with a ton of ice?   Wow.......they are good margaritas.....maybe one of the best I've had; but c'mon......$12+ ?  Happy hour is "1/2 price"......which was still $6.00 for a smallish (in my opinion) 'rita.   As for service,  I guess it was adequate,  but our bartender just wasn't friendly and/or engaging.  Hospitality,  particularly Vegas,  isn't about adequate,  in my view.  It's about EXCELLENCE.    He took our order,  but that was about it.  We even tried to make a little small talk....not much,  just little to be friendly.  Also,  there were only 4-6 people at the bar so he wasn't in the weeds.   No big deal....but I may or may not be looking to  return.  I just have a thing tor service.  It's so important.  Make people want yo return (and write good reviews) ;)

Overall, I'd give it 3.5 stars.  Easy potential for 4 star....just make your customers feel like you are happy they are there....spending $$.    Pretty easy.
