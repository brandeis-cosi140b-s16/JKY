Nope, the food isn't amazing. It's not bad--but I haven't had anything that thrills me. 

We still find ourselves here maybe once a month when we want something quick(it's easy to tell from the menu that a lot of it is pre made and just assembled to order), some chips and salsa(yeah, it's kind of a bummer that they charge--but I'm seeing that at a lot of places now), and my guy wants a beer. 

This is where we dash into for quickie lunch breaks, mid-errand dinners, and casual guacamole dates on the deck. 

I recommend the chile verde, it's cheap(maybe $7), tasty--and filling. I think they've tweaked the blue cornbread a bit, tonight  it was more moist and had just a dash of sweetness that I didn't remember from previous meals.
