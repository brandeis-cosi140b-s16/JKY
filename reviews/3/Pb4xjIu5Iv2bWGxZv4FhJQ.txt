I used to love si senior but they have changed their green chili con carne from beef to pork. The overall quality seems pretty low as well. The flavor just isn't as good as it used to be. I would give a 5 star if they changed it back! Salsa is always good and I actually love the chicken stuffed sopapilla but the carne is what I crave! Please change it back!
