Close to 2 star because they need to step it up here.   This is another of the overrated Madison restaurants and another one of the "Best of Madison" restaurants that is just plain mediocre.  Don't get me wrong, I have had some good hot meals here but they have a lot of work to do to get me past 3 stars.  The bathrooms are not the cleanest and seem neglected.  The food is of good flavor and hot but not especially memorable.   I did have one of the best margaritas here once.  The staff is a little remote and unfriendly and they are a little crowded.  Just ok and not somewhere I would recommend for Mexican food.  Pedros is better and they aren't spectacular either.
