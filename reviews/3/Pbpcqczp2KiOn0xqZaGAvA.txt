Six of us stopped in here for lunch earlier this week.  Our service was actually quite good, maybe because we got there at about 11:30.  An hour later the place was jam packed.  They do have a take out counter if you're in a time crunch.

They had quite the variety on their menu, Greek, burgers...even grilled cheese!  My friends told me they'd disown me if I ordered grilled cheese at a Mexican restaurant, so I got the chicken fajita salad.  This salad was so big they had to carry it out on it's own platter.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and all the veggies were fresh.  The other folks at my table ordered some of the $6 specials of the day (tacos and burritos) and those looked really tasty as well.
