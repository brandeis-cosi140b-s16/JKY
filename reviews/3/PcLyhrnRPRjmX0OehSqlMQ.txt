When you are driving home late at night and need a well made enchilada or chimichanga, this is the place to stop. Good bean and cheese burritos and 99 cent tacos on Wednesday as well. Open 24 hours and the staff has always been polite and gotten my order right. The decor is run down but the food is good, I like to call ahead and pick up my food to go.
