Well, what can I say...It's Mexican food Fast! And I'm a white guy! We usually like the food here...Try to not eat there due to some gross looking tile and grout that there cleaning with dirt and grease from the parking lot...The utensils to grab the vinegar carrots with is always buried in the salsa...Typically some 400lb lady with her belly is hanging over the counter as well grabbing like a tupperware full of carrots and jalape√±os out the door...The bathrooms here are nasty (i hold it for as long as possible) Those beans have quite a affect on your colon...One other observation in the store is , if you look to the right where the cashier is, take a good look at that 50 Year anniversary poster is, I swear thats a picture of Judge Judy and some Man from Home Depot...LOL
