My first review was a little harsh.  I just ate here again and am revising my review....This place does a lot of things well.  Clean, with a cool atmosphere and a very friendly staff.  Large restaurant but seating is layed out well so that it feels pretty private.  Can accomodate large groups.  Food is fresh and well prepared.  My issue with Nando's is the lack of a wow factor with any of their dishes.  If you want good food that is well prepared and a large menu you will be very satisfied.  

For me, when I go to a sit down restaraunt I want a dish on the menu that is memorable, unique, and tastey.  Food is solid, but for me not even in my top 10 mexican restaurants in metro Phoenix.
