Food is awesome the chicken and steak tacos are very close to Mexican street style maybe better and the chicken soup is the best. I eat hear alot but recently had a bad experience in drive thru and inside, employees don't know how to split orders and the guac sauce i asked for never made it in my bag and i didn't have time to go back as i was on a lunch break
