I I love this restaurant, and im particularly fond of the Avondale one, but this one is nice too. Friendly staff, but the food I had wasn't that great. I ordered a carnitas burrito, and it was kind of bland. Half the burrito was salsa, the other half meat. Also had a carne Asada which was all meat in the burrito, lettuce on the side. I will still go back to this place, but probably won't order those again.
