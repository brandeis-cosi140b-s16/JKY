It's a Taco Bell, so don't expect more than that. I have eaten at this location more than any other over a span of several years. The people have been consistently friendly and helpful, both in the restaurant and at the drive-through. I don't recall ever having my order messed up, and the place is pretty clean. Again, it is a Taco Bell, so I assume your expectations are reasonable.
