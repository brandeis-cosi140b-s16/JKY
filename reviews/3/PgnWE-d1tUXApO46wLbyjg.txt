As we were gathering our things after touching down at McCarren airport,
our main concern was of course food.
I suggested Mexican (per usual) while my friend had been thinking Chinese. Well you can imagine our surprise when the concierge mentioned a Mexican-Chinese fusion restaurant within our very hotel.

This is not your standard Mexican. So be prepared to shell out a lot of money for
each very small taco. However, it is somewhat worth it. My friends ordered Green Tea Sour cocktails (with an edible marigold) while I tried a new beer: Moutai - it was light and exactly what I needed with my food. 

I tried the Barbacoas and Carnitas tacos. The Carnitas was quite delicious but I am not quite used to the consistency of pork belly, so it was a bit of shock to bite into something so... jelly-like. 

We ordered the Twenty-vegetable fried rice because apparently it was on some
well-known foodie list and we weren't disappointed at all.

Like all of our food, it was light, incredibly fresh and made with simple ingredients. 

For dessert I had the Mango Sticky Rice.
Coconut milk is boiled to a cream and then added to shaved mango
and sprinkled with crisped rice to create something incredible. Loved.
 
 The decor inside China Poblano was... interesting. There were steering wheels
spanning most of the ceiling, an altar of buddhas near the entrance, 
low ottoman seating and a red/orange color palette. 
 

What I loved? There is one "bar" for Mexican  and one for the Asian inspired dishes. Each were incredibly clean and each dish is served as it is ready so if you order several things (as you will need to) you do not have to place the same emphasis on some of the more traditional dining rules.
 
 While I enjoyed my experience there (for the most part...) I do not think I would go again. It is definitely a great place to pop into if you are in a bit of a rush and not 
particularly hungry, or else $6 per tiny taco just becomes a bit annoying.
