I reviewed this place before and I guess I just ran into a bad day.

This Moe's is like most: your typical burrito, quesadilla and taco joint with unlimited salsa and chips.

I always snag my Moo Moo Mr. Cow (a kids meal) with black bean, tofu and no rice. Seeing I consistently get this at ANY Moe's location I go, I can compare prices and this location is a WHOLE DOLLAR more than the one in Northlake Commons. Strange, eh?
