I have to agree with Dan in saying that the staff didn't seem too excited to be here on the weekend. I came in on a Saturday for a quick lunch before running errands and I was pretty excited after the rave reviews that I read. Unfortunately, as soon as I was seated and started munching on the chips, I was disappointed. They were bland and a bit cold. I didn't let that totally bash my excitement though; I just salted them a little and enjoyed. The salsas were interesting; they were very fresh tasting, but lacked any sort of explosive flavor that I was expecting (The red is much better than the green). With the bland chips, it wasn't much of a pairing, but with the salted chips, I was pleased. 

For lunch I ordered an al pastor burrito and a barbacoa sope. The burrito was awesome! I actually really liked that it wasn't huge. What it lacked in size, it made up for in flavor. The barbacoa on the other hand, wasn't as good. On the menu it says that barbacoa is only served on Saturday and Sunday. This is apparently because El Napolito's barbacoa is made with lamb. I've had plenty of barbacoa before and I was expecting to be blown away...especially after having some great al pastor, but I wasn't. The meat was really gamy, like really gamy. Salsa and a little salt were needed to make my sope enjoyable, and that was a shame.

I would return to El Napolito, but there are loads of great little Mexican places in the area that I'll be stopping by first.
