The atmosphere is the best part...great decor, modern vibe, outside bar and patio all are really great. You can sit and drink and watch people on Mill Avenue. That alone makes it totally fun. The food is just okay. Nothing exceptional. The fish tacos are tiny and mostly fried bready parts compared to fish. The onion rings are greasy and not great. The salsa is mesquite and tasty and the chips okay. The best part are  the drinks (good margaritas and tequila shots) and fun vibe. Worth happy hour visit for drinks but not worth going for the food.
