Wasn't wowed by anything in particular, although the chile verde plate was pretty good. Salsa bar was in awful shape when we came in around 6pm: most were empty, and there was a lot of cross "contamination". Cilantro and onion trays were all over the place, and all of their salsas were extremely watery. Travel companion had chile verde which I tried. I had asada and carnitas tacos. Carnitas was great, asada had an overwhleming burnt flavor, although it wasn't burnt... I love some good char, but this was on another level.
