Was on my way to Pepe's and pulled over when I saw the crowd gathered around this taco truck.

I liked...
- Handmade corn tortilla.  Yum.  
- Salsa bar.  A good spice red sauce and an even better greenish red sauce.  A tasty avocado sauce too!
- Fresh horchata on ice.  Nice and sweet.

I didn't like...
- No rice in burritos??
- High prices for a food truck.  $2 for tacos and $6 for burritos.
- No tables or chairs for sitting.
