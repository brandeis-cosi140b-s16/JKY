The atmosphere in this establishment is amazing. Love the cozy, romantic, dark feeling of the restaurant and the patio. Our plan on this chilly night was to sit on the patio and order from either Richardsons or Rokery, as we had several months prior. Apparently that is no longer an option, so we decided to go to Richardsons. When we entered, we inquired about happy hour, which is only at the bar, so we chose to sit at a booth, instead, and skip happy hour. We ordered a round of margaritas and our entrees. The food was good, but, for some reason, was not kind to my stomach later. The service was so-so. I agree the waitstaff acts like they are way too busy to be bothered with doing their job. Our waitress was standoff-ish and absent. We had to ask one of the other workers for drinks and extras, like napkins, etc. The place was not busy, so I am not sure what happened to our server. We may return for a romantic cocktail or to bring guests for a drink, but that will be the extent of our return.
