Would have given a 4 star but couldn't do so due to the the poor attitude of the manager. The food was tasty, excellent drinks,service was very good. Our issue was unfortunately with the manager. We are in town for a conference, decided at the last minute to have a team outing with 25 people. Got to the restaurant and were fortunate enough to be seated even with the late planning - but not together. When I arrived shortly after and after being informed by my team that they would not allow us to have our tables together (even though the remaining portion of the restaurant was empty) I approached the manager in the hopes of trying to get us together. I was met with complacency and a feeling that our business was not appreciated. Every option I threw out that would put us together was turned down for a variety of reasons. She said she had reservations and it just wasn't going to happen. We had our dinner and cocktails and a great time anyway. The important part of the story- not one additional party sat anywhere near us and not one of the tables that could have been used to put us together was ever utilized while we were there. No explanation, no apology, no appreciation for our $1200 tab. We took care of the servers but the manager needs customer service training at a minimum. We left at 10:00 pm and headed elsewhere to close our evening.
