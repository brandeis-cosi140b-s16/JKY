So, I went here for the UYE yesterday and for their Monday Yelp specials.   For a dollar,  the margarita was very good.

Where in the hell were all the other people that said they were going to show up? It was just me and two other very nice yelpers.

The place was dead while we were there and I didn't get any food.

Will go back to check out the roof when it's open again, promise.
