First time here Amazing food ,would recommend this restaurant! However my rating was not a 5 star due to he lack of customer service from the guy that brought out our food was a total asshole got In the middle of my boyfriend and I while we were having a conversation no excuse me or anything just start moving our stuff to put down our food and didn't not even introduce  himself not even one word until my boyfriend said  can you at least say excuse me his response was "really" and they started to go argue back and forth and this server had the nerve
To get in my bf face so unprofessional I don't know how people like that have jobs so disappointing it did ruin my dinner in a way because , customer service is a big thing for me just because I work in customer service for over 5 years now and I don't let that slide around me. other than that they took care of us the managers,the guy that took our order they were so nice & friendly . We will go back for sure but will definitely request a different server! Wasn't the best experience for it being our first time will try it a second time.
