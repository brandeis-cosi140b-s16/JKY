Sloppy service but great margaritas. We were amazed at the abundance of wait staff and still no service. They all seemed preoccupied, even the bartender who wasn't able to clear the bar after guests left. 
Really the only reason to patronize this establishment is on Tuesday for $5 top shelf margaritas.
