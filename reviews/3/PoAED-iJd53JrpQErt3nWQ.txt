I went to Pink Tacos because my brother likes it.  We ordered a pitcher of margarita (beware, I thought it was supposed to be half the price that it actually ended up being) and a tostada salad.  The margarita was okay, the salad was okay.  Service was okay.  Everything was just okay.  I would go back again just to try something else.  Cute decor.
