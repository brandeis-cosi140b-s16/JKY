If you like cheap, Americanized Mexican food, look no further.  The food is good and the staff is polite and welcoming.  The beer menu suffers quite a bit (the typical Mexican and American macros) especially to be in a city with some really good brews at your fingertips.  The chips and salsa are tasty.

Next time we go, we will have to check out the buffet.  Sounds interesting.
