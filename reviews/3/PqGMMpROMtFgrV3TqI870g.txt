I travel frequently for office work and I like to try local restaurants as much as I can.

Was driving around monroe street and got into this one for dinner. Thanks to the catchy sign board. 

It has a typical but nice ambience of mexican bar. I was accompanied by my Boss who is Belgian and likes mexican cuisine. Were served by a cute and helpful girl.

A bit disappointment on food taste. My plate looked really nice but did not taste very well. Drinks were really nice though. One of the best Shangria I ever had!
