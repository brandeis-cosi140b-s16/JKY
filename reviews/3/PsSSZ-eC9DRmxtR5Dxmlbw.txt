They increased their prices to restaurant prices. It's $10 for the "special." Most menu items don't come with rice, beans, sour cream, sauce, or guacamole and you have to pay extra for each and everything. Way too overpriced for fast food Mexican. The chips and salsa suck. The food is decent but not $12 a person (after paying for every little thing the menu item should include anyway). My daughter had chimichangas and they tasted like they had been sitting under a light bulb for hours.  Almost gave 2 stars but the chicken and beans are decent.
