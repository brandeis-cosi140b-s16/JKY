Was in the area so I stopped in for lunch. I was alone. Ordered the lunch special. No chips, breads or dip were served. Nor was it offered.

The ginger soup was excellent. Definitely worth the price of admission. The chicken sandwich was unique and tasty.

Service was good but I was the only one there for at least 15 minutes. They really need to step up their game if they want to stay in business. The food was good but not sure if I'd go back due to the chip fiasco. I mean really. As soon as another group arrived, they were shown to a table and chips were served.

Why would I return with bf and friends?
