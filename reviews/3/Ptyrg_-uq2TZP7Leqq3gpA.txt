Had lunch with the family here today.  I had the red chili burrito enchilada style with rice and beans.  Overall I enjoyed my meal.  The place is clean, not overcrowded and the staff is friendly.  They have a connection to the valley that has spanned over 60 years, so that is kind of neat.  If the weather is nice there is also a small outside dining area to enjoy.  I'm kind of partial to another Phoenix only restaurant, so I feel like a trader when I eat elsewhere, however this was a decent alternative.
