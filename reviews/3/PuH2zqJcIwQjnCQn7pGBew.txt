My husband and I ate here for the first time last week. Our experience didn't start off so well, as we waited close to 10 minutes to be acknowledged by one of the bartenders who both seemed to be ignoring the 6 or 7 other people at the bar and were both working the well. After finally being greeted, we waited another 5 minutes for our drinks. 15 minutes for two beers is a little much! 
However, things got better when we were seated. Our server was very friendly and knowledgable. We ordered the corn appetizer and table side guacamole. The guacamole was delicious, but I wouldn't order the corn again. To be fair, I was expecting it to be as good as a similar corn dish served at the Elote Cafe in Sedona, but it didn't come close. We ordered about 5-6 tacos from the taco menu which I would give an overall rating of a 7. The unusual ingredients and combinations were fun, but I thought the overall execution was just ok. I'll be back for the guacamole though.
