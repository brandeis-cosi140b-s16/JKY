Drive through service was ok, just like other locations. It does take them long time to serve folks and they often forget important things like straws, or sauces. I like their skinless chicken breast with steamed broccoli, great post workout protein packed (and low-carb) meal. Their less than 500 calorie menu is pretty good too, I also like their avocado sauces.
