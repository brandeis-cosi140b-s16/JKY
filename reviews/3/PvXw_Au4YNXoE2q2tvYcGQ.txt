After a long day at work, and nothing at home to fix, pickup was my plan. I have driven by Moe's for over 9 years and only been once more than 5 years ago. The parking lot is always full, Mexican sounds good, so my car led me to Moe's. I was greeted as I walked in by an enthusiastic staff. After looking over the menu I decided to go with two tacos. I ordered one chicken soft taco and one ground beef taco in a hard shell. I chose my fixings, added chips and queso and headed home. The ground beef was very flavorful, however not something you should take to go. The side the ground beef was on made the hard shell completely soft and I was unable to pick it up. No big deal because it was the best thing I ate. As for the chicken, very dry! And, the chips were fresh, but cold and no seasoning or salt. As for the queso, I wouldn't waste my money, nothing but melted cheese. I like a little kick, seasoning, jalepenos, etc.
Overall the staff was friendly and the meal okay. Not my favorite Mexican fast food, but I would return and dine in next time.
