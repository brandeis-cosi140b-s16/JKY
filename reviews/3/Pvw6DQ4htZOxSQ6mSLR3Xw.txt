Solid menu and ambiance.  The execution is off.  The staff didn't know the menu well enough and I was charged for a higher priced item.  With Blanco and Sumo Maya across the street and Barrio down the road they better work out the kinks in order to win patronage. Would also love to see some more dishes native to DF like Sopes, Al Pastor, or Cichilo Negro.
