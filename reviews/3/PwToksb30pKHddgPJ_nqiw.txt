This place gets 3 stars and let me tell you why. The carnitas are bomb. com super delicous. You could go with carnita tacos, burritos, and just carnitas by them selves.
The handmade tortillas are $2.50 each but they are def. worth it.
 The only thing that was bad about this place was the bathroom, and the fact that they dont keep mexican bolio in stock for their tortas. I was kind of dissapointed when the waiter came up and said "Can we make a torta with a regular piece of bread?" Well then It wouldn't be a torta. Right? 

Other than that the food is really good, I mean I almost inhaled it.
My daughter also ate with me which is very suprising because she is hard to please.

p.s they serve the burritos with homemade french fries. (so good)
