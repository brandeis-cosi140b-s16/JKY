This is one of those joints where the food overshadows the spotty service.  Anyone that reads my reviews, knows I'm sort of a salsa snob. And although I like their standard salsa that comes to the table complimentary, I LOVE their secret stash of hot salsa (you have to ask for it).  Not everything hits the bulls eye with me, but for the most part, F&L is good eats!

Their Santos Lounge is pretty cool and has a pretty impressive menu of tequila.
