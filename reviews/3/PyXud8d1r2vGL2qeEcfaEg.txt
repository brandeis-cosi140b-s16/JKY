The food & customer service were awesome as usual for a Chipotle however I give this place only 3 stars mainly for the awkward setup which is less than ideal. You walk in and it is set up like a mini food court with a panda express counter and small pizza place in the same area. Seating is very limited and the tables were all very dirty. That said, It is conveniently located on the strip and is a good option in terms of price as meals can be expensive on the strip.
