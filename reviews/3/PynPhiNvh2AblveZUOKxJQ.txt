I'll start this by saying I have been here on 4 separate occasions and every time I just get tacos.  No frills, no beans, rice, chips, etc.  I see those as pretty much just filler and I'd rather not.  So this is about their tacos... that being said I'd like to try their breakfast burrito sometime since its received such good reviews. 

I have tried their carne asada, pollo, and fish tacos.  So far, my favorites are the steak and fish.  They are quite good, but I wouldn't say they're amazing.  They come double wrapped in corn tortillas (which I love) and a rather large helping of meat per taco.  I usually pound tacos like its my job but 2 is plenty for me here.  To me, on of the keys to a great taco is the cilantro, so I ask for extra and they heap it on!  The meat is pretty good, but I can see how some would call it bland.  It would be great if they spiced it on the grill.  The fish tacos are beer battered, but I have a feeling they are frozen.  So whatever, its a pretty good place for lunch, but I don't really want to try anything else on the menu as it looks pretty dang cheap.  Oh, and they do have a military discount, which is always a plus for me.  So, there you have it:

Good, but not great.  I've heard Don Pancho is the place to try.  Looking forward to my first taco there.  (Did I mention I love tacos?)
