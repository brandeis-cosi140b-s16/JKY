My boyfriend had one of his cravings for some Sonoran hotdogs, I'm not a fan of hot dogs AT ALL.. But it was one of those compromise while in a relationship moments so I played nice and went along. They do have a lot of food to choose from besides the hotdogs and I tried a chicken taco as well as a pork torta and both were pretty decent. 

I can't speak on behalf of the hotdogs but the smile on his face while slumped on the couch with his hand on his belly was a good enough indication that he was very happy and enjoyed them.
