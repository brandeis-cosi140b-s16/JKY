The salsa was spicy and flavorful. They were almost a 2 star because of the slow service and dirty tables. Since this is the first week they are open, I am giving them a break. The staff is friendly and they are really trying. They did give out free churros and apologized for the wait. I am sure we will be back and hopefully by then everything will be running smoothly. Try the carne asada tacos, the meat was on the thick side but tender and well seasoned. For $2 each for street tacos, I feel that Tacos El Gordo is the better buy. Good tacos for a neighborhood joint though.
