The food at Qdoba is OK - it's not quite as good as Chipotle, but is OK for a burrito fix. Since the grand opening mailer coupons ran out I haven't felt the need to visit when I prefer Chipotle that's located in the same complex.

I read Matthew C's review regarding his drama with the gift certificate and while I never experienced this, my wife and I took "$5 worth of food free" coupons in that we received in the mail and the cashier said we were required to purchase a drink in order to use this offer. This was not mentioned anywhere on the mailer we received and eventually I was able to use the coupon as advertised. It made me feel a bit awkward though.

Decent food, but I'll stick with Chipotle.
