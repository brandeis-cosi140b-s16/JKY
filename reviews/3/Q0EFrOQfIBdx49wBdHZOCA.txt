Ah sweet, sweet, dependable Rivas. You're always there when I need you, which is almost exclusively after 1 a.m. or on a difficult Saturday morning. I'm sure you have other operating hours, but that seems hardly important.

The staff is legitimately friendly and helpful, especially at odd hours of the evening. The salsa bar is adequate and includes gratis pickled carrots. The menu is far too robust to try everything and can occasionally be difficult to navigate. Seriously, it's a 10 foot spread at least.

The food is exactly what you would expect when you walk in. Compared to FiliB's, Amado's, etc. it's completely serviceable; compared to Los Taquitos, it is lacking. Rivas does nothing to separate themselves from every other 24-hour Mexican joint save for slightly more generous portions. The carne asada fries, rolled tacos, and California burrito are the standouts of the operation, with the carne asada being consistently tender and the rolled tacos being smothered in delightful guacamole. Avoid the tacos and enchiladas, as both are damp in a manner that you do not typically associate with food. 

Rivas is far from the best option in Tempe, but I still keep going back. That's gotta count for something.
