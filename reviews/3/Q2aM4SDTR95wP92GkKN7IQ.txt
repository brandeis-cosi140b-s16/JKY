Went here for lunch to try out their $5 lunch menu.  

I ordered the tostada and was not disappointed with how the food tasted - it was not spectacular, but it was not bad either.  It was only one tostada, but I was surprisingly satisfied after the meal.  

My wife ordered the burrito bowl, which had a good amount of food, but once again was nothing special.  For $5, it wasn't a bad deal.  

We took a look at the regular menu, however, and were surprised at how much more it costed.  The only thing that gives this place 3 stars instead of 2 for me is that we only had to pay $5 for otherwise mediocre food.
