Food did not taste the same for this last visit, somehow it was a lot more greasy and a bit salty and way too much cheese. Tried #100 on the menu - Should have tried the burritos (next time).The margaritas was definitely not as good/strong/tasty as I remembered as previously. Staff was nice and friendly (still a good thing). A large birthday group with friends. A private room in the back was a nice. It's always a fun place to go, if you are in the mood for margaritas and Mexican food. Will give this another try sometime soon.
