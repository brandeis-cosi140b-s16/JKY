We have been to cocina real a few times and find that there are two things to order.  Number 1 is the nachos con mariscos.  Enough for two with plenty of chips, cheese and seafood ( shrimp and scallops).  The other thing to order is a margarita, especially on 2 for 1 Tuesdays and Thursdays.  We have tried other menu items and found them to be utterly terrible ( we have not tried the fresh guacamole).  We have noted thst kids do seem to like other menu items...

So, get nachos con mariscos and margaritas and you will love this place!
