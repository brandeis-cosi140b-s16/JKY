Lame selection of beers and lame restrictive happy hour menu - why just discount some of the beers?  Mall location often means longer wait times too, and this mall is becoming the sister mall to Metrocenter in so many ways beyond that.  Food was alright, service was a bit slow, and parking is nowhere near the entrance (because it is always full).
