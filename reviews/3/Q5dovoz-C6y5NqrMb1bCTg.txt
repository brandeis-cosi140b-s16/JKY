My wife wanted to go to downtown Glendale because it had cute shops and such.

It got more exciting when she mentioned Mexican food.  This place is what I expected from the reviews.  The food was traditionally made and the tomale was real fresh and delish.  The Salsa was really really stand-out good which improved the quality of all the items.  

Unlike other reviews, we had really really attentive service including fast seating, waters filled, asked if we were ready to order when we looked up from menus, etc... 

This place was a standard, good, sit-down mexican tucked in a cozy little historic downtown.  No complaints.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend the place solely on the food or atmosphere, but it was a nice spot overall.
