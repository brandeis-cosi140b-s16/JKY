Got food poisoning from here. Won't happen again.

I got a quick and concerning response from Hussong's shortly after I posted this. They are looking into the situation and will be contacting me. First time a company doesn't try and brush it under the table. That makes things a little better.

Everyone else in my party enjoyed their meal, so I guess I'll change my rating.
