We've been here three times since the name change to Cabo's. Frankly, the second and third trips happened because we forgot that we weren't going to go there again.
Interior decor is nice and fresh, although one row of booths along the righthand side is ablaze with spotlights that glare in your eyes; don't sit there! There is a bar area, and TVs around the perimeter of the entire place. They DO have wifi, which is great.
The food is what's disappointing. It is either bland or mushy, depending on what you order. The soup we had with fish tacos was very oily/greasy. We exchanged it for chicken soup, which was salty salty.
This place serves best as a lunchtime stop for the working crowd and construction workers. Not a destination for dinner out with your spouse or date.
