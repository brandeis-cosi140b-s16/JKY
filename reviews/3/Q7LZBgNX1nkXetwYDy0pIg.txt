First time I tried this place it was real good, I had me some fajitas de carne asada. I love that they bring it to you pipeing hot with the steam coming out! That's how I love my food, but how did they know? Tthe meat and the bell peppers were dry and the tortillas were too, well, not really they just didn't have much flavor, but the salsa bar makes more than enough for it. Next time I tried it I figured out the first time it was great because I ate somewhere else. Cheap place to eat and it will get you full, it's not like it's real bad food. But both times I tried the margarita on the rocks were good. The service was satisfactory for a place out of the strip and being more local than anything. They were always there wondering about how you were doing. Now the salsa bar was awesome! I think the best thing out of this place is the salsa bar, If I would I would eat off of it haha.

  Plus even if you have tasted better somwhere the whole slot machine in the casino kinda makes up for it because it's Las Vegas. The colors inside this place are good it goes with the environment in the casino.
