Overall, this place had a great atmosphere. Inside, the bar and dining area is very nice, but the outdoor patio area was even nicer. Decent amount of space heaters, outside bar, and a few TVs. I was a little disappointed with the food. Unlike most Mexican restaurants, you have to order chips and salsa. We ordered chips and queso, which was just OK. The chips were great, but the queso was luke warm at best. I also ordered the organic rice bowl, which wasn't bad, but similar to one at Chipotle ($2 less). Overall, this is a great place to hang out and have a drink with decent food.
