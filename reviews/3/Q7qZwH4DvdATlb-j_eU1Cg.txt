This is like so many funky little places tucked away in a small shopping center.
We happened in here, on our way to meet some friends for cocktails. Deciding we wanted to have quick bite before.

The interior could use a little love, but has all the charm of a cute little place.

Even though the dining room was busy, I felt very taken care of by the waitress,
I ordered the cheese enchilada with green sauce.It came out hot and tasty. 
And the menu is not expensive, even the seafood dishes which I saw coming out of the kitchen. And they looked really good!

I would go back! Would I travel across town to go, not so sure about that. Would I suggest it after a day of Outlet Shopping?? HELL'YA!
