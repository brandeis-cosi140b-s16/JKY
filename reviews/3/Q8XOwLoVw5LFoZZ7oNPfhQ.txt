Roberto's is a greasy mess and I love it! There are only a few places I trust after a certain hour and Roberto's is one of them. Roberto's is open 24 hours. This location is attached to a Fabulous Freddy's and has a walk-up window for ordering. There is a patio with tables and chairs where you can grub if you are on a lunch break or just waiting on your car to be finished at Fabulous Freddy's or Jiffy Lube. 

I like a variety of things on Roberto's menu. Today I ordered a "Chicken Taco" since every Wednesday they are only 99 cents! These chicken tacos are greasy and delicious. The chicken is all white meat that has a nice flavor to it, and the cheese and lettuce are shredded fresh on site. The "Rolled Tacos" and "Carne Asada Fries" are worth trying too. The carne asada fries can easily be shared with others. My hubby ordered the "Carne Asada Burrito" priced at $4.90 which isn't bad, until you add on the 95 cents for each additional item such as cheese and sour cream. It can get pricey if you customize what you want, but it tastes better with all that other stuff! 


They also have combination plates that include rice and beans. If you like Menudo they serve it on Saturdays and Sundays.
