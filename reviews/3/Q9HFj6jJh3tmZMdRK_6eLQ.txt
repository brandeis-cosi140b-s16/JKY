On a Friday night, there were only a few of us looking for a quick, made-to-order dinner.  The staff were friendly and efficient.  The restaurant was clean.  

I do like that you can do a sort of pick 2 here.  My choice of a plain cheese quesadilla and a salad were nothing exciting, but were prepared well and as requested.  Coke Freestyle machine - yay!
