Had our employee holiday party here- staff was great about organizing our event on short notice! Location is decorated on a Dia de los Muertos theme with rustic wooden benches and chairs, and hanging lanterns. 

Food was solid: variety of nachos, taquitos, quesadillas, and enchiladas available, along with churros for dessert. As for the drinks,  the sangria has an interesting spice to it but the margaritas were the major hit of the evening.

Not a place I'd rush back to, but nice and dark for a quiet date night or some late night snacks and drinks with friends. It's a bit out of the way for me, personally. Experience having an event here was a positive one.
