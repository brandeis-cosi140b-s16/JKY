okay, so I haven't eaten all day and now it's late, pretty late & I am at that stage where I need to eat!  So, I go to good ol Yelp to search for something around & I love the fact Yelp lists business hours too!  So, of course all my top choices are closed except for, yup, you guessed it, da da da daaaaa Blanco!  

It was pretty empty, well they were closing in 30minutes, we sat at the bar and ordered the Braised Short Rib & Avocado cheese crisp and the Camarones Tacos.  The cheese crisp was awesome, I will confess I have a wee bit of an obsession with short rib, and this was pretty good, I will go back for just that!  I wanted to get the short rib tacos too, but my hand was spanked & firmly told 'no'...  The shrimp tacos were okay, they weren't 'OMG I'm salivating just thinking of them', but they weren't awful.  

And, the service, well I can't really say anything about that....  Because, we saw our server twice, good thing we paid cash, Lord only knows how long we would have waited for her...

I shall return, but I'll be doing it for happy hour!
