I like the fact that this establishment is open 24/7 and I like the salsa bar and juice fountain machine.  The #1 combo was tasty too.

I have to be honest though,  as someone who does not speak Spanish,  I had difficulty communicating with the cashier. Three examples:

1) I almost never have cash on me, so I asked if there is a minimum on cards (ex. Some restaurants have a $10 minimum when using credit cards).  The cashier "yes, debit-credit okay."
2) "Can you do take-out?" Blank stare... "To-go?" Nervous smile... "Take-away?" The cashier sighs in frustration trying to decode my question.  I ended up playing charades to get my answer.
3) I asked if the combos come with a drink. At this point,  I am this poor cashier's worst nightmare with all of my questions. 

What I have learned: no credit card minimums, I can place to-go orders and you have to order drinks separately. I would come here again (language barrier aside, the cashier was polite).
