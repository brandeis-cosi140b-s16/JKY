Went here yesterday for a late lunch/early dinner. 

What we sampled: 
Banana Slama Margaritas (where on happy hour special 16oz. for 5 dollars!  Tottally worth it and delicious)
San Francisco Insane Wings (hot and delicious!)
Pica Dippa Peppita hummus, xx chesse dip, guacamole (could have done without this, the flavors where off and weren't that interesting)
Carnitas Burrito (very hard to share between two people, but very delicious)
Ice Cream Burrito 1/2 Saturday 1/2 Sunday style (OMG a must try insane)

Overall the food quality was good, but with so many great places to eat I don't know that I would be rushing back.
