I love the food truck craze that has struck Las Vegas.

My first experience with a food truck was at Slidin Thru, and they really set the bar high. The next place I went to was Fukuburger, who was equally as awesome. Needless to say my expectations were very high when my wife and I wen to try out Sloppi Jo's. Those expectations were not met.

While the menu provides a pretty good variety of food, we thought we'd both go with the signature dish the Sloppi Jo. You can't go wrong with the dish that's the name of the truck, right? Eh, wrong. The non-traditional sloppy joe is pork that is slow cooked in their red chile sauce and topped with a sunny side up egg. It's also served with pickled onions and a tortilla. I chose to build a burrito. The pork was a bit dry and the red sauce surprisingly had very little flavor. The onions didn't taste like they had been pickled, more like marinated for 20-30 minutes then served. I expected my mouth to explode when I took my first bite, but that didn't happen. The sunny side up egg is a great addition to the burrito as it added some moistness that was well needed. The tortilla was outstanding, but when the contents inside it aren't great it makes for a very mediocre burrito. From a presentation standpoint I thought it was just okay. Value was just so-so as the self made burritto really wasn't enough.

Now the menu is diverse so I would like to try something else. Maybe it was just an off night or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. I'll try it again, but for me it just wasn't great this time around.
