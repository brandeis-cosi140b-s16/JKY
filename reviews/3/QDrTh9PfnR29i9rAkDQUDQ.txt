I heard this is a shoot off of Guadelajara, my favorite place ever.... They need to up their game at Francisco's. The tacos were tough and really just not the same. The food seems like there's an overdose of sour cream everywhere. Even though they are open until 3am and serving lots of drunk people, they are slipping.
