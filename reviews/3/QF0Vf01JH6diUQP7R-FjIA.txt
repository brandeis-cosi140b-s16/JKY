Food is decent, funny as I type that, I remind myself; it's the only Mexican or Latin restaurant I really like but that is probably because I ALWAYS order the Enchiladas Rancheras. They are quite yummy made with real corn tortilla, the way they are supposed to be made, not 100% authentic but but by golly it's close enough to keep me coming back. I adore the fact that the Traditional Corn Tortilla's are actually Hand Made!!! A Rarity! Believe me I know. Oh now though, the rice could be a lot better, also please work on your Aguas Frescas or Fresh Made Water, less sugar, more of a balanced  water to fruit ratio because my Agua Fresca was way more watery than nummy. Kitty out.
