Toto's specializes in Mexican seafood dishes.  They also have a Sunday Margarita brunch that I haven't tried.  Their tacos al pescado are nice--firm white fish, lettuce, a few shrimp and a chipotle cream sauce on the side.  The chipotle cream sauce is sort of like a lively (and much tastier) version of Big Mac "Secret Sauce".  It adds just the right amount of kick without overwhelming the fish.  The chips and salsa are okay--nothing special, and the beans and rice that came with the tacos were also just okay.  Service was good.   The restaurant is close enough to my apartment and good enough that I know I'll visit again.
