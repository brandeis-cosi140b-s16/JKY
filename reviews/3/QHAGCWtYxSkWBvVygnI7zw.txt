We went here after reading the reviews and wanting a change from our usual three amigos routine
The space and the service were great and very attentive
The chips were warm (always a plus) and the pico was AWESOME  
I got the carnitas de puerco and my girl got the chicken tacos
my carnitas were tough and fatty and it tasted like they hadn't changed their fry-o-later oil recently, but all the things that came with it were awesome, guac was great, pickled onions and other pickled veggies (nopal, and pico with beans in it) we awesome and unexpected.  beans and rice were standard 
her chicken tacos were very standard and nothing to write home about

i might give it another try cause the service was so sweet, we'll see.
