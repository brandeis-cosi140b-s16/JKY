Los Betos is standard Phoenix Mexican fast food.  It's no different than any of the joints ending in "berto's".

The tacos were good with ample portions of beef stuffed into them.  I didn't care for the Jamaica drink.  It had more of a natural taste as opposed to the more sugary versions I am used to.  That may be a plus for some.

This joint is not in my neck of the woods and I just happened to be driving by.  I wouldn't go out of my way to return but if I find myself in the area with a taste for Mexican I wouldn't hesitate to stop by.
