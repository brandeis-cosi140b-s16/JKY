Our server was very overwhelmed so our service was mediocre at best. I was so looking forward to fajitas and was fairly disappointed. There was absolutely no flavoring on the chicken or the steak, no cheese, it was just really plain. I will say the chips and salsa were great but not worth a visit. Overall, very not impressed and would stack this up to the many average mexican restaurants in the valley. Truly nothing special.
