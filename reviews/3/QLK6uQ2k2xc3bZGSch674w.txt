Go to this location often but last visit was not good. Food was excellent but the service was very slow. Took much longer than usual to get our food on a slow night and never got refills on drinks until we were finished with our meal. Plus music was so loud I could hardly carry on a conversation with my girlfriend. Waitress was very unattentive. Very disappointed.
