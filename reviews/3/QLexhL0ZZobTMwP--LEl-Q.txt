This location has let me down. So sad. 

Their portions are half of what they used to be they don't even give you a full scoops anymore. The last times I've been there were right when they were supposed to be open. They unfortunately never open on time it's always 6-10 min after they should have already been open. And they're still running around trying to get things done. I'm not sure if they're under staffed or not but some people are on a schedule. 

This very last time I was there they didn't only open late, but a lot of the food items that should have been available were not. They under served and from the rush they were in had barely mopped the floors before opening. As a result the lady in front of us fell flat on her back. Of course employees ran to help her and make sure she was ok, but if they would of gotten these things done way before opening this might of not happened.
