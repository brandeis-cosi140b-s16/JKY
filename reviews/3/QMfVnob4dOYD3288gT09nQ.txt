I am sure just about everyone has been to a Macayos.. it is your typical Mexican fare.  I come here for lunch a lot and I like it because it is fast for a sit down lunch... you are out of there in under a hour.  I always get their original Mexican pizza (not the baja one)... it is good and something like $6.00.  So while I am not going to rave about Macayos to my friends and tell them they need to try this place it is a good lunch destination.
