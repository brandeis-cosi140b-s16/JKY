The other locaton in Fountain Hills is better than this one but still only average.  I tried this location a few times but the last time I went I was served cold enchiladas with dried out rice in my combo, the beans weren't bad.  Yes, I mentioned the enchiladas and rice to the guy behind the counter and he could have cared less.  No offer to replace the food or refund or even a "Sorry."  Also, this location could be cleaner, the other location is always pretty clean.
