I don't know about anyone else, but to me, this place seems sort of doomed. Based on the history lesson we learned in the tiny museum shack, Tortilla Flat has burned down or been destroyed somehow about 3 or 4 times. Consider the fact that it was supposedly started by a no-good, ragamuffin, low-down dirty thief/murderer who lost his booty somewhere out in the desert, maybe it wasn't meant to last this long. 

But this is America! We can keep anything alive and running if it earns enough money! Hallelujah, praise the sweet Baby Jesus!

According to some mathematical equation, they've estimated that the saloon/restaurant has over $80,000 in single dollar bills stapled to the walls, kindly donated by tourists and lookie-loo's from Round the World. The town itself was most recently purchased by some company for over 1.3 million dollars. It was originally purchased for $11,000. 

As of today in the Year of Our Lord 2013, the great attraction of Tortilla Flat is the burger in the restaurant, the live music in the saloon (only part of the year) and the Prickly Pear Gelato in the ice cream parlor (which you can't taste before you buy). 

It also doesn't hurt that the drive there is quite beautiful. We did it on a motorcycle and had a grand old time swooping around the curves and passing elderly out-of-towners in their comfortable SUVs. 

Might as well do it once if you live here, but I'm not sure I would recommend it to visiting Snow Birds.
