I can only give this place 3 stars because of the staff.  They were all so super nice and very down to earth.  Sampled five drinks from friends being the DD and all,  didn't really like any of them except the frozen mojito and even that one was a little too sweet don't think I could drink a whole one.  They did say it was the most popular drink.

The peppers off the HH menu were surprisingly good.  Chx tacos way too small. I mean tiniest portions there all together.  The $18 tuna ceviche came out and there was hardly anything to it plus it wasn't good at all.  I did eat it though because I didn't want to waste $18 ceviche but really wish I would have sent it back.  Great presentation on it.  The guacamole was good but nothing special. They do only give u 5 chips to eat it and when u ask for more they charge u.  
All in all. I've heard rave reviews about this place and all of us agreed it's not worth it to go back.  Sorry sumo! :(
