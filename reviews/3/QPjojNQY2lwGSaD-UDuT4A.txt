I have been to America's Taco Shop by ASU, and I liked it. However I think this location is better.I prefer this location because of its modern decor and setup. More importantly, it feels cleaner.

I ordered the carne asada, chicken, and al pastor tacos. Chicken was my least favorite one, but probably the most healthy. The carne asada taco and al pastor tacos were on point. I also got free chips and salsa from yelp check-in deal, I appreciate it, but I would not pay money for it next time.

complaint: my vegetarian friend did not get his order until most of us were done with our foods. Fortunately we were not in a rush, but it's annoying. My review would have been 4-stars if not for this issue.

Overall, a good place for a quick lunch.
