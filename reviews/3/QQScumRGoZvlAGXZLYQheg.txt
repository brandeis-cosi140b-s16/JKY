Came here for the Empanadas. Nice cozy little restaurant with an area to sit outside if you wish. When you walk inside you see display coolers on one wall full of 15 types of prepackaged Gourmet Empanadas and other goodies. Several flavors to choose from that range from sweet, savory, and veggie.

We used are Yelp check in coupon for a free Empanada and got a total of 7 different kinds to try out. Also ordered some of the Carnitas and Carne Asada Tacos on the side. Love the presentation when they came to the table. The Empanada are packed full of delicious flavors and were very good. The chunky fire roasted Salsa was yummy and had just the right amount of heat. The tacos were also tasty although I have had better. Tried a Tamale also just to see if I was missing anything.

Ordering is confusing. They seem to be a little disorganized in general. Sounded like they got slammed the night before and were out of some choices. Maybe they could have showed up a little earlier than usual to get the place back to normal and tidy up a bit. Also did not enjoy hearing the microwave buzzer going off while they were preparing the meal. I get the impression that they are just reheating stuff out of the cooler which I can do at home of course. Then finally once we were are done they expected us to remember what we ate in order to pay the bill. A little pricey by the time you are finished and I was still a bit hungry.

I would have to recommend just buying the Empandas and bringing them home and reheating them yourself while enjoying a cold beverage. A-OK
