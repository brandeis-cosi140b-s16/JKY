Meh.  Not really fond of the place but the hubby loves it.  Close by and we get some decent coupons in the mail.  The family dinners are OK but I miss the tropical elements El Pollo Asada had.  The salads are mediocre and I have never gotten one that I ordered.  Always a mix up.  The new bowls are not so good either.  All in all the place is average.  The staff is not friendly but they aren't rude either.  The wait time is long and mix ups common.  It is a very average establishment which we visit when the hubby has a Jones for it and I can deal with a mediocre meal.  It is a shame because it is close to us and it has such potential.  I like El Pollo Asada much better and wish they hadn't been chased out of business by this boring restaurant chain.
