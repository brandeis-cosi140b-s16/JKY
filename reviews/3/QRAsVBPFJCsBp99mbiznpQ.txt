We actually found this palce by accident one morning looking for Menudo. The place is actually clean with newer TV's. We were the only two in the restaurant at 9 A.M. on a Saturday, so that made us a little nervous. My wife ordered the Menudo, and I ordered the Chorizo Burrito. 

The Menudo was okay. This was just a big bowl of Menudo, no meat, no hominy. Which was fine, we prefer the mixture. I think if you're looking for a quick fix on the East side of town, this is a great place to go for a decent bowl of Menudo . The Chorizo Burrito was also just okay. No amazing flavor. I actually prefer the burrito and Filibertos to this one. 

The thing that bothered me the most is they did not know that I speak Spanish. So they were arguing on how much to charge us for our bowl of Menudo. They ended up charging us the lower amount or I would have really shocked them and told them to cancel our order in Spanish.
