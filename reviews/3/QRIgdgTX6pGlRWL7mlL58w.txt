Potato oles + side of sour cream = heaven. The employees at this location are always nice to me and are so darn happy and service is pretty quick. I stay away from the beef taco, they are very greasy and just a weird texture with the meat, maybe it's just me though ;) They have specials throughout the week that change daily, they throw a flier in your bag usually.
