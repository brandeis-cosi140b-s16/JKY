When we arrived, we were seated right away, but there was a bit of confusion about who would be serving us, so after a few minutes the manager came over to take our drink order, which was nice.  She said that they were making more chips and that someone would bring us a basket in a few minutes.  About 10 minutes later I just went up to the salsa bar and got a basket myself since they had a full container of chips.  

A few minutes later the gentleman who turned out to be our server brought our drinks and took our food order.

We started with a pitcher of shaken Classic Cadillac Margaritas- Cazadores Reposado tequila, Grand Marnier, fresh lime & sour, and a splash of orange juice.  I was expecting it to be weak, but surprisingly, the margarita was made pretty strong and very delicious.  They said the pitcher yielded 4 glasses, but we actually got 6 full glasses.  Maybe they used to have larger glasses, haha.   

I ordered the combination plate, Rice and Black Beans on the side- $11.99 with the Shredded Chicken Taco- crispy corn tortilla, lettuce, pico, oaxaca & Monterrey jack cheese and the Mini Shredded Beef Burrito- peppers, onions, tomatoes, guac & black beans.  The taco shell was extremely greasy and soft at the fold, so I just ate the contents with a fork.  The chicken was good.  The shredded beef burrito was a little dry, but not bad.  The best part was the cup of black beans.  They were surprisingly outstanding.  

The BF ordered the Carne Asada Platter 16.99,  Char-grilled steak, roasted poblano chile and cotija cheese. The menu stated that it was served with a cheese enchilada, fresh veggies, and flour tortillas, but he did not get any of those.  The steak was also very well done instead of medium.

All in all, pretty much what you'd expect in Sunset Station.  Except for the margaritas, it was just meh.
