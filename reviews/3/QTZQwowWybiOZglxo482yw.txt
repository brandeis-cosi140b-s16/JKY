We've just moved into the neighborhood around Zabas and coming from the East coast we needed a new Qdoba equivalent!

Food: I love the bowl options and do the salad since you get lots of lettuce at the bottom. GREEN SALSA = MONEY and super limey like I like it!

Service: friendly and nice when I'm super chatty to start with lol.

Atmosphere: clean tables and "amenities" for customers

This will be a regular "spot"
