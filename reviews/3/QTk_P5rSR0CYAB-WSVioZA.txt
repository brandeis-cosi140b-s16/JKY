After reading the reviews and over hearing comments made by other customers there, I was hoping for 5 stars.  

Food was just OK.  It was not fantastic. . .but I realized after I ate that this is not your traitional Mexican place.  It is based off of New Mexican Cuisine which is different then tradtional Mexican food.  

Sopaipilla was just ok.  It was denser then I am used to. . .so I definitely will not be getting that again.  It was more along the lines of Navajo Fry Bread.  Totally not what I was expecting.  

CC Sizzle. . .that was the best one as the other reviews said.  I tried it as nachos and it was really really good.  I tried chilaquiles.  It was not good.  I normally love it BUT this one was sub par.  

Am I planning on going there again?  YES!  Why?  Because I love to support mom and pop style shops and because they have GREEN NEW MEXICO HATCH CHILES!!  =)

And after studying the menu, I think that I have a better idea of what to order.  So be expecting an updated review when I go back there.  =)
