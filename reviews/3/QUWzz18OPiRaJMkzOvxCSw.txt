Oh, Chipotle, why do you have to be so inconsistent?! I love the concept, the lime-y chips & the guacamole. Sometimes I love the barbacoa, but sometimes it is fatty & inedible. I love the convenience & prices, but I think I have to go vegetarian if I'm going to eat here again. Especially at this location the meat is, on occasion, just disgusting. I couldn't even eat my tacos on my last visit. The staff here seems under-trained & confused, but friendly. I want you to be better. Why can't you be better?!
