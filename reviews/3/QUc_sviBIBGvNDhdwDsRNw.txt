We went here recently before my brother in laws wedding. I had the hamburger and garlic fries and my husband had chicken tacos. The food was pretty good and they started the meal off with chips and salsa which is always a plus. The decor was really modern and cool but the only downer was the music was super loud so you couldn't really hear anyone talking at your table. This has more of a club vibe than a restaurant.
