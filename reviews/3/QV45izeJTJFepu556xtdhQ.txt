First time here.  I have seen it featured on TV with Guy on Diners, Drive-Ins a and Dives.

Atmosphere is unique in a good way that pleasantly surprised me.

Bread and Olive spread is tasty.  Made from Spanish olives.

Roasted corn soup  is the best I have ever had!!!

I order their highly acclaimed pork in banana leaf entree.  OMG, so moist and tasty.  Unfortunately, on the salty side, especially after the Olive spread.  I couldn't finish it because of that.  (I still took it home!)

Pork is partnered with mashed potatoes, fresh cooked veggies and tortillas.

Portions are large and can be shared by two.

I will return and get the corn soup but will try a new entry .
