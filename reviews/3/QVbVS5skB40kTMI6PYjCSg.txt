My friends and I decided to come here for lunch since we were all craving Mexican food. I was told it was one of the older places in the hood, so the atmosphere would be more authentic. 
I definitely agree that it's more of the classic style Mexican restaurants - big layout, Spanish style tiles, decorations, and a very old fragile burro statue out front. The prices weren't bad, and food was pretty good too! The waiter was also a tall drink of water, which is always a nice perk ;)
The salsa was especially good and homemade, yum!!
