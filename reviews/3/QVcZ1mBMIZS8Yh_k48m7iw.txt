I know, I know....you've all been to Chipotle and it's probably been reviewed to death. But I haven't been that much and finally formed an opinion. Modern, sparce decor with a minimal and easy to read menu is cool with me. It definitely is a step up from Taco Bell. Of course so is dumpster grazing for a chimichanga but that's a different story. The response for my rice to be served on the side was a quick "no, we don't do that." I was too tired to question, argue or even hope that perhaps little missy might learn to crack a smile when a guest is in front of her. In all fairness the cashier was deeeeelightful, professional, friendly and helpful and she really worked those hoop earrings...those are still in aren't they? The food? Hmmm....it's really quite good. You call out your toppings, skipping what you don't want and adding what sounds yummy. All in all, not the most interesting flavors. But solid and dependable. Not saturated with sodium and grease....and that's a good thing, right? I had the carnitas tacos and would go back. God forbid I ask for rice on side. Ole Yelpers!
