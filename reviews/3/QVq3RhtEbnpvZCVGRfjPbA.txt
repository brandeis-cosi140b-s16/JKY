Lets talk tacos for a moment... Alpastor, yes please. cut right off onto my freshly grilled tortillas topped with some onion and cilantro a little sauce and some pineapple... It was great. We also picked up some corn in one of the many lines to choose from when you go up to order and we decided to get it mexican street style, now not to downplay the alpastor tacos but the Mexican street style corn was the highlight, perfectly cooked sweet corn with all the fixins is enough to make you come back for more. The salsa bar also had some great options and I would definitely recommend the habanero salsa.

Now, lets get to the few things I was not see excited about.

1.) Pick a line any line- If you want an alpastor taco and a carnita taco it is in two separate lines and then if you need to pick up some corn you have to get in another line.

2.) Pay for your meal- Yes it is another line, It really reminded me of a college cafeteria, walk the line get what you want and then the dude in the hairnet at the end will ring you up.

3.) Cleanliness- most of the tables in the dining area had not been wiped down or cleaned and it just made the entire place seem dirty. 

Overall, Yeah i will probably end up here a time or few again but I don't know know that I will be making it my go to taco spot.
