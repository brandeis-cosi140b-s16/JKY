Very nice waiter, his name.. I dont remember! I think it was luis but im really not sure.. a young mexican man who used to life in new york as he told me.. very nice waiter! they didnt have cherry coke and he made me one handmade.. 5 stars for him... the food.. the quesadilla, cheese burrito, was really nice, real big plates!! the rice and vegetables, well the rice was too hard and the vegetables didnt really taste fresh.. so this was a bit disappointing.. my mom had a mixed plate.. it was suppose to be like an entrance, but it was so big it couldve passed easily as the mean dish... we took the food home in a doggybag, but this wasnt worth it... the next day we could throw it out because it was not nice anymore.. so this made me doubt about the freshness of the dish.. but overall.. for a weekly meal for nice rate it was a nice experience..
