So we just got home from Cali eating some great Mexican food, and my husband is crazing more!

So we find this place on yelp and decide to give Mexican food in Arizona a second chance.

This place certainty isn't bad, but it's nothin special

We ordered flautas- these are not flautas. Flautas are a deep fried flour tortilla. These are definitely tauqitos. And the chicken was super dry. Not getting those again.

We also ordered a green combination burrito- which we took as a burrito with green sauce on top. Nope. It is a burrito solely filled with green sauce and shredded beef. It would have been way better if there were at least beans in it. The meat wasn't bad. The sauce wasn't bad and the salsa was great. We will probably come back and try again. Especially since they have sopapillas and margaritas.
Friendly service and the food was made quickly
