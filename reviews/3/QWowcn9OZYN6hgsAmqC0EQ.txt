I stopped here yesterday to use a Groupon that was expiring soon.  The restaurant is a small area but quite cozy and pleasant.  

Instead of chips and salsa, they bring you a nice basket of fried tortillas and bean dip with a small bowl of a little spicy salsa.  You break the tortillas as you want and dip.  

I ordered the soup of the day which was chicken tortilla soup.  It was a tomato based soup with lots of cheese and real chicken with nice tortilla strips.  It was a thicker soup-quite flavorful and something I'd get again.  A bowl of this soup in the winter would be great!

For my main course, I got the Chicken Sarandeado, a grilled chicken breast with their "special spices."  With the platter came rice, pico, some guacamole, and refried beans.  This was another tasty dish for Super Mex.  

For dessert, I got the fried ice cream.  It didn't appear as if this ice cream had ever been near a fryer but it was good.  It was simply a ball of vanilla ice cream that had been rolled in a small amount of coating and then frozen.  It was placed in a sweetened tortilla basket and decorated with whipped cream, and some strawberry and chocolate syrup.  Mind you, it was a decadent ending to my meal, but it was not fried as far as I could tell.

I was tempted to give the place 4 stars but I had one BIG hangup with the service.  For the most part, it was very good.  However, I had just started to eat my soup when a server appeared with my main course and set it down.  Why do you do this?  It seems to happen more in Tex-Mex places than anywhere else.  Cabo at Red Rock was notorious for this.  Can't they do courses like a normal restaurant?
