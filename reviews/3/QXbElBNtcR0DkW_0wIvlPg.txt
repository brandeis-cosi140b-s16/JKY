The first time you see this place, you wonder what da' h is this place?  You recognize the name Jose Cuervo for tequila's, but then wonder if this "bar" even had real food or just happy hour crud.  They actually serve restaurant styled food minus the usual utensils made out of metal and ceramic plates.  Food was served on plastic plates, plastic cups, and plastic utensils.  This created a less than memorable experience, subtracts from it.   The food is decent but detracted by the plastic experience.  Most of the cocktails came in plastic cups.  The sodas came with free refills.  I ordered a margarita but was surprised by the bill which said there was a double shot of tequila.  I did not believe it at first because I did not taste any double alcohol in the margarita but as I got up to walk and then I realized there was a double shot.  The reason I came to this place was to look for an alternative to the airport fast food eateries like Burger King or Subway.  Got almost the full dine in experience.  This place looks to be usually packed, with servers taking on several tables at a time.  I've noticed it on a few flights out of Vegas. I don't think the food here is going to be outstanding to most people on their first visit.  I did not really appreciate this place knowing that there was still Alejandro's Tex Mex to be tried but after having tried both on separate occasions, I think Jose Cuervo Tequileria is the better place to go at the Vegas airport.
