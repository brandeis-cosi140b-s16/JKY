This is the former Super Mex, just rebranded.

The menu is pretty much the same. If there are differences, they are slight and I didn't notice. Same goes for the prices. There is a current Groupon running, which is $11 for $20 worth of food. That makes this place a viable lunch option if I want Mexican food at a decent value other than Roberto's.
