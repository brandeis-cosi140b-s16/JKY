Ouch!  Usually this would be at LEAST a 4-star review from me.  When I worked in Cornelius I used to go to Zapatas a few times a week for what we liked to call "Mexican Therapy" lunches.

I was so excited when my (new) boss asked if we wanted to do a late lunch at Zapatas this past week in Ballantyne.

We were seated fast, asked for waters and a chance to look over the menu, given chips and salsa, delivered waters, and were left there for 25 minutes.  One of the women at my table physically got up and got us napkins.  Then about 10-15 minutes later she walked over and asked them to take our order.  It was crazy.  All three of the waiters were sitting in the back (within eye-shot), but just didn't come over to our table.

So we got our food pretty fast and then were brought one check.  We put our cards out-they just sat there.  When one of the guys came over to fill up our waters we asked him to please take the check even though he wasn't our waiter.  Poor thing had no idea what we were asking him to do.  Finally we wrapped everything up and got out of there within 1.5 hours.

I still give this place a 3 stars because I honestly believe that maybe they were just having an off day.  Even my boss, who goes there at least 2 times a week said that this was strange for them.

The food is great--I always get disappointed when Mexican Restaurants don't serve tamales, but it's cheap and usually pretty fast service.

Wish I could've shared better news here!
