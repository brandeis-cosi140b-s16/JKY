Oh, it's hipster. Yes, very hipster. But it's cool and good. 

Housed in a vacated Greek Orthodox church, they've done a lovely job by leaving the stained glass windows and murals and making the vestibule into a small dining area.

Not many food options, limited menu. I got the tacos because they had interesting options...lamb and duck were my choices. The rest of the menu is kind of meh and overpriced. 

Service really sucked but I'll give them a pass on that because they have only been open for two weeks.
