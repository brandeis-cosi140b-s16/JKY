My wife and I stopped in for dinner last night kind of on a whim.  The place was packed which did make the service slow.  However, the server we had was bubbly, informative, and friendly.  She pointed out some of her personal favorite items on the menu as well as some customer favorites.  My wife ordered shrimp and chicken.  The plate was heaping with food and she said it was very good.  I had a bacon cheese burger and fries.  How else are you going to judge a sports bar if you don't try a burger?  The patty was thick and juicy.  It appeared to be fresh meat and not frozen.  Not the best burger I have ever had but far from the worst.  We also ordered a basket of onion rings.  These were awesome.  The batter is great.  

There are TVs everywhere you look.  Nice for a sports bar.  It is pretty small inside and that makes it cramped.  Could only imagine it on game day or later at night.  

We would go back again.  Not sure how it would be for children.  There were many folks being happy and having a great time at the bar if you know what I am saying.   This was at about 630 pm.
