Another trip to Nellis AFB, followed by another lunch at this Taco Bell.  Again, a satisfying Crunchy Taco Supreme with fresh and cold tomato pieces and Mild Hot Sauce followed by a Burrito Supreme that was a nice contrast of warm refritos and ground beef melding well with cold sour cream.  Quick and friendly service.

This time, not arriving famished, I ordered and ate reasonably.  Again, XXX-1/2 stars overall!
