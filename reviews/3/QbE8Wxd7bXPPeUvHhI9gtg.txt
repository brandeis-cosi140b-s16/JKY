The street tacos here cost a bit more than at other street taco places, but they make up for it by giving you more meat or other filling, and the tacos are definitely the most moist you'll find anywhere. Tastewise they're OK, although I find that adding a bit of salt wakes up the flavors significantly. And there's a good salsa bar offering lots of stuff to dress the taco with; definitely don't forget to add the pickled onions on your tacos or burrito. You may find a line leading to the counter if you come around lunch hour, but the line moves reasonably fast.
