I don't eat too much Mexican food but the menu sounded pretty good so we decided to give it a shot. Food was good but service was better! I tried the chicken but despite it's compelling description, it just tasted like chicken in tomato sauce. The chicken wasn't too dry, yet not particulary moist either. 
The seats were comfy, there was live entertainment, so the atmosphere was nice and comfy. My overall experience was nice, I think it's partially due to the servers being super attentive and accommodating. :)
