I stopped here with a friend who was familiar with the place and raved about their carne asada burritos.  The dine-in area is very small, and the few tables were not wiped cleaned.  Since it was a nice day we ordered our food to go and ate at a picnic table at a nearby park.  

As a sort of appetizer, we ordered a couple of mulitas.  These are kind of like little tortilla sandwiches that have cheese, onion, avocado, salsa, and the meat of your choice.  We got ours with BBQ pork (pastor).  They were awesome and just $1.50 each.

I try to avoid beef as much as possible so I ordered the mole poblano with chicken, which at $7.99 is one of the most expensive items on the menu.  However, when I saw my friend's burrito, it did look appetizing.  So appetizing, in fact, that I had to try a bite. It had been two or three years since I had a carne asada burrito, but I can't say I've ever tasted a better one.

As for my main dish, the chicken was covered with the mole sauce, and rice and beans were served on the side, along with some slices of fresh avacado.  It had also been awhile since I'd had mole and I was not disappointed.  It hit the spot.  

I know I'll be back here on a pretty regular basis -- whenever I want authentic, delicious Mexican food at a very affordable price. 

It is cash only, so make sure you bring cash.
