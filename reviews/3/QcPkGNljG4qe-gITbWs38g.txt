I come here regularly & the staff is great. The food however is not the best quality. The cooks do a good job with what they are supplied with. The prices are on the higher side ($10 for a basic egg & bacon breakfast) so you would expect at least good food. The portions can be large for some items like pancakes (which are really good here). But I find that I usually leave here unhappy with something. Either the food or the bus lady that mops while you eat or reaches over your plate while you eat to grab the condiments or remove coffee cups.
