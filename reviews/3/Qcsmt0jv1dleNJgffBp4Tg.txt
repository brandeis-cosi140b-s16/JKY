Had a pretty good dinner here the other night.  Wish they had a couple of different salsas,  the one they have is really hot and I like hot, but it was to hot, It would also be nice if they gave you a small bowl for salsa when you order and pay for the chips and salsa,  the tiny one ounce to go container is kinda hard to eat chips and salsa out of.  The chips were homemade and tasty.  The beans were really good and the fresh flour tortillas are awesome.  pretty disappointed in the enchilada,  the tortilla was really tuff and I wish I had a knife to cut through it,  also the sauce was not  very good.  This is a quick easy place to grab decent fast Mexican food.  Will be back for a bean and cheese burrito for sure
