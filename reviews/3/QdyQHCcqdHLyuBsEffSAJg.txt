The Maki Taco truck is in Ballantyne at the Brixham Tent every Thursday. Just so happens that I work in one of the Brixham buildings. So I finally decided to venture down and get myself some Tacos! I mean it is a Taco truck right? I went around 1pm and there was no one at the truck. I walked up and was promptly greeted by a man to take my order. I begin the "uhhhh" & was staring at the menu & I guess this told him that I was new because he asked "1st time?". I said yes and he promptly recommended the Hibachi. In my mind I'm thinking, "but isn't this a Taco truck? Why wouldn't he recommend a Taco 1st?". This immediately deterred my initial craving for a taco, because they must not be the great if the taco truck Isn't recommending them, and got the Hibachi Chicken with no mushrooms. The wait was about 5-8 minutes. As I sat down I thought omg this looks so good. Hibachi with cabbage and onions instead of the typical zucchini was refreshing. The food was pretty good. It tasted fresh. Nothing I got excited about thougg, but no complaints either. It was just ok. The white sauce was unusually runny to me though. Im a dipper but dipping in that sauce just made a mess. Then when puring it over the food It ran straight to the bottom of the paper bowl that they put the food in & barely stuck to the food.I doubt I'll be back unless I am really pressed for time. Not because it was bad though, but because I'd rather drive to better and eat at a place that recommends what they are known for.
