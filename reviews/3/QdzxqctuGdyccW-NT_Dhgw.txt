This place has a large range in reviews! It's not a bad bar but it's not the best thing in the world. Because of the location I feel it attracts an older crowd and yes even families. The food here is decent so I noticed quite a few people come here to just eat, on their special nights like taco Tuesdays. During the week it's an older crowd and people are there to eat, on the weekends the younger crowd rolls in and it's more of a bar than a place to eat. The food is decent, it's a bar serving Mexican food so you have to keep that in mind, its not going to be authentic. They have a few different drink specials, more beer specials than anything; unfortunately the mixed drinks are mediocre and are pretty pricey. The set up is pretty cool for they have a big open patio with a bar, a Corn Hole game set up, Jenga stations and pool tables. If you get there early on the weekend you can snag the back corner inside and it has a little private area for beer pong, Jenga and a little bar right next to you, kind of perfect for a group of friends. The staff is always friendly and quick with drinks and food orders. In the end its A-OK by me if your looking for just a place to chill.
