I had the pleasure of eating two tacos for lunch today from America's Taco Shop. Let me just say that the Carne Asada taco is freaking delicious and I wish I had ordered 14 more of them. It reminds me of Big Star tacos in Chicago...mmmm. 

I also had a pastor taco. It was pretty good, but I didn't like it as much as the carne asada...maybe because I'm not a huge cilantro fan, and that was all I could taste. They put a LOT of cilantro on their pork taco. 

I was not very fond of the chips or the salsa, though. The salsa was bland and tasted like watered down V8 juice. 

Someone from the office picked up our lunch, so I can't comment on the service or the restaurant itself. But I will definitely be back for those delicious little carne asada tacos. 14 of them.
