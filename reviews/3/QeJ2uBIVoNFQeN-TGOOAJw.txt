Ok so went to Armando's for the first time recently and got a delicious ham, egg, and cheese breakfast burrito and coffee for $4! My friends got grilled chicken and veggie burritos also very cheap and also pretty tasty for the price. However there were a few negatives about Armando's that definetly stuck out. First, when I went into the bathroom there were two cockroaches crawling around (big deal breaker). Second the food is clearly not the most healthy or made with the freshest ingredients (however that wasn't exactly expected). The service was ok in that; it was fast and we got whatever sides and salsa we wanted at no extra charge. Overall if there weren't any roaches and it would have been cleaner and better maintained would have given Armando's four stars for it's convenience.
