First time here and ordered the #7 a hotdog with red meat chili cheese and onions. I got the combo with fries and drink for $6 can't beat the price. The dawg was pretty good the chili meat was pulled carne meat I think (not what I was expecting) it was a bit dry but the fries were really good. The menu looked good and price is right I will probably go back to try something else out.
