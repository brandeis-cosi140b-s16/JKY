Friday night was a beautiful night so we wanted to go to a place with outdoor seating.  Had been to Abuelo's several times before but this was the first time we tried the outdoor seating.  WRONG!  A loud band and singer were playing in the small outdoor space that made what could have been a lovely eating experience into - let's get out of here, can't talk anyway!!!!  Why they would have a band in that small of a place so that talking was almost impossible.  Even the waiter agreed they were too loud.  Don't even remember whether the food was good or bad.  All I know is that the experience was bad!!!!

Tainted my feelings about Abuelo's.
