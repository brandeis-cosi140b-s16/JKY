Maria was super nice and inviting. 5 stars for service and ambiance. This place was clean. The rest room was clean. 

The chips and salsa were excellent, hot and chunky salsa. 

Food: I had the two soft taco meal with rice and beans. I mixed the tacos one with Chicken and one with Beef. The beef was carne asada on two small corn shells. Topped with pico. The chicken was chopped into cubes and was "day old" at best. It was not fresh. Topped with pico.

The rice was good but I have had better, the beans were ok but really lacked flavor. 

The "lunch" was about 10 bucks and I felt cheated. Maybe I am not a Jalisco style fan?
