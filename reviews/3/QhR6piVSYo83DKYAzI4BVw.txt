So my flight was delayed and I was hungry.  Very hungry.  After walking around the airport looking for a Popeye's (because we saw a sign for it), we gave up and ended up at Blue Burrito.

I ordered a Big Blue Burrito - a double-size burrito with carne asada, rice, sour cream, guacamole, cheese and tomato.

It was good enough for me to keep eating even after spotting Donny Osmond at the same gate.  I also couldn't finish the whole burrito, so that will give some insight to its size.

Really nice lady working the counter, too.
