Service is fortunately better in a bad economy. We had 5 check backs by the staff.

The food was good, and rice was done correctly. Not parts of it so hard it'll break your teeth from being in the oven too long. 

The margarita had way too much ice, and I felt ripped off for what they cost. Less ice, better value would go farther than all the check-backs. I hate to complain, as do most people when out to dinner. Just do it right the first time....
