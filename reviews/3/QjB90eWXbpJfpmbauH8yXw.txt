Awwww MAN!!! I have written a review on their Pecos and Washington location, which I love and obsess about during the summer when craving sea food. However, felt like this location is lacking that "touch". I ordered the shrimp ceviche and fish tacos and they were definitely not as flavorful as they are at their north town location. The ceviche tasted way too fishy, needed lots of lemon and salt and the tacos where just blah!  

The restaurant itself is nice. Waitress was nice and attentive, just didn't get the same experience. The people I was with also agreed as they have also tried the other location. I will not be coming back to this location, especially because the prices have increased but worth it if you get the "Islitas" experience. This place does not have it. Go to north Las Vegas location. They are overpriced for the quality. I give them 3 starts only because I know they have potential on improving, or else I would give them 2.
