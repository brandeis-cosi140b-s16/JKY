I've been to the La Fonda in Flagstaff and really enjoyed it, so I was looking forward to going to this location.  Turns out that they are not related. 

The family and I ate lunch there on Saturday.  It is a bit old, but clean enough.  The service was a little slow and not attentive either, but friendly. 

I ordered the carne asada chimi and was sorely disappointed.  It tasted like they added sugar...it was way too sweet.  It wasn't crispy like a chimi should be either.  

I tried my son's red burro and wasn't impressed with the flavor of that either.  

There was some good though:  I could have eaten their chips and hot sauce (not the chunky salsa, but the salsa roja) all day. Great chips and the hot sauce was very flavorful.  Their beans are also very tasty.  Next time (if there is one) I'll just order a bean and cheese burro.  

By the way, the meals don't come with rice and beans like most places...you have to pay extra...a lot extra.  Booo!

I was tempted to give two stars, but the chips and salsa were just too good.
