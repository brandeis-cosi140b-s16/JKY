my honey and I went here on our tuesday night after pre marital counseling class dinner, it was a beautiful night.
The outside was way cool, I figured it out it was the Santana restaraunt! Maria Maria .... get it , It took me a sec . hee hee

So cool , I had the Sangria it is made with brandy I have never had  it that way before, I had the chimichangas because I was told everything was pretty spicy, I only look spicy I actually hate spicy food, Flavorful yes hot spicy No!

So the chicken in my chimis was MUY CALIENTE! overstuffed with pinto beans but the delicious thing ,almost a crepe, its shell  was delicious mmmm. and the crema mmmm tasty but hot :(
The atmosphere was cozy, candles and great music :) seating spread out I like that, nice decor 

My honey had the fish tacos which had a sauce that was also hot hot hot, but he said really good besides that his looked way more interesting than mine but what do you want I ordered a chimichanga lol , we also ordered the guacamole YUM!!! oh my very fresh and super tasty, limy! love that.
Great chips and the service was good , it was not a busy night.
