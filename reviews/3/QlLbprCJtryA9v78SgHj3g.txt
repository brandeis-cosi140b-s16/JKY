I get that this is a Mexican food establishment but shouldn't the servers know more english than what's on the menu? I've been here twice and the first time was better than the second. I had a hard time communicating with the server on the second visit that made me feel like the first visit kind of a 50/50 shot that i had a good time.

The building also seems a little on the rugged and dirty side...really, REALLY dim lighting as well. I could barely read the menu!

Aside from the questionable service and quality of the place, the food is quite enjoyable. Try the cheese crisp!
