I met some friends for a late lunch at Pancheros Mexican Grill.  The line was long however, they kept the line moving along nicely.  

When we went to find a table, most of the tables were dirty, but cleaned one off ourselves. The food was good and I the atmosphere was causal.

The menu is limited, but the entrees are good.  The tortillas are freshly pressed when you order your entr√©e  and you can select your preferences as you move along the quick-order line.

 I really enjoy the chicken quesadillas and the chicken tacos.  The meat is flavorful and moist.

So if your looking for an inexpensive, quick, and filling meal, give Pancheros a try.
