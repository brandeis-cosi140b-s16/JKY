Went to Richardson's for the first time the other day after hearing about the place for a long time.  I thought the food was good but not great.  The atmosphere as nice but a bit dark for my tastes (to each his own).  Overall I guess I was expecting a bit more than this place delivered.

I had the enchilada plate and as i said it was good but did not stand out compared to other new Mexican enchiladas.  I liked the salsa a lot but the chips were pretty oily. I would go again if someone I know wants to go there - but it it is not high up on my list for a repeat visit - -  overall, the food did not overwhelm me and for Mexican/New Mexican the price was a bit high.

Not a hater of of the place but not a lover either.
