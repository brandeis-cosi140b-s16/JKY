Came here for happy hour on a Thursday.  Was excited to find out about their margarita/manicure combo (such a fun & clever idea!) but then I didn't end up taking advantage of it.

Had a couple margaritas (can't say they blew my mind) and tried some of their apps (tasty but nothing to write home about).  Best part was probably the salsa.  Mmmm. Love my salsa.  And theirs was good.  Smokey, my favorite.  And the chips were light, crisp and the perfect amount of saltiness.  Would come here again for chips/salsa & probably just stick to beer.  

Not bad if you're in the area, but don't make a special trip.
