First thing first, they offer a lunch special (at least the day i went) that includes 2 shot of Don Pablo and a Dos XX for $9.99.  as you notice no food is listed, this will also ring up as a lunch special so you can claim this with your business expense. ---  2 thumbs up!!!

overall I was not impress with their Taco's, I almost went back to the kitchen to 86 the cook after tasting the Pork Pibil (Johnny Depp style) .  Lucky for him after biting into the Sonoran hotdog I had one of my euphoric feeling that took me back to the streets of Nogales.

Definitely comeback for some more Sonoran goodness.
