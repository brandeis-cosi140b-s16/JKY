Not bad.  They had a great Valentine's Day special that we went here for, and the service was prompt and we got our food quickly.  Our waiter was friendly (they have been whenever I've gone) and the food was pretty tasty.  All in all, not much to separate Pedro's from the other Mexican restaurants in the area, and it certainly isn't the best out there, but decent in price, quality and service for sure (the Seafood Suiza is the best there, in my honest opinion, but all other foods are just ok).
