Kokopelli's has several things going for it, unfortunately the food isn't one of them.

Pros:
Next door to my gym
A minute from work
Clean interior
Excellent staff
Fast service

Cons:
The food!  The food is not bad in any way.  The ingredients are fresh and the menu boasts a decent variety.  Unfortunately I found that everything I've tried there is kind of bland. 

The salsa.  It just doesn't pack that much flavor, and on occasion tastes like cocktail sauce.  I'm not sure why.

I've given them a shot, and will probably grab some food there again due to the convenience.  I just wish it had a little more pop to it.
