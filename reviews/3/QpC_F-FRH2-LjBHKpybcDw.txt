Let me start by saying that we are regulars here. The girl that normally helps us out is always timely, and she is able to get my (rather complicated) order right. Tonight when we went, the drive thru was being ran by a manager, so I expected even better service than usual. Unfortunately, the opposite was true. I ordered my usual- carne asada fries. But I like them without cheese, and they gave them to me with cheese on them. So, I returned to have them fix my order, and it took about 15 minutes for them to remake the fries, and much to my dismay, the fries were disgustingly soggy, and way undercooked. It's unfortunate one of the young girls is better at running the restaurant than the manager.

But, I'm still giving it three stars because even after the many mistakes, I am addicted to their carne asada fries and will probably be back tomorrow. Great food, not always great service.
