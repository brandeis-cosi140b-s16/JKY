At first I was not a believer of the Qdoba experience... but now I am, this is a more particular review of this location as I will go more in depth of the food in another review. This location is ok, it has a very odd line system but it feels really really large. The only real problem that I have with this place is that the Whiskey Jacks Saloon is right next door and their line can go right up to the Qdoba door so you have to walk through a wall of drunken people just to get into the restaraunt. It is relatively clean and is in a great spot for a quick late-night dinner after being out on the town.
