I've been here several times for late night festivities on Fri/Sat nights. It's the new place to be in Chandler so it's still pretty packed after 9-10pm. 

I think it's pretty lame they charge a cover for guys after 10pm and they do have a sign up about a dress code, I've never been with anyone that's had a problem so I'm not sure what they won't allow. I know some of the girls I've seen there are dressed like h00kers, so maybe they just do the general no baggy pants for the fellas? Ha. 

After 10 they clear out the tables inside and have dancing. Pretty good music, sometimes its a weird mix and you are scratching your head on how to dance to the next song but still fun. Lots of old school fun songs to sing along to and just have fun. The dance floor doesn't seem to get to packed, not dead by any means - you have room to move around. 

Its very diverse, I still think everyone wants to check it out. Age range 21-50, seriously :) Some of the people in there are a little too Scottsdale for Chandler, no offense to those Scottsdale-ites. But seriously, you are at a bar that has a sand floor outside, 6 inch heels may have not been the best choice of footwear. 

It's hit and miss with the bar service, at the bar can take awhile to get a drink, but that's going to happen anywhere. I do want to give major props to Katie, our server the other night for taking care of our table. She was awesome and I was never empty handed.
