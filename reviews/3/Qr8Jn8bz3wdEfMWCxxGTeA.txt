People have talked about this place like it was absolutely amazing, I knew I would have to try it for myself eventually. And just last week I did- awful experience. It was during the lunch hour and it was crazy busy. You could hear everyone talking and it just wasn't too peaceful. It took 10 minutes for a waiter to take a drink order, then another 15 minutes to order my food, food didn't come out till 25 minutes later. The food was okay, not that great. I have had a lot of authentic Mexican food and this didn't compare. The only thing that I absolutely loved was the salsa. I will return but perhaps at a different time of day- hopefully when it's not so busy and will choose carefully on my order.
