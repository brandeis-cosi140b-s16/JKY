Went here last night after wanting to try it for a good year or so.  We checked in at the hostess stand at 5:45 and told it'd be a 10-15 minute wait.  We kind of were disappointed as they had a special going on that ended at 6, and wanted to get that.  When we were finally seated, we asked our server anyway just to see.  Quickly told that we checked in at the desk at 6:02, so no go.  Um no, we were sat at 6:02, not checked in.  But whatever, I'm just excited to try the food.

The menu prices were pretty average with other locations around the Strip.  I decided on the combo tacos, my fiance on the shrimp tacos, and a shared chicken quesadilla for an app.  Our server brought out some salsa and chips to tide us over (which was awesome), and then out came our drinks and appetizer.  The appetizer was a little small, but tasted delicious.  And my drink - a strawberry Margarita, good and strong.  

When our entrees came out, we were a little less impressed.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good and the portions decent.  But the flavor was lacking a bit.  The pork tacos were delish, the steak and chicken, not as much.  Fiance said he liked the shrimp tacos, just wish they had been a little more seasoned.

When we were finally finished, we were in good spirits and both agreed we'd eat there again.  Just try something different next time.  

Our one last little bother was that the server, while very sweet, was incredibly slow.  We waited about fifteen minutes before he even took our order, and then about another fifteen between telling him we'd like our check and actually getting it.

Still, we're big fans of Mexican fare and the salsa and chips (ohmy!) were so great, that we're still going to go again some time and try other items on the menu.
