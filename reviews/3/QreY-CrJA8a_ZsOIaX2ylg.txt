This place was just ok. Very typical Mexican fare that tasted exactly like very typical Mexican fare. I had the strawberry margarita too which actually had real blended strawberries - huge plus. The downside- almost zero tequila. I honestly thought they may have made a non alcoholic version! Overall, the prices are decent and the food does the job but it's nothing to write home about.
