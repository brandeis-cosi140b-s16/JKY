Just another 'bertos.

I have forgotten how long ago this place moved in where the old 59th Ave. Freeze used to be, probably 8-10 years.  However long it has been I have been getting take out at least once a month for lunch.  The food is consistent a good 95% f the time.  Today I had a #5 (shredded beef taco, cheese enchilada, rice, beans).  I have had several other menu items over the years also.  It's not great but it is edible and cheap.  My combo was $5.60.  

Because I always have somebody else pick up my order I can't tell you what condition the place is in.  Maybe I don't want to know?
