Picked Barrio Urbano at the yard for Mothers Day dinner, they had some things they were out of like the Mexican water drinks and the churro deserts, I ordered a red sangria to drink and it was great but when I ordered another they were out of it? So I opted for the white sangria which was very good, just surprised they'd run out especially on a Holiday,  that was disappointing but everyone loved their dish, although the skirt steak on my torta was a bit chewy and grisely. Took quite some time after being sat down to have anyone acknowledge our presence, I told one of the girls ,"I think they forgot about us?" It had been at least 15 minutes. Took another ten minutes for someone to come and take drink orders and a long time to get the orders, we ordered a sangria and two teas mind you, and again to take our order, at this point I was starting to question what time we would be leaving. Got our guacamole made and the few chips they gave us to eat the 1 avocado guac and waited at least another 30 minutes for the meal.We had desert, the tres leeches ice cream desert was good. Safe to say I will be back, to Barrio Cafe that is. Waiters were at least nice, but they seem unorganized or confused or maybe lack experience? Too young maybe?? I don't think it's a place that kids would enjoy and the candles are an accident waiting to happen. My daughter knocked one over and wax went flying.
