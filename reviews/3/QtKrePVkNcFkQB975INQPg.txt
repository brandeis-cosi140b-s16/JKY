I finally got to try komex. I had a fish taco, pork taco, chicken taco, beef taco, and pork belly taco. The fish taco was fried. I asked the waitress if it was grilled or fried and I was told it was grilled. That was a minus. The pork, chicken, and beef tacos were all ho-hum. Nothing special. Beef was probably the best of the 3. The pork belly taco was very good. Best thing I ate. Surprisingly, the sauces were really good. I'm thinking try should bottle the sauces and sell them. There were 3 red and 1 green sauce. The reds were super good.
