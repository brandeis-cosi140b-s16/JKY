With the staff shouting "Welcome to Moe's" every time a new customer walked in today, I enjoyed a quick meal with two coworkers. Since the Moe's crew assembles it right in front of you, it has a feeling of being "fresh" and "healthy" though it's really easy to go heavy on the fattening ingredients if you're not careful.

That's not to say that it's not healthy. Not at all! If you go with the "streaker" which means no tortilla or shell, you drop 300 calories immediately. Skip either the cheese, guacamole or sour cream and you're in even better shape. And even with the meat (chicken, steak, pork, ground beef, tofu or fish), it's still going to be a delicious meal!

Sadly, I had the tortilla. And the cheese. And the guacamole. It was absolutely delicious. I even ate about half of the chips with a small dish of medium salsa from their unlimited salsa bar.

Refills from their soda fountain and sweet/unsweet tea urns are free. There are also a couple of outside tables that are under cover from the upstairs shops.

A good meal and I would absolutely return. It's in the back corner of the plaza at Sharon and Fairview. Maybe a little hard to spot, but it's worth checking out for lunch or dinner!
