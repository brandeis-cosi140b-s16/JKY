Yesterday for lunch my friend really wanted to eat here, so in an act of almost unfathomable generosity I said OK!  I know I'm selfish!!!

The Wait staff seemed like they did not want to be there, though that has no effect on my review!  The seats were very soft and comfortable, though that will not effect the outcome of my rating it is nice to be physically comfortable.

The food:  Chips, plain, little or no salt, 3 stars!  Salsa, good flavor (better than many), too watered down 3.5 stars.  Steak Fajitas good flavor, better than some, 3.5 stars.  Flour Tortillas 4 stars.  The Pico was better than most 4 stars.   Vegetables, good quality 3.65 stars.  My overall rating of this place is compared to similar Mexican Restaurants.

I can NOT say that I am a fan (so I do not give them four stars) they get 3.25 for me = A -OK!  Though I would not chose to return here  would come back if I really wanted to join my group of friends who chose to.  Many places I would not, so that says something good about this place!
