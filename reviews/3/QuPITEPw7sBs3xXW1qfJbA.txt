I have been to this Chipotle a few times for both lunch and dinner. Additionally, my company has ordered catering from here. During the lunch rush, per the norm, they are super busy with a line out the door. The shopping complex they inhabit has a lot of parking, but during lunch time it is a mad house and it can be extremely difficult finding a parking space. Once inside, ordering is normally very smooth. First, you must decide on your meal - burrito, salad, tacos, or burrito bowl. Then, pick your meat or the new vegetarian option.  Next, pick your rice and other toppings. Finally, choose a drink and pay. It's very fast and efficient.  Great for a quick and extremely filling lunch.
