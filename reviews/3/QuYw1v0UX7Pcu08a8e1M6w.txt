Went here for lunch today. I've been driving past this place for a few years now, so was looking forward to finally trying it. It was good, nothing to write home about though. We had the lunch specials - I had the chicken enchilada with green sauce and rice and beans, my friend had the chicken tacos. Extremely small portions, wow. For $6 a meal, which ok is affordable, and true it's just "lunch portions", I still was expecting more. The enchilada was the size of a tortilla roll-up, like really really small. The tacos were also three tiny lil guys, like maybe only 3 inches long. The taste was just alright too - I mean it was good, but again nothing that's going to make me go back again. 

The service was good, the server was attentive and our drinks kept getting refilled.

So yea...good, but nothing spectacular. Maybe dinner is better.
