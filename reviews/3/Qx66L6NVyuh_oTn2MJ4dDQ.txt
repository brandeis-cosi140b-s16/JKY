The food is good, the fajitas are a pass, bland.  My wife and daughter's  dinners were fine.  my problem is the service, we ordered an appetizer and received it with the dinner and I ordered a salad that never showed up.  4 different people were at our table at one time or another and nobody could get it right. Every person thought the other was getting what we ordered,  frustrating. The bill came promptly and he remarked that he took the salad off the bill, like he was going me a favor.
