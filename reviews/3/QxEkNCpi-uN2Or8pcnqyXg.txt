Great outside patio, but overall the dining experience was okay.

To start off the server while attentive, was really not very helpful nor did she try to encourage us to try different things on the menu she was very ... Let's just say short with her answers to our questions.  I ended up ordering the mushroom mulitas. It was a very interesting - essentially mushroom stacked up apparently stuffed with beans and cheese and greens ...But all I could taste was mushroom and I swear there was not a pinch of cheese in the entire dish! which it desperately needed. I ended up ordering a side of tortillas so that I could chop it up and put it in something otherwise it just really didn't feel like a meal more like an appetizer. Overall the concept was there but it was poorly executed. On the plus side their chips and salsa was very tasty. 

Again, overall it was not a bad experience, but with all of the dining options in Las Vegas... I would not go back.
