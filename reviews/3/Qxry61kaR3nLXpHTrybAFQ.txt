Not a bad spot. We sat on the patio which was really nice. I read a review about the inside being very noisy, which it was. As soon as we walked up we immediately asked for the patio once we heard how loud it was. The seating was more lounge style and really low, it was ok for the finger foods we ordered so it worked. Service was quick and good. The food was OK. Our mango guac definitely didn't look or taste fresh, more like it was something you would get pre made at a grocery store. The pollo tacos were tasty but nothing special and the carne esada plate was also just OK. Overall it was a solid 3/5 experience. I would come back again and check out other items and sir outside on the patio.
