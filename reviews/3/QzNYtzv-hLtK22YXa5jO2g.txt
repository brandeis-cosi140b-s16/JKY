It was good not great. Service was excellent and probably worth an extra star but the chicken was slightly underdone and the breading was very generic - not a ton of flavor.  Awesome atmosphere. Love the jazz music playing while I sat on the deck.  Overall worth a look. I will try something besides the chicken and waffles next time.
