The food it hot and "globish" the enchilada sauce has a tangy cinnamony flavor I must have missed the onion the taco is good the meat is roast beef but could use a bit more meat. The relleno is tasty not much spice it could use the green sauce on it. The chips were solid good the salsa was surprisingly spicey good flavor an undamiliar spice in there maybe cinnamon. 
All in all it was a good meal.. filling satisfying and tasty.
