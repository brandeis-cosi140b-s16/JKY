I really wanted to like this place, and at first I was very hopeful. The decor is reminiscent of taquerias out west, and the service was friendly and prompt. Still, I mostly rate a place on the quality of the food and it was decidedly subpar. I tried three different tacos here: chicken, pulled chicken, and carnitas. They were all certainly edible, but the tortillas ruined the experience - they were tough and greasy.

On the plus side, the complementary chips and salsa were decent although the salsa wasn't very hot.

If I try this place again, I will probably avoid the tacos and try something else.
