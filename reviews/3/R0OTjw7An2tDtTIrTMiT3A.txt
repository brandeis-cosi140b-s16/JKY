If you can get past the staggering cost of the menu items and come during the off hours, La Comida is a pleasant enough dining experience.  None of the food has knocked my socks off, but I did enjoy the Puerco Ahumado which is slowcooked in an adovado sauce served with some smashed plantains.  They have a nice selection of tequila, but I can buy a nice bottle of anejo for the cost of a couple shots here.  I still think it is a nice concept, and with some tinkering it can be successful...as for me, I'll probably make the short drive down to Los Tacos or Tacos el Gordo to satisfy my lunchtime Mexican cravings.
