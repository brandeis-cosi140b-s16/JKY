Location makes this place the best choice for anyone that forgets to bring food to school (CSN). Was not really the best I have had at Chipotle, it fact, it may have been the worse, but I did waste time waiting to be NOT served at McDonald's next door (SEE review) after leaving with my fat burrito and then I had to walk all the way to Building Kilo so I can fire up my Smartpop in the microwave (just discovered that there is a micro-onda [actually two] in Bravo building as well). 

So yeah, it was a smudge cold. And the food as they were placing it onto the tortilla did not look as fresh as Doug E. Fresh (in the 80s) either. I went in the early evening, and there was only two other customers in the restaurant, so maybe a visit during the busy lunch hour would be a better barometer on the best they can do. 

Overall, the carnitas burrito with brown rice/pinto/pico/lechuga was alright. I consumed every morsel. - E
