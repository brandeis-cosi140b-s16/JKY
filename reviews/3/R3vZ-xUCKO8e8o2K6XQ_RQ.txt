Hot Taco wasn't bad but it wasn't outstanding either. I would say it's a pretty typical Mexican style restaurant. What I did enjoy was the atmosphere. The restaurant itself was huge and a lot of fun. They had great decorations and the way it is set up is pretty efficient. It's like a big open room but there's a dining area and then the bar area and the bar is separated by some booths. 

The food was average. I got tacos in lettuce wrap and so did my boyfriend. They were pretty spicy which I didn't expect because t did say that. And we also got a free appetizer from checking in on Yelp which was awesome! We got the queso dip which was actually pretty good. I couldn't get enough of that! 

The margaritas were stroooooong! Definitely recommend those if you like tequila. Overall not a bad experience and I'll probably be back at some point to try some of the other menu items.
