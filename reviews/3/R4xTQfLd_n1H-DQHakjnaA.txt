After seeing this place featured on Food Network, we had to try it.  It was unique, but I think it got a little more hype than it should have.  Definitely a hole in the wall and the food was good, but not outstanding.  I might stop in again if I happen to be in the immediate vicinity (doesn't happen often) but I don't think I'll make any special trips down there.  

Limited seating, and it's kind of like a deli for ordering, place your order at the counter then sit down and hope you hear your number called over the music.  Not the greatest place for picky eaters.
