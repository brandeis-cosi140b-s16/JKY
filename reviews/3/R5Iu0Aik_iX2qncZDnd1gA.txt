First, let me say this: so, so much more convenient than venturing down S. Park St. to Tacqueria Guadelajara. It's owned by the owner's (of TG) nephew, but the location is so much more convenient! Prices are pretty cheap ($1.70/taco) and the food is excellent. If you go at lunch, you may be lucky enough to see Francisco, who came out and chatted with us last time we were there. Delicious chips and salsa, and they came with free tortilla soup!

Oh, but the food...the tacos were excellent. Personally, my favorite was the pastor, but the chorizo/chicken/steak were all superb. I've had just about everything on the menu, and it's all great. Highly recommended!

UPDATE: Docking Francisco's a star. The food is good, but after going to La Guanajuatance? Francisco's is simply mediocre.
