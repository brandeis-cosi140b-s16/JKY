Went to Verde last Friday.  Sat at the bar.  Drinks were great.  Tacos were outstanding.  Almost everything else was bad.

They had taken reservations on almost all of their tables (Friday, ~8PM).  Trouble was that walk-ins didn't have any place to go, so they doubled up at the bar a bit.  The bar stayed completely full, while tables were 3/4s full; the bar got *pounded*, and if a bartender tried to take a (deserved!) break, service got much worse.

I asked for "no cheese", as it doesn't agree with me.  That narrowed me down to two choices; the rest of the menu had cheese, and it might be pre-prepared, since they couldn't do it without cheese.  The girl next to us at the bar wanted a corn tortilla, and they were out.  These seem like weird issues to me.  I know some things are prepared ahead of time, but "no cheese" is usually easy, and running out of a shelf-stable staple is odd.

The tacos (chorizo?) were possibly the tastiest thing I've ever had in a mexican restaurant.  They also were one of the two no-cheese options I had.

Other than tacos, the food was bad.  Guacamole, salsa, flautas, all had absolutely no salt, and very, very little spicing.  They tasted completely dead until we asked for a salt shaker and fixed it a bit.  The soup was an exception; so salty it was nearly inedible.  My best guess was that the kitchen isn't tasting any of the food, or the manager isn't trying any of the dishes, or something.  This was really surprisingly bad, as this isn't hard.


The mixed drinks/specialty drinks were phenomenal.  Kept ordering different things, and they were *all* good.  Best drinks I've had in months.


Worth visiting for the bar.  Hopefully the kitchen and service issues will get worked out.
