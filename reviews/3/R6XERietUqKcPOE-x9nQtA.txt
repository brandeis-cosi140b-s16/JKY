My coworker and I came here when we were in town for a conference. The service was good, waitress was attentive and got us everything we needed. She had a chile relleno and i had the spinach, avocado, shrimp salad. I thought the salad was good, it comes with raspberry viniagrette that's pretty sweet, so I picked some of the shrimp off to eat them on the side since they were salty. The salad was pretty simple and small. If you're going to get a salad and you're hungry, I suggest ordering something else to go with it because it might not fill you up.

We also got a fried ice cream. We split it and really enjoyed it- it came out quickly and with two spoons. 

I personally did not care for the chips and salsa. The salsa was okay, but thick, and the chips were very thin and broke easily. 

Mi Amigo's is a very affordable Mexican option downtown. We had a good experience with the service, but none of the food really wowed me. We could walk from our hotel and that was a nice touch, too.
