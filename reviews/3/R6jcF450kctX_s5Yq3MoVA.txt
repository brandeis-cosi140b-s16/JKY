I've heard countless stories of Senor Frogs in Mexico and I knew not to have the same expectations. The initial reception of Senor Frogs on Yelp has been less than stellar with a little less than 3 stars. Nevertheless, my friend and I still wanted to check out Treasure Island's latest cantina. Senor Frogs is clearly visible off the strip and is the backdrop to the Treasure Island Pirate Show.

The bar/club was relatively slow on the weeknight we visited. We had no problem getting barstools at the main bar. If you turn around, glass walls give you a great view of the Las Vegas Blvd. and the free show. Our server was quick to  bring us their drink menu along with their food menu. We skipped the food since we had just had some appetizers at Margaritaville. Drinks are pricey with an average price of $10 and up.

The drink menu is extensive and my friend had plenty of options. I'm not one for mixed drinks and I stuck to a Long Island with no sweet and sour. The bartender was fast with our drinks and courteous throughout. The bill for two drinks was about $23 not including tax or tip and we were quickly on our way out. However, we did enjoy the servers dancing to the music inside the bar and the pirate show outside.

As we were leaving, we discovered another side of Senor Frogs where it was much more lively. Lots of dancing, lots of balloons, lots of drinking. I'm sure if we had seen this on our way in, we would of stayed a bit longer, but we were ready to head back to our hotel. Senor Frogs isn't bad nor is it great. I'd recommend coming with a group or drinking a bit before coming in and paying their Vegas prices.
