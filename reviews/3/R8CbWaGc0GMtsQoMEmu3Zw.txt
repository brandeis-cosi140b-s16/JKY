Eating at Qdoba reminds me of eating at Chipotle' except a little more on the mexican side. I mostly eat there on longer lunch breaks because I'm never sure how big the crowd is gonna be. Another major factor is that Qdoba's manager comes by my work (a block away) and drops off 2 for 1 coupons, which really is a no brainer. 

I like how all the ingredients are laid out in front of you, the workers are pretty efficient and quick to choice selection as well. I prefer the soft Burritos with Carne' Asada and corn, some black beans, Guac and Sour Cream for a super filling meal.

At the same time, I can't see dropping $8 on lunch when I can get a massive mondo Carne Asada Burrito right down the street at Roberto's. 

But, the place is clean, The bathrooms are usually spotless, and it's usually busy at lunch time. It's twice the distance (2 blocks) from my work which deters me sometimes, and though I like Qdoba, I usually can't find a spot close to it to park with my limited time due to gym crowd and workers parked in the parking lot. 

I enjoy this place and will come back every so often. I don't believe they deserved quite 4 stars, maybe about 3.5.

Cheers!
