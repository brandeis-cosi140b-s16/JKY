I decided to check this place out for lunch yesterday, since I was in the area. I've heard a few good things about this place and was looking forward to trying it out myself. I ended up going with the chorizo burrito with crumbly cheese and their habanero salsa. The burrito was underwhelming in my opinion. It's a tad pricey, has too much Spanish rice for filler, and minimal chorizo. Overall, it was a bit too bland and dry for me. Also, I'm not positive the cheese made it into my burrito. The habanero sauce was tasty though. It was not extremely hot and therefore manageable for anyone who likes some heat, but I only got enough on the side for half my burrito. I will try again at some point, but I'll be honest, I went to Chipotle for dinner to get the fix I was looking for later that day.
