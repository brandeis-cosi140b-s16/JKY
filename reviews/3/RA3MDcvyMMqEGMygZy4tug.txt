Yelp, you steered me wrong. A place shouldn't get extra stars because it is hard to find. This is just mediocre food in an odd location. 

I had a shredded beef taco and a green burrito enchilada style. The taco was fine. Seemed fresh, but there was nothing great about it. The burrito easily had more cheese by weight than meat. The green sauce was better than ok, but not by much.

Now I have calorie regret and an unhappy stomach.
