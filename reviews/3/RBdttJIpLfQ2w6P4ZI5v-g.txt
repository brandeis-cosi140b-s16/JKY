Great gluten free menu...extensive options. Ordered elotes (grilled corn) for an app...left a little to be desired. Portion was small and taste can't even compare to mexican street corn I've had elsewhere. For dinner, ordered fish tacos which were incredible. Great portion size, tasty. BF ordered GF chicken enchiladas and they were delicious as well.

Atmosphere is ok, a little drafty. Cool bar....definitely a good spot for dates or plenty of room for a group. Made a reservation for Saturday night but wasn't too packed.
