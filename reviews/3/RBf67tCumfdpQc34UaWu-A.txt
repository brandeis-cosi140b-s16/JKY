I finally made it here! After my lab mates repeatedly told me Panchero's has the best burritos in town, even above Chipotle. Prior to going I have searched the internet for their menu and such, they said every tortilla is freshly pressed, by that, I assumed they just warm it up for you, just like how other burrito places do it. 

Boy were we in for a treat. We saw how they grab the dough and placed in onto the presser, and in one blink of my eye (quite literally), we have a freshly pressed tortilla skin! Next the waiter warmed it up on the hot plate, before assembling ingredients of your choice. Just before wrapping up the burrito he mixed the fillings up for you, so every bite feels even. 

I love the smell and taste of the freshly pressed tortilla, so much so that we actually ordered a couple of the tortillas, yes, just the tortillas, to go. What is different for Panchero's is that their burritos are similarly priced regardless of the choice of meats. I have to say though the remainder of the dinner wasn't as exciting as the tortillas.

As previous reviews pointed out their meats are less flavorful. That is something within acceptable level for me. I am not a huge fan of heavily flavored foods. However, their rice isn't something I will get used to easily. Instead of the cilantro-lime rice I so love, their rice tasted pretty salty. It reminded me of the side of rice I got at Popeye's. 

I can foresee myself going back, their tortillas are that good. But I will stay away from the rice this time.
