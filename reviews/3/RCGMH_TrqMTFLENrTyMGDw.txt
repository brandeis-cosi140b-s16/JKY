This is a great place for inexpensive Mexican food. My favorite is always the #3 daily special cheese quesadilla with rice and beans combo. Taco Wednesday isn't so bad either. 
Not like your ordinary Mexican fast food place, you can tell by the guacamole (which is alright). 
If you can skip Taco Bell and Del Taco for Roberto's you're doing yourself a "flavor" hahaa..okay I'm done.
