This was my first visit; a continuance of my quest to find the best shredded beef tacos known to man.  I did not find what I was looking for, but I did find a passable back up to tide me over until I do. 

The shredded beef was not bad, but the taco shells were not like homemade...very disappointing. The refried beans were a little salty, and watery, but did not taste horrible.  The rice was quite good. 

The wait was very long, but the counter girl was very nice, and warned me in advance. She also gave me a free soda for my troubles.  I was very pleased with how I was treated, and plan to go back and try some other menu items.
