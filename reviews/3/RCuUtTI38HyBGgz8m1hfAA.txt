I found Moe's to be average. I ordered a chicken burrito bowl and it was pretty bland.. nothing too special. 

The free chips and salsa bar are a plus as well as the outdoor seating. They also are very efficient, especially with a crazy lunch rush.

The main reason for my average review is because of the queso. It basically had no vegetable in it.. it was just white. I'm used to (& addicted) to Q'doba's. They are not even similar. 

I may head back to try a regular burrito or something different.
