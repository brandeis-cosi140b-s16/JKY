Hello friends,

I think I'm spoiled a little bit with my visits to the "Uptown"/"Downtown" Salsarita's. I ordered my usual. Nacho's with the nacho's on the side. This keeps my nachos from getting soggy. Well I'm used to getting a BAG full of chips, and a To-Go box full of toppings for the nachos. Welllll, to my dismay I got a Decent amount of nachos & a BOWL full of toppings. As in a BOWL. So I really had to ration my nachos to topping. Very disappointing. BUT, everything was good and nicely prepared. 

They moved 1 door down. So now they are not sandwiched between other stores. Now this location. Has the END SPOT. Which is cool because now they have the Outside seating on the side of the building. 

Everyone greeted with a smile and seemed eager to help. The manager rushed to change the lemon aid, once he was informed by another patron that it was empty. 

I'll try em out again, but I'll try something else.
