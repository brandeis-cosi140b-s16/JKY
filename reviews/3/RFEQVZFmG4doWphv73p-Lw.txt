Keep striking out lately...:-( maybe it's a sign to stop eating out. So, my burrito was fine. But my husband ordered the home wrecker with steak and got chicken! Even the foil had a big "S" on it for steak. Then, we got crumbs for chips...now, for those of you seasoned Moe's goers, know you usually get a heaping scoop of tortilla chips with your burrito that you can never finish anyway...but not today! I actually still had queso to spare, and that was the 2oz side! I know you can see and directly talk to the guys or gals behind the glass as they roll up your one pounder burrito, and my hubby should have said something, but didn't. I just told him to "eat it anyway...chicken is better for ya anyway". So he did. But the bottom of the barrel chips? Come on! I have been striking out with eating out for like a month straight here!
