Nice little place, pretty good food, really nice people.

A friend and I had lunch here on a Friday afternoon.  For $9, I got two chicken soft tacos with rice & beans, a drink and a bowl of chips.  

The food was o.k....but alot better with the addition of salsa from their salsa bar.  They had 4-5 different types of salsa that you could add - for no additional charge.  (The chips were free too).

The restaurant itself is nice.  We were there for a couple of hours and so were a few other groups of people. 

The owners have also done a nice job of keeping the place clean - bathrooms and all.

Would I recommend Caramba's?  Sure.  Probably won't be a regular, but would definitely go back.
