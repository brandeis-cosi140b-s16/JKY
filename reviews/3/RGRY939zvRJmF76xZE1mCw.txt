Came here with a few friends to just hang on a saturday night after midnight.

- COVER CHARGE? maybe it was just us, but the bouncer charge 2 dudes and 1 girl $20 to get in.
- Hot dancers! give them a dollar to get a shot of some flavored vodka! give them $20 with your phone number on it, expect a date with them the following couple days. ;) lol
- DD friendly. bartenders give free coke to DDs
- Variety of music. hip hop, top40, high energy, 90s...pretty much all over the place.
- spacious dance floor. not very many people danced. fun if you like to do some spins..lol
