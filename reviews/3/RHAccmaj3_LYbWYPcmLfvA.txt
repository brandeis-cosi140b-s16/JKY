We came here after an Angels spring training game. The yellow banner hanging in right field at tempe stadium that read "Dos gringos: A good place for day drinking" was convincing enough. Good happy hour, good margarita, decent food, ok atmosphere, alright service.. Probably not a place I would visit again.
