I come for the corn cake.  When Chi Chis went under I mourned the loss of my dearly departed friend, the corn cake.  Then, a couple of years ago, we stop in here for an only slightly extended work lunch, and all of a sudden 'Reunited' is playing in the background as the corn cake arrives at my table.

I can't even tell you what entree I order.  It's good, but, like, OK good.  My only request to my waiter is 'bring corn cake, sub all sides for corn cake... corn cake!'  One time I had a waiter bring more corn cake then entree.  I told him I loved him and left a hefty tip.

Ooh, I just remembered something I get.  Corn cake (kidding).  There's a build your own combo, and one of the items is a chicken flauta with a jalapeno jelly sauce.  That sauce is awesome.
