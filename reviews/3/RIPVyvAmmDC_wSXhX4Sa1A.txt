I first off have to say I love Chipotle! Good food, pretty decent price, for the new age fast food market (fast food that isn't a burger). Their chicken is my fave and their guac and chips are the best in town I think. 

However, I for the first time today took what seemed to be the advantage of ordering online. My office all wanted lunch from there and the line can be pretty ridiculous at noon, so I figured I would pre order then just walk in pay and be on my happy way. Not so much. I will say that the ordering process is great, very easy and fast, took just a few minutes then hit send. But when I got there is when the annoyances started. Our food was not ready on time. I made a point to watch the person that walked in right after us and see how quickly they got out of the building, they won, we were still trying to pay for our order. It was seemingly very unorganized. The girl at the register kind of pointed us in a direction where someone would come out from the kitchen to give us our order, we were not allowed to pay or fill drinks while we were waiting, and it was to difficult to ask any questions that we were too frustrated to ask for extra salsa. 

On top of that while we were waiting the lady that was making our food came out in the middle of prep to talk to another customer about franchise opportunities and how much their building rent was. **Note to the jerk off that thought it would be a god idea to pull the manager out of the kitchen to discuss business at noon on a Monday: HELLO!? Are you serious? Time and place buddy, time and place. Call Corp for these silly questions. Arg! 

Anyway, the food is good, but they really need to get a better handle on their service. A bit of a cluster f*** if you know what I mean. I am a huge fan of ordering online and getting things fast, but I do not recommend using these opportunities at Chipotle.
