I felt like I was actually in Mexico when I was there. The chips and salsa were great, very fresh, tasty and probably made there. I had the smoked Marlin tacos and my husband had the carne asada tacos both large portions and very good. The Margaritas could have used a little more tequila but not bad. Decent service, fair prices.
