Everything around my office seems to be a chain.  It's still good though and it won't stop me from coming here.  The staff is very friendly and they line moves fast... Try to get there around 11:30 and you can beat the lunch crowd (that comes from the IBM and Wachovia business offices).

I usually get the grilled chicken quesadilla and make it a combo with chips and queso.  

The manager is really friendly and he remembers you when you stop by... great place for a break during the workday.
