How did I end up here???


This looks like Tijauana threw up all over the place in here. That being said ..

CHow Chow- I had the Fry bread taco style it was good. Nothing too special but I did clean my plate. The bread was soft and warm and you can tell it was very fresh , however the cheese and other items seem like they came out of a bag that had been frozen. 

Looks galore- the decor is just madness , hodge podge of all things mexico. But the building is very stange too its part of a indoor mall that looks like worlds smallest swap mart and it was kinda creepy because everything was closed. and you park in the scary ally in the back and creep through the back door, i felt like I needed some password.

Why I would go back- The super smiley happy as anything, waitress greeting up super quick and was super nice. Food came out as we ate the owner greeted up and just felt so welcomed!

Let me wrap this up- It just like any semi generic mexican restaurant , so dont go out of your way to get here. But I bet it is always consistent with the food on your plate.
