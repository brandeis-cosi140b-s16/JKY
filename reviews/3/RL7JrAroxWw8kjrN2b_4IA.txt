The food here is good. It's not outstanding, or anything to write home about, but it IS tasty.  

The whole making a tortilla in front of your eyes seems a little kitch-y to me, but so what? Everyone has to have a marketing ploy.

I've eaten in, and taken out, and the burrito quality is about the same.  Personally, I like Chipotle better, as I like the dressing on their veggie salad.

My one beef (amusing, since I only get the beans) is that they were a little too light handed with everything. I got hardly any guacamole or sour cream, and that is really what helps to make a delicious tasty burrito of goodness in my eyes.

Will I go back? Certainly, if it's on my way and I'm hungry. Will I choose to seek it out? Probably not.
