Have been there twice since thet changed their concept.  The food is as good or better than before.  The service  has been way off.  Food comes out fast, but drinks never get refilled and we had to ask for our check twice.

Second visit was with a larger party.  Pretty much the same situation.  WARNING, drink prices aren't on the menu.  We ordered skinny margaritas and were stunned when we got our bills.  A medium was $17 and a large (ordered by accident) was around $24.  That really turned us off from making it a fun happy hour hang out.

That being said, still my favorite goto for fast good Mrxican food...and one diet coke.
