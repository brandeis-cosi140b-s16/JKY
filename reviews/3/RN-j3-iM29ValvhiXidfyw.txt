Day-drinking! Tequila! Chicken Sandwiches! Yeehaw!

If you're a fan of any or all of the above, let me hear you say "Yeehaw!" Really, let's hear it.

No, not really, you don't have to say it, but you should when you go to Diablo's. It's fun, loud, lively, and a great place to be when you want to enjoy the warm breeze and a margarita. Speaking of margaritas, I recommend you get one on the rocks- they're quite delicious and extremely potent. You will get drunk, which is good because life is good. Also, my group was ordering rounds of Cazadores Anejo shots and I swear they gave us a half glass full every time. Maybe I had too many margaritas before that, but nonetheless, shots, shots, shots! And to wash all that down, or soak it up, rather, I recommend you order their chicken sandwich. It was dog-gon tasty (and it wasn't the drinks...).

Yeehaw!
