I am grateful that there is one the mall now since I don't like any of the other choices there besides maybe Paradise Bakery. But I know they are still quite new and the few times I've been there they are a bit slower and prepping the food and have a smaller staff. Sometimes the portions I got were very small and had to keep repeating for larger scoops. But overall they its good.
