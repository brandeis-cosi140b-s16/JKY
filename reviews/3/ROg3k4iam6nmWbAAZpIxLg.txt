Came here with a mommy friend for lunch while our kiddos had a playdate @ Kid Quest.
We both had the fajita buffet. It was 10.50 each but I had my handy dandy 3 buck off coupon. Didnt order a drink since we each had one walking in. Next time I will have to try a margarita. They looked really good.
Well you can have either chicken or steak  for your fajitas. I had steak and my friend had chicken. The steak was nice and tender and had plenty of peppers and onions.
You can have beans/rice and all that jazz as well as a really nice salsa bar. Everything was fresh and tasty.
Our server made sure to keep our waters filled.
A nice lunch for 10 bucks for sure. I would come back again.
