Ah, Del Taco. It's not great (even for fast food), but it ain't bad. One thing I particularly like is that they serve a mix of "Mexican" (tacos, burritos, etc.) and "American" (chili cheese fries, burgers, etc.). So if you're craving a mix of items, or are "dining" with someone who doesn't want "Mexican", this is the place to choose - especially late at night after some drinking. 

My personal fav is the chipotle tacos. They're cheap and tasty. I'm also a sucker for their macho nachos. They also have good hot sauces (those little packets), but I often neglect to remember just how crazy hot their hot sauce is (and I like hot).

This particular location is pretty good. They never mess up orders and the drive-thru is fast.

So all in all, it's not stellar fast food, but it's a-ok and has some decent options.
