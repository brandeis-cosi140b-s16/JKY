From the outside this place looks as if it would be infested with flies inside and has a fat greasy cook at the grill.  I am happy to announce it was neither.  I love the look of the furniture in this place, which has old Mexican looking carved chairs.  They even added a jukebox full of Spanish music for your own pleasure.  I will start with the drinks.  Of course they have all of the important imported beer, but the best part about this is that they are cheap!!! Almost half the prices of most places, which will definitely keep me coming back.  I have always said you can determine how good the Mexican food is by the salsa and the rice.  The salsa was just the way I like it, tasty while eating it and spicy when you're done.  This obviously just makes you want more due to the fact that your tongue is still sizzling and craving that hot flavorsome liquid on a crunchy tortilla chip-- a positive in my book.  They even give you an extra bowl to mix both the red and the green together.  

Now onto my meal, chile verde burrito with a side of rice.  I love to try this dish at different places since most green salsas all taste different depending on who makes it, so different places meet my craving needs.  My burrito was ok, but I wouldn't rank it up there with the best.  It needed more flavor and definitely more spice.  Adding the salsa for the chips made it a little more enjoyable.  The rice to me was disappointing.  Mexican rice should be juicy and fluffy, but instead it was fried and had no flavor.  I'm not too much of a shrimp person, but my brother got shrimp colorado, which was surprisingly (to me the non-shrimp eater) good.  In the end the salsa gets a check on my list, the rice was a negative and the beverages quenched my thirst.  I will be dining here again, but next time I will stay away from their burritos.
