BIRTHDAY AT THE PRINCESS!!!!!

Chip and salsa!!! Keep it coming. Oh.my.gosh. The tortilla chips were thick and so crisp. The salsa would of have been spectacular if it was hot.

Very casual.. good vibe, the decor was western like.
 
Entrée ;:The Chicken fajita was really good says the boyfriend. And i got the vegetarian enchiladas. It was very salty.. :( I rather have the chip and salsa as my entrée.

:/ i hate to do this..but here it goes ... our waitress was so slow. Took her forever to get the water, paper napkins. And the bill.

My birthday desert was really good. :) mmmmm fruit empanadas.
