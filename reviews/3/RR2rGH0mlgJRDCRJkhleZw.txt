Abuelo's is a unique Mexican restaurant.  

It's not the "You're the only one speaking English authentic" type of restaurant.  It's also not a Taco Bell.

It's somewhere in between.  The typical mariachi-band is upgraded to Spanish language contemporary pop music.  The salsa portion of the expected chips and salsa appetizer are upgraded to a mix-your-own mild, sweet, and hot salsas.  I get the feel that it's a Roman-esque type of grandeur, yet it's a typical Mexican restaurant.   

My wife had the fajita tacos.  I had a combo platter that included an enchilada among other typical fare.  

As for the quality, I give Abuelo's credit for making a leap to gourmet type Mexican food.  It's a healthy step above the crummy ingredients and composition you'd find at cheaper places in town.  But it's also not Earth-shattering "ohmygodthisisthebestplaceihaveeverbeentoever!!" 

I was very pleased with the service.  Our food and drinks arrives without haste, and our server was on top of the chips and salsa situation.  

Abuelo's is a fine choice if you're in the mood for mexican and not wanting the typical bargain-basement type of mexican fare.  More importantly, the atmosphere and the service is what puts it above other restaurants of it's type.
