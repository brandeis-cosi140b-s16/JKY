This is another one of those border Scottsdaley all $ goes into the looks of it with giant tiki men and fire at the entrance to the giant fish tank with expensive fish in it. There is a pool table or 2 and a small patio live music and either karake or dancing wknds. Mainly this is where older folks go to cut loose, the food was nothing to recall the only thing worth going is their giant volcano bowl drinks but I wouldn't go out of my way for them. The bar can get crazy and it can be hard to even get drink's here. This place may be a fun early dinner if you have kid's after dinner this turns into what we call an OPH=old people hangout sorry Joe.
