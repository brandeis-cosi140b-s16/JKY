I can't figure out the rave reviews people are giving this place. There is virtually no difference between this and other hole-in-the-wall Mexican fast food places like Robertos.  The prices must have been raised since opening, because the #1 meal for $4.99 is now $5.99.  I had the asada burrito, which tasted good but I found gristle in almost every bite.  My wife had the asada taco salad, which was $7.00, and was not very big.  Overall, I thought it was a bit overpriced for what you get.  We were the only people there and it still took about 15 minutes to get our food.
