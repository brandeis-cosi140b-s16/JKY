This place is ok. Probably the most fun "in the area". I've come here and had a good time but I've never stayed incredibly long. The crowd is mixed but I usually see milfs and dilfs which is fine until they get drunk. It's pretty entertaining though, last time I was here with a couple friends and we got to watch an older couple go at it with lots of tongue. Although that was the highlight of that night, it was also our cue to leave. Another time I went here you could tweet the DJ to play a request, my bf got a song played and it was exciting but then they went back to playing annoying house music and drove me off the dancefloor. I would recommend if you're in the area but I always end up leaving and going somewhere else.
