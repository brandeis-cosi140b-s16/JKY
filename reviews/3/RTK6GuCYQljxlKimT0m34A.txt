We have only had good experiences with the food.  Yummy salsa and chips, delicious Bloody Marys!  Generous portions and fast food preparation.  This last trip though, the service was awful.  Slow to get orders, slow on drinks, no refills, and it was not busy.  No excuse.  The food however was amazing and the great cooks knocked it out!  Go for the food, 3 stars for the service.
