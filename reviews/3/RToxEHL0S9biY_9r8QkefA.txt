Every bite I had was spectacular - sure, the choices are limited, but I appreciate when someone hones in on something they do exceptionally well.

My main problem is portions. While cheap, the amount of food is tiny. I got 3 tacos @ $2.25/each and I got about 2-3 bites out of each taco. So, while cheap I would have had to spend another $6 to get enough.
