Had the worst and most ironic experience tonight. I went over to this place, looking for something good to eat... Well I decided to get a torta Cubana & the lady taking the orders told me they were out of pastor... Can you believe that? Tacos el buen "pastor" without pastor? I was so freaking frustrated
:( I still got the torta tho bc I wasn't going to waste 20 min of my life. But yeah I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.. Another issue I saw, was the menu they should translate it or at least make it understandable for people that don't speak Spanish and I'm not saying because of me, but because I saw a few ppl in front of me having the hardest time to order because they didn't understand what they were going to eat!
