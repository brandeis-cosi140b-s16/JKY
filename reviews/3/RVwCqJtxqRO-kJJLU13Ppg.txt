I went here last night with my mom because we were having a girl's night and we had a coupon for bogo entrees. So we walk in and are seated promptly, no problem. Our server is nice enough and brings us chips and salsa. I think the salsa is made with chipotles because it is spicy and smokey... I liked it, it's not exactly what you would expect, but that's nice sometimes. I ended up ordering the chicken caliente at the waiter's suggestion and my mom ordered the baja enchiladas. So my dish is this huge butterflied chicken breast where one side has chipotle cream sauce and one side has jalapeno sauce and it's served over mashed potatoes with just a couple little quesadilla wedges. The chicken was decent, it was spicy! (which was a good thing) but the chicken itself was a bit chewy. Also, the potatoes definitely tasted like they were from a box, if they weren't I would be shocked. My mom's enchiladas were filled with shrimp and covered in the chipotle cream sauce. She seemed to like it a lot, I don't eat shrimp though, so I can't evaluate it really. So the bottom line is that if I had another coupon, I would consider going back, otherwise  I don't think it's worth it as it is just ok.
