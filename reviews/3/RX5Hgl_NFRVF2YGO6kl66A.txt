Some like it hot. And so do I. But Los Dos Molinos wasn't hot, at least not for me. I have heard for years how good and how hot it was, so my expectations were high.
The restaurant is kind of small, with tables in the bar area (no booths) and patio seating. It is decorated southwestern, rich pastel colored paintings, animal skins and Indigenous weaponry. 
The menu is traditional Mexican, enchiladas, tacos, etc. 
We were seated quickly and served chips and salsa, one red and one green. The red a little spicier than the green. 
Our meals came quickly. The beans are refried with whole beans, not as pasty as what I am used to, but good. The rice was almost a little crispy, like it had been baked or heated in the oven, and also good. The main courses were good, too. Not great, but good.
I can have good Mexican food a lot of places and for a lot less than $40 for two people (dinner, drinks, tip). And I am still wondering what about Los Dos Molinos is so hot. I guess I missed it.
