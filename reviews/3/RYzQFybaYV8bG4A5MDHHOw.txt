The chips were very fresh and tasty, and the accompanying salsa and bean dip were also quite good. We ordered the table-side guacamole, and it was quite yummy also. The entrees were somewhat disappointing, just average. My rice and beans were on the dry side and didn't have a lot of flavor. The shrimp in my shrimp tacos were not very fresh but were okay. For the price, it's about right, but we were hoping for something a little more.
