Ok, so as we were waiting on an hour and half time for a lane at the bowing alley on Sat night on Montford we decided to try MRT. Menu looks good, place had a good crowd and it wasn't raining for once, so there were people sitting outside. 
The waitress seated us promptly and the server came by for drink orders.
We order chips and salsa, beers etc then our dinner. Food came reasonably quick was good but we had to ask for silverware and noticed a couple of other tables had to ask also. (Shouldn't the server notice that and bring it before we are server?).
Overall the food was OK, not as good as Cantina or even Pacos Tacos but ok.
What really surprised me was that the menu says the chips and salsa are $2 but they didn't charge us so I wonder if its free if you order food etc..The place was loud and the d√©cor is nothing to write home about but overall it was Ok.
