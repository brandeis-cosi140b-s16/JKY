I would give the food 2 stars.  I've only gone once so maybe I need to give this place the benefit of the doubt and try it again.  I got the carne asada tacos with the works and the meat was just awful and grainy/mealy.  The soft taco even fell apart on the first bite.  The place itself  made up for the experience entirely.  It was super cute (fun ambiance and decor) and great for watching sports with a small group of friends (Suns game was on when I visited).  The drinks are pretty cheap too and decent beer selection.  I love me some negra modela with my mexican food :-)
