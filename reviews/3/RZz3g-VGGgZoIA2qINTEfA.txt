This little eatery near the intersection of 521 & Ardrey Kell is a good place for a "fast casual" Mexican food fix.   I normally get a burrito when I go to places like this, but on this visit I decided to try a salad instead.  You have a choice of regular flour or whole wheat shell, then of course, your choice of meat, beans, and other toppings.  They also serve chips and salsa with each order. I tried the hot salsa and found that it had a nice bite.  I like the fact that this is a local family-owned place rather than a chain.
