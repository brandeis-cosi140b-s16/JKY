i've had good and bad experiences here.  food is usually good, but the service is pretty inconsistent.  never really got a "friendly" vibe from a server working there, and forget about getting refills on drinks, etc., cuz it ain't gonna happen lol

but, like i said, food is pretty good, and even though i usually get pissed off with the lack of customer service, i go back every few months ... 

price is reasonable, too.
