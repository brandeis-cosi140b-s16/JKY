This is a good little place to stop for lunch or breakfast if your in the mood for Mexican food and near the intersection at 67th and Happy Valley. It reminds me of some Mexican "dives" I enjoy in Tuscon but it's a new place, not a dive but their food taste like it's made in a dive, so it's a "new-dive"...  This is a locally owned place with a different spin on Mexican food than the usual.  

I've stopped by a couple of times and I like their breakfast burritos and their Carne Asada Chimi's. Their chorizo/eggs/cheese with green chili sauce breakfast burrito is very tasty and huge!  It's almost too much for one person... Their shredded beef tacos are a bit bland and they use shredded cheddar cheese (as stated above, they have a different spin on the usual Mexican food, cheddar cheese on tacos = not a good time nor good eats). Their salsa is good but taste and looks like the salsa at Caramba's. 

After you get past the overuse of plain shredded cheese and the stryro-foam plates and cups it is an A-OK place to eat. I will probably go back to try other things like their specials.  They have "Tortas" on special this week!
