Agree w/those who knock the service, girls are dim at best rude at worst and slow UNLESS you go for breakfast then it is a totally different place. The lady at the counter was very nice, appreciative, prompt and professional. Food is OK but close and inexpensive so we go occasionally. Won't ever be our first choice for dinner but good for breakfast burros.
