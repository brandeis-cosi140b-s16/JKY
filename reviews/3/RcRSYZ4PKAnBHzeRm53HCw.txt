Was driving around after doing some Christmas 'browsing' and really didn't know what I wanted to eat. Wanted to try someplace new.....saw Rubio's and ended up trying it. 

Small and clean restaurant. Ordered from their menu board placed over the register area. Decided on the Carnitas Rajas burrito. 

Since I was the only one there at the time the food came out extremely fast. 

All the ingredients of the burrito did indeed seem fresh....but as a whole the dish didn't do much for me. There was a chimichurri sauce in the burrito that kind of overpowered everything else. I think I would have liked it better without the sauce. 

I did try the roasted chipotle salsa from the salsa bar and found that very, very good. Nice dark and rich salsa with a chocolaty after taste.It doesn't taste anything like it looks. When was the last time you thought....."Hmm....I'm in the mood for some food that's colored black." 

So I may try it again sometime in the future and get the carnitas burrito without the chimichurri sauce.....but with the roasted chipotle salsa instead. That sounds a lot better. 

I'm giving this 3 stars because it was right in the middle of the road for me. Nothing great, nothing awful. I will probably try it out again but order something different than what I had tonight.
