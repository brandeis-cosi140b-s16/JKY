First time customer and came off the Yelp reviews. The atmosphere isn't the most charming for eat in, but it does look clean. The service was fast and the staff were friendly. They didn't offer a choice in the taco shell (just gave me corn) and also charge for toppings such as sour cream, guacamole and etc. The food taste fresh and good, I would recommend to anyone who just needs to kill their craving such as I did today, but that's about it. It seems like a mom and pop shop and I like to support local business.
