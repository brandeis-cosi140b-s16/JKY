Wanted to love this place having just had a wonderful meal at Los Dos Molinos.  It was just ok.  Even the decor was uninteresting and had the feel that you would find in a rest home.  I was hoping for more of a homemade taste and unique environment but it ended up being pretty much like 90% of the Mexican food I find--it wasn't a cut above.  The chips and salsa were good and the enchiladas were perfectly fine but not special.  Same can be said for the rice and beans.  The frozen margarita was just plain bad--watery and without flavor.  The sopapillas were excellent.  There are too many better options so I don't think I would be back.
