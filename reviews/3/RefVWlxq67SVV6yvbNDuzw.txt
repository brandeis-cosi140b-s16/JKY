It's a cute place but I've had better food.

I walk in and the place is decorated with everything Vegas and Mexico. From Elvis, shot glasses to Chiuauas, etc. 

I had a side order of their chile relleno. Meh... Nothing special. It wasn't bad but I'd had WAY better at my Mexican friend's house when she makes it herself.

The highlight of the night was the huge flat screen that was playing old school R&B music videos. As a big fans of eras past, we decided to stick around a little longer just to watch the vids.

Would we return? No, not really. But if we were in the area and were craving the cuisine, we'd stop in.
