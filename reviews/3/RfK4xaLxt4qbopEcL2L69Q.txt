I used to love this place until today. I just got off work and was craving a delicious meal. And I thought I would grab some El Pollo Loco. I also had some coupons that I received in the mail. However, I waited in the drive thru line forever, to come to find I got corn on the cobb instead of corn in a cup(which I was craving so badly). The lady asked me what sauces and salsa I wanted and had nothing inside the bag when I checked. But did not want the hassle of going in to grab some sauces. I was not satisfied with my food.I usually never complain about fast food, but really horrible job
