UPDATE:  Unfortunately I must remove a couple of stars after last night's dinner from Felipito's on Trop. I ordered the Chicken quesadilla again, and although it was still big and chock full of cheese and chicken ... it was surprisingly bland.  Same for the chili relleno chimichanga, which was undercooked and lacking flavor.  Overall, a disappointing dining experience. I will give them another chance some day, but I am in no hurry to return at this point.

UPDATE:  Returned to Felipito's for their carnitas plate and was quite impressed with the quality, although I did find some chunks of fat here and there. Regardless, it lived up to the hype. Felipito's remains my favorite for fast & awesome Mexican food in Las Vegas.

Best chicken quesadilla I have ever had. 
Big. Cheesey. Chickeny.  Mighty fine Mexican grub.
Can't wait to go back and try their famous carnitas!
