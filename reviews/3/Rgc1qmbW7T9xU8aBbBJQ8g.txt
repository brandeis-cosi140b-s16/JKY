Mi Patio without a Patio?  This gives you a hint of what is about to happen.

The interior is modest and Patio"est".  Patio type tables and chairs with Terra Cotta tiled floors and Mexican influenced tchotchke decorations.  Promptly upon seating, a silver bowl full of chips and a side of salsa arrives.  Things are looking up.

Next, time to order a drink or 10.  My first thought is how many places serve a small Margarita for $1.75 and  a large for $3.25?  I am not sure who did the business plan for this place, but generally bars do not use drinks as the loss leader. Shh, don't tell anyone OK?  The large was a healthy size and I am surprised it did not come with a beta fish, so I had two !

Sipping on cheap margaritas helped wash down the somewhat stale tasting chips.  Maybe I am just use to super crisp chips, but the salsa did help with the overall experience.

I ordered the two chicken taco combo with rice and beans ( I always order with double rice and no beans and they accommodated that).  I have to admit, the chicken tacos were stuffed like a Thanksgiving turkey with plenty of chicken, cheese and lettuce.  I was happy with this result and could barely finish.

Overall a good meal, a very solid showing for the patio-less patio place.
