Husband and I came in on a Wednesday at 8 to place a to-go order. We had quite a bit of sticker shock with the prices. Most plates ranged from $17-21. We went ahead and ordered two a la carte burritos hoping it would be worth it/generously portioned/something to justify the prices. Hostess was friendly and the food came out not particularly speedy but not slow enough to complain, and they did get our order correct (no easy feat, I am a picky eater.) The food itself however was average at best. The chile colorado was a little bland and tough, and was the ONLY thing in the burrito. Definitely would not have been worth paying full-plate prices. In fact I think I've had better tasting burritos for much less elsewhere. Overall the place is OK, but we are going to keep looking for our Mexican "spot.:
