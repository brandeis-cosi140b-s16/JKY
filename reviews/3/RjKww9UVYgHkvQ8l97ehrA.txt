Went to pinches last night. The carne asada is sooo good. We had eaten somewhere else already, but my husband wanted to try the tacos here. Has a bite of one of his carne asada tacos and wanted more. So we ordered a carne asada burrito. Great combination of ingredients, and the tortillas taste amazing.  Only disappointment was when I ordered potato and cheese taquitos, they poured salsa all over the top, when I asked for guacamole instead. So they were nice enough to remake them (I also tipped them extra for remaking them), but then all I got was potato taquitos with no cheese, no sour cream, OR guacamole. So I had two potato taquitos with a container of salsa. Really annoying that they got it even more wrong the second time. I was really nice about the mistake too, and thought I'd made myself pretty clear in what I wanted.
