Located in a popular apartment complex, so parking can become tricky. Their  chips and nachos are good, but the rest of the food can be bland. Unlike Chipotle, they offer free guacamole with any entree. 

This location doesn't have the fancy Coke machine like the Cotswold location, so beverage options are limited. They have a full bar, but I've never seen a person with alcoholic beverages in here.
