The menu is the same as Tacos Atoyac. There might be a few differences but my favorites are still available. I'm a fan of the carne asada tacos and possibly the best molote I've ever had. There is something off about the food now but I can't put my finger on it. Lower quality possibly? If you liked it before, you'll like it now though. Same flavors.

My review is for the service. Now that Dan is gone, no one greets you with a smile or friendly small talk. In fact, there's a language barrier. Not a big deal as long as my order is right and I know enough Spanish to get by but I miss getting acknowledged and thanked as I walk out the door. I'd say the customer service is down right bad now and I wouldn't doubt that the new (old?) owner doesn't really care. Bummer. 

Plus side, the a/c seems to work now!
