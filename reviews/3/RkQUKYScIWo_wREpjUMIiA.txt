Great Idea and cheap prices.  The food was surprisingly good as well, and you get a lot of it.   I would definitely recommend checking out the place if you have never been there.  i do however think that the food quality was lacking a little, and the restaurant was empty.  A little more care in their implementation of the concept and this place could be 5* quality.
