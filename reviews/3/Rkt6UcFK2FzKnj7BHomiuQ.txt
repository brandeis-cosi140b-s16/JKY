Service was very friendly. They gave us samples of their various meats since it was our first time there. They had a large selection and all of them were yummy! My husband  said the burger was excellent. On a future trip I tried the burger and thought it was decent but much prefer their Mexican food. The mesquite flavor really brought out the flavor of the fresh meat. Several sauces to choose from to go on your salad, burrito, taco or whatever you choose. Good spot with good prices. Over time and multiple visits, we found that there isn't consistency of food and flavors.
