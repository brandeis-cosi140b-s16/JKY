When we pulled up I almost made my husband turn around & take me somewhere else...it looked crazy sketchy.  We went & ordered at the window & sat outside (only seating there is) our food came out very quickly. I ordered a chicken chimichanga with green sauce, it was full of onions & the green sauce was just salsa, I was expecting some kind of chile sauce.  As I got to the middle of the chimi, it was very cold on the inside, as in, not cooked. Weird. The beans & rice were SO good, though! My husband wants to come back & try something else, I'm not too sure yet how I feel about it.
