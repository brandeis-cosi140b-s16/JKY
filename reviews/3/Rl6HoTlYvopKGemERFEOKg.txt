We began this dinner with an excellent smooth mild Bean Dip, followed by good tableside guac.  But the Tortilla Chips were very salty.  Albondigas Soup was hearty and filling with very good, nicely formed meatballs.  

I ordered 1 Ground Beef Taco and 1 Shredded Beef Taco  but received 2 Groud Beef Tacos.  They were very good tacos but Americanized crisp tacos deep-fried in metal slots.

Things were off on service this night.  Restaurant staff seemed so overwhelmed by the turnout that the chef himself brought out some of our completed dishes, and I had to ask three times for butter for my specially ordered Flour Tortillas.  My party of four dined on a Wednesday night, but apparently the Speedway crowd contributed to a full house in the early evening.

I will still frequent this establishment.  It is close to where I  often reside, and the food is consistent and sound, if not the service.
