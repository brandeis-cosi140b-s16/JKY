I would give it 4 stars if the West Side location had a salsa bar like the original East Side Tex Tubb's. The black bean soup is hearty and good for the thousands of cold winter days in Madison. Try every type of taco at least once. My favorites are the veggie and grilled mahi mahi. Saturday and Sunday breakfast burritos are good after a late night out.
