Although this little hole in the wall is a good, genuine Mexican style caf√©, the quality of the food varies from night to night. We went there five times and each time the food changed from the time before. The first experience was okay - the food was what other yelpers said - genuine, decent quality, etc. 

The following visits weren't all they could have been - everything from a pair of couples making out in the parking lot while loud music played to the couple who were most DEFINITELY fighting to the almost collision which we were witness to while waiting for our food.

I tried the pollo fun dido and my boyfriend had the combo platter with taco, enchilada, and tostada. The food was hot, fresh, and had that "Mexican" flair/flavor to it, as advertised. 

On another trip, I had the carne asada fries and he had the same combo platter with something small on the side. LOTS of food - the portions are very generous for the prices so no complaint there. 

Different night, different menu choices - I tried the shredded beef chimichanga with rice and beans - we added chips once or twice - everything was edible, nothing went to waste.

Any suggestions I may have? Perhaps longer hours on Friday and Saturday nights - you know, for us late night noshers. They close at 10 pm most nights and at 8 on Sunday. I appreciate the desire to take only cash for transactions, but I think this is probably a crimp in some people's ability to pay - not everyone carries cash! However that being said, the bookkeeper in me sees a lot of issues with the cash method. 

We give them 3 stars because they aren't terrible but they sure don't compare to our beloved La Canasta down the way on 7th Ave.
