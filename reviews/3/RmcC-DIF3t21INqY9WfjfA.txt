Happy hour small plates are the way to go. Good value at $5 per plate and good tasting. We returned for dinner and it was underwhelming. I got the skewers and watch the cook throw them on the grill and them proceed to get torched by the flames. My girlfriend got a Mexican platter and her burrito was cold in the middle and the tamale was not that good.
