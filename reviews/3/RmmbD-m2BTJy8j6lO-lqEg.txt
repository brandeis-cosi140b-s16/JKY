i've never had al pastor like that in my life. i got an al pastor burrito w/ everything. overall my burrito was good but there was something up with that pastor. i think it was good, i'm not sure though. i might need to go back and try it again soon, haw! the rice stood out to me as the best part for sure. the guacamole was bad but not so bad i couldn't enjoy the burrito, i'll just skip it next time. they have a really good salsa bar with two reds, two greens and a big vat of sauteed onions. also, i saw a lot of people eating tortas. i'll be back.
