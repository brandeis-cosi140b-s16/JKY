I am now updating my review of Burrito Drive, as they seemed to have improved their ability to deliver the items purchased. In fact, their delivery service now seems pretty fast, and the food is better. The grilled chicken has a delicious char, the local bacon is caramelized and rich, and the burritos seem better composed than they once were.  Their guacamole is also wonderful, if a little overpriced.

I stand by my previous statement regarding their so called "Golden Rod Tres Leches,"  which is an atrocity against mankind, composed of three frozen twinkies swimming in melted whipped cream and condensed milk.  Stick to the burritos.
