Alright Tempe-dwelling college students, listen up! Mexican delivery! I was friggin' fascinated when I realized that I could sit on my rump and order delicious machaca and chips and salsa. Now, I'll be the first to admit that if you're willing to travel a little bit there are a bunch of great Mexican joints in the area, but c'mon now...delivery is sweet! There isn't too much to say about this place so I'll keep things short. If you're craving greasy, salty and filling Mexican munchies, and you're a bit too lit to drive, gives this place a try.
