*The seafood here is really good. I know I've had better though. I did not like the fish civiche tostada... so stay clear of that. But everything else is awesome.
*Almost always busy, the wait time to be seated could be a while but people still wait. You can tell the employees want to get their customers seated as quickly as possible.
*There's live mariachi playing so this is no place to have an extensive conversation with someone... it is however, great for charades and miming. More like a big happy family eatery.
*The waitress we had would take a bit, but that just may be because of how busy it was when we went (Sunday). They did take our drink and food order quickly.
*Food presentation is fantastic, they use different kinds of platters, bowls and even a big Mexican mortar is used to serve some dishes.
