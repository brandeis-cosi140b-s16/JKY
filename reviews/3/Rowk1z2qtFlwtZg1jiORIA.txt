Per the suggestion of a friend, we stopped at Cinco for dinner on a recent Sunday. I was surprised to see that the restaurant was almost full with only two tables open and several large parties with children. Cinco is very kid friendly. We started our meal with guacamole and salsa. I was a bit taken aback by the fact that you have to pay for chips and salsa. I always feel nickeled and dimed when I have to pay for bread or chips. The guac was extremely bland. It tasted like it onl contained two ingredients, avocado and a ridiculous amount of lime. I had about three bites and left the rest on the table. I then ordered the ciudad due mexico-seasoned pork topped with pineapple, onions, cilantro and salsa with a side of rice and beans. I opted for no onions and somehow ended up without salsa as well. Good thing we had some on the table. I thoroughly enjoyed their tortillas- soft and flaky- but the actual taco was not what I was expecting. The pork and the pineapple were mixed together in the sesoning. The only way I can explain this is that they mixture was prepared earlier in the day or possibly earlier in the week and was warmed up and placed in my tortillas. I understand that slow roasting takes time and am fully on board with the meat being prepared ahead of time. However, I felt that adding the pineapple to the mixture masked the taste of the pineapple. As I was biting the tao, I was unsure if the chunks I was gnawing on were of pork or pineapple. They both tasted the same. This dish could have been much better had they added the pinpple on top of the meat prior to serving. All in all, I do not think that I will head back to Cinco.
