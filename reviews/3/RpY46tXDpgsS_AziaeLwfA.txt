2 stars for the food, +1 star for the ambiance & service :) 

Having said that, they put cheese on EVERYTHING.... luckily they didn't douse the drinks, lol! 
I don't know, when it comes to real Mexican food, I'm a purist :)
If you're going to put cheese on something then let it be an authentic Mexican cheese! I don't like my food smothered in Jack, American or any other Velveta like substance :(  Now, I'm sure that if you ask for no cheese they will oblige! Learn from my mistakes :) 

The machaca I salvaged from beneath the layer of cheese was good.
 
I did not want the rice & beans (don't judge me) so the waiter asked if I wanted a salad instead. I said YES, & could it have avocados? Oh yeah! 
I did get my salad. Iceberg lettuce, little tomato & about 3 slices of avocado. I ate the avocado & when my bill came realized that although I did not get rice & beans my meal was priced the same AND I was charged extra for the avocado. I paid it, but I don't think I'll do that again. 

I did not have any alcoholic beverages, just coffee, & that was not great either.
