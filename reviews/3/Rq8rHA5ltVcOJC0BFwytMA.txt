It was late....I was tired...the flight in from Dallas was kinda bumpy and long, but the thought of some non Tex-Mex mexican food brought me and a couple of friends to La Fonda. It's a small joint located at the end of a small strip mall area. One of my compadres, Ray, is a regular and the hostess greeted us warmly and joked with Ray as she walked us to our table.

La Fonda's looks functional and minimalistic. There are no velvet paintings of bull fighters or senoritas with way too much eye makeup in here, but then again, velvet paintings are overrated. 

The chips were huge. The chips were hot. The chips totally rocked. I am not a huge salsa fan, but found their particular mix to be notably tasty. I ordered the Martguerita Chicken and while the portions of chicken were large, it was a bit on the dry side. The rice and beans that accompanied it were good, but not great. The impressive dish was the Supreme Nachos that Ray ordered. The plate was almost as big as he was and the goodies had to have weighed at least five pounds. Not surprisingly, he ate the WHOLE thing. 

Overall, La Fonda's delivered decent food at a decent price; however, our waitress (who apparently was the owner's daughter) appeared to have never waited on tables before. No drink refills without having to ask multiple times; no chip refills (another waitress got those for us); did not clear the dishes, and in general was just not good waitress material. Perhaps they were short staffed that night and she was drafted unwillingly into the position. Whatever the reason, it was a detriment to the meal. I do have to throw out a caveat here - the other waitresses seemed very attentive, friendly and professional as they bustled around the restaurant. It appears that we just happened to draw the short stick that night.
