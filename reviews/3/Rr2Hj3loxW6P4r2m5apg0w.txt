First time here.  The salsa bar was great.  Huge variety of salsa.  Service was good little slow at times.   But we got what we ordered. I had the three combo.shredded beef taco, cheese enchilada and Chili relleno.  Taco was awesome but next time I will try the ground beef. The shredded was big chunks so it got messy.  The enchilada was excellent. The relleno was a bit too greasy for my taste.   All in all it was a great meal presentation was lacking but the door was good.
