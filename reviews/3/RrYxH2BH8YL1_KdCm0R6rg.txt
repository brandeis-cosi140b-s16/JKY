A friend and I met another group here for a pre-cocktail get-together before we headed to a concert at another hotel.

We started with drinks, which were made just fine...nothing to write home about, but no solid complaints either.  Actually, one thing that bugged me was that the margaritas were served in plastic cups rather than margarita glasses or even regular cocktail glasses.  For an establishment located on the strip, I kind of expect more.

For food, two of us took part in the two dollar taco special while myself and another of our group split the Queso Fundido and an order of the chicken tenders.  The chicken tenders were very good.  Not too meaty and not too breaded, served with either barbecue sauce or ranch dressing.  The Queso Fundido, however, wasn't that good.  The flavor was all there, but the consistency was gritty, almost like the cheese either went bad or hadn't been melted properly.  We didn't finish that dish because of that very reason.

I think the only other reason why this restaurant isn't getting more than three stars is the service.  It was lacking.  Our waitress barely came to check on us, so we'd ask a passing server for something and she'd make a big announcement about how she had to find our server first.  I don't care how my request gets done just so long as it gets done.

I'd probably only go back if I were staying in Bally's and didn't want to venture off of the property to look for anything better.  As I live in town, I don't have a good reason to go back.
