Fun, relaxed vibe and tasty food I'd describe as tex-mex with a twist (not authentic Mexican).  Definitely order the chips and check out the salsa bar which has mild, medium and hot options.  Plus, the visit to the salsa bar will kill a bit of time while you wait for your drinks. The drinks always take TOO long to come, even if we just order a couple of beers. Hmmph.
