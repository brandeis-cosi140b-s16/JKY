After being in the sun and pool all day, Hunger pangs set in. So our group popped in here on way back to the room. I really enjoyed the freshness of the food. The portions size on the apps here nice. Just enough to fill in the gap before dinner. The 'rita's were taste also. I have to try again when not so tired and the place is open for full menu.
