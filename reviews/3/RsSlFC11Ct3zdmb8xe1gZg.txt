Upon walking in I was surprised at how big it is. There were only 2 others in the restaurant. It was an off time. The place is very clean. It was very warm inside. Which was not pleasant on an over 100 degree day. 
I was ordering take out.  The order process was quick and simple. 
It took about 20 minutes for the order to be ready. They also include napkins and utensils. 
I ordered the beef fajitas. It is a huge portion. Too much for one person. I was a little disappointed as I felt it was overwhelmed by cilantro. The tortillas had an odd flavor as well. 
The chips were good, not greasy nice flavor. 
The beans were quite watery. The rice was perfectly cooked and I liked the taste. Perfectly seasoned. 
I ordered the shrimp burrito for my DH and he loved it. 
I found the prices high. 32.00 for two for takeout. 
I will try this place again, they had a lot of choices.
