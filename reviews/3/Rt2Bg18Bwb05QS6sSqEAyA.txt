Well, I thought I would try again. I mean why not the owner or manager responded after my last visit and offered $10.00 off my next visit. I didn't take advantage of it, but came back anyway. I made sure I arrived before the lunch rush. Unfortunately that didn't alter the 15 minute ticket time. Maybe that is normal because everyone says it is made to order. Fish tacos are on the docket today, they came out hot, but a little dry. Unfortunately over salted... But all in all tasted good. We'll see what happens on the next visit.
