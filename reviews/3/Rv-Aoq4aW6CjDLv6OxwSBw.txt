I've been here a few times. Enough to think I've got a grasp of what to expect.

The food here is not quite the great mexican food we have in San Diego, but almost nothing really is in Phoenix. The meat is a little more dry, the rice just isn't right, everything is just a little lower in scale.

Rating on Phoenix standards, the place is okay. The atmosphere is okay, the service is good, you don't wait forever for your food.

I'll eat here every so often as other people I know seem to really like it.
