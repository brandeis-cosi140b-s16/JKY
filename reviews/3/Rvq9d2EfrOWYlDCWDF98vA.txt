Cheap, fast, and fresh. I had a shredded beef taco and shredded beef burrito combination. Rice and beans were a little bland and the burrito came with sauteed veggies in it, so it was a little soggy by the time I got home with it. The real gem was the taco! Although there was a little oil in the bottom of my styrofoam to-go box, this showed me that the taco shell was fried to my order and it was thick and crisp and perfect for holding together the filling, which was hot and moist, with no weird hard pieces. I will definetly be back.
