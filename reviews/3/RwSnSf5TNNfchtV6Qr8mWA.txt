Sylvia's has the best red chili in town. Alexander hit the nail on the head with his review. Sylvia's is the upscale version of Los Compadres down the street in most every way. Salsa bar for fresh pico de gallo (for eat-in only), full bar available next door or beers on ice at the register, and colorful decor throughout.

My problem with Sylvia's is the price you'll pay for counter service. For these prices (basically twice Los's) we should get sit-down service. Well, to each his own. For the sit down service, just go a mile to the east to Manuel's at 7th Street. I have a problem paying an extra $0.85 for a slab of butter with my tortilla and $0.65 for extra cheese, just two examples.

This red chili is the stuff of legend. The meat is roasted just right and falls apart when you fork it and then it melts in your mouth. The red sauce is perfection with its thickness.

They are at their best when putting on their holiday buffet brunches. Scoop your plate full with the guacamole (usually $3.25 each) and the chips (and tortillas) that make La Canasta famous throughout the valley. Oh, and don't forget a healthy helping of the best red chili in town. Yum.
