Ive been eye balling this place for some time after seeing they offered a dining certificate on restaurant.com.. so the Mr and I wanting to eat on the cheap headed over there. Okay, to get into this place you have to turn into the plaza behind the restaurant on Southern.. if you park in the adjacent lot on Mill you might get towed so look out. 

We did find the entrance and was greeted warmly by our server. Service here is great.. very attentive and willing to please. The food is decent enough, basic cheap Mexican fare.. taco's, burro's etc.. we shared a cheese crispy which was more like cheese limp but tasted great, like home made.. the chunky salsa they served had a nice bite and worked well with the 'limp'. Also had the red chile burro as an app.. no one can do red chile like La Canasta.. however the meat was plentiful and cooked very well. 

The Mr had the Chicken enchilada's, very good, a nice creaminess to the sauce. I splurged and had a beef chimi.. was very good and not greasy at all. 

So the food here is good but not one of those places where you feel the need to return to try more things. Please note they are only open for dinner on Friday nights otherwise this is a lunch place. Live Mariachis on Friday night as well!
