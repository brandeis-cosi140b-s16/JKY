I happened upon this relatively new restaurant while driving to another restaurant within the same plaza.  I know that it was a Qdoba before, but I have never been to any Qdoba restaurants.  So when the restaurant I intended to go to was closed in observance of Passover, I decided to make a mental note to come try this place in the near future.

Fast forward about a week.  I walked into a mostly empty restaurant that was decorated as if you are dining in an outdoor courtyard, except you are indoors.  It has some Mexican themed decorations, such as the hanging dried chilis.

Since this was the very first time I have been to this restaurant, I didn't realize that it was actually part of a small national chain (this being the third location and they have one in Utah and I can't remember where else).  Their main thing is the burrito with sauce both on the inside and outside that they called Burrangos.  I tried to describe it to my friends and they said that it is similiar to the Cafe Rio Wet Burrito (I will take their word for it, as i have never been to Cafe Rio).  There are a variety of meats to select from (I  opted for the grilled steak, which was very tender) and for vegetarians, they have grilled vegetables.  You have your choice of three different beans, two kinds of rice (tomato base and lime rice), three sauces (mild, medium and hot - the medium wasn't really spicy) and finally cheese.  After it is assembled, the burrito is placed on a conveyor that moves it along while baking it (think Quiznos or something like it).  Overall it was a decent burrito presented differently.

Just FYI:  The "regular" size burrito is actually their large, and it was a decent size burrito.  They have a frequent visit card, which I assume will give you something for free after 10 visits/purchases.

The staff that works here are friendly and did not mind explaining the menu to new customers.  That is always a plus.

A-OK!  Three stars.
