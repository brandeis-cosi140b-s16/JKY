It's a fair meal when your nearby.  A little more authentic than the fast fast food mexican.   Service is a bit somber.  They keep it fairly clean (someone has been mopping the floor both visits).  My cheese enchilada on my first visit was not melted (that may be how they make them here?).  Chicken enchiladas were decent.
