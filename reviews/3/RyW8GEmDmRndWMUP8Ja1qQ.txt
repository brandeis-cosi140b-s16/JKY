Pro:  good food, solid happy hour 

Con: service is inconsistent but has been trending up of recent.

We eat here often and always leave satisfied by our meal but not always by our service.  I think they're getting the message via yelp as I've noticed an "uptick" in service and hustle lately.  Any way... everything we've tried on the menu is good, esp. the cortada salad, soups and taco's.  The breakfast burrito goes well with a hangover.  Very good value at happy hour.  The roof deck is money.   I'd give GB 3.5 stars but can't so I'm rounding down until the service is steadily great.
