This is the new incarnation and location of what used to be Oaxaca Restaurant in the bowling alley complex in Sunnyslope. It offers the familiar menu and small Oaxacan grocery section of its old place. The food itself has retained the flavors that patrons of the old place are familiar with: OK but could definitely be improved, and I wish their mole would be a little less sweet. The restaurant itself is spacious and the location quite convenient, though it will be even more accessible once the light rail extension construction in the area is done. Some confusion may also result from the signage on the facade of the restaurant - it reads, "Oaxaca Restaurant - Mexican Food," though this used to be covered by a banner that reads "Cocina Oaxaque√±a", which is also what is printed on the entrance signage as well as on the menu. http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2014/01/cocina_oaxaquena_mexican_restaurant_phoenix_new_oaxaca.php
And by the way, chapulines are available seasonally at the restaurant's refrigerated case near the counter. You can't get any delicacy more authentically Oaxacan than these!
