I know this place has a ton of terrible reviews, but none of my experiences have been nearly has bad. I work in the area and am obsessed with the chicken tortilla soup, so I visit here whenever I am able to get out. 

I have eaten in and taken out. I have never found the place to be extremely dirty, or anything gone wrong while I've been there. The only downfall is that service is typically extremely slow. Even if there is a line, there is no sense of urgency from the staff. They have always been extremely friendly, just not in any rush to get people out the door. 

So all in all, it's not a terrible place to eat. Love the food and I couldn't live without the chicken tortilla soup!!
