do not fear this yellow and red striped hut, right here in Mesa's hood :)
Rolberto's has some pretty good stuff going for it.. their Carnitas is more traditional, and flavorful, than similar establishments.. their pico, and guacamole are really awesome, totally homemade.. (tasting, at least).. 
It's not the BEST taco stand in town, but it does the trick, especially if you live nearby.  This is a walk up, cash-only, 24 hour, outdoor seating, or drive thru kinda place..
