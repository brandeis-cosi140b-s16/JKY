On the plus side- food was good.. On the down side had to wait an hour and 20 minutes to get it.. Took one hour for them to inform me they were out of what I ordered.. Felt bad for wait staff cause all they could do was offer apology after apology all night to each table over and over.. Plus when you have all you can eat fish Friday you should truly have tarter sauce.. Hoping this was a fluke on service but 2.5 hours to grab pizza for kids- fish fry and chicken strips was a bit ridiculous.
