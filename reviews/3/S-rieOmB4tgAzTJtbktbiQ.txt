Compared to everywhere else, Robertos ranks low for me.  When it comes to indulgence after a night of drinking, there's no place like this Mexican fiesta!

Whenever I come to Roberto's, no matter what location, I tend to get the same two things:  Carnitas Burrito and/or Carne Asada Fries!  On this night, I got the Carne Asada Fries.  This meal is huge!  Crispy fries smothered (and when I say smothered, I really mean it LOL) with all the Mexican fixings:  sour cream, onions, cheese, guacamole just to name a few.  The carne asada is perfectly seasoned and cut into strips.  Every bite is packed with flavor and the combination can cure any drunk tummy.  

This particular location was packed with a younger crowd.  A.) probably because it was right across of the UNLV and B.) It was like 3 in the morning.  The staff was nice, nothing that stood out.  Bathrooms were disgusting.  I'm not going to get into details, but I have NEVER seen a Roberto's bathroom in good shape.  

Trust me.  NOTHING in here is healthy, however, if you're looking to get your drunk munchies on, this is the place.  Come by and check out the fries.  You'll thank me later.
