Great Margaritas, standard food.

Any time I find myself in the PH, I try to find a reason to mosey over to Yolo's bar so that I can down 1 or 5 blended strawberry margaritas.

I've only eaten here twice, and both times the food was acceptable, but nothing to write home about.  One time a person in our party didn't even get an order taken, which was rather frustrating.  

Overall a cool place, just not a place I recommend for a bite.
