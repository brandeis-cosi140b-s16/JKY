Average American-Mexican food. I had the vegetarian burrito. Peppers, black beans, and the hot salsa. Peppers were a bit too chewy. Rice was good. Salsa was OK. Tortillas made on site, pretty good. They mix up the contents of your burrito, which I do like. Good service. Quick lunch. Clean and plenty of seating. Even so, not much different than the other 'burrito' chains around.
