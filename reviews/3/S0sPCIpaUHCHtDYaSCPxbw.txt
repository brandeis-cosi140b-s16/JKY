Tried this for the first time after having the munchies after the club. And the only thing that was open at 3am. I tried the manchata burrito and it was delicious. I went back the next day because i was hung over and somewhat helped. 

I tasted my sweetheart carne asada burrito and it was just as good. The hot sauce was very bland and no flavor. Really wish they had a salsa bar cuz I'm a fan of spicy food. 

The place was really clean and our food was made to order. The prior 0 people that took our order were very nice and friendly. 

Overall good food and I will be returning.
