After several visits and living right down the street, this is a place I would come to drink, not to eat.

The ambiance is good, and the drinks are as well. They can make a proper mojito and have great margaritas. In the summer, the outdoor porch is fantastic and comfortable. 

I have ordered different tacos on a variety of occasions and they never live up to expectations. Waaay too much radish and too little substance. If you want tacos, go to Reynas.
