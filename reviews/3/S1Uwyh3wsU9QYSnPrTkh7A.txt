Went there with my hubby and 2 kids on a Sunday afternoon.  The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside... I was a little nervous.  The inside was pretty clean and tidy... not much for decor but   there was a guy on karoke singing songs in Spanish!  
We went mainly for the pupusas.... they were cheap, a lil' oily and oh so cheesy!  There are 3 types available, plain w/cheese, cheese and bean and a pork cheese and bean.  we ordered a couple of each  and were not disappointed.  Next time I'll ask them to make them "well done"  a couple were kinda doughy... the slaw they came with was ok.. nothin special... 

They had a sign for 12 pupusas for $12 Mon-Fri... I dont remember what type but it sounded like a good deal.....  

We'll definately be back!
