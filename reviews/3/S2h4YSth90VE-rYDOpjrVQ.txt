Pretty good breakfast, I was in a pinch and came here for a quick order to go and got the chorizo plate.  The chorizo was very good and the beans were too, but the cheese was smelly (think it was goat cheese), and the potatoes were deep fried looking and did not taste good at all.  I did like the chips and salsa and the atmosphere inside wasn't too bad for a casual mexican fast food joint.  I will probably come back since it is so close to my work.
