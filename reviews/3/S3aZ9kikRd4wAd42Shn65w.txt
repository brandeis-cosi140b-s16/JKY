Filli's makes a good breakfast burrito. I prefer the bacon, egg, cheese & add potato breakfast burrito.

The service is hit and miss, some days you will get excellent quick service and other's it's ridiculously slow. 

Be prepared to pay extra for sides of guacamole or sour cream. Make sure you check out their daily specials some of them are well worth it.
