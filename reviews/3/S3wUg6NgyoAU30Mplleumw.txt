After countless stories about how great chef jose andres is i assumed this place would be absolutely amazing.  Therefore, i set my bar preeeetty high for this place and expected greatness.  What i got was decent mexican AND chinese food.  many of the reviews were right, its not some type of amazing fusion blend of the 2 but more so of the 2 cuisines in one restaurant.

The tongue(lengua) tacos were very delicious, but after having some authentic tacos from the ghetto side of vegas, it made these ones look like a joke as there was no special kick to it.

We also tried the dan dan noodles which were pretty unique out of all the dishes we ordered, but for some reason didnt hit the spot.  I couldn't taste too much of the unique flavors as it was just plain spicy.

Overall, its not a horrible place, but nothing spectacular to earn a 4-5 stars in my book.
