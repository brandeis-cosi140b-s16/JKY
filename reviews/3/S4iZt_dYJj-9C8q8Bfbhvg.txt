I think 3 stars is generous.  We have given it 2 tries, but just haven't found this place spectacular by any means. It's on the pricey side for standard Mexican fare, and it's just not all that good.  It's pretty plain in fact.  I've read a lot of other reviews raving about this place, so maybe its just us but the first time we went, the service was average and the second time, the service was terrible. It took 10 minutes to get a drink refilled, and our food took slightly over 30 minutes, with minimal check ins from waitstaff.  The chips and salsa are good, but after 20 minutes you get tired of chips and salsa, then you just get restless for the next 10 mins waiting on your food. 

The margaritas were pretty good, but it's a Mexican restaurant, so I expected a decent margarita. I ordered the pick 3, and the beef taco and chicken enchilada were good, but the guac on my tostada had a funny taste to it, almost like it was a day too old or something. My boyfriend tried it and agreed it did not taste right.  We've also tried the nachos, the Carne Asada, and queso dip with chorizo and they were all good, just not great or anything super special. I think for us, considering we've tried it twice now, price, and all the other dining options close by, this will not be one of our go to's.
