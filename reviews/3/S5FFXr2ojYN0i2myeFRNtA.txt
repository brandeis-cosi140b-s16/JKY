I ordered the waffle combo and tried some of my stepdad's huevos rancheros. The waffle breakfast was like any other breakfast I had. Not bad, but not special either. The huevos rancheros we ok, but not amazing either. Friendly staff. I feel as though I should give the Mexican and Chinese food a try to give this a place a fair rating.
