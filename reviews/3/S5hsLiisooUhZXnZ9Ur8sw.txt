The food was tasty, however the experience was sub-par.  We understand we came on a Friday night with no reservation, but were told it would be about 20 minutes.  It turns our we waited over an hour and when we were seated it took over 15 minutes before our server came to get our order.  We sat on the patio, which was beatiful, but it was a little too cold outside.  They have several heaters outside, which made it more cozy, however they decided to move our heater to another (more deserving party I guess), without asking if we were cold.  It then took over 30 minutes to get the check, and our drinks were never refilled.  We had the Seafood Stew, Ribeye, Salmon, and Chili Con Queso which all tasted delicious.  I just wish we hadn't had such a poor experience with the wait and server.  I may return because the food was so good.
