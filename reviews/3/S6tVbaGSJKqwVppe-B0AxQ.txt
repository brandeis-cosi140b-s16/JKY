While Ajo Al's easily holds the crown for most bearable tex-mex food in town, imho, I still am a far cry from a big fan of here. 

One of my best friends LOVES this place. LOVES it. And I could never figure out why, but I have since turned him onto El Molino in Scottsdale and I haven't heard much about Ajo Al's lately, so maybe he just didn't know any better.

Also, I did hear murmurings of trouble with health code violations here a few months back. Those usually don't scare me too much, in all candor, since perfectly good restarants get the whistle blown on them for relatively minor infractions so often that I've grown somewhat callous to their warnings. 

Further, I'm sure any problem that once existed is now long gone since there was some press about the incident when it happened. 

A good after work place to grab a drink or watch the game with friends, but do yourself a favor and grab some authentic mexican that us Phoenicians are blessed with when it comes time to eat.
