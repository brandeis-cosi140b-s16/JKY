Oh Casa Reyna, I had such high expectations for you!!!

Overall, it was a little pricier than I expected. $15 is fine for Mexican, but I was expecting the same taco prices as the stand :( They also had specials on the sign outside that were apparently for next week??? Why would you do that?

Good ceviche, but not the best I have ever had. I really wish it was more flavorful. There were out of scallops :(. Shrimp tacos were a little salty, but delisciousness none the less. I feel like they may need to scale back their menu and go back to their taco stand roots... Those taco stand tacos were effing amazing, and that is what i expected for all of the food... But, not so much.

I am however going to go back, because I believe in Reynas and their tacos and I think that next time will be better. Will update!
