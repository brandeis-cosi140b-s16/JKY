Ventured to Los Olivos on a Wednesday evening after finding out about them on a happy hour app for my iphone. The happy hour specials looked good enough to try a new place in Scottsdale. Got my boyfriend to try it with me, seeing as we both have a deep love for Mexican food! When we got there we were seated promptly, and the place has a real authentic feel to it. I think it's family owned? Our waitress was not super friendly, and told me the only item on happy hour was the house margarita- no food on happy hour (so I was misinformed). 

We decided to stay anyways and try it out. I had the house margarita for happy hour which ended up being $3.50 so not bad. Imagine the size of a wine glass, that's what the margarita came in basically. It tastes like an average house margarita. But no complaints, I had already figured it probably would. The chips and salsa were amazing! A chunky salsa and a hotter sauce as well; I wanted to eat the whole basket. We got a cheese crisp to start, and you can never go wrong with a cheese crisp! I ordered a shredded beef taco plate (2 beef tacos with rice and beans). The tacos were good, nothing extraordinary but I would get them again. The Spanish rice and refried beans were delicious and I was really happy with those. 

Overall, the food was decent and the service was subpar. I like trying to support local and independently owned joints, but honestly for what I had I would probably just go back to macayos.
