Definitely disappointed this time. Normally a visit to a Chipotle is where the staff is attentive and the food is ample. This was not the case this time. The scoops were lacking their normal robust amount and left me hoping it was enough for my family. I had to repeat my order more than once while the person making my food was distracted by the people who walked in behind me. Kind of a bummer this time.
