I've been to all the valley Saltys, but choose to review this one as it is the one I most frequent due to the proximity to my house.

First off, I learned early in my Saltys experience that this isn't really a place to go for good eats.  Mediocre at best.  I gave everything a chance and it's all just OK...nothing stands out, except for the habanero salsa that you have to specifically ask for when served chips and salsa (that you have to pay for, wtf?)   Probably one of the hottest in the valley, I absolutely love it.  The actual chips are pretty good too, when they're consistent.

This particular Saltys quickly went the same route as its brethren, catering to 20 somethings (which I am)  looking for some ass (which I don't really mind, but just giving you an idea)  I know it's East Mesa, but it almost has a Scottsdale'y feel to it, especially on Fri and Sat nights...and that's why I kinda like it I think.  It's a good place to people watch without having to go to Old Town, or even Mill for that matter.  It's also a great place to day drink with cheap-ish beer.  Better than Dos Gringos in my opinion...not as uh, dirty feeling?

Don't like it at all as a restaurant, but as a local watering hole, it's not bad.
