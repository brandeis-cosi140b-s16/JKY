Decided to come by and check out this local mom and pop restaurant. It is close to my house and on the way to pickup my granddaughter. She is so much fun.

Located in the same complex as Good Will and right next to a popular donut chain. This little restaurant serves up a good variety of the more popular Mexican dishes.

Inside is very small with several tables and chairs to enjoy your meal. The menu has a good selection of photos so that you can just point at what you want to eat. They even have a nice complimentary chip and salsa bar to get you started.

Ordered the Green Chili Pork Burrito Combo plate and helped myself to both the mild and hot salsas. The burrito tasted OK and seemed to be filled mainly with beans and green chili gravy. The cubed pork seemed to be hiding and required a bit of searching to find the rather small pieces. 

This place more or less cranks out some very typical Tex-Mex style food with not a whole lot of flavor. Even the salsas were pretty bland and I had to add a large amount of hot sauce to kick things up a notch.

Service was friendly and the place was pretty busy. I would not call this authentic Mexican food unless you are just used to the Americanized versions of this cuisine. The prices are reasonable and the food in general falls into my  A-OK category.

Give them a try and see what you think. Everyone has a different opinion of what they enjoy when it comes to Mexican food. LEFT STILL HUNGRY!
