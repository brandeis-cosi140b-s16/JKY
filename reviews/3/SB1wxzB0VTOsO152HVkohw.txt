Was a bit disappointed with this place. I expected a full taco spot with lots of yummy options but that wasn't the case. They offer a carne asada burrito but won't do Carne asada tacos?? I asked the waitress what that was about and she said she ASSUMES it's because her chef is concerned with cross contamination?? What the?... Ok. So I order a fish taco, the prices are over inflated for only getting a tortilla a ton of cabbage and a little piece of fish. There are by far so many better options for tacos than this. I will not be returning to this establishment.
