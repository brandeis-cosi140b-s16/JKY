After hearing mixed reviews I had to check it out. After arriving we ordered a sampler appetizer, including guacamole, cheese dip & flauntas. The cheese dip was heavy and pretty blah & the flauntas were burned and nothing too exciting. We proceeded to order the chicken fajitas and barbacoa tacos. They were both OK, nothing too write home about. I was also extremely disappointed with the rice & beans, served with the fajitas, very dry and tasted like store bought or out of a can. A little disappointing overall.
