First time here. I came with a guy who loves Mexican and he loves it here. Truly authentic cuisine. 

You've got to look past the old decor and trust that it's good. 

I had three tacos all different flavors. Tortillas were not homemade and could have used some frying to get the crispy! 

The hot sauce was smoking hot. 

Staff was super friendly and amazingly fast service for a quick lunch meal.
