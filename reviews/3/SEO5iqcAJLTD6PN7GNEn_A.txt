Had lunch here with some folks from work; while the food was decent Taco Bell grub and the prices were good (a dollar for the Beefy Frito Burrito is a deal), there was a rather unpleasant smell permeating the dining room; it had an edge of sewage, so there may be something wrong with their plumbing.
Problems like this can occur, and I don't hold the workers at fault, but the second that a manager notices something like that, a call should be made to their maintenance guy or a plumber to get it fixed post-haste. If you can't get out fixed or diagnosed right away, apologize to your customers. Put up a sign. Don't act like a reeking restaurant is what you always have or people won't want to return. People were still coming through the lobby, but not a lot, and everyone got food to go.
I bumped up the review a star because the trainee behind the country was very friendly, and even though she had a trainer hanging over her at most times to help, she did her best to figure everything out on her own so she didn't always have to wait for help. That shows initiative and good customer service. I wouldn't expect her to have any control over the smell issue on her first day, so she was exempted from the "unapologetic" rubric.
