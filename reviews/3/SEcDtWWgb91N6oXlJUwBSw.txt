I really don't like Las Vegas. There . . . I said it. I had to get that statement out before I typed another word.

I am just not a Las Vegas kind-of-guy. The lights, the constant bombardment of second-hand smoke, the noise - I just don't like it.

I do, however, make a couple of trips a year to LV for business. This past trip my team and I worked out of the Venitian and had a very full schedule. As such, we had no time to get "off the beaten track" to find good-eats in Vegas.

The one meal we had that is worthy of a post is the Taqueria Canonita. The food is not great - but very good. The staff are wonderful. These was a wonderful person who helped us find our way around the menu. We had a working lunch and the server was so gracious in allowing us to linger and talk.

If you are ever "stranded" on the Las Vegas strip - this is a place that will "tick the box" of the food experience . . . and not set you back too much cash.
