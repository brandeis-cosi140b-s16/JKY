This review is actually 3.5 stars.

I'm a believer in that Mill Avenue is a hotbed of douche baggery.  I feel like a douche just being there.  Especially at night.  At night, the smell of Axe Body Spray is so thick you could choke a mule to death.

During the day, there are some pretty decent, quiet spots to get your grub on.  Hippies Cove is a pretty solid Mexican food joint.  The prices are decent and they load the SHIT out of your burrito.  Their tacos are pretty awesome too.  They have a couple of the more standard Mexican beers in the back fridge too so you can catch a little food/buzz too if you want.

The service isn't the friendliest, but it's quick and awesome.  It's not friendly but they're definitely not rude.  They don't roll their eyes at your for asking for cheese or something, they just won't kiss your ass and call it ice cream.

I think the interior and the whole theme of the place is kinda, you know, it's kind of stupid.  It's sorta like they're trying to ride the coattails of Two Hippies or rock a "counter culture" kinda theme like Cheba Hut or something.  It's really inconsistent.  You'll see this picture of Bob Marley, Jerry Garcia and, like, Jimi Hendrix but the person working behind the counter is about un-hippie as it gets.  It's just a name and a theme thrown together pretty half-assed.

I like the food, I like the service, but the decor is lame but it's not a big deal.  Eat outside.
