I'm big on supporting local business owners to the fullest, but I'm also honest with my reviews.  

Jester's location is tough as is since the storefront is facing an airport and next door is a motorcycle shop and a MVD registration.  However, the good side is that it's the only Mexican restaurant within a 1 to 2 miles radius!  Most other places around the area are sandwich and burger shops.  The shop itself is very new -- matter of fact; think I was their first Yelper.  The decor to me is kind of cheesy with a Jester mascot in a jeep baja and the walls were splashed with some comical quotes of the day.  Needless, to say I wasn't here for that.

I ordered the 2 taco combo; my buddies ordered the cheese quesadilla and a beef burrito.  Fresh ingredients and made to your order, that's a plus in my opinion. However, my corn tortilla tacos were okay.  I thought overall it was pretty plain.  I had a beef and pork taco and there were no seasoning or spice except topped with your choice of sides.  I just had the pico de gallo, lettuce, and hot sauce.  Truthfully, the sauce was mild at best.  Nothing really popped on my plate.  My buddies thought their dishes were excellent.  I was told the burrito was real tasty and the cheese quesadilla was awesome!  Needless, to say I'm the one telling the story - wink!  

Service is real relaxed and inviting.  I think the owners of the place worked hard to get this place up and running.  Their welcoming and position attitude is much appreciated! - Enjoy!
