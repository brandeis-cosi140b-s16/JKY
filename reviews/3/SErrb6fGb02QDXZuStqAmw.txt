I really wanted to like Steel Cactus.  The decor is really nice, it has a great semi-open bar with a nice view of Walnut Street.  And... that's about all it has going for it.  When I walked in the hostess was nowhere to be found so I seated myself at the bar.  The bartender very begrudgingly took my order, and about 15 minutes later I was treated to 3 very bland tacos.  They were only served with raw onions and cilantro.  No tomatoes, sour cream, cheese, or any sides.  Way overpriced and underwhelming.  Such a shame, it seemed so nice!
