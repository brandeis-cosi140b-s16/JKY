The ever evolving menu changes again, But a coupon made it a decent buy.

I will admit my co workers 2 for 1 coupon is why we went in. This means ~3.25 per burrito vs the usual $6 range.

What I didn't like was that my vegetarian burrito did not have vegetables in it, it was just a bean and rice burrito with guacamole. I don't know how one gets the grilled veggies in their burrito but it is not by ordering a vegetarian burrito.

The drink and napkin station here has always been a bottleneck, getting a refill or more napkins is nearly impossible.

I do like the fact there there is Choula sauce in addition to the red and green tobascos. And I also like that the chairs are not nearly as bad as those at chipotle.

The best tip this time is get in before 12, otherwise be prepared for a long long line.
