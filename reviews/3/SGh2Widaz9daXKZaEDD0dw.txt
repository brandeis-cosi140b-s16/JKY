I enjoyed the comfortable, colorful, appropriately southwestern atmosphere, but the food just didn't pack a good punch. I ordered the veggie enchiladas, and although they looked great on my plate alongside beans and rice, they just didn't taste like much at all. I ordered mine with a blue corn tortilla, which I was excited to see as on option, but it lacked the great corny flavor I was hoping for. The red chili sauce had no heat to it and the cheese seemed to be more grease than anything. I was very surprised that such a great looking dish could be so lacking in flavor. The service, however, was friendly and speedy. I liked that you could order small or large potions of most menu items. I'll probably visit Pasqual's again sometime in the future, but I think I'll call ahead to make sure the kitchen hasn't run out of salt...
