Right away I'm greeted with the smell of Mexican food and a malfunctioning sewer system - it bummed me out.  It's dimly lit inside, not much to say about the decor, very unimpressive, I tried not to look around because I really did want to love a place called "Nacho Mama." 

I got the carnitas nachos and they were pretty tasty, the carnitas were dry and lacking in flavor though.  I noticed they had Stella on tap, which is a great reason to come back.  All in all I'd say this place is more of a bar than a restaurant.  Plenty of dudes getting their drink on at noon on a Monday.
