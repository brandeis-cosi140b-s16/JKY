It's back!  A decent place for sure, but certainly a few long standing quirks, that to me, make it 3 starts (average) over something that I would consider above average or exceptional.  Overall the food is good and despite some of the negative reviews of the staff, I find them to be friendly.  We go about 1-2 times a month, but for one reason or another not as much as before since the move.

The quirks I find are ones that most people that join us all agree with as well.  Portions are a bit small for the prices and no "free" chips.  The other is the small plastic salsas that they will give out for free but are clearly protecting from waste so you find yourself having to get up from your meal to ask for time and time again.

So with the quirks, how would I change this... First I would focus on making the portions about 1/4-1/3 bigger or add a small, but cheap side (beans, or rice) with any order. Then I would also offer a free chip bag on orders over $15.  Last I would have staff monitor the tables and offer salsa about every 5-10 minutes (come to us so we don't have to come to you). 

Remember this review isn't negative, but to be special, you have to offer something special.  Right now the food is good, but the nuances of the value for what you are getting make it seem... average.
