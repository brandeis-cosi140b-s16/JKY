2.5 stars, but I'll round it up for our first visit.

Mom's choice after seeing it featured on Check, Please! Arizona.  We were looking forward to trying the Tres Amigos, for it looked so good on TV.  I thought I heard one of the guests say it was made with flour tortillas, and since I'm allergic to corn, I was happy to hear this.  I didn't even bother to confirm with the server, since I'm tired of asking so many questions.  Well, at least two of the enchiladas were made with corn, so I left that entree for Mom to enjoy.  She favored the chicken tomatillo most.  It was also the only one she found cooked perfectly.  The other two (spinach and shredded beef) had tortillas that were partially-cooked.  We both tried the side of refried beans and liked it.  She thought the rice was terrible and didn't even bother to include it in the leftovers. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/manuels-mexican-food-scottsdale?select=Ra5FvYBankc_ub_K1HrytQ#Ra5FvYBankc_ub_K1HrytQ

I ordered a spinach enchilada in a flour tortilla a la carte. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/manuels-mexican-food-scottsdale?select=aoxX8QUR6l3n4HuOL4dFYw#aoxX8QUR6l3n4HuOL4dFYw  I enjoyed it, even though it's just a tortilla filled with saut√©ed spinach and onions, with chopped lettuce and tomatoes on the side.  Would I order it again?  Probably not.  We may return for Mom to try a seafood entree, and I will have to try the beef and chicken enchiladas, but not anytime soon.

The flan was good.  Not the best, as Mom makes the best flan, but we both appreciated this flan's texture.  I actually prefer its flavors the day after. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/manuels-mexican-food-scottsdale?select=LFppwbhhjs4-oTzkyYNesA#LFppwbhhjs4-oTzkyYNesA
