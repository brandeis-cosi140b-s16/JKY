Not bad. The food is pretty good, but don't eat here if you are in a rush. We did go on a Sunday night so service might have been slower. I got the fajitas, which were good. And my partner tried a combination platter. He enjoys cheese a lot so it was quite good for him. Not sure if we will be back or not.
