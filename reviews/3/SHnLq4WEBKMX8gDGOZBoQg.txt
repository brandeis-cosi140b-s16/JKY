Food was decent.   Nothing special.   Hostess was rude and not helpful.    I told her that I was not happy with the answers.   She turned her back and walked away shrugging her shoulders.   Waitress forgot to bring the menus.  Waitress took only part of the drink orders and left the table.  I had to ask manager to take the balance of the drink orders.
