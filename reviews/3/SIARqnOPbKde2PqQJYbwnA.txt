Had some work colleagues ask to meet here today. Was pretty bummed with other interesting places nearby like Humble Pie & even Houston's.

Looking at the menu, it is just so chain uninspiring. Nothing super authentic, nothing fun. My biggest problem was the menu itself. Just pretty boring.

Ended up getting a shredded beef burro which was ok.  I did think the chips & salsa were decent.

I will say though that our server was awesome. He was as on the ball as I've ever seen.  Didn't have a ton of personality & wasn't super friendly but he was efficient & rocked it.  If it wasn't for him, I'd definitely have gone 2 stars as "meh" totally hits the mark for me.

Just feels like such a wasted opportunity when you have a meal out & end up using it on an uninspired, playing-it-safe chain.
