Food and atmosphere are standouts, as well as the ownership and lure of the restaurant's hand prepared food and presentation.  But at the end of your meal, you are really just getting a snack.  The quality of food is top notch for buc, but the quantity is on the skimpy side once you realize only your tastebuds were satisfied.  Twice now, I have eaten there and had to go for a second dinner same night and I am average 6'0" 180lb so not exactly needing to pig out.

So if you want a cute, quaint experience this is a great gig with friends and out of towners, but if you are truly wanting quality as fulfilling meal . . . I would pass and head North a few more blocks to De Tia Rosas on McKellips / Lindsay http://www.ranchodetiarosa.com/
