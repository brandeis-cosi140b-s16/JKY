Had to deduct a star for how I was welcomed or made to feel unwelcome. I checked in late after a long day of flying and was happy to hear that the restaurant was open late. I walked in and looked on the restaurant and it was empty but there were a few seats at the bar. I asked the bartender if I could order dinner from the bar and she looked at me like I had four foreheads. She finally said yes and then I had to ask her for a menu? I also had to ask for water. Maybe she's having a bad night?

I ordered a burrito but it was more like a chicken wrap. Regardless it was tasty. The food in this place was decent, the service not so much.
