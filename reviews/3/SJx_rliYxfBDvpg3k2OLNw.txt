I will have to come back yo try other items on menu. But only have trying the #3 combo I was sorta unimpressed.

 It was $5.50 for a combo/no drink . The shells for the tacos were that of supermarket quality. I do not think they make them. The shredded beef had flavor but was not complimented well by the shells. Also the beans had flavor as well but were watery. The rice was just not good to me.

This restaurant is also a Mexican bakery and has a bread shelve in the back that looks delicious. I will be back to try breakfast burritos and bread

NOTE: I here that the "handmade tortillas are to die for" so maybe grab a bag on the counter as you go.
