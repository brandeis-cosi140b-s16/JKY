Came here with a friend for a light lunch and some drinks. Although it was pretty pricey, the food was good and the drinks were strong. It's got a great atmosphere, maybe just a tad bit too dark indoors.

I can't say the menu prices really reflected the quality of the food but it's a place I would recommend to a friend if they were in the mood for Mexican food.
