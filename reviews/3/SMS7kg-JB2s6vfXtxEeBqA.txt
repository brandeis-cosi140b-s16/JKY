First of all, let me just say that the tacos are awesome. I've gone twice and tried 4 different kinds. The Mexican corn on the cob and the queso dip are great too. However, the rice and beans are bland, bland, bland. I'd definitely give it a higher rating if it weren't so expensive. 3 individual (tiny but delicious) tacos, a half order of the queso dip with chips, and a regular size fountain drink should not cost $17.
