This last time we got the "big caramba," which is a beef burro, served enchilada style. It certainly was big. I'll give them that. I swear the tortillas they used were 2 feet across, and they used two of them for each burro. 

But it was so bland and goopy. This was actually confirmation of what I've experienced the last few visits. It seems their food has gotten more flavorless and sloppy.
