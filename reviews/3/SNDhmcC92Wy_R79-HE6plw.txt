It's Taco Bell what can we say.  We have been here a couple times but the last two time we have waited extremely long times in the drive thru. 

If you on a lunch break go to Roberto's. It's just not worth it.  Last wait time was 36 min if there had not been a. At in front or back of us we would have just left.
