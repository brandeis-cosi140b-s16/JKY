We're used to the great service from the Arizona Rubio's that this Rubio's doesn't compare.  Only my husband was eating and it was 3 fish tacos.  It took SOOOO long for them to make these, it wasn't funny.  I saw other people get their food and leave and still he hadn't gotten his tacos.  He finally got his tacos.

Anyway, thankfully the Rubio's we go to all have better service.  This wasn't the worst, and we had had bad service at a McDonald's the day before, so the fact we didn't get great service was a bit of a shock as well as a disappointment.
