so I made reservation at 5:45, showed up, and told to wait by wait staff because the table is still busy. (sure... there are many other tables available for 1 or 2 ppl)
20 min later I asked, is my table ready, she then looked at the manager, and the manager asked her if I have any reservation. she pointed to my name and he asked for how many ppl, she said 1. and he said only 1!!?
then she seated me to another table (which has been available in the first place)
the place is not a place for enjoying your meal. it is a fusion of mexican argentine and peruvian food. in which the food part is pretty good. just don't order any Taco (they are badly made and not sure why)
the waitress was very nice and describe the food well, she did not recommended the Taco, next time I would try the short ribs or their speciality pork belly.
I wish they lit up the room a bit, too dark and having a waitress to shine a light on the menu or your food so you can see, doesn't help.
Duck Carnitas Empanada was great.
