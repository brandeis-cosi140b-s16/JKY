We went for taco Tuesday.  Service is hurried and food is slung together.   Staff do not take time to drain juice from meat or water from lettuce.  You end up with a soggy tortilla. Fresh made tortilla would be good if not treated like a sponge. Meat is tasty.  Cleanliness is questionable because they are so busy. Could be a great place if someone was managing the restaurant who cared enough about their product.
