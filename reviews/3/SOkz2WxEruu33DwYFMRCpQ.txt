the restaurant is open during construction, though i'm not sure it really should be. it was very noisy, dirty and they were out of 3 things we tried ordering including tinga and lengua which are staples to have at a mexican street taco restaurant. 

the "chicos" tacos were street taco size and the bigger tacos were huge. what we did have had great flavor. used mexican cheeses, shredded lettuce and the housemade salsas are on point.

will try it once more hopefully after construction they will offer a full menu. 

they had a credit card machine, not cash only.
