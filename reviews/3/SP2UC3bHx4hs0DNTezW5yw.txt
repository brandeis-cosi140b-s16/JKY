Came In today because we got gift certificates via Restaurant.com only to find the manager doesn't allow them .  Only because we were super hungry  did we stay .  I had the cubano Torta and a single Tripitas taco.  My dad had a tripitas burro. Lnch was good .  The Torta was huge, took half home .  Very flavorful.  Tripas were cooked well.  Had cokes in a bottle and definitely no room for dessert .  Total bill was $24.   Not bad but a bummer I couldn't use my gift certificate
