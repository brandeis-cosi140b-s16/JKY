While there were some cleanliness issues, we enjoyed our food.  Its interesting to read people complain  that the restaurant is not "Mexican" enough-that its too Tex Mex.  Well then, you've got a problem because that's most of the Mexican restaurants in Chandler and the area.  Actually, this restaurant had a much more extensive menu than many other restaurants-they have quite a few seafood and shrimp dishes.

I had the Chicken Mole Enchiladas which is not typically found at other Mexican restaurants.  It was pretty good and it was a good size portion.  I have had better chips and they certainly could be more generous with them and I do like getting a both a mild and spicy salsa.
