I get the hype. It's where the locals feel comfortable eating more traditional mexican fare. I think it is worth feeling a little more uncomfortable and driving a little further down, or even down south blvd for alternate restuarants. Recently had some tacos, the pollo was dry, the al pastor was tough. The chicken soup I randomly ordered was delicious so I give them props for that.
