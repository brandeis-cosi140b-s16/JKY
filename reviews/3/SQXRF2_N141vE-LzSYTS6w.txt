Loved the idea of a garage restaurant.  We stopped in for lunch after shopping for hours. We got the T bucket sampler: it did come in a bucket, but everything in it was fried-which made it all taste the same.  Watching other things come out of the kitchen-their portions are large.  We Really loved the chips and salsa, but not sure if that's enough to come back for.
