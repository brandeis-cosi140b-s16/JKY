As with so many places (just about every place, perhaps), most factors depend on when you hit the joint.

The good news is that the service is solid, just about every time. Friendly and on point, quick to attend to every need you might want in a restaurant.

When it comes to the food, is when it is more hit and miss. The tableside guacamole has been good, though it's difficult to mess with this nearly ever-present starter.

The real problem is that after this solid start to a meal, it can go downhill fairly easily. The offerings are good, but often turn out better on the menu than on the plate. It's not that they are bad, it's just that they aren't particularly memorable.

Also, certain "standard" (Americanized?) dishes seem to be a bit more lacking than the more "authentic" options, so if you are feeling adventurous, take that route instead. For instance, the barbacoa seems to generally turn out well.

As has been noted, the parking is iffy - so if you go at a busy time, you might find yourself looking around a bit in order to find a spot. At other times, it's a ghost town, so that's not an issue. If you can make it at an off time, then you might enjoy things a bit better, because you don't have to worry about parking and service will be a bit better to boot.
