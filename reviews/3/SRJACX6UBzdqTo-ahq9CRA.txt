Dos in Old Town is a laid back day drinking /  happy hour / evening spot in where you dont have to be pretentious, a bro, done up, or out to 'pick up' someone to go. You can just go, eat, drink,  dance, have fun without any of the Old Town rules or boundaries or cultural faux paus. 

Dos is fun because it knows what it is and accepts it well. If you want to just sit and chill and drink, do it! If you want some tacos or nachos and some beers. BOOM! If you want to go out on a Saturday night and 'just dance' without 10,000 other dudes all up ons you, then good; Dos is good for that. 

Food: Food is meh. Bar food, mexican taquiera style, but certainly not 'good'. The drinks are your typical bar drinks, no fancy menu drink menu. Not that type of place. You typically end up getting a bucket Dos Equis Lagers and there ain't nothing wrong with that.

I like going to Dos and i'm sure i'll be back time and time again, especially on nights where the bro status across Scottsdale Rd gets to be so high I can't take it....
