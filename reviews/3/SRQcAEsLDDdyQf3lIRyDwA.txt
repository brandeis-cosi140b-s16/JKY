Pretty cool little spot hidden in a gas station. I've once had their burrito here and it was average. What I did get when I was just here recently was the rolled tacos aka taquitos. Those weren't that great I think I should of stuck to the burritos or have gotta the street tacos. My meal came with beans and rice which again weren't that great. I'd rather of gotten beans and rice at another spot, but hey it did to the job of filling me up especially in the middle of the night. I'd still come back here for more rather than going to Taco Bell. Price here isn't as cheap as a normal fast food place like Taco Bell or Del Taco, that's because it's not really considered fast food. Open 24 hours with better burritos, would get me here rather than Taco Bell, unless I'm on a budget.
