I like Chipotle, but it's just not anything great, a very average place.  The good points are that the burrito's and burrito bowls are pretty good sized although half of it is usually rice.  The meats taste pretty good, the salsa is good and the prices are cheap.  I also think the place is usually pretty clean and the staff has been nice.  The negatives are simple, not enough main dish selections.  Pretty much a burrito, bowl, or tacos is about it.  Would be nice if they had other selections, like quesadillas, nachos etc.  I also don't understand why the staff has to pass you from one person to another like 4-5 times during the course of one order.  I have seen this situation cause some confusion with people's orders.  Why can't one person just follow me through the whole process and than maybe pass me to the register person?  Chips would be good here if they didn't have so much salt.  I like salt, but most of the time the chips I got are WAY over salted to where the chips actually have a sour vinegar like taste.  I find myself scraping salt off the chips every time.
