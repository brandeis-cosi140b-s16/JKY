This has become a regular stop for lunch during the work day.

On a recent visit, my El Tradicional burrito had a pretty nice sized bone in the middle of it. Yes, I found yet another bone in my chicken from two different chains now.

This time, instead of being a big chunk of bone, it was a nice sized rib by the looks of it.

I tried calling the store to let the manager know their staff should be a little more careful, no answer. I know how busy they get during the day, so I figured I would call a different time. No answer. A different day, before the daily lunch rush. No answer. Fill out a form on the corporate website, receive only an autoresponder email. Next visit in, I brought the bone and receipt, manager was too busy to step away.

Oh well, I'll keep eating there, the chicken is pretty good. Will have to see if I have already filled my quota of chicken bone incidents for 2012.
