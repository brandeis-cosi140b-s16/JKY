Street taco and skewers kind of place.  Food was light and fresh.  They serve onion rings which is kind of weird but then who doesn't like onion rings.  

Lots of Tequila on the shelf that are all reasonably priced.  Nothing high end but it's more of a margarita joint than a Tequila sipping bar.  

Place is a bit squishy but the outside patio is pretty large.
