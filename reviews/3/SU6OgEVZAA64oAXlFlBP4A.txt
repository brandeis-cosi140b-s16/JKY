This was my first time here. 

Had the chips and salsa and guacamole. All three dips were homemade and really good. 

I had three different tacos. They were good but very similar to the Pgh taco truck. My other guests had the tortilla soup which they said was the best they ever had. Very authentic!!!! 

Service was great but we did get there at 12 and it wasn't busy. By the time we left it was crowded and there was only 1 server for he entire place. 

They use square for credit cards and ring you up right at your table. Finally someone that gets this. Great way to pay. 

Def will go back and try some new items. 

The place was very clean and certainly a unknown gem! 

They also do catering and could be great for steeler games or parties.
