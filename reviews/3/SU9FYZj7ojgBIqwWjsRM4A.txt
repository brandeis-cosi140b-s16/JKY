Not the best Mexican food, especially for the price. Last night I went with a friend and our tab for 1 entree and 4 house margaritas (2 each) was $45. Occasionally, I go for happy hour because it's the only place closer to home that has a patio. Appetizers are 1/2 off during happy hour but I don't think the drink specials are that great. I just go because I like to sit on the patio when the weather is nice. Service is usually pretty good.
