I'd heard good things about this place (I think they were mentioned as the best tamale in Phoenix magazine). They even have vegetarian and vegan varieties! I was sold! Then I went and got some. Funny thing, I mentioned several times I was a vegetarian and wanted only tamales without meat. When I found that I had been given several meat ones I was displeased. The tamales without meat were pretty good though I've certainly had better. All in all a good bet if you're at one of the many markets going on in the valley.
