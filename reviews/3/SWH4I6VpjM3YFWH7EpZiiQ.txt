I have been a huge fan of Rosa's ever since I was introduced to it.  I stumbled upon Tia Rosa's just by going through Yelp.

The moment I visited the website, I thought, "F*ck yea...a Rosa's closer to me!"

I rounded up my girlie friends and floored it as fast as I could get us there.  I was extremely impressed by how cute, clean and well organized the new place was.

We sat down and I viewed the menu -- what a selection.  Some same stuffs from Rosa's out on University.  Rock on.  Some other new stuff.  Rock on.  I decided to try their burro.  I seem to always get something different at Rosa's on University so I decided to get a standard fare that goes back to my Mexican food loving roots.

But blech...what a disappointment.  For some reason, the burro didn't live up to all they hype I had thought it would be.  It was ok, but nothing I'd write home about.  The food was lukewarm, but I am willing to cut them some slack since we were sitting outside and it was a mild yet not cold day.

I'll be coming back and giving them a second chance, but for now Rancho de Tia Rosa's gets 3 stars for their lovely decoration, spotless bathrooms and extremely friendly waitstaff.

I'll take the original Rosa's over Tia Rosa's for the moment.  I'll add an update when I've gone a second time.
