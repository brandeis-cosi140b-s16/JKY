There are a lot of good Mexican food spots here in AZ... so much so that you really have to do something great or unique in order to stand out from the crowd of other Mexican restaurants. Ajo Al's is good... but it isn't quite good enough to leave a lasting impression or warrant return visits. 

First off I have to give the place high marks for their décor; the place has a fun western feeling vibe. The booths all have strips of cow hide and are adorned with old time western movie posters among other things. I could see this being tacky in certain circumstances, but it works here. The tortilla chips came out nice and warm and the salsa was flavorful... definitely not bad to munch on while waiting for the main dish to arrive. We tried the Taco Del Mar plate (fish tacos) and a combination platter which included a taco, green chile tamale and a chile relleno. Everything was pretty good, but as I mentioned above it just didn't have that 'wow' factor. It was just one of those meals that 'met expectations' but didn't go above and beyond in any way. The same could be said about the service... it was passable but not anything above average. I'd be happy coming here again if the circumstances were right... I just feel like the food needs a bit more pizzazz and maybe some more distinct flavors/dishes to set them apart from the crowd. For example maybe they could have some chef specials that you couldn't find anywhere else... rather than having the majority of their menu taken up with the usual suspects (tacos/tostada's, etc... while they're good reliable Mexican dishes, it'd be nice to have more adventurous options like some of the higher end Mexican spots offer). 

Alo Al's is definitely worth trying at least once, I just wouldn't expect anything too different than the usual Mexican staples. They'd be on to something if their menu was as fun as the décor.
