I was really pleasantly surprised by this place.  Planet Hollywood has two other Mexican restaurants in the Miracle Mile that get so-so reviews and I expected Yolos would be like that but it was actually great.  The food was really good, with more complex flavors than your standard Mexican place of this price range.  We were there for Sunday brunch and they have a special brunch menu which looked good but we ended up ordering off the regular menu so I guess I can't comment on the brunch menu (although it did have a very tempting "Hangover Stew" which I would ask you to try just to tell me how it is).  The queso fundido was the best I've had anywhere, and the nachos were really good as well, every chip had a ton of yummy stuff on it.  The tortilla soup was spicy and they poured it over the tortilla strips as tortilla soup should be done.  The guacamole that came on the side of the dishes was very good so I would bet the guacamole appetizer is even better.

The service was a little too in your face, but that also meant that it was very attentive so I guess that's a toss up.  I would recommend this for a good casual lunch.
