I am from Indiana and located this restauant on Yelp. I was in town for a friend's event and I was excited to find a tequila bar. Online the menu shows several infused and flavored tequilas which I was looking forward to trying. On arrival we learned they have changed their menus and none of these are available. So instead we got margaritas which were good but overpriced for the size $9 each for the size of a small martini. Tacos were Awesome! Chips were greasy and bland. Go for the tacos but not if your looking for infused tequila... their web site is inaccurate and needs updating.
