Somebody I work with introduced me to this restaurant and it was pretty good!! First time we were there, he asked for extra salsa, and our server brought a big bowl of it back! Like a whole soup bowl filled with salsa. We couldn't believe it.

The taste of the steak meat is yummy. It has a certain toughness and just enough charring to make it yummy. I loved the burrito I ordered as well as the quesadilla. I haven't tried any of the more specialty items in their menu.

The atmosphere was so so and a bit divy. However, though I can't say the food was the greatest, I actually crave it and want to come back and eat there. In fact, I had lunch and came back there for dinner one time. 

Also, the beans and rice were on the bland side. It can be seasoned better; but I don't mind it as I prefer bland than too salty. I just salt it a bit and problem is solved.

The big plus is it is so cheap! You get a lot of food for the price!
