I really want to like them.  really.  The owner is cute and friendly.

The truck is easy to find but...

the name is a misnomer and the sloppy joe tasted like mexican food.

I wanted to go have a sloppy joe ($6 each, I need two to fill up) not, carnitas.  And for the price, I can get better tasting carnitas at alot of other places.

The pork was tender enough, overly salty, not spicy, and did not
taste like a sloppy joe.  I liked the egg and pickled onions but, that was the best part.

I think they keep the price high to make up for volume but, if you have to eat in your car it should be cheap, greasy, and yummy.
