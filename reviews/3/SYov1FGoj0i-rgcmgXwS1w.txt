I don't eat at Cafe Rio a whole lot unless people from work drag me along. This time we were in the area during work and they wanted to stop by. The food was fresh and the service was fast even though there was a line forming when we arrived. 

I ordered a chicken burrito and it gets toasted in the oven after it's filled with chicken, beans and rice so it's nice and warm when you get it. The hot sauce was good too and had a decent kick to it. I would come here again if I were in the area. 

Don't forget to get your rewards card stamped too, because I always forget to carry it with me. After 10 stamps you'll get a free meal!
