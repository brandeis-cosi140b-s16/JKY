I like this place sober.  Most people go to restaurants like this when they are full of booze.  I have never had a bad or off meal here and the service is fast and friendly.  My favorites are the rolled tacos, bean burrito with cheese, or if I am really feeling decadent - the carne asada fries.  Also, it is important to note that their beans taste like beans my Grandma would have made.  There is no Pinesol aftertaste in the food.  Do you know what I mean?
