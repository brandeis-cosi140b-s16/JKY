"Don't make me repeat myself."

QDoba made a big change when all the toppings including guacamole and cheese became free and included.  I applaud this change and hope it becomes the case at competing places.  I had to keep asking for more of the toppings.  Back when I had to pay extra for guacamole I got a lot more guacamole, same for the queso.  You can still achieve this but you have to ask twice.

I would have given an extra star or half if I hand't battled to get my toppings.  If it is free I want tons of it.  I am that kind of greedy eater.  This isn't unique to QDoba, I also have to repeat myself at Chipotle.  Think of a reasonable amount of whatever and then double it.  If I ever have to ask a fourth time I usually don't go back to a restaurant. we didn't get to that level.

I really like the queso here but if QDoba's policy for toppings could be infused at Moe's then I would 100% switch to Moe's because I like it better.
