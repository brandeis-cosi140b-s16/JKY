The name Carefree, especially to the uninitiated in the context of Arizona, conjures an image of an idyllic, expensive, possibly old money paradise where all undesirable elements and rough edges have been safely "sanitized" out of existence. In my experience, that's not that far from the truth. However, the purification process is not perfect, and some remnants of the outside world have survived the cleansing.

Carefree Station, in the sparse Spanish Village area with expansive outdoor seating for the appropriate months and few diners below the age of 50, is the haven of one such out-of-place artifact, a schizophrenic (or quantum, depending on one's nerd background) ethnic menu that, sharing in inspiration with a chain named after a decadent dairy dessert, not only can't decide what it wants to be when it grows up, it can't even decide what it wants to be in the present.

(Traditional) American?
Cajun/Creole?
Chinese?
Japanese?
Mexican?
Southwestern?
Thai?

As might not be surprising, the result of the identity disorder was somewhat above the meager expectations of thoroughly average for the unfortunately heavy "sushi nachos" ($15) with surprisingly solid ahi, but the unforgivably bland thai beef ($15 for the petite) did not fare as well in the initial international evaluation.

Desserts are huge, the best part of the meal, and a bit more rationalized. The summer sorbet special was a light, refreshing, if a bit too sweet compliment to the more flashy chocolate volcano cake, replete with hard cocoa shell and a stream of fiery rum lava.

I'd probably never come here (again) on my own by choice as I'd rather exit the bubble to a nearby town with more options, but the Carefree Station is a surprising oasis of commensurately priced character and culinary chutzpah in an otherwise antiseptic city.
