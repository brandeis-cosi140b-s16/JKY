Love this restaurant. I went with a group of friends for Taco Tuesday. We were a group of 9 and they seated us super quickly which was amazing. They have $2 tacos and $5 margaritas! They were DELICIOUS! Our server was Carn and she was the best, so patient and so nice. I will definitely return, no doubt. Especially for Taco Tuesday. The environment is great, it's a little noisy, but not too bad at all and they were playing the best music. If you haven't been yet, go! They're right next to Postinos and Federal Pizza, which I will be trying next!!
