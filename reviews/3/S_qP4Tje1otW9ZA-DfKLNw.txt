I had a rather interesting first time experience at La Bamba. Stopped in for a quick bite to eat with a friend. We each ordered one steak taco. In Spanish we said, "Un taco de asada." The cook was taking a rather long time to make two tacos, only to later see in front of us two huge steak MEALS. Apparently there was some miscommunication... He must have understood two steak meals, not two steak tacos. The manager was there with him and it was a rather awkward situation. No one was really saying anything. There were a lot of back and forth looks. I ended up being the one having to step up and speak. I told the manager I'd be willing to pay for one of the carne asade (steak) meals, but not both. My bill of what would have been 5 bucks turned into about $15. He sort of laughed off the situation and accepted my deal. It bothered me that I had to come up with a compromise when it was not my wrong doing. The meal was fine. It was a generous amount of meat served with red rice, beans, tortillas, and a huge grilled jalapeno. Does anyone actually eat the jalapeno? Just wondering. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't awesome. Honestly, the situation probably just left a bad taste in my mouth.
