We came here on Superbowl Sunday which happened to be nice and quite. I was extremely grateful for that! 

We started off with the fresh Guacamole dip ($8.25). It is my favorite way to start a Mexican meal! I like the fresh pieces of jalapeno, tomato, onion and a squeeze of lime. I love when  my guacamole has a thick and chunky consistency. This was delicious! 

My main dish was the Camarones Abuelito Timo. It was plump Gulf shrimp stuffed with cheese, peppers and wrapped in bacon and deep fried. It was good but not great because it was little bit too salty for me. I had to peel off some of the bacon to make it a little less salty. 

I saw that they had a Tres Leche Cake on their dessert menu but they ran out! We settled on a cheesecake that tasted similar to the Tres Leche but it wasn't my favorite. I'm not a big fan of cheesecake but it still tasted decent.
