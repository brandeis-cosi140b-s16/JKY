The cilantro lime vinaigrette costs $1.00. I wasn't aware of that when I asked for some but it was pretty tasty. The sour cream is $0.59 as well which is weird to me. So I ordered tacos and the only thing it came with was meat, lettuce, and Pico De Gallo. That's it? Everything else costs money? I ended up spending $13 on two tacos, rice and beans. That's not an unaffordable amount, but if I got the tacos just as they came with nothing in it, they would be boring. The rice was very plain. No flavor. The horchata was really good too.

Overall, decent food but expensive for what you get.
