I've eaten at Chipotle about 26,327 times in my life, so it's no surprise no matter which location you choose. This Gainey Ranch location is quite roomy, which is good, because this neighborhood is quite sparse on good lunch spots even though a growing number of people work in the area.

If you're going to lunch at this location, you have to get there before 11:06. If you get there after, prepare to be standing out the door, pissing away your lunch break and sweating to death. This happens every day. From my office I can see the entrance. 

Depending on who dishes up your food, you'll get a good-sized portion. They seem to load up chicken burritos to full capacity, but skimp a bit on the barbacoa and carnitas. You've been warned!
