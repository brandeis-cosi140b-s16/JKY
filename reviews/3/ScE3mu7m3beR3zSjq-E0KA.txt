In town for the weekend and my girlfriend found this little taco place. The tacos here are pretty darn good. She and I split a shrimp taco, carne asada taco and a pork taco. They were all pretty tasty. They have a bunch of homemade salsas but none really knocked my socks off. I tried five different salsas hoping one would catch my attention but I was kinda disappointed. Luckily the tacos were really good.
