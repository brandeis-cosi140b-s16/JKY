Decided to visit Chronic Tacos in the charming Las Vegas suburb of Summerlin, Nevada. Glad I made the trip up from Los Angeles. The staff were super friendly, and helpful. I ordered a carnitas burrito, my two friends ordered a shrimp burrito, and a carnitas burrito, and we got two orders of flautas for the table, chicken and beef. I loved my burrito and the flautas. My friend said her carnitas was bland, a problem easily remedied with gringo bandito or some of their house salsa. The meal was overall very tasty. The wall of the restaurant features a Chronic Tacos logo over a huge skyline of the Las Vegas strip. It was cool, except people wrote stuff all over it with magic marker. The mens room was vandalized with graffiti too. This Chronic Tacos had it's own bar, and artwork painted and embossed into the floor: a giant taco, the corporate logo, the words: Chronic Tacos, among other things. A shaded dining area exists outside for al fresco dining on days the temperature drops below 100 degrees. Glad I came by Chronic Tacos in Summerlin, NV. It was a great way to spend my labor day lunch with friends.
