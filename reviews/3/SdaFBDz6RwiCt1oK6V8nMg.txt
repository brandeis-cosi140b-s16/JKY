So I had high expectations because I'm such a fan of Postinos, and I probably hyped it up too much in my mind...

Cute, stylish decor, as expected. We opted to sit on the patio (unfortunately) because it was an hour wait for an inside table. It wasn't too bad because they have misters.

We were served water and chips and salsa right away. Thank god because I was starving! I really liked the salsa. Not a big fan of the chips though. Too thick for my taste.

I got the cucumber mint aqua fresca and OMG...it was SO good! It sucked it down so fast! Our dining companions got the pineapple and said it was too sweet.

And since it was our first time at the taco house, we got tacos. The carne asada, baja fish, shrimp, and fried fish. They were all so so good! Carne asada was so flavorful and the meat was really tender. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and there was a good amount of shrimp.  I was disappointed that there was such a small amount of fish in the fish tacos, but they were delicious. I was really pleased with the food. In fact, I usually take pics but we dove right in and they were gone before I got a chance!

Where they lose 2 stars for me is that I feel it is overpriced and I received lackluster service. Which is weird because I don't think Postinos is overpriced. But really, $4 for ONE small taco? Come on! That's ridiculous.  Also, the service was, meh. Not friendly, indifferent really. It wasn't rude but it wasn't the great service I usually experience at Postinos, so I thought that was bizarre.
