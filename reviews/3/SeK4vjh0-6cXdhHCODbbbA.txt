It's pretty standard Mexican food but the standouts are the tortillas.  Even if you aren't a "fajita person", you should suck it up and have them here just so you can experience the hybrid fry bread/tortilla combo they have going on.  

Our server was prompt and friendly.  I fully expected that we'd have to wait on a Friday evening but we didn't which was great.  The margaritas need some work.  They taste like the Cuervo version in grocery stores.  (I like the Cuervo version but obviously, I can have that at home.)  More veggies in the fajitas would be great too.  The chicken was super tasty but they sat atop a pile of raw-ish onions.  There was A ring of green pepper and A ring of red pepper.  (More peppers please!)  

It's a loud atmosphere so if you're looking for a venue to have "that conversation", I would suggest going elsewhere.
