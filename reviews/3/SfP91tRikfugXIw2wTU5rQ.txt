It was nice to see this place at Northlake - like a breath of fresh air from all the Chipotles and Moe's around Charlotte.

The menu selection provides some interesting combinations.  I tried the Summer style burrito that included mango slices and avocado.  Pretty refreshing.  The bag'o chips provided were a bit stale, but the fresh chopped "Salsa" was neat and rustic.

A bit over priced for a moderately sized burrito and stale chips.
