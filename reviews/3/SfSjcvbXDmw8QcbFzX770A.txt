So I've only been here twice... the first time it was only their first couple weeks of opening. Bad service but I gave them a break being fairly new. My husband hated his food and had no desire to go back. Finally got him to agree to give it another shot. The portions were huge! Definitely get more than what you pay for... he actually liked his food this time. I had regular ground beef tacos being that it was a taco Tuesday special. It was ok, nothing to die for. Our service we received was great! Everybody was very nice and making sure we had what we needed and we're comfortable. I would definitely go back and try a few more things on the menu. Atmosphere was nice.
