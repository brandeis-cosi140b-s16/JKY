Not a huge fan of this location. I like the set up of this locale but not really a big area outside to dance around at like the other locales I've been to and we came about 9pm on a Saturday night and I was oddly surprised to have seen such an 'older' crowd for lack of better words at this bar. I mean granted still a lil early I suppose but a very large group of older people that night. The service was good though, I will admit. We ended back there Sunday morning for brunch, and to my surprise it was a great cure to a very 'hot mess' of a night. And if you're a bloody Mary fan, they have $3 build your own on Sundays!
