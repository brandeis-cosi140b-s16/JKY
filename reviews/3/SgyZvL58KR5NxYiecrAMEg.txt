Let me start by saying they have good breakfast burritos. But I haven't found anything else I would recommend. Tacos were massively overcooked and the shredded beef was flavorless and dry. the stuffed sopas with ground beef were also dry and flavorless. Cheese enchiladas were served cold- so the cheese didn't melt. Will go back for breakfast though.
