We have previously loved this place, but our last visit, on Sunday evening, was less than great. Service was a bit slow initially, but the real problem was a very messed up order. Ordered cheese dip, didn't get it. Two of our 4 meals had MINOR adjustments (add cheese, no onion) that weren't made. When I ask them to fix it, the response is, "you're gonna have to wait a few minutes." When my meal comes back, it doesn't have onion, or two other ingredients that were supposed to be on it. Chip basket went empty the whole meal. Never did get the bill--finally just went to the register, where I also had to ask for the carryout boxes. Service matters to us, and they're going to have to do better on an almost $50 meal if they want us to keep coming back.
