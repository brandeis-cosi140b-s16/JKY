We went there last night for the first time and we weren't overly impressed. While the pork was good, there were quite a few customer service issues during our visit. As someone who can't eat flour tortillas due to a food sensitivity it was very disappointing to hear that they didn't have any corn tortillas made at 5pm on a Sat. Especially since they have menu items that are listed as being served in a corn tortilla, including that night's special! A man behind the counter who I assume was the manager was very proud to tell the line of customers that their tortillas are made fresh unlike the Chipotle across the street. But, I've always been able to get a corn tortilla when I asked for one at Chipotle. The order line seem very unorganized and my husband had to tell the same employee four times that he wanted rice & beans beacause she wasn't paying attention the 1st three times! When we got to the cashier we had to wait because no one else behind the counter seemed to notice that cashier was on the phone & a line was forming. It may be awhile before we give this location another try.
