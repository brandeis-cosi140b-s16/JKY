Here's the deal...Prior to Moon Valley Grill opening at 6:00 AM this was the only game in town for an 8:00 AM blood marry.  The early opening time and $1.50 blood bar are what first attracted me.  I've continued to go back because the Mexican food is ridiculously cheap and in my opinion pretty good!

The Good - Drinks, Food, Prices

The Bad - Service, Atmosphere, Clientele

The Ugly - The bartenders
