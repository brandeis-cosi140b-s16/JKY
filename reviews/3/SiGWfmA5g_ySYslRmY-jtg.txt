I honestly really wanted to like this place, but it unfortunately ended up disappointing me.

Lets start with the good. This place is seriously nice inside. There's a great patio area and it seems like a really cool place to hang out with your friends. Very clean inside and very friendly staff. I'd be happy to spend a few hours here with some good company.

From then it starts to go bad. I was just passing by and decided to try this place. It was such a slow night that they were closing up 3.5 hours earlier than their listed hours (closed around 10:30pm). I got a beef taco to go and price to size it was actually a really good deal. The tortilla was warm and reminded me a little like flat bread. There was high quality lettuce and everything looked great. Then I bit into it. It was way too salty that I couldn't taste anything at all. 

I think I'll come back in a couple weeks (if they're still open then) and try the food again. It has a lot going for it and other than the salt content would be an awesome place to relax.
