It's been a long time since I've dined at a Garcia's.  
Nice to have one in the neighborhood at a location that hasn't seemed to be successful for anyone else that's signed in there.

I had the soup and salad -that tortilla soup with taco salad.  
Eh, it was okay.  I wasn't especially hungry so can't say I was wanted or expected much more than a soup or salad.

Now the margarita on the other hand was alright.  I got the one with the Cuervo (?) and Grand Marnier and hubby got the one with the Sauza and Grand Marnier served in a shaker along with a martini glass.
I was pleased with what I got.  And I had a second one and asked for the Grand Marnier on the side.  Mmm mm
Gotta love a Grand Marg on the rocks with a bit o' salt.
