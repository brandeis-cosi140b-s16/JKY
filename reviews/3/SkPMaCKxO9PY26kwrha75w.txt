We came for Dia de Los Muertos Celebration in downtown Mesa....they could not handle the traffic coming in from the festival.  The service was not great and we only came in for drinks.  The poor customers trying to get seated for food that was a longer wait as this place is not really that big.  

So, 30 minutes later we finally got our drinks at the bar and I will say my margarita was pretty good (3 stars not 2).  We had a server come by and ask if we wanted chips and salsa, we said, YES..never came.  The whole establishment was pretty overwhelm.  Downtown is begging for a great and fun establishments to pop into and after this experience this will not bring me back to Margaritas Grill. Sorry.
