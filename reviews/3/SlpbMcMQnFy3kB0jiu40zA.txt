Was at Arizona Mills Mall headed to the movies and walked past the food court and saw that  America's Taco Shop was there, this is a place that I have been wanting to try, not necessarily in the mall, but just in general so I took the chance and headed over before the movie.

 After studying the menu I went ahead and ordered the Carne Asada Burrito, which had caramelized onions, pico de gallo, carne asada and asked for the extra spicy hot sauce to go with it.

I want to say the burrito was mind blowing, but it was bland to me, it had a great opportunity to be a mouthwatering experience, but it wasn't, I was kind of of looking forward to the caramelized onions, but really they were just like slightly saut√©ed and its kinda like being invited over to a friend's house for fajitas and finding out that they used the frozen onions & bell pepper mix for it. It just wasn't as good as I had hoped it to be, but for a fast lunch time meal it would be something to check out, not something for a dinner, for dinner I just want more flavor.
