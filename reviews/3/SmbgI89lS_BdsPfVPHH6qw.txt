I'm not an authority on Latin American food but it seems rather authentic to me. The staff is nice and they do have a few who can speak English. The menu has English translations which is also very helpful!!  We got the chicken flautas, chicken in a jalepeno cream sauce and the carna asada. The flautas were okay but you could really taste the lard in the tortillas. The Carna Asada was a little over cooked for sure but had a great taste. The chicken was delicious and was very spicy but yummy!! Neither of us were a fan of the tortillas that came with any of the dishes. We just could really taste the lard that they used which is not something either of us is used to. Over all though it's a decent little spot to check out and they are open late.
