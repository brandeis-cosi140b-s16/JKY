Im not sure what kind of person checks yelp for a Mexican fast food joint with a drive thru  - usually best for after the bar closes. It's what you would expect. Greasy, filling, sauce laden, cheese covered Mexican food in a styrofoam box.
75% of the menu comes out of a deep fryer - these places are on every corner in Scottsdale and are pretty much the same. Not as cheap as they should be but they are sure to fill you up. 
Seriously - how do you review 5 rolled tacos with cheese...
