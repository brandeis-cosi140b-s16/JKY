I had never been to a Qdoba before and was driving across town and was looking for someplace that had a menu item that did not have meat.  Mexican inspired places always have bean burritos. As soon as I entered I realized it is very similar to Chipotle. They had a grilled veggie burrito that was listed as vegetarian so I got one.  I think I might have been happier swapping out the rice for onions and peppers but it was a pretty good burrito and wasn't running juice down my arm.
