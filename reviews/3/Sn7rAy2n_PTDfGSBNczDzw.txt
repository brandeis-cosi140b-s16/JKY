Great for a late night snack or meal! Decent Mexican food and cheap prices. I have had the chicken tacos, breakfast burritos, tamales and shredded beef tostada. So far it has been good. The register person is usually just there to take your order and get your food to you. Don't expect much else because you are not paying much for the food or service. 99 cent chicken tacos on Wednesday!
