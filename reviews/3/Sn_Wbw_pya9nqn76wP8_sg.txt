I have loved Baja Fresh since the beginning....but something has tragically happened recently.  There is no consistency at this Baja.  The burritos are either really good or "so-so."  Their black bean salsa is so good that I could drink it.  But lately, it's been watered down with no real flavor.  I know there has been a lot of competition for good Mexican food in this area- but come one, Baja!  Don't go down without a fight!
