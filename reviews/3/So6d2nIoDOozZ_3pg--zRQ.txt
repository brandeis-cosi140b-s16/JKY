I have to downgrade my review for THIS location, which my husband and frequent at least 2X a week.  Have to admit we LOVE us some Chipotle BUT....EVERY time we go into get lunch or dinner they are out of something (chicken, rice, forks/knives, soda, Iced tea).  Tonight we went for dinner.  Hubby ordered a large soda and was SO looking forward to a Coke Zero (he usually doesn't drink it..just water...so this was a special order!)...to find out that it's out.  So we tell the cashier who yells in the back for someone to switch out the line.  We wait.  We check for Coke Zero...still looking like Sprite out of the soda dispenser.  We wait some more.  Go back and check and it's still running clear as Sprite.  So I ask the worker about it and she says, "Oh..we are out of Coke Zero.  Like completely out!"  Ummm...well the only reason we bought a large drink was to get a Coke Zero.  And it would have been nice to know that info the FIRST time we asked you about it being out!!  And perhaps you should put a sign up for future customers?  We slide on over to grab some forks for our meals.  There are no forks.  The place has no customers except maybe 6 other people who are eating their food, nobody in line and all the while there are literally 7  workers standing on the line and they're not fully stocked?  How does that happen?  My guess is poor management.  Andale, Chipotle!  Get your act together.  I see that I'm not the only reviewer writing about this, either.
