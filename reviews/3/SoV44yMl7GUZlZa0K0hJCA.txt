El Rinconcito defines lowbrow dining.  Honestly, your average diner would probably walk in and then turn around and head back out the door.  This is no frills slumming.

Flies were buzzing all around but I opted to man up and brave the pests.  Some tables and a mess of chairs awaited me in an old run down structure.  

I ordered a grande asada taco and pambazo.  To my dismay there was no pork available so many menu items were not possible to order.  The food was good.  I didn't care for the pambazo but I had never tried it (or heard of it for that matter) and wanted to try something new.  It's a mix of chorizo and potato with cheese and lettuce served on a sandwich soaked in a red chili sauce (be advised this is very messy).  Win some, lose some with new experiences.  The taco was excellent and rivals that offered by Tacos Atoyac.  They served it with a side of red and green salsas.  Amazing salsa!  This isn't your average weak salsa.  It has a great kick.

The major downside here was the service.  Not attentive and I grew frustrated waiting on my check.  My plates had been cleared away, I had an empty Coke bottle and four different employees kept walking past, saying nothing to me.  I even told my waitress that I was finished.  With no plans for the evening I decided to wait and see how long it would take.  After 20 minutes I just got up and asked for the check.  Being my first visit I cannot say if this is normal here.  While annoying I'd give them another shot as the food was very good.

I'd say it's well worth a visit if your crave cheap and tasty Mexican eats.  Just be warned that service might leave some to be desired and the place itself is a dump.  Personally, the latter does not bother me but might be for others.  It has "character" as they say.
