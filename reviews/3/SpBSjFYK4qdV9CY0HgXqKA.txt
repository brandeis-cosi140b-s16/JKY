It seems like every time I go to a new city I ask, "Where is a great Mexican restaurant." I found an OK one, but not a great. 

I ordered 3 chicken tacos and a steak burrito. Let's break that down 

Food: 

Chicken Tacos ~ Your choice of flour or corn tortilla. The meat, my favorite meat, chicken. It was orange like Sunny D. That would lead me to think it is PACKED with marinated flavor. Sadly, it wasn't. I loaded these suckers up. Corn salad, green salsa, cheese, lettuce, sour cream, and fresh limes. You wanna know what was the best flavor on that dish? The fresh lime wedges I squeezed on top. 

Steak Burrito ~ The thing was huge. Marinated steak, but again, I sadly would not have guess that just by tasting it. All the same toppings were added as the tacos, minus the lime wedges, and the most packed punched flavor? The cheese.  Where was the incredible home made salsa taste? The melt in your mouth, marinated for hours steak? 

Saving Grace: 

Price ~ 3 tacos = $5.95. Huge burrito = $5.95. 

Speed ~ Fast. In and out in under five minutes. 

I can't complain to much. I'm full and I didn't break my wallet.  But in today's day and age I will pay high for flavor if I have to. I haven't tried much Mexican food around Madison but this place is on my, "I'm starving and need to energize now" list. 

One star because it was cheap. 
Two stars because the portions were worth the price. 
Three stars because I'm full. 

I'm going to give it another go in a month or so. Try some of the other items and see if something.... pops.
