Living in metro Phoenix I never expected to eat at any Mexican joint that was not a hole-in-the-wall.  Why?  Because those places always have the best food.

However, I opted to try Manuel's Mexican Food before work recently.  I drive by frequently and always see the full lot and thought it couldn't hurt to give 'em a go.

My go-to Mexican meal is enchiladas and I did not stray from my normal plan of attack.  The meal was supplemented with tasty chips and salsa as is standard in an Mexican sit-down worth eating.

The enchiladas were not spectacular but good and worth the price (around $10.25 if I recall correctly).  My meal was served on a sizzling, gigantic plate with beans and rice.  All around very tasty.  I was very impressed with the service as well.  The waiter was very attentive.

I must be honest that a place like Manuel's will never be my first plan of attack when it comes to Mexican food.  But should I have company that wants to actually sit down to a good meal in nicer surrounds not offered by the standard hole-in-the-wall, I will probably take them to Manuel's.
