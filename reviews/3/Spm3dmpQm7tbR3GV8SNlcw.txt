La Hacienda is a GREAT late nite joint if you're in a the mood for food that isn't from the drive through. It serves as a great convenience for larger groups and the services is AMAZING. I have dined here on several occasions and I have never had a bad experience with a server.

The food overall is solid. You're started off with chips and pico de gallo ( bottomless). The Pico is possible the best pico I've tasted at a restaurant. I always ask for more. The menu is extremely large. It's hard not to find something on it that doesn't t appeal to you no matter how much of a picky eater you are. I am a fan of their taco dinner or fajitas. Both meals come with spanish rice, pinto beans ( which I do not care for and never order) and the toppings for your meal. Please be warned, guac and sour cream is extra. I am OK with the guac being extra but why pay more for sour cream that comes in a small container that is the side of a quarter? I do feel that they are being very cheap on that front. Sour Cream should come with every meal free of charge! Also, I don't care too much for their chicken so I stick with steak. 

Overall, the food is good. Location is good. Service is good. Their location is perfect. It's really how they are able to make money. You're near downtown and UW Madison Campus. Lots of bars around the area and they stay open very late. Winning recipe for making profit.
