Location - Southwest off Russell / I-215 ; location is a little secluded which is kinda weird. It's located behind a brand new apartment/condominium complex which looks vacant for the most part. It's not visible while driving down Russell so you're gonna have to turn into the plaza and drive towards the back. Parking is decent. 

Atmosphere - Clean and very vibrant ; huge restaurant with tons of tables and chairs. I was the only one eating , however the location is new so it's probably going to take awhile before potential customers hear about it. Decor has traditional Mexican flair to it, complete with Mexican music. Huge windows all around the wall so there's tons of natural light. 

Service - Quick service type ; you order at the counter and food is brought out to you. My order took 5 mins so no complaints from me. Lady behind the counter was friendly and helpful. 

Food - Decent ; it's not bad but it isn't mind blowing either. I ordered their Torta al Pastor and a drink. Personally, the pastor lacks flavor. It's not horribly bad. I was satisfied with my meal but I wish it could've been better. I guess I'm spoiled by Taco y Taco and Tacos el Gordo's Pastor offerings. On the plus side, their Tortas are huge. I had a stuffed belly after I devoured it. 

Final Thoughts - Food is OK. It's my first time and I can't really judge of a horrible experience because of my first meal. I'll definitely be back and try their Asada or something. It's a good quick place to grab a bite if you're craving Mexican food . Just keep your expectations at bay though .
