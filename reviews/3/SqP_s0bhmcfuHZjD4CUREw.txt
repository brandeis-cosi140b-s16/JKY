After hearing about Chino Bandido for awhile now I decided to go there the other evening. I didn't really know what to expect other than hear people constantly talk about it. When I arrived I had a wonderful woman give me samples of everything on the menu which was a huge bonus because I really had no idea what I wanted. The food was pretty good and if I lived closer I'm sure I would visit again but I can't say that it was worth the drive to go get it. My attitude is if I'm in the area I would go again but it certainly for me is a been there done that.
