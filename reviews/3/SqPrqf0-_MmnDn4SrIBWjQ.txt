Sometimes you get an undeniable craving for a lengua burrito. If you don't mind your walk-in order taking ten minutes without a line, this might be the place for you!

If you really like lengua with cilantro and onions, you're set. Because that's what this burrito is: an arm-sized burrito stuffed with nothing but lengua, cilantro, and onions. But if you want a burrito, maybe look elsewhere- not sure why there weren't any vegetables, beans, rice, cheese, guac, etc on my burrito at all and the menu doesn't really say anything to explain it. On the bright side, I didn't have to worry about filler bites with just rice and lettuce or anything, but this wasn't what I was expecting when I ordered a burrito.

The salsa bar up front is stocked with radishes, onions, jalapenos, and various salsas- the green and red were both better than I expected, and I preferred the red. Wish I'd gotten more.
