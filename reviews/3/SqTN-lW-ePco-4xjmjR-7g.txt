My daughter wanted to be sure to bring me here during my visit because it is one of her favorite places to eat now.  I can see why.  The atmosphere is very nice, the prices are reasonable and the food is very good.  Today was "Chimichanga Thursday" so I got a Chicken Chimichanga for only $1.99!  I asked the waiter how much it would be to add in rice and beans (if I'd seen how big it was I would have seen I didn't need anything else) and he told me $3.  I said, for both? And he said yes.  I'm sorry, but I believe the waiter should know how much the food costs and when I got the bill it said I was charged $1.99 each for the side dishes.  I didn't complain but I did knock a dollar off my usual 20% tip.  If he had told me it was the right price I wouldn't have done that.  He was nice enough, but I got charged $2.39 for one cup of coffee and he never did come around to see if I wanted a refill--nor did he refill our water either.  I mean, this is ARIZONA,  you should refill people's water in a restaurant.  No brainer.  You would think.  I would still come back here, just be more aware and assertive.
