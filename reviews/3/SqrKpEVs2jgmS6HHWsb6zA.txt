I stopped in for lunch, and found this to be like many other Mexican places in the valley - not bad, but nothing spectacular, and not really worth making a special trip to.

I ordered a steak chimi with rice. Both were decent, as were the chips and salsa. Nothing really jumped out at me.

I suppose it's a decent place, but I've been happier at some of the chains like Macayo's or Arriba.
