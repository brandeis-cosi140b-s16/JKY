Went here for lunch.  The lunch menu is the traditional items you'd expect at a Mexican food restaurant.  I've also been here for dinner and the food is better for dinner, IMO.  I do like the way the food is New Mexican style here.  Great Red Sauce!

Anyway back to the lunch review..  I love the variety of sauces they bring out with the chips.  There's a simple lunch menu where you can build your own combos or order the traditional "bundled" items.  The food was good tasting and good quality, but nothing spectacular.  Again, I think if you ordered the full combo dishes for dinner you get more of what they are famous for. (New Mexico style, great chili rellenos, etc..  

A great treat at the end is the complementary sopapillas!  Very good.

So, why 3 stars and not 4?  The service was friendly but slow and not super attentive.  When i used the restroom there were two large soap dispensers and they were both empty!  This means no soap for customers or employees!  Yuck.  This freaks me out when I find out stuff like this in restaurants and to be out of soap in both containers means no one is paying attention for quite a while.  Opening the door from the inside was a chore too because they were set up with air dry only machines, no paper towels to grab the handle that all those other people who couldn't wash their hands grabbed.  For me this means grabbing some TP and two fingering the door open.  Ok, I'm a little strange, but still..

This place has great potential to be 4-5 stars for me; they just need to give a little more care for the basics.
