The food is really good here, if there are a couple of major gripes about this establishment is that they close VERY early at 8:00pm. I don't know about most people, but for me dinner is about at 8 or 9 pm. So its really an inconvenience. But again, if you can make it there before the close, the food is wonderful and the staff are polite. The other gripe I have about this place is that the expect a tip as clearly available on the credit card receipt, which would be okay if they actually serve me, but they never do. It would be the equivalent of adding a tip at a McDonalds, would you do it? Of course not.
