The food is decent but not spectacular. The service has gone downhill and always seems short staffed since the remodel. So, we primarily just get take out which is usually ready in 10-15 mins. The manager is friendly when we interact with him. The margaritas are weak so I never order them here. The kids menu is appealing to my kids so occassionally on a busy night when we need a quick dinner, this is decent enough and actually cheaper and better than Arby's across the street. I spent less than $33 on take out for our family of 4 tonight - 2 were kids meals.
