The Las Vegas strip is filled with a lot of pricey places to eat. It's easy to get lost in the void of expensive gourmet and overpriced mediocre food. If you're really cost conscience you'll eat at the fast food joints like McD's and Sbarro, or maybe stock up on cheap take away from the ABC store.

And then there's the Salsa Cantina. It's a nice little Mexican restaurant with sit down service, pretty good food and decent prices. I found the staff at this one (it's a chain) to be very friendly and efficient. They have plenty of tables and booths for seating and pedestrian traffic doesn't seem that bad. If you don't want to be all shoulder to shoulder eating in a food court tripping over people and their kids, this place is nice to get a booth and somewhat "privacy". 

The atmosphere is pretty fun and it's dim with lots of neon lights and has that feel of actually being in Mexico. But your on the Vegas strip. And just so you know, they have a photographer come to your table and take pictures of you. They'll come back with a free postcard photo of you and then offer you a couple of framed photos. $20 for one or $30 for two. We declined, my iPhone took care of that tidbit of memorabilia for us. 

They have a breakfast special of 2 eggs, meat (sausage patty or bacon) home fried potatoes and corn or flour tortillas for $3.95 up until 12 noon. Add a small Bloody Mary for 99Â¢ or a large for $2. Cheap cheap and very tasty. 

The Lunchtime special offers 2 enchiladas( choose chicken or beef and the beef is not ground beef, but steak), rice and pinto or black beans for $8.95 and $2 coronas. You have a choice of red or green sauce and both are delicious. For happy hour try the 48oz hurricane margarita. If you can't finish it, just take it with you. 

The only thing this place is missing is a mariachi band. But it's a great cost saver while staying on the strip.
