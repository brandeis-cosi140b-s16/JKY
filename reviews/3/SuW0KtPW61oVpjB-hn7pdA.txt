I must say Baja fresh was the veteran (well in Vegas atleast) for the fresh Mexican food trend. If you'd rather have others choose your burrito/taco toppings for you this palce is for you since all of it is already determined for you. I usually get the baja burrito with steak, pretty tasty. I probably like their steak best compared to thier other popular competitors.  I also recently tried the torta with chicken, which is a new menu item.  The grilled vegetables was a nice touch and the bread was pretty good too. But I must say the bread was a bit too fluffy, if that makes any sense? Their prices are about $1.50 higher more or less than Chipotle's or Qdoba because their menu items automatically come with chips. Unlike the others which have it as an option. I really do love the salsa bar, which gives them that little edge. One more plus is they probably have the most menu options. They also help out the community by offering those Baja Fresh fundraiser nights, shows that they care about the communities they cater to. Sad to say I probably visit Baja Fresh the least probably because their food doesn't taste as fresh as the others.
