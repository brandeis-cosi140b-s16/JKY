I felt as though I was sitting in Juarez/ El Paso. The tacos are delicious - elote (corn with cheese) was fabulous. Taquitos (flautas) - WOW!!! Food was fresh, warm, tasty, perfectly seasoned! I can't say enough wonderful things about this place. 

Now - let me warn you - it has absolutely NO atmosphere. It looks like a renovated McDonalds. You go up to the counter and order and sit down at a McD's type table. "Silverware" is plastic. Food comes on a plastic tray on a paper plate or paper french fry type holder. 

You don't come here for the atmosphere - you come here for the food!!!! Yes, the location is quite seedy - but it's just one block north of the 95 off Eastern. Excellent prices!!! If you are from west Texas/southern NM it will take you back in a heartbeat! 

To everyone else, you MUST GO HERE to try authentic TEX -MEX FOOD!!!!!
