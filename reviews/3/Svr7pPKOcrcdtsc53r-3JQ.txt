we're from san diego so mexican places have tough competition for comparisons.  margaritas are great... i had the perfecto and the pomegranate.  not disappointed.  chips and salsa are good since they give you 3 different salsas and refried beans.  the entrees are just okay... the carnitas were not to especial.  and our waiter was not so attentive.
