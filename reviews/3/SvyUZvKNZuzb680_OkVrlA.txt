He had plotted for months. The fish tacos of his youth had disappeared. The world had changed around him. But he had hope. "My big fish must be somewhere," he said. 

He came to hear of a fish taco purveyor, in a place called NoDa. The crowds were thick. The smells were intoxicating. He set out.

With two sturdy shipmates, he entered. He ordered. The menu was promising. The beer was cheap.

Finally, the tacos. Finally.
