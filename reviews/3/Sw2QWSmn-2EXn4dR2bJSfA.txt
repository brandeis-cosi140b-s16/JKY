Fast service at lunchtime, but they forgot the chips in my stuft nacho thing. (It just came out, I can't remember exactly what it's called.) I guess the reviews are true, this crew is kind of inept. But I've only been here once, so I can't really say whether they really suck or not. I know I'm in the minority,  but I have an iron stomach and I like taco bell. It's hard for it to disappoint me.
