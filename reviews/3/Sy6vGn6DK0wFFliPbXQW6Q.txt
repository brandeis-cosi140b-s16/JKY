Had planned to hit La Mestiza on Monday night, but... surprise! La Mestiza is closed on Mondays. So, we drove a block or so to the Odana Road Tienda Los Gemelos. Time: 7:30pm.

+ Still located within the grocery store
+ Looks like they recently expanded; there is a *ton* of seating that wasn't here when I last visited in 2012.
+ Tables, booths, etc - all are updated, and there's also a new little bar area

+ Nice selection of Mexican brews, including Micheladas
+ Reasonable pricing on drinks

+ Perfect menu. Not overwhelming; covers the staples and does so well
+ Reasonable prices

+ 3 tacos: $6. Went with steak, pastor, and chicken. Shockingly, the chicken was the best of the bunch. The steak had a nice sear, but was under-seasoned. The pastor was chewy and largely bland. The chicken was excellent.
- Tri-color chips (red, green, white) were a bit stale and from a bag
+ Salsa was delicious, as were the two complimentary hot sauces (tomatillo and chipotle)

- Service. It was prompt initially, but then we never saw our server (or anyone) afterward. It would've been nice to grab a refill of drinks, but despite standing at the cash register for a few minutes, we couldn't flag anyone down for help. We never received a check; we had to go to the front of the grocery store, find someone working there, explain to them that we needed to pay, and then waited while she went and got someone from the kitchen to help us close out. 

They're open until 9pm, but we didn't see a soul after 7:45pm... not sure what was going on. 

So, while it's good, it's not great. I'd much prefer La Mestiza on any given day.
