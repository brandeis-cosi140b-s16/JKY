Tried this place out just yesterday, and sure it took us a little while to get there since it's a little hidden but once we got there it was all good. The cashier was very nice, and pleasant. The food.. . .it was average. I ordered the carne asada tacos combo, beans okay, rice good, tacos were a little on the bigger side and single tortilla ( and well say whatever but I'd rather the traditional smaller tacos with double tortilla), but hey not too many complaints about size either. I was also somewhat upset the sauces offered were not a bit hot, I certainly like to add some spiciness which Mexican food is associated with, but not possible here. So I guess above all the place is a very standard place for mexican food, the store its self is a little . . .well ugly, but food is decent, and service was fine.
