Stopped in to grab a bite after a trip to the neighboring Target. As far as TB's go, this is one of the cleanest I've seen. The staff was friendly and our order was up in quick fashion. As I typically do, I just went with regular crunchy tacos. The others got Cantina Bowls and Nachos Bell Grande. My tacos were good and everybody was happy with their choices. All in all it was a good experience, however, it was so cold in there, my nipples could have cut glass. It was a nice break from the heat, but OMG! Basically, a four star experience, but the shrinkage forces it to stay down at three.
