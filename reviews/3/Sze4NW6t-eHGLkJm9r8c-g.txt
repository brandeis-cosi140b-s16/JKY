Oh, Chipotle.


I want to really like you, maybe even love you, but I just can't bring myself to do it.

Your rice is mushy, your seasonings are bland, and your meat, while plentiful, is watery. Your line cooks stare blankly at me and don't even ask me what I'd like to order. They seem to be tuned into some other-worldly radio program that only they can hear.

I know that your commitment to ethical food production practices and fair treatment for food workers is so admirable and correct, and I love that about you. You even have unsweetened ice tea, and writings by my favorite author Toni Morrison on your drink cups. 

But Qdoba still has my heart.

It just...tastes better.

We can still hang out if no one else is available, k? :-)
