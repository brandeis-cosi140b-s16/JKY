Not bad, but not worth a trip (and for us, it's a long one). 

Sunday night is probably not the best time to hit a hole-in-the-wall taqueria, but we were on our way home from the airport. Couple people at the bar, cooks camping a back table.

I knew what I was ordering ahead of time, continuing my search for the perfect torta. He got veggie fajitas.

Torta was good, possibly the best I've had in Charlotte, but not the ideal I'm looking for. Teleras bread, no beans, skimpy tomato, and almost an omlette of eggs and cheese (I like mine a bit separated, so I can taste each item distinctly). I asked for extra jalapenos and got 3 pieces. Avocado wasn't quite squishy-ripe, and kept falling out of the sammich, onto my clothes or the table. Plus a huge pile of meh fries.

Veg fajitas were some of the worst we've had, dried out rice, no flavor to the seared veggies at all other than their own. A dash of chili powder, even some salt, would have improved things.

They've got the salsa trio thing happening, yum. Chips were perfect. Prices reasonable (fajitas 8, sammich+fries 7). Service was awesome, and saved this from being a two-star review.
