We came here with family after recommendations from friends.  The food was just ok, and seemed a little over-priced for the quality (and it wasn't that expensive).  We drove from Ahwatukee to try this place out and I would never do that again.  If we happened to be in the area and saw the place I "might' give it another visit, but not really worth a lot of effort.
