Loco Lime is one of those places that I tend to love infrequently as there are things that sing loud and clear....and some things I could do without. It's a killer location with a lively patio and tons of seating -- optimal for a Sunday lunch or any Tuesday (Taco Tuesday). 

As it goes any given day of the week, I love guac. Guac, guac, guac all the time. Loco Lime's fare is definitely a cut above with the table-side preparation and tender care. Throw a candle in that bowl and I'd eat it like a freaking birthday cake. Good stuff. 

Taco Tuesday -- $1 tacos. Why would you need to know more? 

The only thing that tends to lack a bit is the service -- a bit uneducated as far as the menu goes, spotty at times, and a bit uninterested. No deal-breaker, but can tend to be a bit more than lackluster. 

Still love ya, Loco Lime. $1 tacos, guac, and my own bottle of Tapatio is all I need.
