Before a Suns game we were looking for a place to eat.  Chose this one and sat on the cute little patio at the Arizona Center.  Food was just 'ok' (I've definitely had better Mexican in the valley) but happy hour is GREAT with $2.50 margaritas that were quite tasty!  Try the Blue Amigo.  I see us coming back for drinks and snacks but not a full meal.
