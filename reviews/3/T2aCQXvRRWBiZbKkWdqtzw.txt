Atmosphere is great for dining but the "Chipotle-Style" line you go through to order your food while they prepare it in front of you is less than appealing.  But hey... at least you can see what they are doing while making your food? :)

My wife and I had a burro and some enchildas and they were both very good.  The homemade chips are a little greasy but other than that, they have a great salsa bar televisions with sporting events so that you can enjoy a good game while having your Mexican food.
