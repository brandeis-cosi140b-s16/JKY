I am giving this place a three because it is beautiful inside. However, I did not have the best experience as far as service goes. It took 20 minutes to get water. Plus, valet only.. really? The food was ok. The main thing that I didn't like is you couldn't tell which hipster was your server . Confusing because they dont have any kind of uniform.  They did give us a $10.00 coupon because we had bad service. So... eh.
