What: Cousins Night Out
Location: @ the Monte Carlo Hotel
Service: Bartenders were fast; they did have a heavy hand on the alcohol
Takes: This is definitely more of a late twenties-30+ year old crowd.
Live Band: Covered top 40 songs and some oldies
Notes: No cover fee, and $20 for unlimited beer from 9pm-midnight

Bottom line: Not my scene, but if the above sounds like for you, go here for your barhopping fix!
