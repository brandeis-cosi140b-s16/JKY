The food was amazing!  I had the chicken fajitas :)  I had to wait way too long to get a refill and our waiter never offered to refill the chip bowl.  Come to think of it he never asked me what I wanted to drink so I just had water and tried to catch his attention to order an iced tea but that never happened :/   I will definitely return to see if I have better service.  The food is amazing!
