Meh. Loud. Overpriced. $13 for a glass of house wine? Nuts. The improv troupe was phenomenal. Too bad we could barely hear them with the downstairs sound so loud. Would come back to see them, but won't be ordering anything. 

What's sad is that it's a prime location with lots of potential. If they weren't so greedy with their prices, they would actually make more, because this place would be packed with locals. Parking is good, walking through the mall isn't too bad, and the service is pretty good.
