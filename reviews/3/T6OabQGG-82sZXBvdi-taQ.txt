I have eaten at two different locations of Serrano's the one on Power Road and this one. I personally think the food is prepared better and the service is much better.

I think the food is usually pretty good here. I have had an occasional mix up on the order and not getting the same food you ordered. That would be my only issue.

But my observation every time i dine here the place seems understaffed. I see servers with too many tables on different sides of the dining area. 3 different staff take your order, bring your food, and serve drinks. 

I would say A+ on the staff that bring salsa and chips rock! They always get you what you need in a timely manner.
