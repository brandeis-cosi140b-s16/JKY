All their menu choices are great,  never had bad food here. Prices have gone up, regretably. .... last time we went, there were less beans than rice, which was disappointing.  Maybe a fluke? We won't stop going, just less frequently due to prices.
According to witness statements, portion sizes have shrunk.  Come on CB, it's beans, rice and chicken. You do wonders with it, but to raise prices and cut portions?  Filiberto 's is about a mile north.... don't make me go there.
