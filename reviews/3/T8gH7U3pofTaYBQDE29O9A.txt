This restaurant is close to the house so I've been a few times. It is ok. My last visit was for brunch a couple of weeks ago. It was decent. The food was plentiful and seemed pretty fresh but it was just basic Mexican buffet fare. It is economical for a Family brunch out.  Sunday brunch is my thing and this one just didn't do it for me. I think I will keep this as an inexpensive lunch option.
