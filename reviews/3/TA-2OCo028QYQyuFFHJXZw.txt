Ordered the Carne Asada Burrito as many people suggested on the yelp reviews. It was only $4.75 and was big enough to share between 2 people. However meat was excessively salty and did not taste very savory. It's a good, cheap deal but quality wise wasn't amazing. We also ordered the guac and chips which was definitely my favorite part. The guac is drizzled over light, crispy chips. Guac was great and chip weren't oily. Also got a Pastor mini taco.   I wish there wasn't such excessive cabbage in it because it covered the taste of the meat. 

Also wish the salsa bar had more choices!
