Simple, good enough Mexican food.  I can only imagine that AZ has WAY better Mexican food, as Kansas City has places that are leaps and bounds above this place...but it was tasty enough.

We arrived around 7:00 and were one of the last tables to be sat before the whole place was full.  Our waitress was quick and attentive and got our drinks to us.  Margaritas were pretty standard, but slightly strong.  Bonus!

Chips were stale.  They came out with three salsas: a spicy, DELICIOUS tomatilla sauce (which I loved, and I usually don't like tomatillas.  Pleasant surprise!), a mild salsa and a hot chipotle salsa.  The menu says chip refills are .95 cents after the first free basket, but our waitress took the basket and refilled it twice without asking us.  Hmm.  Not sure if that was added on the bill...mom paid (Heyo!) but she didn't say anything so maybe we lucked out.

Our food took quite a while to get out, but I saw a guy carrying out HUGE trays full of plates out to the patio so perhaps we got in right behind those parties.  I ordered the tamales, but ordered two of the green chile variety, instead of one of those and a beef one, as the menu states.  These were...OK.  Lots and lots and lots of masa and barely any filling.  They were covered in a tasty verde sauce and some tasteless cheese.  Since this was technically an appetizer, I ordered a side of black beans (VERY yum) and guacamole (pretty fresh, but I'm an avocado-obsessed freak so I was going to like it either way) but I was so stuffed and only ate half of each tamale.

This place was pretty standard and had some high points, but didn't blow me away.  Their patio would probably be very fun during a warm summer night.  Perhaps another trip!
