Tequileria in Charlotte International Airport was a lively Mexican establishment. The airport party stop for alcoholic drinks and fun foods. Breakfast, lunch, dinner and everything in-between.

I tried to enjoy cranberry juice and hasbrown casserole for breakfast. It was a good, but very light. Also, shredded iceberg and salsa with my morning meal was too weird to actually be acceptable. The culture shock was unreal.
