- Quick and pleasant service
- The bean dip is very tasty (although $.99 for probably two tablespoons is a little odd)
- The red salsa is good
- Not a fan of the green salsa.  I like spicy salsa, not sweet and usually green is spicy
- The shredded beef tacos were delicious, as were the rice and beans
- Good prices and value
