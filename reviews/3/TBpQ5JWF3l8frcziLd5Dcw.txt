We took a ride up the Apache trail to Tortilla Flats, we were there around 1pm and the Saloon was real busy. We were able to sit at the bar and had the pleasure of sitting in saddles. I had the chili for an appetizer, warning it is very spicy hot. I had the taco salad for main dish, it was ok, I was kind of disappointed. My wife had the turkey sandwhich, she was pleased with her food. Very interesting place to eat and worth a stop for lunch on the way to Roosevelt dam.
