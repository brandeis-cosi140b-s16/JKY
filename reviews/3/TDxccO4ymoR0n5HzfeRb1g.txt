Cool bar/restaurant on the strip. This is a indoor/outdoor restaurant that is in front of the Monte Carlo and is a great place to stop for drinks or a meal. We ordered the nachos and they could feed an army.  They not only looked yummy, but tasted yummy as well. They handout coupons as you are walking by, make sure your read the fine print, since they are only good for well drinks. We tried to use them when we ordered drinks and when we ordered lunch, but since we didn't order "standard" well drinks, they were not valid. Service is decent and people watching is excellent. Cool eatery on the strip.
