This place is A-OK. 

Yes, it's in the same building as Sapphires. Yes, there is a separate entrance. No, you do not get to see nekid boobies while you eat your tacos. No tacos and titties. 

We went to this joint last weekend with some friends. I have been really excited about this place for awhile. Seeing all of the awesome reviews and pictures. 
I will admit, I was a bit let down. 
The food was good, but it wasn't extraordinary.

We had - 

Cochanitas Pibul - it was good, but it wasn't the strong flavor I was looking for.
Carnitas - very tender, but again - the flavor lacked a little. 
Shrimp tacos - tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary.
Margaritas - super sweet and they taste like they use a mix. Eh, I like mine tart with real lime and no mixes. 

We shared wings, the house guac and queso. The wings were pretty good, but the queso was a lump of melted cheese with chorizo that was in hard chunks with little spice. Ugh, I keep repeating myself. The guac was good but mediocre. 

I will say the Habanero was delicious. Super spicy and good flavor. 

The service was good and I loved the vibe and decor of the place. 

Overall, I would say it's good food but it's not the best Mexican I've had in town. It's more of like a nice Mexican place with a little above average taste for what you find in town. There are just a few places that really beat this place up on taste.
