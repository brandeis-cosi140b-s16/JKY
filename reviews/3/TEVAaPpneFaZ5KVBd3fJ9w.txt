First time here, and have to say I wasn't blown away. Restaurant was messy: with uncleaned tables and chips on the seats and floor. In defense, they were packed and very busy. First batch of chips were very good, served fresh and warm. The refill chips were cold. Salsa was tasty, but not anything better than Pace or El Pato. 
Had Nana's Special: was better than fair. Red sauce was hot and tasty. Rice and beans were very good. My wife had the chicken chimi, and that was very good and not greasy. Overall, was a good lunch and or service was Very Good!!!
We may try the takeout tamales...
