A gringo friendly Filibertos, with a salsa bar and higher prices is the best way to describe this place. 

From the outside it looks like a newer cleaner style store front Mexican food place. Inside not much of a surprise, menu above, counter to order and get food at and tables.

The menu has Burritos, tacos, salads and enchiladas. Prices are a bit more than expected a lunch will set you back $6-9 w/o a drink. Meals do include a small try of chips if you ask for them. 

They will also give you two small plastic cups to attack their salsa bar with. The red salsa is nothing special. The green has great flavor,  the picco is nice and fresh.

I went with the daily special which was cheese enchiladas with rice and beans for $5.99  In reality this should be a 3.99 dish 4.99 at most. The enchiladas were soft and mushy, likely out of a tray and not made to order.

I may go back to try a burrito but I am in no rush. There are plenty of other Mexican options in this area of town.
