Even worse service than normal today. My burrito was all fixed up, and then I waited and waited for someone to ring me up. Then there was a mixup that took three workers to solve. It shouldn't have been difficult. When I was finally finished getting rung up, the woman who was at the cash register, instead of handing me my receipt, held on to it while she turned her attention to the mixup at her side. 

This Qdoba has consistently had really terrible service, and I'm not gonna go here anymore.
