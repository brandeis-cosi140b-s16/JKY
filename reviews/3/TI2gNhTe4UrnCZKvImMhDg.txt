This location has a big patio and a different clientele than the Scottsdale location (which is the only other Dos Gringos I've been to).  I had never been here before, and at first I thought that the restaurant was the nursery section of a Home Depot or something.  It's not too pretty, but it's functional.  The staff were friendly.  Our server was on top of food and cerveza orders.  I went on a Sunday, and they had $3 Coronas all day, which was nice.  They have a giant Jenga-type game, and bean bag toss game on the patio, which would be fun, except for that when I went there was a motorcycle club hogging all the space.
