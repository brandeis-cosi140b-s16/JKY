It's Qdoba Not Adobe
By The Rue

Qdoba, let me start by asking a question of you,
How in the hell does Chipotle not sue?
Your indgredients are exactly the same,
The menu board is different but it's still lame.

I decided to go with the queso burro,
Chicken for my meat it was so-so,
Add the black beans and some rice,
Asked if I want cheese I didn't think twice,

Added the hottest sauce and sour cream,
Did Chipotle change their name or is this just a dream?
Iced tea was the drink that I decided to pick,
The only thing about this place that will stick.

The final price for my food and a drink,
Was $9.78, yes that does stink,
Nearly ten bucks flushed down the drain,
Just go to Chipotle it tastes the same.

I've never been here before so I can't be upset,
At not knowing what it was all about just yet,
Now I know and next time will remember,
That for lunch this place isn't a contender. 

BONG!!
