After all the reviews I read, and recommendations from friends my wife and I tried this place out.  Both me and my wife love spicy food, but this was too much.  It took away from the taste of the dishes, which otherwise would have been good.

It was hard to taste any flavor because each bite was a mouthful of heat.  We also had a couple of drinks and taste no alcohol, the mix drinks should have been stronger.

The place was just ok, I don't think we would go back.
