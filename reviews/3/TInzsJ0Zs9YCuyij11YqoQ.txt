I go for the volleyball, and that's exactly what they provide.  Based on everyone else's reviews on the food, I will leave me expectations on the low end.. but..  they did have some decent 1 dollar taco specials..  what do you want for that kind of money?  Tuesday night pacifico $2.00's.  Perfecto for me!  The place also has bags, horse shoes, and plenty of seating.  I pretty much dig it.  :)
