After finding myself in a 50 minute wait for sushi and hunger pains greater than I have ever experienced, I had to make a choice. So, it was to the generic Mexican restaurant.

Arriba's has ok food, but somewhat slowish service. That actually didn't matter too much with friends and family around. The margeritas are just OK and someone in my party had to send his back several times because it was like lighter fluid. Yuck.

I think next time I might wait in the 50 minute line, but you should definately try this place on for size. Hopefully, you will have a better experience.
