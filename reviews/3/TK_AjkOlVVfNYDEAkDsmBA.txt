I was in the mood for some fast food-ish Mexican food and remembered that Cafe Rio had just recently opened a location near my apartment so I decided to check it out! 
It looked nice and clean inside which is always a plus. No one likes going to a dirty fast food joint. I really liked the tables for some reason haha thought they were cute. The other reviews were correct that it is Chipotle-esque. Obviously not as fresh or tasty as Chipotle, but still not too bad.
The people working there did seem a tad clueless, but they're young and this place hasn't been open that long so that's ok. I got the vegetarian tacos and I had very low expectations for them, but honestly they were pretty good. The guy never asked if I wanted cheese on them though and I forgot to ask. Not too big of a deal though. Also I had to remind them to give me guacamole since I got veggie tacos. The guacamole was a tad brown but still edible looking. I wish they had actual vegetables to put on the vegetarian items, that would have been awesome! 
My favorite thing was the tortillas for the tacos, they were so delicious! Yum. Black beans were pretty good too. Was just like a ton of black beans and rice for me though cause the tacos were both filled with that and it came with a side of black beans and rice. 
This wasn't the best fast food Mexican experience but also not the worst! Definitely better than SomeBurros and Taco Bell, but not as good as Chipotle. Might come back to give a quesadilla a try and hopefully the staff will have their act together a little more by then.
