Stopped here for dinner on our way home from Tucson. When you want french fries and pseudo-Mexican food, Del Taco is the place. There were a couple of random tires in the parking lot. I ordered my usual Del Combo Burrito. They were out of iced tea... *sigh* Second time of the day that happened. I settled for Sprite. I noticed the dining area was larger than other locations. When our food came out, we were missing an order of fries so my friend had to go back up to the counter. We realized the first order of fries was a large instead of a medium, so we had a lot of extra fries. The second order of fries was hotter and crispier, so we had a good mix. The burrito tasted as it should.
