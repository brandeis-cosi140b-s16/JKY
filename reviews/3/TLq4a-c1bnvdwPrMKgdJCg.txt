The burritos could be a little bigger for the price. It is delicious and takes a little bit because they make it fresh. I ordered a steak Baja Burrito. Comes with free chips. The chips were fresh and light and non greasy. The Burrito shell was kinda falling apart. The Steak was moist and tender with a nice flavor. The Pico De Gallo was awesome sauce. Instead of guacamole there were pieces of Avocado in the burrito which was a nice touch. The Salsa bar rotates its flavors and had a mango Salsa(medium level of spicy). Buy a Large cup and get 99 cent refills for life. Cant go wrong with that.
