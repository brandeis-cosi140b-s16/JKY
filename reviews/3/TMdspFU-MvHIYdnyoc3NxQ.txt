Good breakfast burrito, but if push comes to shove I am going to stick with Jims Burrito for my breakfast burritos instead.   This place was dirty and there is not much sitting room and since they cook it when you order it (which is a plus) it takes a long time to get it.  I will get burritos here again, but not with the family, and not to sit and stay there and eat.
