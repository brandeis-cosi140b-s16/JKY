If you are looking to open that Mexican cook book and try some recipes you will find everything you need here BUT you will pay for it! This place is extremely price gouging! 

Some items you can't get anywhere else so I buy here. Cotija cheese ($8.50) a salty crumbly white cheese to top many a Mexican dish, Chorizo ($12.00) sausages that I open and cook as a mixture to add into egg chilequiles, and as a side to hueuvos rancheros. Note the $5 chorizo is not right, it's super greasy when heated up on the stove. It's meant to be dryer, salty, spicy. A great add in homemade adult macaroni and cheese too. Mmmmm.

The back of the store aluminum garbage bins contain all the dried chilis you may need for mole or your own saucey concoctions. 

I especially love the bug candy! I love to give it as gag gifts! So would you like red, blue, or green hard lollys with a special surprise of cricket, worms, or scorpion! Haha. Pinatas adorn the ceilings and you can watch them make the tortillas from scratch. It's such a festive atmosphere that makes me miss my familia south of the border!
