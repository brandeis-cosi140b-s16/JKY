There is a reason why fast food workers are not paid $15 an hour, they never get the order right. I've been here 3 times and my order is always wrong and their receipt printer takes forever to print!

I asked for a Small Unsweet Tea but they handed me a Large Sweet Tea

I asked for no chips & salsa....there are chips and salsa in my bag. 

Asked for the quesadilla....and I get two tacos.

Thanks crazy chicken!
