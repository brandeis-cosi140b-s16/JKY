Saw this place on Man Vs. Food and had read all the yelp reviews about this place. I was expecting a good meal, and it was descent, but I wouldn't say it is 5 or even 4 stars. The food was ok. I split a chicken quesadilla and ranchero beef torta. The quesadilla really can't even be called a quesadilla, there was barely any cheese on it. The torta was ok, but it seemed dry to me. The meat seemed cooked ok, but it wasn't of the best quality. It wasn't too expensive, so that's a plus. Overall, I just thought it was mediocre. Nothing too special.
