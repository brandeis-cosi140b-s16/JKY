I was more a fan when Vicky's Mexican Restaurant was Mexico City. My boyfriend and I had many of our earlier dates there and I have many fond memories of the time we spent dining there together. So I was overjoyed to learn that Mexico City had not closed but instead relocated only right next door and changed their name.

I ordered two chorizo tacos Mexican style.  I used my student discount and got 10% off the total.  I was unhappy with my tacos. The preparation was straight up lazy.  The toppings were super stingy.  The chorizo was not spicy at all. I didn't even know that was possible.  I wanted more then anything to relive another great meal but that did not happen for me. 

VMR was not worth the trip down Grant Street.
