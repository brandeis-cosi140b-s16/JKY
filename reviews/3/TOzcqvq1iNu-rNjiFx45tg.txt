Average at best and over priced.  Clean, warm and friendly atmosphere.  VERY interesting choice of art work , Not that there's anything wrong with it.  Waiter staff is very nice and friendly.  The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't authentic or worth the price. Refiried beans were watery and prolly rehydrated, nothing special.  Chips were packaged and to thick for my liking.  Margarita's were great. I can't say anything bad about the place but on the other hand, I can't really say anything good about it.  I won't go back for the food, but I'd love to go back on a weekend and have a margarita on the patio.  It just looks like the kind of place that would be very festive and gay!
