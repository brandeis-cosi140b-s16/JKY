Wednesday $1 tacos. Tortillas tacos are deep fried so they cone out very crispy. Must eat them asap otherwise they get stale. Chicken is shredded and very lean which btw they are not cheap with their chicken. Two have me pretty happy, three have me full. 

Breakfast burritos are pretty hefty and tasty. Again, eat right away.
