Went to Vitamin T for lunch today, it is kind of in an odd location, so if my coworker didn't know exactly where it was, I probably wouldn't have found it.  Had 3 tacos with 3 different meats so that I could see what I liked the best here, plus a side of guacamole.  Guacamole was fine, nothing special.  The barbacoa taco tasted very strongly of coffee (menu says that it is coffee rubbed, I just didn't expect it to taste like a cup of joe) and wasn't to my taste.  The Pibil (pork) just tasted odd to me, especially with the pickled onions fighting with the flavor of the pork... actually, the pickled onions were probably the best thing about that one.  But the chicken was very good and fairly spicy, contrary to other reviews I read on here... maybe the chicken was just really good today?

I also got to try my coworker's roasted veggie caramelo, which was the best thing I ate at Vitamin T.  Surprisingly good, especially when topped with sour cream.

Since Maria's closed (man those carnitas were tasty), this is a much better taco joint for downtown than Baja Fresh, but it hasn't hit excellence yet.  I still think they have potential... maybe they can steal Maria's carnita recipe from the now unemployed cooks...

I'll definitely go back to try the chicken in a tamale and have another of the veggie caramelos. As another reviewer said, if you're downtown for lunch, try it.  If you're not, don't go out of your way for the trip.  At least not yet.
