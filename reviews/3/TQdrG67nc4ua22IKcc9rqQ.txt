Great food after a night of drinking. However, you are going to have to wait for a while before you enjoy it. I have never been here, night or day, and had good service. Whether it's sitting and waiting to place your order or waiting to receive your food, you can guarantee being there for like 20-30 minutes. As everyone mentioned, you need to try the carne asada fries. You won't be disappointed.
