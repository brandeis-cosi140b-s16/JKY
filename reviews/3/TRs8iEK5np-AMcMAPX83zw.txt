i loved the decor of the place, it's laid out well.

I enjoyed the hefty serving of guac but the salsa needs some serious work.  Tasted like tomatoes and vinegar, bleh!  Happy hour prices are pretty reasonable for the area.  Ladies night is nice but kind of a slow/boring night.

Word to the wise!!!  DO NOT PARK DOWN WIND OF THE MISTING SYSTEM!!!  My car was coated with junk. Made driving in our bright AZ sun kind of scary!!

I had to take it to be professionally cleaned to get the film off my car.  Major buzz kill
