This is a pretty fancy looking establishment in a great area of town.  It is nice and dark and sexy on the inside too, which was pretty rad.  Ooooh lala.  

The girls and I had the pineapple infused tequila shots (I think it is called the House Shot) and it was pretty yummy.  Went down nice and dangerously smooth.  Yes.  For beers, there are a lot of microbrew drafts on the menu.  I ordered a Milk Stout, which was really creamy and tasty.  

But the food...it was mediocre.  I had the corn and cheddar tamale small plate and it was bland.  The sauce tasted like cream, but the tamale itself had no flavor at all.  I also ordered a pork torta and the meat was okay, but the whole sandwich was not great.  It seemed like my friends enjoyed their tacos, so maybe I ordered the wrong thing.

Our waiter was cool.  He put up with our drunken cougar shenanigans, so props to him.
