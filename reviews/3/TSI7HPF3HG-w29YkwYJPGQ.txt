I have always wanted too check Frijoles & Frescas Grilled Tacos. It super close to the house and seen that location change so many times over the years. New place need check it out. I heard from my brother that the tacos pretty good. I should have gotten but went with Burrito Meal or number #3. It comes with your choice of protein. I went with the carne asada. Burrito split for me the pros and cons. I love the fact portion size is really nice. Not just burrito everything I ordered get your money worth and more. You get  FULL, HEARTY burrito, and take first bite see loading with beans, avocado, and lot of stuff in it. My con is not much flavor in it. The carne asada itself needed more seasoning and overall all the amount of stuff in it makes nothing stand out. The chips and salsa. WINNAH. The chips taste super fresh and nice crispy right out of the fryer. The salsa love it!!!!!! It not your water down or salsa salsa. It more refreshing salsa lots lots of diced tomato, onion, and cilantro. Honest I enjoyed the chips and salsa the best. I also ordered side of refried beans and rice. Nothing stood out for either no "wow" factor. Overall maybe the tacos are on point but right now found the food just ok. 

The service was awesome. The cashier was friendly and explained all my questions great. It open kitchen so if want can see them prepare your food while you wait. Free entertainment while waiting. The menu has nice diversity to choose from typical Mexican fare, even the drinks got nice diversity, and don't forget look at little freezer off side of the main menu board. You might find frozen treat that you like!
