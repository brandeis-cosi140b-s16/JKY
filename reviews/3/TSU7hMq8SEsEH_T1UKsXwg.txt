it looked really interesting when i saw it, and the place we decided to go eat on a sunday was closed, so we went to try Beach house because it was right down the road. 

Upon getting there the place is really confusing, so after walking around it, we found the place to order, on the West side of the building.

I got their chipotle pork burro special. It was huge but the majority of it was veggies and rice, i felt jacked. there was a real chipotle chili inside the burro so that was really cool

the peach lemonade was delicious with lemon twists in it at as well. I'd come back but it isn't the best of mexican food i've had.
