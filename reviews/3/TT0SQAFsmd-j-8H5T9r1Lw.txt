Taberna offers a nicely priced happy hour and spacious patio, however, the food items are hit-or-miss.  In my opinion, they would be far better off serving a basket of good quality tortilla chips rather than the mixture of yucca, plantain, and blue corn tortilla chips that they currently do. The chips are excessively greasy and some of the yucca chips were actually tough and chewy rather than crisp. The two salsas have good flavor, but the greasy chips prevent one from wanting to partake in too much of the chips and salsa. 

The guacamole was average, but would have been much improved with the addition of some peppers to give it a bit of spice.  The tortilla soup is fairly good and has a nice spiciness to it without being overpowering.  The veggie enchiladas also had good flavor, but were quite a bit oilier than I would have preferred and the side of black beans was flavorful, however, the Mexican rice was very bland.

All in all, it's a conveniently located place to go for drinks and a nice patio, however, we probably won't make this a regular place for lunch or dinner.
