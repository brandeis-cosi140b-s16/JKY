THE HOUSE MARGARITA!!!!

Ok just had to get that off my chest because a big pet peeve of mine is house drinks that suck, but when they are actually GOOD, my day is made!  Came here for a weekday dinner and chat with a friend.  Typical cute Mexican ambience going, friendly staff(for the most part) and the chips were fresh... Be warned the salsa is spicy... But I like spice so it worked for me.  I wasn't super hungry so at first I was going to order a taco salad which wasn't too big but then i say they had BEEF TONGUE tacos and of course I had to go there (I immediately was transported back to Mexico in 2003 that time I took a road trip from Cabo to La Paz and stopped at a few,what some might call, sketchy places for a quick bite and each place had their versions of tacos with all the little nasty unrecognizable bits of the animal but taste absolutely AMAZING)
So yes, I went for the beef tongue!  I was a little disappointed that you are not allowed to mix and match tacos or order single tacos... I like options, but whatever. The tacos were ok... Not exactly as life changing as I remember but tasty.  The salsa served with the tacos however was something special... It had fresh ground chilies and everything!  The pinto bean pur√©e that also came with the dish was also tasty.  I sampled my friend's carnitas and it was delicious and I now understand why she doesn't order anything else.  Overall the food was pretty good.  Our server was a little odd but he also seemed pretty young.... He seemed to want to rush us out toward the end of the meal but I will chalk that up to a one off.. I'll be back
