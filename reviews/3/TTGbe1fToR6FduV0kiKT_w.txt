I think Panchero's is still a solid 3-star place, but in general I've noticed that the staff are more upbeat and pleasant to interact with since my last review.  I don't really feel like the burritos I get are super consistent--sometimes it's really really good, sometimes it just seems off.  Not sure why.  I got a chicken burrito the other day with my usual hot tomatillo salsa and for some reason it was ungodly spicy (which it's never been before) and my esophagus was burning the rest of the night.  Yikes.  Not sure what changed, but I've never had that experience and I pretty much order the same thing every time.
