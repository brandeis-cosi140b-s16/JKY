Ended up in the hood after going for a ride at the Ponderosa Stables.  

Shoot I gotta try the authentic Mexican food and lets put this East Coast West Coast thing to rest.  

Pulled out my Yelp app and found Taco Feliz.  3 of us had dinner for 20.00!  My carne asada was pretty darn good and it was huge I could not eat it all.  Fish tacos were just OK needed some lemon/lime on it.

Decided to eat in the car as the place had no A/C and the neighborhood was a little sketchy.   I'm not sure this place solidified the "West Coast has the best Mexican thing"
