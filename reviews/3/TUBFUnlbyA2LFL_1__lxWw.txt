I'm not really sure how I feel about this place yet. I got the chili rellenos, and didn't really care for them...they had a funny windex flavored aftertaste. My hubby really liked his carne asada burrito though. They have a pretty wide variety of things you can order, so I'm willing to give this place another try. I really liked the green salsa (lots of garlic), the red was pretty average. The prices are reasonable. My hubby's burrito was big and full of steak that he really liked. I'll post again and re-rate after I try something else from here :) So, for now it can get a middle of the road.
