Decent for fast food Mexican.  I had a hard taco which was good but not at all warm.  I also had a cheese enchilada which I didnt much care for because it wasn't warm at all so not melty and delicious.   I will definitely have tacos again for quick takeout.   My husband and those two items as well and also a tostada.   His comments were.."pffffff" he was disappointed because of all the good reviews and Check Please Arizona.   Easy cheap fast lunch but there are better choices at same price point.
