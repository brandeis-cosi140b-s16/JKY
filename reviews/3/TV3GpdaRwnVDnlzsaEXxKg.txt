I was iffy about trying this place because of some of the bad reviews but the husband and I really wanted Mexican food and we didn't want to go far. He ordered the chimichanga combo and I ordered the fish tacos combo. Plus we ordered a side of chips. Everything was delicious when he brought it home. Hot and fresh, even the chips were delicious and warm. We will definitely be going back for some quick Mexican food.
