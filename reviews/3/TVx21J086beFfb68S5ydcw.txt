I have heard so much about La Parrilla Suiza that when we got a coupon in the mail we decided we had to try it. The chips and salsa are great. I really like that you get three different types of salsa; a red spicy one, a green one that has an avocado flavor and a chucky pico de gallo. I had the shrimp melt. It was a like a tostada with shrimp and lots of avocado, cilantro, and cheese. It was delicious and very fresh tasting. It came with a side of pinto beans and rice. I like that the food is true to Mexico City and not the usual saucey and heavy Mexican food you see at restaurants. While the food was great the service was a little spotty.  We saw our waiter bring our food and that was about it . Hopefully, this was just a one off situation with the service. I would try La Parrilla Suiza again just based off how great the chips and salsa were. However, if I had the same waiter experience as this I wouldn't return to this location.
