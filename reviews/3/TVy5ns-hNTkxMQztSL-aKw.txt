Randomly stopped in Tempe, AZ and was in dire need of sustenance at 3pm. This place was open and I was in the mood for Mexican food, perfect. The cashier and maker of my food was super friendly and helpful. I got a veggie burrito and it was very filling and tasty, but it was also just a veggie burrito. Price was about $6 including tax and included all the hot sauce I could drown my burrito in. A-Ok in my book!
