It appears they raise their prices again. They have a new menu board and it includes kid's meals. They let me get one which I appreciated as honestly there other meals are wayyyyy to many calories. For $3.78 I got a kid size queso with chicken, rice, chips and a drink..fine by me! I like them but I just think their regular menu items are getting pretty expensive,.,
