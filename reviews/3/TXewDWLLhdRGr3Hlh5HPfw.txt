Went here for lunch with a friend and the food was decent. 

They basically have two vegetarian items on the menu that aren't salads: guacamole tacos and garden fajitas. I wish they had something like a grilled veggies burrito or something to that effect.

I ordered the guacamole tacos and they were just ok. The guacamole didn't taste like it was made in house...sorta tasted like a mix. I guess it's personal preference but I like guacamole to taste fresh and like avocado. This tasted like garlic and had a weird consistency. The tacos came with a side of beans and rice, which were REALLY good. 

The chips they give you tasted like they were from a bag and also not made in house. 

Next time I think I'll try one of their salads.
