The hostess was a sweetheart and seated us very quickly. The bathrooms were fairly clean. The waitress hated her job, you could just tell, she wasn't terrible, I mean she served our needs and all, but she certainly didn't feing joy in doing it. It was a big turn iff to the place honestly. We got our drinks, one of which was a Margarita, it tasted like it had no alcohol in it at all. I rarely drink, so if I have a strong drink it will effect me very quickly, I drank the majority of it in an empty stomach and felt nothing, I don't think there was even a full shot in there.  The food came, presentation wasn't great, but whatever,  it's Mexican food so no biggy. The food was very good, I'd say a step above robertos, but a step below chapalas. Prices were high for food, it was almost  $13 for a burrito.  I was glad we had the groupon ti save us a little money. The margarita was surprisingly cheap at $5.95, but I would much rather pay $8.95 and have some liquor in it honestly. Husband played a few bucks in the machine in the bar and said the bartender was keeping busy but didn't have too good of customer service either. The manager appeared to be running around in a poor mood with an upset look on his face which may explain the poor attitude of the staff, with the exception of the hostess who was great, but just before we left he was over there messing with her about something and pointing around tge restaurant while he complained that she didn't seat someone fast enough, so I'm sure it won't be long til she's got the same attitude as the rest of them. Probably won't go back, I'd rather pay half the price at robertos and get the same level of customer service, or pay the same price or less at chapalas and get amazing customer service
