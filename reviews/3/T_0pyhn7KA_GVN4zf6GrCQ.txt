Good when you are craving Mexican. Chips and salsa are the bomb! I always get a combo platter and I'm usually satisfied with the quality. 

Typically the service is slow and unattentive, but now we expect that when we come so it's not a surprise and we have learned how to deal with it. 

The atmosphere is eh, they ave some CRT TV's in the dining area and I'm always distracted by them because they are CRAPPY quality and completely random stuff playing. 

My advice: don't eat the chips and salsa until you've received your drink and order your drinks and food at the same time.
