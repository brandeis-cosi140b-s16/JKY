At the time I ventured here there was the Yelp mention special and get a free lunch item, can't complain on that one :-D

But, the service was pretty dismal.  We were there for two hours!!! For lunch!  And, not busy either...

The food...Carne Asada Fajitas.  They were okay, lots of liquid in the bottom :-/

I won't make a specific special trip back here, but if I'm in that shopping center, I'll check it out again.
