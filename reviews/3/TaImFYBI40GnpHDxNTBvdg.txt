Stopped by on a friend's birthday, as I've heard so many great things on Senor Frogs (mainly the one in Cancun).  Who doesn't love a good yard drink?

My friend and I ordered two specialty drinks and beers, which were pretty delicious.  There was a happy hour deal which was decent, which was buy one drink get one free.  Not bad.  We also ordered the chips and salsa with jalapeno cheddar dip.  Nom.  Overall, I think this is a fun place but would attend when it's much busier (it was less than 1/4 filled).
