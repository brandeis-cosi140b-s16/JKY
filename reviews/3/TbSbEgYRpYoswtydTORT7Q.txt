Hmmm maybe an off day, my experience was not the same as others. I was on the hunt for Le's but the were closed so remembered this place was close by. Went in, sat down and the place reminded me of so many places on the side of the road between Tijuana and Ensenada, kinda beat up, kinda dirty ... but with the hope really tasty food... 
Ordered a beer, no beer... ok. Waitress doesn't speak English ok ... keeps the Mexico vibe going and my Spanish is passable. Dying for a really good Carne Asada Burrito, but notice they put the rice and beans in the Burrito Ala Chipotle ....hmmm not good or authentic. I ask  for the rice and beans on the side. While waiting I notice the health dept. score of 101.5 woohoo .. good sign, but then look around at the tattered streamers from the ceiling, and the fuzzy backing on the plastic table cloth(?)  looks like it was used to mop the floor .... So the "Burrito" arrives ... hmm rice on the side.. check, no beans ? and the tortilla is kinda flat ( little filling) and open on both ends ?
I pick it up and am thoroughly unimpressed  beans inside, almost no meat, no avo, some lettuce maybe a few pieces of tomato and chopped onion. Because it was not folded and rolled most of what was inside fell out... In short not carne asada, not a burrito, and not tasty.
