Went here with my family using a Groupon.  Was good, but not great.  Wouldn't go back unless I had another coupon as we found the prices huge but the portions small.   The nachos were to dry for me, I like a lot of salsa, but had to choke them down because we never saw the waitress again after the food was served.
