This is some pretty decent Mexican food. I used to work over in Matthews so this was one of my normal mexi spots for lunch. After returning here last week for the first time in a few years I remembered why I used to come here all the time. 
Its tucked away in the back of a nightmare parking lot/center on Sardis N. Thats the bad, its only gets better from here.
 Last time I was there I got the "Fiesta Enchiladas" 4 different ones with mole. The mole was good, I would have liked a little more kick, but thats just me. Everything came out hot and fresh. 
Service is always attentive without being up your butt. 
I'm not on this side of town often, but would gladly return when I am in the area!
