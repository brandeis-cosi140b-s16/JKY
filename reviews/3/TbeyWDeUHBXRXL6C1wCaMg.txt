I'm no Mexican food aficionado or anything, but this place has a lot going for it. Even though it is big and has the feel of a chain (our hotel concierge actually described it as the PF Chang's of Mexican food), but once you're at your table, it can feel quite cozy and homey. There are some nooks and crannies you can seek out to feel a little more tucked in. 

The guac is made tableside, which is a big selling point for me because anything interactive when dining with coworkers is always a nice ice breaker. It also happened to be ladies night when I was there (a Thursday evening). Who knew ladies night still existed anywhere? Not me. So this was a fun surprise and an easy excuse to order margaritas (which were good, not anything amazingly mindblowing, but a good, solid margarita and a varied list so everyone actually tried something different). 

The food was fresh and flavorful, things weren't completely and unnecessarily smothered in too much cheese, there were interesting side options other than just rice and beans (I'm talking to you, snap peas), and a server, if not necessarily our server, was always accessible. Everyone at the table seemed happy with the dinner, and I'd go back if I'm in the area again and have a hankering for enchiladas, so that equals "A-OK" in my book.
