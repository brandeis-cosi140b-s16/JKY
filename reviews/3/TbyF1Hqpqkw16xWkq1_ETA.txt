A few months back I ate at a random la salsa and had an amazing meal. Like, legitimately excellent (which is saying a lot, since I live in Southern California and used to live in Mexico). That La Salsa was somewhere between fast food and fast casual. I was looking forward to coming to this la salsa (because I really like Mexican food for breakfast), and was kind of surprised that it was an actual restaurant. The prices reflect that change as well. 

Overall, the experience was ok. The food was pretty good (nothing to write home about, but it cheaply and healthfully filled my belly), and the servers were nice enough, but the service wasn't really *good*. It was like a Mexican Dennys. This is totally ok if that's what you're expecting, but disappointing if it's not. Their hostess set up isn't really working. They have the hostesses doing a bunch of other miscellaneous crap around the restaurant and it means that you might wait a long time to be seated. 

I ate a full meal here once on my trip, and stopped in for some snacks to go twice. Their chips and salsa to go is around $2.50ish and they give you a massive amount of chips and salsa. Like I couldn't have gotten that much at the grocery store for that price. Their pinto beans are also delicious.
