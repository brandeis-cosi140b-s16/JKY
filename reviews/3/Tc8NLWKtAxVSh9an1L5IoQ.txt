An off day.

The West Valley has had its share of  Mexican restaurants.  However, I get tired off the typical version of Mexican food drowned in sauce,  rice, and heavy beans. 

Today, I decided to give Raul and Theresa's a try. The dishes at Raul and Theresa's looked really good. That's why I feel bad saying that my meal today just wasn't very good. Today, I had the chorizo, eggs, beans, and tortilla breakfast. The chorizo was somewhat over cooked and just wasn't very flavorful, as were the beans.  I was disappointed with my meal. It wasn't the worst meal nor the best. Maybe it was an off day.
