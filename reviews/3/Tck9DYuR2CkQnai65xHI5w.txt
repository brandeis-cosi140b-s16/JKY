I've been here twice now. It's cool, clean and modern, even a bit trendy. I got the aboghadas the first visit, and went for the extra spicy option. The cashier was unsure and told me that "gringos" can't handle that much heat. I assured her that despite my skin color that I can handle it. I got my dish and it was barely spicy at all. It still had a good flavor so I finished it. But as we left I told the cashier that it wasn't very spicy. She spoke to the chef and they determined that he forgot to add the spicy option to that number. I suspect that she told him to keep it mild when I ordered. A simple mistake at best, or some mild racism at worst, who knows. Now I'm not picky or easily offended so I went another time. I opted for a different dish and didn't have to to deal with the spiciness issue, it was still good. One thing to note was that I the two times that I ordered food, there was a distinct lack of crunch or crisp texture. All the food was soft and saucy. But I could be wrong. I need to study their menu and determine if they have any dishes with crispy tortillas of some kind. I had to knock off another star though because they don't serve alcohol. I feel that Mexican food pairs well with good Mexican beer (Bohemia anyone?) and not having that option is disappointing. I recommend giving this place a try.
