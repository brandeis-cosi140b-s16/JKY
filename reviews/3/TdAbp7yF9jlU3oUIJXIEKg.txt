OY CARAMBA!

The last time I ate at one of these Caramba's someone there highly recommended getting the Salpicon Salad saying that it was delicious and tasty and he thought it was the best dish they make. It's listed as a salad so I was expecting a salad.

I did ask them to leave off the cheese and sour cream to lighten it up a little for me. But all this salad appeared to be a fried flour tortilla smeared with beans topped with a small amount of lettuce with a very small amount of fresh made plastic tub like chunks of chicken and topped with a big glob of guacamole. To me it looked like a tostada. It was a $6.25 tostada. I read on a sign that the chicken and a bunch of other stuff is made fresh every day and is never from frozen. I also didn't eat the fried tortilla the food seemed fresh but it was a small amount of food.

 TWO STARS for the Chicken Salpicon Salad 

I also had a Margarita and it was so strong I thought I tasted AntiFreeze in it and I also thought it might make me grow hair on my chest.

My husband liked the Carnitas Plate. He said it was nicely seasoned and the meat was moist. It came with rice and beans and a giant flour tortilla that could hold a small body.

I'll leave them at three stars because my husband liked the carnitas here.

We were going to have a donut next door at Lamar's but it was after 12 and they were almost out so you might want to check out Lamar's before lunch.

All the Caramba locations are open everyday for lunch or dinner.
