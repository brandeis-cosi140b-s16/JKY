We ordered the combo meal, enchilada sampler, and the spinach dip. The spinach dip helped us to eat more chips than we should have. The combo was ordered with a baja chicken enchilada and the shredded beef taco which my wife really liked. I thought the enchilada sampler was a great combination: beef enchilada with green sauce, chicken enchilada with cheese sauce and a cheese enchilada with red sauce. We thought the food was good and the servings were large.
