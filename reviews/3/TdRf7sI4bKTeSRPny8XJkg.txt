After watching the last restaurant in this space (The Palmetto Grill) struggle for a while, and never really recover, I have vowed never to review a newly opened restaurant again.  

Now that we have been here 4 or 5 times, I am happy to say that every time they get better.  Yes, the food was *yawn* in the beginning and the service was a bit...scattered, but they have come along nicely.  We still like Azteca's food much better, but for walking distance in Mint Hill, it's not bad.  The margaritas are excellent (which is another reason to walk), reasonably priced and frequently on special..in fact....they have drink specials most nights.The guacamole is fresh, but pretty boring.  (Perhaps once you have Azteca's guacamole made before your eyes at your table, you are ruined for life?).   You can order "half orders" of a lot of their appetizers, (the hot queso is excellent) which is a nice touch.

My favorite entree so far is the enchiladas with the mole sauce. Three Enchiladas, your choice....chicken, beef or cheese, topped with mole sauce and melted cheese. Served with rice and beans.  The rice is good..the beans...meh.  The partner likes the Chile Verde, big tender pieces of pork in what I understand to be some really good verde sauce. Service has gotten much better (much more friendly and efficient), chips are warm and fresh, salsa is ok.  HINT:  If you like spicy (as we do) ask your server for the "Hot Salsa" they keep hiding in the back (my guess is habanero), mix it with the house salsa and you are good to go!  

If you are looking for something in the area, want to have a drink or two...maybe pick up a little Mexican... (food!) ...you won't be disappointed with Taxco.
