Lovely setting, bright & cheerful. Huge menu, but just had 1 chicken taco with rice & beans. It was only fair, very little flavor in the meat, rice & beans were bland.  Says "authentic Mexican food," but tasted disappointingly like GringoMex. However, the chips were good, salsa was flavorful with a nice kick. Wait staff was friendly and attentive.
