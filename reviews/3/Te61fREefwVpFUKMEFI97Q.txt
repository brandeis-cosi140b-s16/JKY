I'll start by saying I eat here twice a week and usually REALLY like it!!! Tonight however, BIG disappointment!!!  I ordered 2 chicken tacos no lettuce, simple enough right??? NOPE!!!  These things where so over cooked and burned the shell actually crumbled from trying to add salt!!! I thought I ordered chicken tacos, apparently I ordered chicken jerky tacos... Driest nastiest chicken I have eaten IN MY LIFE!!! Conveniently I live across the street, so I returned in hopes of getting my usual good chicken tacos... I received the tacos with lettuce, returned them again and received them back no lettuce better shells and far drier chicken then the first time!!! This high 3 star rating is only because I'm giving them credit for the 4 star they would usually get from me... This visit was a 1 at best!!! Maybe I'll have to go back to Robertos'
