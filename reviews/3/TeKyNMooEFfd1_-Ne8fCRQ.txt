We had great experiences with this place when they were still in a gas station. We tried their location in Anthem and called ahead, but nobody answered and the mailbox was not set up. We went out of our way to go to anthem, and what a disappointment. They were closed and a sign in the door read they will open Tuesday at 8:00 AM Tuesday. They should have set up an outgoing message. Other businesses were open in the same center.
