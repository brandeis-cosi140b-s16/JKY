Had the enchiladas verdes which were surprisingly edible, although what's the deal with the sad looking shredded iceberg lettuce in this city? I've been sorely disappointed with Mexican food in general in Pittsburgh, and while this wasn't up to the standard I was used to in California, it was "decent." The salsa was sufficiently spicy and I'd even venture to say it was "good." Drinks are also served here, but they come on a separate receipt... Service was also decent; I'd go back here again & give it a second try.
