We really liked going to Don Tortaco for the tamales, but no more the tamales lately have been all meal and very little meat.  The sauce was okay.  I always like to get the chille relleno, but it always hit and miss.  Sometimes it is good and other times it is terrible.  The one I ordered today was okay.

It is a good place. To go late at night if you are looking for something quick to eat.
