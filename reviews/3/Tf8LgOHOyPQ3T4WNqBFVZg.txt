The cashier was so rude, maybe we were too "gringo" for her, but our food was great. I ordered tortilla soup with no cheese and the cashier snapped that there was no cheese in their soup. Unfortunately it was served with soup and I had to take it up to food counter for a new one. I was in a rush and couldn't enjoy the new soup because of the wait, but it looked delicious!
