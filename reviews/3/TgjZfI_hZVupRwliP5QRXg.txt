I will preface this with the fact that we went at the height of the day during the Shadyside Arts Festival so it was *very* busy. They had difficulty getting our order straight. The chips and salsa we ordered came with the wrong salsa and we didn't particularly care for it...too smokey, no tomatoes (or no discernible tomatoes). My husband stressed that he wanted the chicken burrito (I say *stressed* because they came back to verify that's what he ordered before putting the order in) but he got a steak burrito instead. I had the carnitas burrito (pork) and it was quite tasty. We did enjoy the burritos, albeit he was served the wrong one. The bill we received stated something entirely different .... two poblano burritos with cheese or something like that, but it had our drink order right.  So maybe they do better on a less busy day but in reading the other reviews, I'm not quite sure of that.
