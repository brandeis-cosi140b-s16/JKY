Cerveza, por favor??

Mexi Casa is a restaurant in Dormont right off of West Liberty Ave that feels more like a bar when you swing open their door. But, trust me. It is a restaurant. 

Mexi Casa includes a tiny dining room, a bar, and a plethora of Mexican themed colors and posters. You have the option of grabbing a seat at the regular bar, or posting up at the dining room bar, where you can literally watch your food be prepared in front of you.

My dream of a burrito at this unethical cantina is the Theo Burrito: grilled steak, con queso sauce (melted, spicy cheese),  and grilled onions and peppers all wrapped up in a tortilla. It's pure bliss. 
***Make sure you ask for the Cholula, which is a MUST if you like hot sauce.

Definitely go on Wednesdays when they have $2 import bottles, including my go-to Mexican beers : Negra modelo, Sol, Corona, and Pacifico. 

Warning: this place is NOT a Bar. They close around 10:30 pm and won't be afraid to make you and your buddies feel extremely awkward by being the only people there. So do avoid going to Mexi Casa if your thinking about staying out late, because they practically throw you out of the place when they feel it's time to close.
