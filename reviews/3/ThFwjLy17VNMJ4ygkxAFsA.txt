Knocking a star off because of consistency, and I have concerns about their food. I ordered a meal during lunch hour when things should be fresh and got obviously old and refrigerator tasting rice, which really turned me off.  Sometimes the food is great, sometimes it's old tasting, sometimes they get your order incorrect (more often than is acceptable).

Another issue is, my work semi frequently orders large orders for the entire office. They actually gave me a hard time once about getting sauce, and I only wanted enough for each meal we had bought. I figured if you order $100 worth of food at lunch, they should probably eagerly give you a sauce or 2 for each meal you paid for... but they actually tried to charge me. We mentioned that we had just placed a huge order, can't you include what we would normally get? The guy reluctantly agreed. If they are this stingy I have concerns over what they are using in the kitchen. 

Currently undecided about whether I will return.
