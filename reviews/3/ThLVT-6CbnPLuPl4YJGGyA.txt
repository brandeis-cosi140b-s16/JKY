First off I love the yelp freebies and bing that it was a margarita, bonus bonus.   This place is located next to the sapphire strip club, which I find a bit odd.  On the inside the decor is really nice.   The free chips were good and the 3 different salsas pretty good.  I liked the hot orange habanero.  

Next we had the table side guacamole, which how can you mess up, so it was pretty good.  Next came the pork tacos, I guess I liked these the least.  The pork had a really porky taste to it.  That tells me, the pork was not fresh, not bad, but close to the end of it life.  So with so many good reviews maybe it was a bad day, not sure.  I just wasn't very happy with the pork tacos.

So overall it wasn't bad, the location a little odd, but once your inside its nice.  I may try this place again, but skip the pork and try something else.
