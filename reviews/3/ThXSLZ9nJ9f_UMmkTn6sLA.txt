Inevitably, we always end up here whenever I'm in Vegas. I'm never terribly impressed, but there's something keeping me coming back. Maybe it's the sweet (as in nice) dancers that pour you shots. Maybe it's the DJ-ing. Maybe it's the fact that you don't have to be dressed the swankiest to get your dance on. Whatever it is, Diablos is fun, the bouncers are doing their job and you (as a girl) feel safe.

I've never eaten here, but they make a pretty decent martini!
