I finally got around to eating at Tee Pee after driving passed it numerous times.  I guess my body was craving heavy cheesy mexican...yum!
I had the beef enchilada with green sauce, rice and beans.  I'll start with the positive:
*The plate was straight out of the oven, so piping hot, I love how the cheese gets all crusty when it's cooked :)
*The chips and salsa we decent, and they brought a refill when we neared the end of the bowl.
*The green sauce was pretty good, but could have been spicier.
*The rice was tasty, some of the best I've had at mexican places like this.

Now the bad:
*The enchilada had barely any beef in it....literally had to open the tortilla to see if it had any in there at all.
*The booths are really old and made of orange vinyl.  Maybe it's part of the decor, but I think it's time for an update.
*The server was pretty non-enthusiastic, we still had everything we needed, but a simple smile would have gone a long way!

All in all, it's about what you would expect from a normal mexican place.
