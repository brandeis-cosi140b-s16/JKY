Placed my order at 724pm.. Got a phone call at 804pm from the restaurant letting me know that they ran out of Chile Rellenos. 40 minutes after placing my order they call to tell me they are out of the main thing I placed my order for. When I told him that was the reason I ordered he said oh yeah I know they are really good... Well I wouldn't know would I, because you ran out and waited 40 minutes to let me know. I'm still waiting for my food, but really upset. Unless the food is through the roof amazing, I don't think I'll order from here again!
