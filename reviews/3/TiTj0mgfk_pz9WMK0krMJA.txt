Food was good though nothing was remarkable about the experience. Ordered the special oxtail quesadilla which had Huitlacoche - the flavor wasn't really remarkable or memorable. It tasted all right and I'm glad the restaurant strives for sustainable practices. Plenty of other places on the strip to try - probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back.
