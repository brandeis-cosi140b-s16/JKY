Mucho food for un pequeno price. I had the fajitas, the daily special, for only $7.99.  That's cheaper than even Chili's and oh so much better. The chicken was flavorful, the toppings were fresh, and you had two choices for rice (sweet or Spanish) and beans (refried or black). 

It's cafeteria-style ordering, so you tell them what you want and watch them prepare it right in front of you. Customer service seemed very friendly -- I was greeted with a smiling "Hola!"

My biggest issue, or rather annoyance on my part, was this alert-the-restaurant banging of copper kettles that punctuated my whole dinner.  I can't figure out what it was all about.  I think if you got some punch-card from them, they hit a kettle and shouted out something. It was kind of stupid. I didn't like it. Especially when I was in the middle of a sentence that I had to repeat because of it.

But, heck, what am I saying. I'll go back. Copper-kettle banging or not, the food was good and a great price.
