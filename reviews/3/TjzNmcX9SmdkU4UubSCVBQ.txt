Enroute to Boulder City today I somehow caught the "2 Gals" sign in the corner of my eye the signage struck a chord due to the previous Yelp Rockers reviews of the 2 gals I felt I must hit it up so we pulled a U'ey and dined at ze 2 gals.
This place would be easy to miss due to the sun-bleached sign. Also, I would've dismissed the joint all together because it comes off like an extra large old man bar or lounge and doesn't come off like a place that serves food. 
 Inside it feels like you are visiting your grandma's friend's house. The service was friendly and quick. The specials are good and the portions are huge. Holy Crap the water- Y U C K!  The crap water doesn't add up. Isn't this place close to the water supply? The water should be nice, no?
 Seriously the water is so gross it makes the soda taste bad. Other than that the place is quaint, in a freshly knitted doily kinda way.
