Great tacos and even better green sauce!  

I love me some green sauce on almost anything.  My friends were deciding where to grab food before running up and down Roosevelt last night, and they knew just how to slide me over to their side... in the great dining debate of Guy Fawkes day 2010... we decided to set a little fire to our taste buds at Tacos De Juarez.  The fact that they serve beer, and it was Friday night,  might have also been a deciding factor.  In the long run, we ALL won.  The french fry freaks got theirs, we had some great food, the beer was cold and the jukebox was.... well, the jukebox worked.  My only regret was that I didn't pick a few of the tunes.
