Definitely a great place to go for a quick, cheap, decent meal.  The only downside?? When I tried to order a corn quesadilla, the guy at the register told me they don't serve those. I then had to ask why it was on the menu. Fortunately, one of the other workers overheard and came over to help him.  Hello?! Maybe you should know your menu.  

Otherwise, our overall experience was pleasant. The place is fairly clean for a fast food place and the food comes quick.
