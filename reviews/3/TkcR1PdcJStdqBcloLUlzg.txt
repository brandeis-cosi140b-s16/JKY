Thanks to Groupon, we discovered this place last Summer and have been back several times.  Located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, it's near all of the Western Shops and knicknack stores....a great place to grab a bite if you're walking around and doing some shopping.

Highlight of some items we've ordered here:

Los Nachos (Chips, Black Beans, Cheese, Pico de Gallo, Jalapenos, Crema Mexicana, Grilled Chicken), $9.95

Chicken Tortilla Soup (Bowl), $5.50

Steak Fajitas, $15.95

3 Taco Special (any 3 Tacos), $12.95
I've ordered this several times.  Some of the Tacos I've tried are:
- Taco al Pastor
- Shredded Beef Taco
- Carne Asada Taco
- Carnitas Taco
- Pollo Asado Taco

My 2 favs on that list are the Carne Asada & the Taco al Pastor Tacos.

Overall, the food is pretty good and the Margaritas are excellent.  We've only come here during lunchtime and the service is so/so.  Sometimes we get an experienced server and they're good.  Other times we get a young, inexperienced college student that has no clue and forgets to serve us our complimentary Chips & Salsa....that's happened on 2 visits.  The inconsistent service is what knocks them down from a 4 to a 3 Star for me.
