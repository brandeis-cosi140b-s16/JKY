I am writing this review while AT THE WINDOW of The Stand. We've been waiting at the window for over 10 minutes, and waited a total of over 30 minutes in line. Look - these tacos are good, but NO ONE's tacos are worth a 30 minute wait - unless I've got a margarita in my hand to distract me. And I don't. :(

The food is 4.5 stars. The wait in line is like a  sub-1 star.
