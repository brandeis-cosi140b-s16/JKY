Sunday Mexican, yippee!  Having been to other Monterray locations, I was excited to see this location while on Independence Blvd.  Arriving just around 12, along with most of the lunch crowd we were greeted and seated in a booth near the back.  We were immediately served chips and salsa, which hit the spot, and ordered two medium margaritas.  While we looked over the menu we enjoyed the margarita, not too strong, but a nice drink to enjoy on Sunday afternoon..although I would have liked a little more kick. The chips were good, but were pretty bland, and needed a little more salt.  
We ordered the Taco and Burrito combination platter and the chicken fajitas. The combination platter was a chicken burrito and ground beef taco.  The burrito was great, topped with cheese and a mild red sauce. As for the taco, the meat was a little dry.  As for the fajitas, they looked good and I was told they were delicious.
Overall, the service was great, the menu full of options, but I was hoping for a little more taste from the food.  No doubt I will definitely be back to Monterray, however, I may stick to the other locations, ha ha!  Enjoy.
