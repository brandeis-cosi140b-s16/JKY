This location is really small. I love the food and taste of Chipotle and it's close to the house but we always get it to go because it feels cramped in there. The tables, floors, and drink station are usually sticky and dirty. I once had to ask an employee to clean a table for us. She only cleaned the table we were sitting at and just walked by the other dirty tables. I have been to many Chipotle locations most have friendly and hardworking staff. This location seems to be overworked at times and with a young staff. I have yet to see anyone there who looks like a manager. So the food will keep me coming back but not staying for very long- order and go.
