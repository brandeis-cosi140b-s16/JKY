I came here last year when it was Gallo Blanco. I was in town for business and came back three times that week. Unfortunately, I won't go out of my way to come back. Aside from a flavorful salsa verde, my carne asana burro lacked the robust flavor profile I was addicted to under previous guidance. Many of the dishes look the same, but the flavor has left the building.
