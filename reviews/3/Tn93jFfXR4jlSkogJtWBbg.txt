First impressions are not always great ones. Zabas has left me shrugging my shoulders and thinking "I just don't get it". You walk in and it looks like they copied Chipotle decor and layout wise. What they didn't copy Chipotle on is offering diced potatoes, whole wheat tortillas, and did I see sweet potatoes? 

My burrito was made fast, but they were out of chips so no chips and guac for me. They have a weird placement for their fountain drinks and it's kind of awkward to get enough napkins that is if the multiple dispensers are even stocked which they weren't. 

So I grab a seat and start in on their massive burrito. And while it was good, it wasn't great. Even going back and getting their hot salsa to pour on it didn't help. And the chicken is just blah. Compare it to Chipotle where they add some minor spices to it and I found myself wishing it had a little bit more seasoning. 

Overall it wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything that had me jumping up and down for joy thinking I found a local alternative to Chipotle either. 3 Stars...ho-hum, I may go back and try it again or I may not. It's nothing I would make a special trip for...I've drove 110 miles one way for Chipotle more than once. I don't see Zabas getting that kind of love from me.
