Really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place and what we tried of the food was amazing. The habanero mango guacamole was the best guac I have ever had. The set up for ordering and seating is very confusing and I noticed a lot of people left assuming they would get served. I think for this place to be successful it would need to probably change this .
