Macayo's - another gringo-fied Mexican chain which quadruples the price for a quarter of the flavor. We knew better, but Mexi restaurants are mostly shuttered tight on Easter, so our choices were limited when hunger struck in the middle of that neon stretch between Phoenix and Tucson. The service earned the third star as all were friendly and fast. But $8 for a teeny, bland scoop of guac? My lonely $13 Baja burro was as bland as a sensitivity meeting at Lego Land, and the food was Mexican in shape only. The salsa tasted like ketchup compote. The lack of flavor was compounded because I'd just eaten tacos el sabor in southern Nogales at La Salida and was nearly transported to heaven. I'd trade fear for flavor any time. Macayo's takes bland to new averages.
