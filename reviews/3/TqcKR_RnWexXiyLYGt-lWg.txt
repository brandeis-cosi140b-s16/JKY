It is Serrano's and I think people either like Serrano's or they don't. It will pass for Mexican food by many locals and most visitors. As a general rule, I find Serrano's only "OK" Mexican food. To me if the rice and beans aren't great, it's a mark against a Mexican restaurant. On the other hand, the bean dip they serve with the chips is good.

So specific to this place which we visited Friday - Chile Relleno w/shrimp (wanted a change) was great, no complaints. Wife's Carne Asada was heavy on the pepper for some reason. Our dinner guest had Tostadas and seemed quite happy with them. Margarita's were extremely lame, didn't even bother to order another.

Decor is in serious need of an overhaul. Visiting the restrooms and peering into the kitchen, the place just needs a revamp.
