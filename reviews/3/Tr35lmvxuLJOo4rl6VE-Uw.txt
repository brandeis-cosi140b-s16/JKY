We've been looking forward to hitting this place as soon as they opened this Johnson Street location so decided to spend a date night with the hubby there last night.  Here's the scoop - cute little place, good atmosphere, friendly peeps.  Service sucked (at least our server did) - he was a low-talker, slow as shit and seemed like he wanted to be out back having a smoke more than being our waiter.  With all that aside, we started with the house salad which had a super interesting seasonal greens and veggie mix - much appreciated!  But the dressing was sad - a vinaigrette with very little flavor and pretty oily.  For $8 - we immediately regretted it.  The Carbonara pizza was our rebound - great crust, bacon, mushrooms, cooked eggs on top - super delish.  My husband also ordered tacos (which they're also oddly known for) but their carne asada was chewy and oddly flavored (soy sauce??).  Another $8 we wish we hadn't spent!  Overall - stick with the pizza!
