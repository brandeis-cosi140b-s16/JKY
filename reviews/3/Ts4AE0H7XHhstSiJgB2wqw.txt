I was stuck in the Phoenix International Airport for 2.5 hours longer than expected during a flight delay one Saturday evening and was getting hungry. After walking around checking out all the different restaurants in the terminal I finally found Sir Vesas.

There aren't too many good places to eat in this airport (but plenty of average ones) so I chose Sir Vesas for the three star average and their more than one Vegetarian Option. I ordered the Bean and Cheese Burrito and it was about $7 which isn't too expensive for airport food. The burrito was pretty good. Black beans, cheese, sour cream and salsa inside a flour tortilla. Nothing bad, nothing great. Just ok.

I might come back to Sir Vesas again if I was in the same terminal at Phoenix International. I wouldn't traverse multiple terminals to get here, but if I was there then it's not a bad option. They have a nice bar area as well as a small seating area which makes for a nice place to relax if you can find a spot.
