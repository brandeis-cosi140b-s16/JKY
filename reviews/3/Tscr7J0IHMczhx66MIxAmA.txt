4 stars for the service, 2 stars for the taste.

The big wasn't that big, it was normal size to me.  Lots of choices for one price, which was awesome.  6 different meats, lots of topping choices.  And yea, the service was really good.

The taste?  Just not there.  The rice wasn't flavorful, the steak had a hint of flavor even though they were generous with it...I didn't put sour cream/cheese on there, but they are generally masking agents - what doesn't taste good with those 2 ingredients????
