I enjoy Filiberto's. I'm not from the west coast so to have moderately good fast food Mexican food is a plus for me!

Since discovering Fiiberto's I noticed that they do not skimp on the portion size, you get exactly what you pay for! Last week I had got a sausage breakfast burrito and I couldn't finish it all, they stuff so much sausage in 1 burrito. My other experiences have been the same with huge portions so don't let some of the prices be off-putting. My favorite so far is the carne asada burrito.

I am well aware that Filiberto's is not a typical fast food restaurant but I've been to this one at least twice and it's taken at least 15-20 minutes for me to get my food. Once inside and another time in the drive-through, so unless I've just been there on there slow days I don't suggest you come to this Filiberto's in a hurry or waste your precious gas in the drive-through.

Also, this Filiberto's wasn't as clean as I would like when eating even if it is just fast food.

I will frequent Filiberto's again but I will  be looking for a better one to try.
