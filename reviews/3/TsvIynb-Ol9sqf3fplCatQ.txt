I was really having a difficult time figuring out what i wanted to rate this place. I really don't care for the food or service overall but we know one guy in genera(who i think is a manager) and has been with this dos gringos location for a couple years since I have moved out to AZ in 2009.  For some reason the nachos lose more and more star points with me since the first night i ever tried them in 2009.  I never love the service from everybody only the one guy(as i am still trying to remember his name) If we ever have a problem with the drinks we always have him take it back and fix it. But that kind of shows you that other people are not doing it right the first time.  We always order the nachos from this place and i cannot tell you how much i hate nacho cheese. I just love to death a place that has regular melted cheese and meats/beans/sour cream/guacamole. Not a mix between regular and nacho cheese.  but i will def eat it if i've been drinking. I love food and savor every flavor (if its amazing) so i can never give a fair review if i had been drinking i would have to go back a time where i am completely sober and coherent.  1 thing i have noticed about the chicken on the nachos is that they are usually pretty dry. i kind of wish they would grill the chicken and place it on the nachos after they take the nachos out of the oven.  

Just an A-OK from me even though we are here a couple times every other month or so.
