The food is great, but it feels as if it's overly greasy. Nevertheless some quick tips!

1. Parking is pretty plentiful. It's in a small strip mall in a not so nice neighborhood.

2. The point of a restaurant like this is to try their fusion offerings, after all the name is Komex! Get a little less authentic on both sides and try the Fusion Burrito or a chimichanga.

3. The meats are pretty good quality and taste pretty good.

4. For those who don't tolerate greasy food, try sticking to the rice plates as opposed to the burritos or chimichangas or tacos.

The food here is good, but some of the things that made it stand out for me as a poor experience was the atmosphere provided by the place. It's a fusion place so it's a little quirky to begin with, but the venue is so small it feels like you're a sardine a sardine can barely living it out. The other thing in regards to ambiance is that during the summer time, it gets incredibly hot and the only thing that Komex does to alleviate this for customers is to turn on the fans that they have. When my girlfriend and I went, we were sweating like two California piggies.

Anyways, the meats and the overall presentation of the meal was nice. The burrito is big and so is the chimichanga. Looking over at other tables, the rice plates and the nachos are really decent for the price. The only complaint I have is the food feels a little heavy on the greasy side. Otherwise, the service was quick, polite, and friendly. Although I like this place, it isn't one of those places where I'm like, "MAN I've got to come back."
