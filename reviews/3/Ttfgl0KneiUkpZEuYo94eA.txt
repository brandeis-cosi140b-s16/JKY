I have been to the Matador for both lunch (it's short walk from the courthouse when you have jury duty) and at night when it becomes a latin club, all I can say is... 

*holds hand out and wiggles it in a 'so-so' motion*

With both the food and the club, it's nothing bad, but nothing to write home about.
