The food is usually pretty good, but this past week my colleagues and I phoned in an order for a meeting we were having during lunch. We requested to have it ready at 12:45 (called in at 11:05) and they said that was okay and when we get there our food had been made and sitting there for over an hour. We did not even get everything we ordered and it was all cold and soggy. I wouldn't have given 3 stars if the manager hadn't apologized and offered us replacement meals when we called back that day. I understand that it was busy and lunchtime but for calling in that far in advance we had hoped that would give them ample time to have our order correct and still somewhat warm.
