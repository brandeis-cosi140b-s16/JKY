Anyone who knows me, knows I am a Mexican food snob. I live in NM, the cuisine here is not, nor can it be duplicated anywhere else. So, when someone invites me out for Mexican food I normally become dismayed. Well, this place is wonderful. It is NOT authentic NM cuisine, however, it is excellent Mexico Mexican food. I enjoyed the shredded beef chimmy with red n green. It came with beans/rice which were amazing for beans n rice. We also enjoyed guacamole , and salsa which was great. There are three (at my last count),  I have tried the other locations, they were pricey. Period. This location is great. Service was great!
