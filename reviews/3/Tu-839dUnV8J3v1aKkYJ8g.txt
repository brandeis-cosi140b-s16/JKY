Think of a Chioptle restaurant but all grown up.  Standard Mexican drinks and food.   The interior is clean and simple but almost stark.  The same goes for the nice big patio.

It's next door to the Dilly Dally so it's gonna be hard for me to wait 5+ min for a beer when the Dally serves then up in 30 seconds.

---Please note: they had the SHITTIEST music I have ever heard.  I swear they were playing an entire album by Le Bebarge or maybe it was the soundtrack from Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo.   Holy crap was it bad!
