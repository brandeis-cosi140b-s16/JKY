I love the horchata & burritos here!!! What I don't like is their service time and that one way mirror at the drive thru!!! I hate that feeling of being watched and that someone is doing something wrong on the other side!!! Their is nothing nice about them in a drive thru and it's totally not customer service like! Get rid of it!!! But still good food...
