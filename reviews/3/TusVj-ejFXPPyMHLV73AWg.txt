Tediberto's -- splitting niches with its identity crisis. Niche: vegan. Niche: Mexican. Niche: expensive (in a part of downtown not known for it). Niche: clubby, youthful atmosphere. Niche: opens late and only takes cash. As a vegan and Mexican food fan, I want this place to succeed. But my fear is that is so specialized, its net is too small to catch a viable customer base. 

The place looks like a bar, and it appears it wants to be more of a club than an eatery, though as of now it serves no alcohol. It earns the dubious distinction of being both the darkest and loudest restaurant I have ever eaten at (5 continents, 20 countries). What's wrong with that? Plenty: the waiter couldn't hear us, we couldn't have dinner conversation, we couldn't see our food (not good for eating nachos), and it was completely impractical for the average client. Fun? Maybe to the youthful crowd; otherwise it just detracts from the primary objective of eating. Atmosphere should enhance the experience, not obliterate it.

The menu is very small. We had the nachos, which were delicious. Two small tacos came with a small salad (around $10). The tables are lit from underneath glass with colored lights, which look cool, but didn't allow me to see what I was eating. Water was free, and tasted like cucumbers, and I had a grapefruit soda  -- which required shouting, then pointing to the menu to communicate to the waiter over the pleasant but very loud electronic music, to order it. The food was good, warm, and so was the air, I am guessing 80+ degrees. Maybe that was the reason for opening so late (weak a/c?).

No ask for dessert, no bill, the waiter told us the total -- well, he yelled it. One order of nachos, 2 orders of tacos, one soda: $33 + tip. 

It's new, so I'm betting on some improvements. Let's hope the cool factor can hop in the backseat and let the food drive.
