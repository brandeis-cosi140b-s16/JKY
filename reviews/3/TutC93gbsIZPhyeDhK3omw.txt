I have to say that I love the super nachos they have here they are covered in juicy meat and beautiful cheese with all the toppings. 

But when it comes to tacos they are dry and not exactly exploding in flavor like the nachos. 

I've heard that when you go you should always have one of the right cooks making you're tacos I wasn't told which one but I'm assuming I didn't get the right one because they weren't good at all. 

If it wasn't for the nachos and the fact the people were very nice while making the food  I wouldn't be giving them 3 stars. (
Side note, I don't know the name of the guy but if you want good tacos the guy with the mustache is the best cook there, at least that's what I'm assuming because there is only ever 2 people there he was one of them)
