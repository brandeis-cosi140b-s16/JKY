Drove over here from Goodyear, due to the unusually high rating.

I was extremely hungry, so I ordered some type of carne asada breakfast with eggs, beans, and rice.

I also ordered six tamales: 3 chicken and 3 beef.

The breakfast was okay, but very rich in flavor.  I probably ate too fast, because it almost made me sick.

I suggest eating slower.

The tamales, on the other hand, hardly had any filling, were very dry and bland, and just plain awful.

With a restaurant that has "tamales" in the actual name, you would think that these tamales would be made with rainbows, unicorn magic, and golden fairy dust.  In reality, their tamales are the worst I have had since moving to Arizona.

If you go East a few blocks, Fuego makes MUCH better tamales.

So, I gave these guys 3-stars, because their service was good and the breakfast was decent.
