I thought the food was fairly authentic but it wasn't great. The outside and inside of the place was kinda dingy but I care more about how the food tastes than what the place looks like. This is the kinda place I'd probably give 4 or 5 stars to if I stopped by at 3am after hanging out all night but such was not the case on this visit. If you've even been to Taco Cabana in Texas, this is similar but more authentic mexican food.
