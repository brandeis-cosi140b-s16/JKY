Went for dinner on a Monday night. Only two other parties there. Seemed a little odd, but we decided to give it a try anyway.

The decor was very nice. A large restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. A fancy bar.

We had a Mole Negro Oaxaqueno and a Chipotle Chicken. Both dishes were quite tasty. Although I have to mention that for a restaurant with only two parties, it took a really long time for the food to come out.

Felt somewhat overpriced. It was tasty, but it wasn't THAT tasty. I'd rather go to Chevy's for the price if I've got a hankering for Mexican food.
