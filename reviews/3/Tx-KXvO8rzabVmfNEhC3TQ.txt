chipotle-esque in that is assembly style serving, but chipotle is better. 

As has been mentioned, sweet pork option is tender and tasty, and they have great tortillas that are fluffy and grilled. 

the perks end there.  The guac is mediocre (coming from Cali I have high standards, but still) the rice is riceroni-esque.  

the only things you get in your taco are pico de gallo which I could make better at home myself and lettuce.  

an okay option if you're tired of chipotle or other options, but meh in my book.
