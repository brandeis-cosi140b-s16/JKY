I ordered the shrimp fajitas. The meal was well cooked and tasted good. The sopapillas were very good and the access to the salsa bar was convenient. Their salsa selections were better than other restaurants. The only issue I have is the lack of service, I didn't get one refill  on my drink while I was there. They could do a lot better in that department.
