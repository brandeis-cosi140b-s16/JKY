I went to Chronic Taco again last night, and needed to write an update.

The food standards seem to have dropped.  My potato taco was still good, but the fish taco was kind of soggy, and the chicken burrito had more sides/filling than chicken.

Its still decent, and I'll still eat here on occasion, but I know a few other taco joints I'd rather go to these days.
