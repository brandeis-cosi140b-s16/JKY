Here's how it went down.   Seated down nicely and the waiter took our order in a timely matter.  The chips and salsa arrived, we ordered and the food came shortly after. I got the tamale and burrito combo.  The tamale came with green sauce which was pretty good.  However, the beef burrito with the red sauce was extremely salty.  It was probably the sauce which probably came out of a can that did it.  It was so salty that the next few hours I had a raised heart rate!  I am healthy that wasn't the issue.
The service was very good and polite but attendants asked one too many times how we were doing.   Another thing I thought the utensils were too cheap and fit for camping.   You would think they would have better ones.   Since they do lit the fajitas on fire next to your table, the place tends to get smoky as will your clothes.  It would have been a better experience and the rating better if only they wouldn't put a ton of salt on the food!   One's health matters most than anything else doesn't it?
