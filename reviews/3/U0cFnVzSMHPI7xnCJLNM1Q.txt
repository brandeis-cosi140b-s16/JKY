Went there with the hubs to try it out on a Friday, I have to say the food and service were very good and reasonably priced. Katie our server was very attentive and kept our drinks full, the place is small and the owner intends on expanding which will be nice, the patio area looks nice we will try that next time. The only bad I can see, the seating is uncomfortable inside, I would have stayed longer had it not been for that. The owner came to our table and introduced himself, which we like to see, and told us his intentions for expansion, I hope it happens. We could definitely see ourselves becoming regulars here, it is that kind of place, and besides that, it is a great place to people watch!
