While staying at Planet Hollywood, we checked out Yolo's for lunch while waiting for friends that were gambling.  Ordered some wings as appetizers along with some soft tacos.  Pretty decent stuff, and I'd eat here again if given the opportunity.  

Service was very good for our table, and everyone was very hospitable.
