My husband loves the breakfast burritos here. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because there isn't any vegan menu items and when busy there isn't much of a place to wait. There needs to be a number system displayed because you can't hear the description of your order spoken.  You wait longer than you should and when you do get your order the individual working the counter mentions that he called your order several times.
