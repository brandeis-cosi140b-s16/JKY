I love zabas I usually eat it 3-4 times a week but this location is lacking the zabas love. Service I would give 4 stars. The staff is friendly and greets you. Food quality is 5 stars it seems fresh like the other zabas. The food portions are a lot smaller then the other zabas I eat at. I ask for double sweet potatoes and I get a normal portion. They even skimp you on the guacamole when you pay extra for it. This location is close to my house so I've given it a few chances to get it right. Still needs improving. For being a local franchise there needs to be more consistency in the training. Zabas on flamingo is still the best location so far.
