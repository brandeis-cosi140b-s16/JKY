The wife wanted Mexican food tonight as we were driving along Horizon Ridge, I suggested Don Tortaco's. It happens to be located in the same complex as a Taco Bell...Taco Bell, yuck...I'd only eaten here a couple of times, it's alright. Pretty comparable to Roberto's,  the menu's are very similar.

My wife got the Adobada plate and I got the Carne Asada fries (what a gut-bomb, right?)...she said she likes Roberto's one better, better flavor and more meat. The Carne Asada fries are disgustingly delicious...beef piled on melty cheese, sour cream, guac, pico and handfuls of French fries. What's not to like? It's your perfect late night go-to if you need something to soak-up all that alcohol you've consumed...

So what have we learned here...if your craving some late-night Mexican food, go to Don Tortaco. Or else, go to Roberto's, or Fausto's...don't go to Taco Bell.
