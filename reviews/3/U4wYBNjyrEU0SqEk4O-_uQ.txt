I have lived in Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas for most of my life and feel I am a good judge of Mexican food.  This restaurant is better than many of the reviews but they are dead on with regard to the salsa.  Bland isn't even an adequate description for this tasteless red sauce.  The chips were OK.  Liquor, to me, isn't a way to judge a restaurant but is important for a tavern or bar so I don't include this in my evaluation.  Our server, Linda, was one of the best I have had.  Our glasses were filled frequently and Linda was checking on us with regularity.  The chicken in the Chicken Enchilada was fresh and properly prepared.  The enchilada itself could have been spicier but the freshness made up for it.  The other dishes around the table were good, but not great.  The re-fried beans were good.  The rice was average.  This is a nice restaurant for the less adventurous.
