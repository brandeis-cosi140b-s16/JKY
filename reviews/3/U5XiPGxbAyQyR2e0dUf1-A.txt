Came in for breakfast with the family, and it wasn't disappointing. Service was slow, but friendly. They give you free chips which is always nice. The food was reasonably priced ($5-$10 for breakfast items) and kids eat free off the kids menu. The quality of the food wasn't anything impressive, but it tasted good and filled us up- isn't that all you need?
