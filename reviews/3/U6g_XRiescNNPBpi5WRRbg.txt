Don't go here if you're in a hurry.  But if you have time and none of the other mediocre restaurants in the food court here pique your interest....   The food is fine, but not amazing.  I had been excited for the Asian Chicken Salad at CPK (which I look forward to at this airport, for some reason), but they don't make it anymore.  I ended up here, but should have skipped it.
