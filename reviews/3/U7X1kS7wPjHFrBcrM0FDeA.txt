One of the first entrants in the burrito market. Qdoba and these others are sort of like Subway, where you pick how you want it as your "sandwich" goes down the assembly line. They have some very innovative ideas for their burritos sauces - I chose the Poblano Pesto chicken burrito. Otherwise, it seems to be very similar to the other chains with chopped beef or chopped chicken. They might also do a pulled pork and veggie burrito.

You don't necessarily have to go with the burrito. They offer salads and nachos and tacos and quesadillas and even soup.

I have to agree with Dave's much earlier review - the cilantro lime rice is really good here but the chips are better at Salsaritas. And going a bit further, the salsa is better at Moe's.

Free wifi and they have a frequent flier club where you can get free stuff after a certain number of visits.
