We used 2 coupons and just paid separately. I had the Ancho Shrimp burrito on a whole wheat tortilla. It was decent; I don't think I've ever had a BAD meal at Rubio's, however this burrito could have used a bit more rice. It was tasty though and had a decent amount of shrimp placed throughout the burrito, which probably accounts for the $7.79 price tag. Definitely tasted better with a $1 off coupon I received via email. My son had the Burrito Especial w/chicken, gave it a thumbs up.
