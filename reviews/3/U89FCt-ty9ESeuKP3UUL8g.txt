Went for the company and I stayed for the food. 

We started with the guacamole and had the server be the "diver" (her term not mine). Most times they drop off the guac fixins and the table makes it to their taste. Overall the freshness was on point and it tasted good. 

For my entree I ordered the shrimp enchiladas. I tired to stop eating it half way through.....I even put my sour cream side cup in the middle of the dish in hopes they would take it.....moral of the story is good food won. I ate every bite. 

We did have to ask for more chips and salsa on multiple occasions. It wasn't the best Mexican food I had in AZ but it was good considering it was attached to a mall.
