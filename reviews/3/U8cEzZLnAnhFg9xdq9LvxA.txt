Second time here and the food is fine. I got a pork burrito, my husband got the carnitas, which is the pulled pork. Mine was definitely lacking in flavor, but the carnitas was better and I would probably order it again. The rice in the burritos tasted similar to rice-a-roni, which was a bit disappointing. Refried beans were good.

Complimentary tortilla chips are served fresh and warm with salsa, which was soupy & enjoyable. A tiny kick of spice but definitely tolerable and enjoyable for a spice avoider like me. 

Service is fast, servers are friendly. Wish their hours were later for some weekend margaritas, but what can you do.
