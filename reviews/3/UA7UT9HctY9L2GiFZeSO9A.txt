Good mexican food with reasonable prices, large portions, and with a nice ambiance. The outdoors area is very nice and has a lot of seating so you shouldn't have to wait too long for a table. The food is straightforward and good (not amazing but not disappointing). We had:

- Queso Guillermo: A yummy cheesy dip made from real cheese (none of that weird nacho cheese stuff) served with corn tortillas. It's very filling but probably not one of the best fundidos I've had. The cheese isn't really melted that well together so it ends up forming clumps and a strange liquid separation layer. It could have used more flavor like chilis or cilantro or something.
- Fajita Taco Salad: A straightforward but solid salad served in a fried tortilla shell. The veggies are a little on the greasy side. The refried beans and guacamole were my favorite parts.
- Chile Relleno con Pollo: My boyfriend got this and thought it was good. I think their rice is average.
