went here for dinner on friday night.  started with a few small plates. had the ahi tuna with wasabe, yummy.  the bacon wrapped jumbo shrimp, yummy.  and the steak skewers, which were good except that two pieces had hard tendons in them. also had the bbq flatbread which was delish.  my complaint is that i ordered the bacon wrapped filet with the dungeness crab hollandaise sauce and jumbo shrimp surf and turf, but the server brought me some gross way too spicy meal that was completely not what i ordered... he apologized and had my order remade and comped the deserts for us but we were still charged the 28 dollars for the meal he messed up.. so my only advice is confirm what the server thought you ordered... so all in all i would recommend trying it out... if you can afford the hefty price tag( dinner for three with three appetizers was and a couple beers = $220) would have been slightly less if we were not charged for the waiters mixup
