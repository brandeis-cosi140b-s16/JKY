One star for cleanliness, two for the $1 off digital coupon and three for it being 24/7. Minus one because the meat was fatty and somehow over cooked so that chewy toughness was in every bite. Paid for sour cream and guacamole that seemed to become a blended liquid-like sauce instead of beautiful white and green cream. But what I hate is when a 24/7 establishment leaves one guy to cook and run the register and I have to wait 10 minutes to order.
