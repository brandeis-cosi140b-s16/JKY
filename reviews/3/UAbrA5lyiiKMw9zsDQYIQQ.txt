Blue Adobe Grille has excellent food.  The chips and salsa are free and are by far the best chips and salsa in the valley.  The salsa is smokey and full of flavor.  It is hot but not so hot you cannot continue to eat.  The drinks are over priced for what is served.  I was dissapointed with my skinny marg.  I think the only reason it was "skinny" was the fact that it is half the size as the normal margarita.  SoSad....

The menu has a lot of variety and the specials are always good picks.  I usually eat the special that is on the chalk board because I know that it will be fresh and it comes out quick.

Visit Blue Adobe Grille for dinner.  Go hungry.
