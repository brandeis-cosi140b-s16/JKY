It is definitely good for the price, but I didn't see quite what all the buzz is all about. Perhaps we are all just deprived in the  culinary department out here in Copa. In other words, there just isn't much to choose from. The service was pleasant and fairly fast. This is  a good place for Mexican take out, and the prices were decent. I guess you get what you pay for here. The burritos were good, salsa is spicy, and I will also try their breakfast menu.
