Came here on Cinco de Mayo, so they were very busy. Service was good & the staff was friendly. Expected some sort of drink specials but there was only 1 marg which had jalape√±o in it, so opted out of that. House margs made w/ cheap Sauza tequila were $7. Ouch!  I had a beef taco salad which was very good w/ tasty strips of steak. My wife had a cup of albondiga soup. It's only resemblance to authentic albondigas was that it had meatballs in it. It was more like canned soup. Overall, our dinner was not very satisfying.
