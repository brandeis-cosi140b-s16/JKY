This is my first visit to cafe rio.  The food is fair +.  The service is fast bit maybe a little too fast as the workers won't even look at you when you're talking. I was in line trying to order and the lady asked me what I would like and I told her but it wasn't what she wanted to hear so she ordered what she thought I said.  I tried correcting her and it was so loud I gave up.  The whole idea of customization is thrown out the door when the employees can't even look up when they are asking you questions.
