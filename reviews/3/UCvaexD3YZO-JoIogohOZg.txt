I, like Caitlin, am on a hunt for great Mexican food. So, upon arriving, I was a little surprised at the set-up of the restaurant, very strange. Stairs appear upon entering the doors w/ about 10 tables behind it. There was one other table during lunch and the service was a little slow. I was served chips and salsa, chips were fresh & the salsa had a nice kick..one I like. I chose the lunch chicken fajitas, perfect size. The fajitas were sizzling and served with peppers, onions, tomatoes, and zucchini with a plates of rice & beans, guacamole, and sour cream. Everything tasted great, but I missed a little Mexican flavor in the fajitas. Overall, it was good and my check was less than $10.00, great price!
