We enjoyed Dos Mas. Sat at the bar. Watched a football game, and played around betting on the ponies. Definitely more of a sports bar atmosphere. Margaritas were good and strong, beer was cold. Service was good. We had the Mexican pizza, and fish tacos. Fish tacos had a tasty chipolte sauce, and filled with a generous portion of crispy battered fish. Mexican pizza was huge for $6. Is it the best Mexican food around? Not by any means...more like bar food. We figured that going in.  However, overall it was an enjoyable experience.
