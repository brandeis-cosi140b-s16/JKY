Food was mediocre. Their "house red sauce" tasted like canned tomato paste. The drinks were also off. I asked if I could get a scratch margarita with premium tequila, I was given something that tasted like Jose Cuervo mix and Jose gold. The food and drinks were kinda shit, but the service was excellent. I will say that our server was very nice and wanted to make our table happy, but the food drink fell short and great service can only help so much.
