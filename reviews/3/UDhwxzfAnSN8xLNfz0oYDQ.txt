I really think they out crack in their chips and salsa because I've never had chips and salsa taste that good!  I had their fish tacos, which was pretty good.  Also tried their Cucumber/Jalepeno Margarita--which I was NOT the business.  I took two sips and was done.  Didn't like the flavor.  Service was not bad. I was there for a bachelorette party and we told them we had a show to catch and they had the food come out quick.  But yeah, the chips & salsa--ridic. good.
