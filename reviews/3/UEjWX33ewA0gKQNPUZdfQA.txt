This is your standard Tex-Mex 'order at the counter' joint. You go through an assembly line, where you choose your meal...and then you choose between black and pinto beans, several different types of salsas, and of course cheese, lettuce, sour cream, and guacamole (which is 95cents extra!). 

My significant other LOVES Qdoba, and I swear before I came along he ate here at least 5x/week. Now I try to keep us to twice a month, if I can.  We often get it as take-out on one of the busy weeknights that I don't feel like cooking. In fact, I can't remember the last time I ate IN here.

It can be really good and fresh, but they are VERY inconsistent. Sometimes it's excellent, sometimes not so much. If you go in within 45 mins to an hour before they close (for takeout/fast food, mind you) - they aren't likely to cook you up a fresh batch of anything. If they are out of chicken, they are out of chicken. Seems a little crazy to me, but there you are. 

I usually eat vegetarian here... the cheese quesadilla with pico and salsa verde, or the naked vegetarian taco salad are my go-to dishes.

Back in the day when they were called Zteca (who else remembers that?) they served margaritas. Wish they would bring them back!
