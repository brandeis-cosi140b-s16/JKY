I like Qdoba, better than Chipotle and I really don't know why.  I'm sure it's exactly the same, give me a burrito from both places and blindfold me and I'll probably end up saying Chipotle is better!  But, really I know why Qdoba is better than Chipotle, have you ever been into a Chipotle, I feel like I'm in an alluminum foil wrapper, the atmosphere, ambience, whatever you want to call it is so OFF, it's uncomfortable to sit in those sharp, uncomfortable, so-called booths...Yup, that must be it, plus Chipotle always seems dirtier, guess it depends on which Chipotle you end up at.  Yea, Qdoba is good, it has to be a, what I like to call, "qdoba craving", otherwise I'm not just going to go there.
