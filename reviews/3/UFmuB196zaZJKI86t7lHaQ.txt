My memory is a little fuzzy from this place, but I'll try my best haha. For a fact, the margaritas are hit or miss. Outside we received cards for $3.00 ones and they were okay, when we actually sat down for dinner my larger margarita was waaaay too salty. It tasted like they just dumped salt in the bottom of the glass! yuck! The only food I had was a quesadilla, and my friend had tacos that she said were also "just okay." Coming from southern california, it takes a lot to impress us with Mexican food, but for a fun time, cheap drinks, and the possibility of meeting new friends? (we did!)... its a fun place to check out.
