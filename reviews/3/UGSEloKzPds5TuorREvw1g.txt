I needed a street taco fix so we drove cross town to and decided to share a 4-taco platter that included beans and Spanish rice.  My wife chose 2 with al pastor while I settled on a pastor and a chorizo.  All were authentic (that's good), but the chorizo made my taste buds do the Shimmy, Shimmy Shake.
