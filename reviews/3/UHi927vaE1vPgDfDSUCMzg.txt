Chipotle is well known. People now a days love it. I like it also just not this location. I came in and they brought fresh rice so I was happy ordered my burrito to go and when I got home to eat it rice wasn't even cooked. It was hard and honestly ruined the whole burrito. I know places make mistakes but how many times a day do they make rice? A lot right? So they should know how to make it.
