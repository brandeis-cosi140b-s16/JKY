Compared to the ones in northern Phoenix, this one misses the mark.
Service is great, staff is friendly.
Chips are thin, bland and stale. Salsa is chunky and lacks flavor (did the recipe change or is it different than other locations?)
Other food was pretty good.
I'm in from out of town, so chances are good I won't return to this one again, but over all it wasn't awful.

Kids eat free on Wednesday, so that was a bonus.
