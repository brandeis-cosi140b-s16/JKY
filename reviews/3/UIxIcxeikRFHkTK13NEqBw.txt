Another new brunch place to cross off the list.  I took my best friend who was visiting from Chicago to Cafe Carumba one Sunday before climbing the treacherous Camelback Mountain, and we enjoyed ourselves.  The portions were just right, the prices were expected, and the service was nice and friendly.  No hashed browns on the menu, though, which was a little downer since they are a staple order item at weekly brunches.  I'm not sure what else to write.  It was not bad, not great.  It was good enough, and I could probably see myself returning there again at some point.  

If you DO go, check out the pictures in the bathroom.  They are hilarious.
