Had lunch here today.  It's great since it's tucked away in a corner, but you can tell that once people find this place, they keep coming back.  Not to the point where it's hard to find a table, but it seemed relatively busy for lunch and especially in this location.

Service was friendly and good.  Seemed a bit slow, but I always tend to want to everything to move faster to give me enough time to get back to the office.

Food was good!  If you are looking for more of a tex-mex place... this would not be your best bet.  This place tends to lean more towards authentic than the jazzed up americanized mexican that people may have gotten used to.  We ordered the Queso con Chorizo... which seemed a little liquidy and greasy, but it was ok.  Not terrible, but not great either.  I'm sure regular queso would have been great.

I'll definitely go back now that I've tried it.... with lots of lunch menu items and combinations, should be a good spot to keep on the list as far as satisfying the mexican food cravings I tend to get every day.
