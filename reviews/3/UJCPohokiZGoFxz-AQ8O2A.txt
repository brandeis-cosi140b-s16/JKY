Service very slow.  We watched everyone around us get our food and we sat and waited.  Once it came we we wholly unimpressed.  We both had 3 taco+veggie plate and each got three diff tacos.  The mushroom taco was mushy and weird and the Korean taco lacked flavor.   The rest were only ok.  The only great thing was the Mexican corn but I found two hard unpopped corn kernels in it and almost broke my tooth.  We told the waiter and he didn't even acknowledge the complaint.  Three stars ONLY for the ambiance of the place.  Gorgeous.
