We really like Super Mex.  It has pretty decent Tex Mex offerings and a pretty large menu.  They even have a discounted and a "lite" menu, for even more options.  You are bound to find something you like here.

We started going to Super Mex when I found a few buy one get one coupons from the Vegas Entertainment book.  I love a good coupon and the place was around the corner from where hubby works, so of course we had to go.  I am so happy we went too because the food is pretty yummy!  It is good, solid Tex Mex style food at reasonable prices.

Our favorite dishes are the chimichangas, gigantic burritos, tacos, and the flautas.   I actually get the chimi 8 out of 10 times that we go because they are so addictive!  You can even get them enchilada style, meaning covered in red enchilada sauce and cheese, which is simply AMAZING!  My hubby is the same way with the tacos.  Yummy!

On top of the menu items, you also get chips, salsa, and bean dip.  The chips are actually tostadas that you break apart and scoop the yumminess onto.  The salsa at Super Mex is really good too.  It doesn't taste like your average salsa from other places.  It is darker in color and has different layers of flavor.  Tasty!  And the bean dip rocks.  I usually finished it off before my hubby and daughter can even get a bite.  Hey, you snooze, you lose when there is bean dip on the table next to me!

The service here is hit and miss though.  Sometimes you get awesome service and sometimes not.  That is why I wen with 3 stars.  The food is easily 4 stars and is pretty consistent in my opinion.

So see you at Super Mex.  I will be the one stuffing my face with a chimichanga!
