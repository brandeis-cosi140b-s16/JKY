This was a pleasant surprise.  I was looking for another restaurant that must have closed and came across Cuco's by accident.  The d√©cor is definitely kid friendly, they have toys and things to occupy the little ones.  

They serve chips and fresh salsa which was delicious.  I had one of the combination plates and the food was excellent.  The portion is quite large, so you will not leave hungry.  The price was very reasonable and the service was good.
