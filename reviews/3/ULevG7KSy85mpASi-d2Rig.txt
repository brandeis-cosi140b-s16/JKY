I've been here numerous times and never had a bad experience.

It is what it is and I like it for that. It's not gourmet, it's not fancy or original probably not even authentic, but it's dependable.

I've always been served HOT decent tasting food. Their salsa isn't  half bad even though its made from canned tomatoes with added fresh cilantro, the chips are great, always hot and fresh.

Their Carnitas are some of my favorite, my husband is  fan of the cheese enchiladas and I also order the fish tacos too(see pic). All these items have been consistently good.

It can get busy with the annoying resort crowd, but if your looking for just plain old generic Mexican food that will fill you up and not rip you off, this is it.
Yes I've had better and yes there is better, but like I said before:

It is what it is and I like it for that. It's not gourmet, it's not fancy or original probably not even authentic, but it's dependable.
And I've definitely had worse!
