Despite my best efforts, I like Taco Bell. 

Yeah, I've heard the rumors. The "D" Grade Meat, the cockroach stories. I'm skeptical of all of them, but moreso because I don't want to believe them.

I acknowledge that TB is not even remotely close to what is classically considered healthy. But what about health of mind and spirit? What can deliver that better than deep fried cheesy goodness of Taco Bell?

Not buying it? It was worth a shot. 

Here's My Point: I actually believe that the "deciders" (yeah, I said it) or head chefs that create and select the temporary specialty items for Taco Bell have something going on. The Double Decker Taco? The Cheesy Gordita Crunch? The Supreme Chalupa??? These were all creative and tasty pieces of America's culinary history. In the gross, fast food section.
