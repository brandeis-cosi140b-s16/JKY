Burritos deluxe. Nicely done. The interesting thing is that the salsa and the other dipping sauce the give you with your chips. The salsa looks horrible but is actually really good and spicy. The other dip was good, it was just a mystery dip to cool your pallet after the surprising ugly dip kicked you with some heat. Nice job all around, but we do eat with our eyes.
