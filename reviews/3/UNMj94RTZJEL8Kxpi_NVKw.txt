After reading the reviews I thought I was in for a treat. The food was O.K. Not as great as the other reviews made it sound. I was under the impression that the hard taco shells were home made, they looked and tasted like store bought, that was disappointing. The food over all lacked salt. It could of used it to bring out the flavors and brighten it up. You should give them a try and form your own opinion....
The man at the counter was very nice though, if that counts.
