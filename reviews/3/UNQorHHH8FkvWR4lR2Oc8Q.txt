First, the food is very good and I would give the place 4 stars simply based on the quality of the food.  The refried beans are very flavorful and the rice was light and tasty.  I subtracted a star because I am comparing this location to its fast food neighbor about a mile East on Guadalupe called Filiberto's.  Filiberto's food is good, but they have the chips, salsa and pickled veggies bar that I love.  That's all Salazar needs to do; just add a chips and salsa bar and I'll stop going to Fili's all together.  Not to mention that Salazar Bros. green salsa is hot and extremely tasty.  Very few restaurants make a hot and tasty green salsa and they do theirs better than any in the Valley.  

I will certainly be back to try their carne asada and fries and to get more of that green salsa!

*Tip*
So you need to go to urgent care and the location on Guadalupe and Rural is on your plan?  Give your spirits a little lift and walk around the corner to get a little Salazar Bros.
