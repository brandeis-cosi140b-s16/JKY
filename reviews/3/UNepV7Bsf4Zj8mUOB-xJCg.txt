So after my initial first review I looked over my reciept and noticed they have a lot of extra fees. They even charge for your tortillas??!! Really. 
Last night was probably our last time having this place. The customer service was bad and they were on portion patrol. We asked for a little extra cheese cause they barely put any and they said it would be extra. The tortilla chips and white cheese dip were just bad... don't even waste your money. Looks like I will be going back to Chipotle where I know I am getting non horomone induced quality meats and as much cheese and tortillas as I need. I guess I just had beginners luck eating here... bummer.
