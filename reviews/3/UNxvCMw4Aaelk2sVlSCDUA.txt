My high school reunion- I changed my mind a week before and decided to go. I didn't realize it was more bar than restaurant. My friend M rode down with me. I tried to tell her what my high school was like, but she had to experience it first hand. We parked and heard country music floating through as drunk people stumbled out. We walked in dressed in, or I should say overdressed in, black cocktail dresses. Everyone else was wearing tank tops and jeans. We were dressed to go to Scottsdale afterwards. My former classmates kept saying "Why are you ditching us for  "Snotsdale"? Regardless I was happy to see everyone.

After some margaritas, yes we got them salty, I was right back in high school. It was fun catching up with everyone. M. got hit on by Mr. Popular who was a year ahead of our class. I don't even know why he attended our reunion, but his pick up line was classy. "I've noticed you all night, you're cute. Come here. Do you know who I am?" M's reaction, "Um..... no thanks. I have no idea who you are. I didn't go to this high school." 

It was relaxed and casual. They had good cheap margaritas. I wouldn't mind going back. I'll be found in tank top and jeans, the token Asian.
