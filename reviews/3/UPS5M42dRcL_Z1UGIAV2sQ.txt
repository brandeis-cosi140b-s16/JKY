Been to this chain many times,  but this is the first visit in awhile and the prices keep going up, up and away. My Damn burrito almost broke the 10 buck mark..cmon. They have two versions of chicken..one is stewed and the other is fire grilled and way better, but they charge you a buck extra. They are both chicken, so that is a bunch of crap and the burro is already $7.95 and only includes salsa..meat..beans..and rice and cheese. Everything else is extra. Not dropping ten on a fast food burrito...so adios and this chain refuses to issue coupons.
