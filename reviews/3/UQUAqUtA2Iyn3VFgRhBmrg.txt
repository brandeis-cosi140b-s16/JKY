This place had so much potential!!  But fell way short!  Salsa while tasty, was very watery! The case so was OK. We ordered the green chili burrito had it fried up chimichanga style and at the burrito was huge but was full of potatoes! I'm cooked potatoes! Who puts potatoes in there Green chili pork?  The service was good but took forever to get our meal.  Probably will not come back to this place.
