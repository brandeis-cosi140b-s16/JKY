This place is really close to my work. I eat chipotle 2-3 times a week and i go here almost every week, sometimes twice. Its always been good chipotle spot, friendly crew and quick, but lately getting stingy with the meat. If i wanted to pay 10 dollars for a bowl of rice of beans i would just do it myself instead.
