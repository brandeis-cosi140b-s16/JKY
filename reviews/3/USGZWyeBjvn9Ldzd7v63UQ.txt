Food is ok..you have to know what's good..(fajitas and rice pretty much)...kinda pricey, open late....everything is extra and extra expensive ..a mini sour cream container costs .75c .cilantro is extra...soda is ridiculously priced...I always feel like I am getting ripped off when I buy food there..overall ok place to go when nothing else is opened
