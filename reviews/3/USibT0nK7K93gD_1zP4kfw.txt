When my fav tacos are not available this is a great place to eat. The tacos are delicious and if you order drive thru they are very generous with the ingredients for the tacos. The horchata is the powder mix kind, I wouldn't order it again. Also, the steak quesadilla although good flavor hardly had steak so I wouldn't order it again. Let's put it this way it had the equivalent steak of 1 small taco.
