I went here today for lunch- I ordered the Carne Asada Burrito to go- I looked around inside the restaurant and saw a lot of people waiting for their food and they did not appear to be too happy.  After 20 minutes, I finally got my food.  The Burrito was pretty good-good carne asada-good flavor but it was somewhat on the small side.  With the homemade lemonade, my entire bill was around $11.00.  I will probably go back because they have a good menu.
