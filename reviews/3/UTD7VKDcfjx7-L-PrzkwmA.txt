Let me start this off by saying I LOVE Chipotle.  I could eat it everyday if I could afford that.  I've been to them in Champaign/Chicago/etc.  They're great and deserve five stars.

The problem with this Chipotle in particular- THE LINE.  Holy hell.  Everytime I would think to myself, "I want Chipotle" I'd look in and see a line wrapping around the building.  Of course I waited in it, but it took forever.  This isn't a one time occuring thing either- there is always a LINE.  

I think it's because of the online orders, backing everything up. Either way, the food and everything is still excellent, it's just a long wait.
