Four of us went here for dinner tonight with a $25 restaurant.com certificate.  Two people had fajitas (one chicken, one beef), my wife had Pollo Ranchero, and I had steak Tacos al Carbon.  We also had an order of table side made guacamole.

Everything was very good and we all enjoyed our respective meals very much.  The guacamole was outstanding.  Service was very good.  The staff was quick to refill drinks, and we were quite pleased with our decision to eat here prior to seeing Louie Anderson in the Bonkerz Comedy Club.
