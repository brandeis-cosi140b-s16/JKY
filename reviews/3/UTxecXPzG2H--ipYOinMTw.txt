Came here since according to my phone this place is the closest to my hotel. 

Nice view of the place it sits on top of a little hill. 

The place looks pretty fancy from in and out, nice Mexican folklore decor, and very clean all round. 

I only wish I can say the same for their food, I mean it's not all that great. 

I experienced the "Burrito Dinner" was like a tasteless and rather small, like an oversize taco. The Arroz and Frijoles were also not all that good. 

Besides, I sampled another entr√©es off from my co-works, they didn't taste any better. 

It's kinda pricey here, for being below average Mexican Food. But I suppose it has to be since its about the only Mexican Restaurant in the area. 

Nevertheless, the service is truly great here. The bus boys are always on point, and the waitresses are not only very pretty, but also very attentive. 

Sharp looking place with super great service, but their food lacks in taste.
