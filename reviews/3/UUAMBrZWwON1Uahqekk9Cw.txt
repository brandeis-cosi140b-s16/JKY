This place is A-OK due to the extreme value.  You can certainly find more delicious, more authentic Mexican food around the Vegas valley.  However, you may not be able to find flavorful, decent food that fills you up (twice) and doesn't get you sick for $4 to $5.

I had a wet carne asada burrito.  It was good.  I only ate half.  Very filling.  

I'm not sure we will go back...but if you are hungry and short on cash, this place will meet your needs.
