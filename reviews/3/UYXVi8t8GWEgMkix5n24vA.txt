Quick Review™
+   Great location within striking distance of multiple buildings (A,B,C) on campus. Parking is free. Food OK.

+/- Food OK. You aren't asking anyone to freeze this and ship it to you via courier service if you are across the world. 

-    Breakfast menu could be expanded and competitively priced (although, they have no competition, which may be the problem). Limited desserts are not good.

Employee of Excellence™: María. Anyone named María at a taco shop is definitely going to be an employee of esteem.

In One Sentence™: Consistent, cheap -- although not exactly inexpensive -- calories conveniently located in B (or is it C?).

This might be the very embodiment of cheap, Mexican-inspired-Southwest-based dive. One always wishes it were better ....

It pains me to relegate María is just an average three-star. We've been through so much, María! 

There really is nothing else around here (walking distance) and with the bizarre sudden appearance and even more rapid disappearance of Smashburger® across the street at Charleston Festival, it might be Maria's or certain starvation (if one did not bring food) unless you have time for the exceptional Moko (http://www.yelp.com/biz/moko-asian-bistro-las-vegas) across the street or upstart Sofrito Rico at Campus Commons (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sofrito-rico-authentic-puerto-rican-cuisine-las-vegas). Chipotle® sucks (http://www.yelp.com/biz/chipotle-mexican-grill-las-vegas-5?hrid=k9UPnGqKGDDMGiRMsNmlAQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)). 

I digress.

I am not going over all the plates I have had here. I've had too many. (Check the check-ins.)

What I will do is exhort you to not try the desserts because they are no bueno. And anyone who knows me knows that I love my sweets. No bueno, amigos. Tacos are alright. Burritos do well in a bind when you have very little time to be wasting. 

They need food trucks on campus to elevate the food racket around here. Go grab one of your campus senators by the collar and demand they introduce an item for the next agenda meeting calling for food trucks to be invited to campus. 

Until then, we have María's.

Rating: Three-stars, "A-OK." (Chipotle® sucks.)
