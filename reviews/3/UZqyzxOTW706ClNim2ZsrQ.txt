Lunch on a cold rainy day....For starters we had the cheese dip which was delicious, but  how can you really mess up cheese and chips.  A little guacamole, some salsa verde(by request only).  My girl had the salsa verde enchiladas, which she loved and i tried the homemade black bean burger. Which was served on a  soft hot huge bun, topped with this black bean spread, guacamole mayo.   Surprisingly good.   We usually eat Loco Lime, but thought we would try something different.  Yes i recommend this place ...Oh yeah, the Margaritas are Incredible!
