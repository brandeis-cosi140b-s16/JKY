On our way to Luxor from Mandalay Bay, we wanted to try The Burger Barn.  The wait was over an hour and we were starving.  So we decided to try Hussong's.

It's more of a sports bar than a Mexican restaurant.  It worked for us since we love basketball and we could watch few games at the same time.

We ordered...
Blackberry Splash Margarita - not so good
El Poblano Margarita - AMAZING!
Steak tacos - delicious!  Huge portions that I couldn't finish.
Cheese enchiladas - my husband enjoyed it.

Overall a good experience.  Will I come back just for this restaurant?  Not likely.
