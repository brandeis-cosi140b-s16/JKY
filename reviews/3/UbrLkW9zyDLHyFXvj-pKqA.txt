Better than average. Like many Mexican restaurants,  we were quickly served complimentary chips and salsa after ordering, which is kind of like the cover of a book or a first impression. The salsa verde was tangy and slightly spicy, just how a green salsa should be in my opinion, but the red salsas were kind of watery and not great. My chile relleno was nicely charred and tasty but the rice and beans were pretty status quo. My companion was happy to be able to order menudo and thought it was good. The service was very good,  quick and attentive. Anyway, I'd go back if I'm in the area and hungry but won't be driving out of the way to eat here.
