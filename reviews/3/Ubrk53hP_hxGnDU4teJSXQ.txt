The food is great. I love me some homemade rice&beans....Red burrito w/machaca meat please. Chips and salsa are also yummy. 
Customer service is hit or miss. Everyone is really nice until you need extra napkins or more chips.  They do it with a smile, but then you hear them yelling in the back at each other. And whats the deal with the chips...self serve?..they serve?..free or is there a charge. Self seating, you seat us?  Always changing. No bueno Sylvia. The food has remained delicious..so Sylvia's gets 5 stars for the food, but 2 for customer service, 1 for inconsistency. Average 3 stars.
