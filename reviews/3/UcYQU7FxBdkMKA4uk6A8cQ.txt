I went to Ricardo's mid-week with a large group from work. We were not offered menus, but it may have been pre-arranged that we were all getting the buffet. Our party was seated in the buffet area with some literally having those lining up for the buffet rubbing up against them. 

The carne asada tacos at the buffet were outstanding. The remaining items were all middle-of-the-road, standard buffet grub you can get at any casino buffet.

The staff was very friendly and did a good job keeping up with drink refills and clearing empty plates. I have yelped before that I am not a big fan of mandatory gratuities, especially eighteen percent at a buffet. I still think it is ridiculous, but after our waitress Debra told us she had been with Ricardo's for thirty-four years, it was a little more tolerable. Hats off to Debra for her years of service. Ricardo's must be a great place to work, as all of the employees I encountered seemed to be happy and eager to please.

The buffet was $12.50 including a beverage and was average at best, except for the CA tacos. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Average food.
