There really isn't much I can say that Chad E. didn't say. I think his review is absolutely spot on. The service is great, friendly staff that are quick and constantly kept the refills coming. The location is ok, the decor is ok, everything is ok. Large portions, not too expensive, but the food tastes a little bland. Certainly not bad, but as Chad said, a bit lacking. Everything lacks flavor and tastes the same. That being said, it wasn't a bad experience. I suggest trying Taxco if you're in the Mint Hill area and want Mexican, but don't go out of your way for it.
