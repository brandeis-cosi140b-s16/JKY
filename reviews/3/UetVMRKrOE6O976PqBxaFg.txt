It's basically Roberto's, with a few different menu items. Quality is okay, portions are large, prices are pretty affordable. Unfortunately, the food was somewhat lacking- chile relleno lacked heat in both the pepper itself as well as the sauce but I liked that it wasn't overbattered, and the ceviche tostada was a shrimp mixture that seemed as if it hadn't marinated long enough but it was really fresh. 

One "different" menu item to try is the #26 special. It's a 5-piece order of rolled tacos topped with lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream, guac, and your choice of meat. It's like asada fries, but with taquitos instead of fries. Definitely enough for 2-3 people to share.

Drive thru service was quick and polite, I preferred their green salsa to the red. They have menudo on weekends.
