My group of four unanimously agreed that this was a good place to have a meal. The menu is different from many Mexican restaurants. The main dishes are tacos and there are some entree options as well as a nice selection of appetizers. I had one chicken (pollo, for your Spanish speakers) taco and one vegetarian of some kind. They were both pretty good. I would be interested in trying other items on another visit. 

Parking was easy. The best part of the meal was the margerita.
