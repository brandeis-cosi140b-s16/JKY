The meal started with the coconut crusted shrimp and orange jalapeno dipping sauce.  The shrimp was well prepared but the sauce was somewhat bland and oily - very oily.  For the entree, I had the chicken mole.  The waiter described the mole precisely which was excellent since it was the sole reason for choosing it.  However, the sauce was poured over a very small half chicken with skin and bones resulting in little meat and lots of picking through the skin and bones to find said meat.  The fresh squeezed limeade could have used more lime juice.

The restaurant itself is comfortable and inviting.  Service was excellent.
