We loved the food, just wish the place was a little cleaner. There was garbage all over the floor and lots of food on the tables. The walls near the tables were gross as well. I wanted to blame it on the place being too busy but there were only 3 tables and the people working seemed bored. The ketchups were empty and greasy. The food is delish but kinda makes it hard to enjoy when you have to eat it in a harsh environment. The service is awesome, Ill keep going but hope they will see this and make some changes.
