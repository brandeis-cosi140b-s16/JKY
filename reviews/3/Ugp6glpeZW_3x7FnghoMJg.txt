You either like salmon or you don't. Unless you don't know the difference.  A little effort to learn the differences ( color, placement location on the food line, label) in the part of employees should have would be appreciated. 

We recently walked over following a haircut and I commented that this Cafe Rio has a huge hurdle that they can't overcome. Their location really was a poor decision on the part of business / franchise owners.  Parking appeared to be difficult, lots of COX trucks and Vans (dining at Buffalo Wild Wings) hot weary desert dwellers flocking into ColdStone Creamery.  Cafe Rio was empty. It was 1:pm on a Saturday. 

I don't hate salmon. I just have to be in the mood for it.  Mahi was my other choice! I was really hungry for fish tacos.  The Salmon tacos she prepared for me weren't bad. They just weren't what I wanted or ordered. I wasn't going to mention it until my husband announced that the last couple of times he chose a dining option for us something went wrong.  (Hmmm maybe he needs to use YELP more) Taking the employee aside I pointed out on the receipt the mistake. I let her know,however,  I intended to finish them.  "Oh, I'm sorry."  And that was that. 

I refilled my mint limeade!  And sat down, to finish my food. Let it be known Cafe Rio has the Best beverage options. Horchata, frescas, and more. 

Before I'd taken another bite this still apologetic employee arrived and very eloquently apologized and made a very kind offer to restore my confidence and to improve the chance of my return business.  We spoke about the difference between the two types of fish. She was gracious and had indicated that the manager on duty had helped her to figure out how to handle the customer issue. 

The salmon tacos were moist and full of flavor... Had I known I was getting salmon adding the avocado tomatillo sauce would have been ideal.  

Partner enjoyed a pork burrito and found it much to his liking!
