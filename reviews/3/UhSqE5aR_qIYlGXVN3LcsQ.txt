I'm giving this place a solid 3 stars simply because its all over the place and I can't choose between love it and hate it.

Been here as a club- mostly love. Fun, very relaxed, good times. 

As a restaurant- oh boy. Used to come for $1 tacos on sundays to watch football, had a blast!  Knew a particular server so service was attentive. Then I went one day.. food tasted different. Went again- food not so good and higher prices? Not a good sign. Went last night to sit and watch the Cards get their ass beat (I'm a fan, but cmon.. this year its been handed to us)
Ok- hot bartender. Stiff drink. Fries. Lots and lots of screens to watch us lose on. These were the positives.

Druunnnkk guy hitting on me @ 7 and us losing the game (not Sandbars fault). A new sandwich that had: terrible bread falling apart, beans, lettuce, tomato, onion, pineapple, avocado, queso fresca, chicken, ham, and some sauce. Wow. Dear God, refine this sandwich before it makes its way onto the menu. Way too much going on. These were the negatives.

The couple ever so quietly getting it on in the bathroom so it actually took me a few moments to realize what was happening? Undecided. Not gonna lie, it kept a smile on my face for awhile.

Ill be back, I like the atmosphere. Ill just try not to be hungry
