If you like modern mexican cuisine, you'll get it here.  It's a quaint little restaurant with a lot of character on the inside.  However, sometimes the wait can be extremely long in which case the only place to hang out while you're waiting is the microscopically small bar area or outside the restaurant (in which case you'll have a not so great view of a not so pretty street).  Big with the downtown hipster set.
