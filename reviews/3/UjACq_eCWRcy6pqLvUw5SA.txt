If you're not a fan of spicy food, stay away from Phoenix's Los Dos Molinos. The New Mexican restaurant "doesn't know how to make mild," meaning the salsas and sauces will burn your tongue off if you're weak like me. Thankfully, the sodas are served in extra-large glasses, and every table gets its own pitcher of water to wash the food down with.

The family-owned restaurant, which is decorated with a mix of Native American and Mexican kitschy art, originated in Arizona and now has four locations in the state, as well as one in New York.

My dining companion and I ordered combination plates--he got two beef tacos with beans and rice ($10.95), while I munched on cheese enchiladas ($11.95). Skip the chili sauce if you don't want a spicy meal--it was tough to finish mine, since I opted for the tasty and spicy green chili.

My pal pointed out that the food tasted super-fresh, probably because no meal is made until it's ordered. It came out in about 5 minutes, though, so the staff definitely knows what they're doing in the kitchen.

For dessert, we ordered the best sopapillas ($5.95) I've ever had. They were so soft and doughy, almost like a thicker version of fry bread. If only I had saved more room, and my burned taste buds, for dessert.

Next time, I'll skip the chili sauce and use the salsa sparingly on the thick-cut chips.
