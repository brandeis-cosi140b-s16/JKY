While this is not my favorite Mexican restaurant, the food is good and service around lunchtime is a-ok.  They do have some nice choices for lunch specials, which are very reasonably priced.   I am a fan of the Fronterra Burrito which includes rice, black beans, chicken & cheese that is served with a side salad.  Chips & salsa are tasty and plentiful, so remember not to fill up before your entree arrives!
