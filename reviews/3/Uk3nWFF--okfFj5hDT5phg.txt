Hehe I definitely wouldn't recommend this place if I wanted mexican food but the tex-mex style here is ok.

Basically the average american style Mexican Restaurant with a lot of guac/sour cream/fried with mild flavors executed in an ok way.

If you want real Mexican food though prepare to be disappointed
