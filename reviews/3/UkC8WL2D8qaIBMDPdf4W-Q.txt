Never been a Chipotle fan. Not since the Great Food Poisoning of 2006! But, I try not to hold grudges in life, so I took a gamble and circled-back w/them today, 3/13/2015. Wow, took me almost 10 yrs? I have issues...

They're just okay, I guess. They are fast, fresh and friendly. But, this location's music was SOOO cranked up it made me wince. Really. It frustrated me that I hadn't taken lip-reading courses to even understand all of the servers over the music. I shouted back at them, "What?" "I can't hear you!". I resorted to pointing at what I wanted on my burrito (like a small child would).

The steak is pretty chewy in my burrito, gotta say. Flavoring is decent. I"m sulking also because of the LOUD MUSIC, the Server gave me black beans instead of pinto! Turn the stuff down! It's not relaxing - it's stressful at that volume.

A la carte chips? Good crunchy corn taste, but for Pete's sake - too much salt!! Bleechhh!

So, let's pray I don't have WW3 in my belly later and life moves on for me.
