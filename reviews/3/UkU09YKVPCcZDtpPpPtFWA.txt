Carne Asada fries and the al pastor torta are solid here- service is drive-up or walk-up, and they don't habla ingles or accept credit, so be prepared with your best espanol and cash dinero.

The asada fries are a little bit of fries, a bigger bit of asada, and an insane amount of sour cream and cheese. I was good after a few bites, but it really needed hot sauce thrown on top to cut through the grease- even after doing so, we were unable and unwilling to finish the portion, which is probably a blessing in disguise.

The torta was large, they're all a flat $5 with your choice of meat, and they are mostly meat instead of filler ingredients- very cheap and fast lunch if you're already in the area.
