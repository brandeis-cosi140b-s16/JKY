So glad there is a semi-decent Mexican place in 'Copa. The food (minus the terrible refried beans and hose tap water) is generally good. Chile Colorado and Chile Verde are both tasty, the fajitas are decent, the fundido is gloriously fattening and good. However, the service after opening was nice, but as time has gone on the service makes me really reconsider coming here as it always borders on rude and abrasive.
