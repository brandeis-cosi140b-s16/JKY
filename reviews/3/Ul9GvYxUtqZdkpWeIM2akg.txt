This has been my families go to restaurant since before I was even born. Have always loved the place however the last three times there I have had such poor service I hardly want to return. Two of those occasions Christina was my servers name and she was horrible, and extremely rude. When I told her my order had come out wrong she actually accused me of lying and saying that isn't what I ordered, I've only been getting the exact same meal here for 25 years so somehow I doubt there was a slip of tongue.
