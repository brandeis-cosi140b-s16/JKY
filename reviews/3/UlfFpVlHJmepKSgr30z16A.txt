This place was pretty good, but not incredible. I would recommend the Al Pastor tacos as they were quite flavorful and came with pineapple! The chicken tacos were bland and unremarkable. Unfortunately, the tacos were only served with a single corn tortilla which fell apart quickly.

This is better Mexican food than many places around Pittsburgh, but only in the middle of my range. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again, but would probably try it again if I was driving by.
