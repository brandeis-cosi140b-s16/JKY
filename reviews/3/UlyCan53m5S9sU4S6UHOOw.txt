More like a 2.8 but I will be a half glass full kinda guy on this November day.    Happy hour was nearing its end  so I chose to  go with a yinzerita (still have no idea what was in it but assume  it had Margarita characteristics with an Appalachian accent )  It tasted a bit watered down but I like the look of the Corona stuck in it 10:30 angle style,,,, had the pulled chicken Taquitoes (spell?)  which were average at best but I was starved from my drunken walkabout.    Service was aloof and borderline arrogant.  Crowd was 20 something crew so at least I know I wouldn't be stabbed or puked on at 6:45pm

I am not really sure why I went with a 2.8 but I did.  :O
