They are very, very, VERY racist!! This is my 3rd time visiting this yummy Mexican place. The food is AMAZING! Sadly they are racist :( The first time I ate food from here my husband got it to go(my husband is white...blonde hair, green eyes), while I waited in the car. He ordered me nachos and got him self carne asada fries. The nachos were really yummy, but they didn't have a lot of toppings. I went back on my own about a week and a half ago and the food they gave me was AMAZING! It was 100 times better than what my husband got! I'm middle eastern, but can pass as Mexican. I assumed my food was better because there was a man working the register and cooking the food. I decided to go back a few days ago for lunch because the food was sooooooo good! Well, this time there were women behind the counter....they were super nice and friendly! I noticed some white people come in and her attitude completely changed, she was rude and almost seemed annoyed that they were there. Their food was ready before mine, the quality was the EXACT quality my husband got! My food was ready right after theirs, and mine was AMAZING wayyyy better than what they got!! 

I don't think they like white people....the whole menu is in Spanish! I can read and speak Spanish...so it's no problem for me. I think if they really wanted Americans in their restaurant.... they would translate the menu. I give it 3 stars because they are nice to me and the food is AWESOME! I take away the other two because they were not so nice to my husband :(
