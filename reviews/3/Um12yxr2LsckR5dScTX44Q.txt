14 years ago after moving to Las Vegas, this was a place we thought had some good fish taco's but we had so many other places to eat, we had't returned. Today, on this side of town I thought I'd try it again. 

I got the costal trio, Original Fish Taco, Salsa Verde Shrimp Taco and Regal Spring Tilapia Taco. The shrimp and fish taco's was good, fresh, crispy with crunch, however, the tilapia was a little fishy smell, it turned me off. 

I like their choices, you can mix and match and the have a fresh salsa bar. And i love the fresh mango tea!
