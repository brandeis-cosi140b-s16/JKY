Cute, colorful taqueria, great staff, large menu, decent veg selection. Service is very quick. 

But the flavors seem hurried, not thought out - ranchero sauce is canned, diced tomatoes, little else - salsa verde lacks the tangy umph that is oh so important. Portions are surprisingly small for the money. 

Like a number of taquerias along South, it seems this place is shooting for authentic Mex, and only achieving above-average Tex Mex. Burritos are good, but small, and smothered in what seems to be pureed ancho chili, yet somehow not spicy. I won't be trekking across town for a tiny plate of overpriced, under sauced chilaquiles again, but would come here if I was suffering such a craving for 'ritos that I couldn't stand a 15 minute drive.
