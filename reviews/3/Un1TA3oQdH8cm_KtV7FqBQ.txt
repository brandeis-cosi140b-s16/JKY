Fun gelato flavors:
Chai latte
Choc chili raspberry 
Mojito

Fun interior, seating at counter where tacos are prepared, cool sidewalk seating/ppl watching (no creeper).

Tacos...$11 gets you two fresh tacos (flavors could be more bold tho!) and chips & salsa. Definitely try if you're in the mood for Mexican. Would love to see homemade chips, maybe offered as some sort of weekly special?!
