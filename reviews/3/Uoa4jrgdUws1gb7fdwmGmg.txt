This place serves some delicious tasting Mexican food. Although the hours they put up on here are not accurate. It says they open at 7am when they really open at 8am. Tried going there with a friend at 7 but the sign on their door had a totally different schedule. I recommend calling them first before you go to make sure they're open. Other than the conflicting hours, the servers are here are so nice and helpful. I definitely suggest it to Mexican food lovers out there.
