This place seemed to be pretty awesome just from judging the facility itself. It was clean and had great staff. Everyone was friendly and the servers were always coming back to check in or refill waters. It was seemingly a flawless restaurant. Unfortunately, though the restaurant had all these great qualities, the food wasn't all that impressive. I got the pastor tacos and it was alright. I then tried some of my friend's food, and that was also alright. Everything was just average. I don't know if I would come back simply because the food wasn't that appealing to me. Obviously this is my one personal opinion so others could totally think I'm wrong, but if you asked me to again, I'd probably turn the offer down and go to somewhere else in Red Rock.
