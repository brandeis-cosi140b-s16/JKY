Met some friends at Otro Saturday night.  Even though our table was set--we waited almost 15 minutes to be seated and this was at 6:00 pm.  Otro is just okay--nothing knock your socks off about anything--I had a trout special--the fish was good but not outstanding--five people at the table ordered the paella--and to the person everyone said it did not have enough flavor--it was just okay.  The highlight was the lime pie--yellow like it is supposed to be and puckery.  All the prices are very reasonable--I was just hoping that the food would take my breath away.  I will probably go back to Otro--but it will be for the company  whoever that may be rather than being drawn to the food.

One more thing--the service was just off--either it was too much or not enough--but it never hit the sweet spot.
