The margaritas are absolutely awesome here! No sweet and sour mix, just good old fashioned squeezed lime and good quality tequila...beautiful. The margarita with "attitude" is probably my favorite with just a hint of jalape√±o and some cilantro, achieving a wonderful balance of sweet spicy and earthy.

The food is not my favorite around, but not disastrous. The chicken enchilada, which is presented more like a lasagna was acceptable, but the sauce was watery and bland. The camarones con chile ajo however was unacceptable. It included something like an English muffin slathered with some red aioli and three small shrimp with no sign of spice at all minus the two dried chile de Arbol included for garnish. But the cochinita pibil was almost a 4.5 star plate. Tender achiote braised pork was legit, the tortillas were nice and warm and the lime crema tart and tasty. But the fried plantain nuggets were black as hell and soggy, and the pickled red onion alas was mushy.

It's obvious that the chef is more from the yucatan region of Mexico as the indigenous dishes from that region show up strong on the menu, and it would be my guess the best ones...like the cochinita.

It seems like Taberna is trying to fancy itself more like the Mission in terms of food and drink, but is closer to an On the Border in execution. I still don't understand the giant frozen margarita machines behind the bar. Sore thumb!

Would have been 3.5 stars but the salsas given with chip basket were sans salt!! Absolutely zero flavor except for the occasional cilantro sprig. If every customer who walks through the door is going to have that as a first impression, season it! Simple.
