Taco Tote used to be our favorite.  We ate this once a week maybe.  The problem is that the food quality isn't always good, I guess it depends who's cooking.  Sometimes the food doesn't taste as fresh.  My biggest complaint, the prices on the menu went up but the quality and service is the same.  You pay more if you go during dinner hours for the same food you would eat during lunch.  This does not make sense.
