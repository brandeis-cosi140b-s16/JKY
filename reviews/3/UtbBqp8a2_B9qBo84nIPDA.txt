I wanted to like this place more, but it lacks the casual, laid-back atmosphere of most Tex-Mex joints, and the food doesn't warrant the higher price tab. We took our kids and I felt a little out of place in the slightly upscale setting. Might be nice for a date night, though. The tacos were terrific and margaritas first-rate, but you can enjoy pretty much the same meal at Paco's Tacos or Maverick Rock for a good bit less.
