Mixed feelings about this place - the food was great, the salsa bar awesome, and the service really bad.  I really like the filling choices,  especially in a taco.  Their quesadillas are like a thick fry bread, I though they we're too greasy but everyone else raved.

Leave extra time to check out, it took longer than the meal.
