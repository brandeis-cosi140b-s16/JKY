Not outstanding Mexican food, yet popular mainstream food.  There was nothing spectacular with the food, yet I was content with the burrito, rice, beans.  Chips are tasteless.  It is what I would expect from this type of restaurant. Unfortunately they don't seem to make things spicy, and this is a terrible disappointment.  If you want something better, 1/2 block north of Peoria on 35th Ave is La Parilla Suiza; the food is outstanding.  Would I go back?  Yes, yet only because it is simple comfort food, but because of the outstanding recipes that they follow.
