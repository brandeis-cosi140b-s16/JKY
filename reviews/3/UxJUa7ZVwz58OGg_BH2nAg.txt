If you're looking for a great mexican restaurant, then there are other places to go than this one. But if its for something to fill a hungry stomach or just wants to eat in a simple place, then this is the right spot. Food is good and quite affordable too. You can't go wrong with this one. But like I said, if its something great that you are looking for, then you're better off going to some place much better (or expensive) than this.
