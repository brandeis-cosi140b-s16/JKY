I was so happy when Vaqueros expanded to this location. The same people who own the one on 18th Ave and Southern also own this one! This is an easy place to get good traditional Mexican food for lunch. The burritos are always quickly served and are humongous for the price. If you dine in, there are free chips available. I usually get the beef taco combo which is consistently good and includes moist refried beans and rice. This isn't a very fancy place but it's sure to curb your Mexican food cravings. PS- They make a killer Super Nacho/Fry (which should be shared unless you plan on going into cardiac arrest).
