It depends on what time of day you come, but they are friendly at this location. But twice a person put ingredients on my food that I wanted on the side but they didn't wait to listen to me finish my sentence or even bother to look at me. One thing that I wish they would do differently, is figure out a way to communicate with the three or four people assembling the food because Subway can not mix up your food, what can't Chipotle not mess up my food or mix it with another persons food.
