Taco Time is kind of out of the way for most people. In fact the location being inside a truck stop kinda ruins its availability and attractiveness to the stable patron of a fast food restaurant, the family.

My GF loves this franchise and explains every time we drive by how she grew up eating at one on the west coast.

We stopped by a few months ago and the food and service was your typical fast food Mexican fare. Nothing there stood out as great and would cause me to desire or crave the dish I had.

Last night the GF begged me to bring her a veggie burrito. I parked and went inside and was surprised to see how many smelly truckers there were. Had to be two or three truckers for every truck outside.

Service was fairly quick my GF couldn't find the sunflower seeds in her veggie burrito but it didn't stop her from wolfing it down.

I won't be coming here on my own (more Taco Johns than Taco Bell and I do live across from a taco shop and can walk there) I will be happy to drive down here the next time the GF gets the craving for home/childhood.
