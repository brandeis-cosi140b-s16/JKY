With all the recent Yelp talk about a taco crawl, I was craving tacos more than usual. So I decided to hit up El Compita during my lunch break. I didn't have a lot of time so I had to grab and go. It was crowded during lunch and I was the only non-latino/hispanic person in there. That's always a good sign that the place is "authentic" and good. I was too intimidated to order in my broken Spanish, so I just ordered in English and the guy behind the counter smiled. It was probably the only English he heard all morning.

I got an order of 4 tacos (2 carnitas, 1 asada, 1 pastor). Each taco was $1.05. Despite the crowd my order was up in about 10 minutes and the guy behind the counter was nice enough to tell me in English that my order was ready. Everything was good, but I still have to rank Los Parados and La Mexicana ahead of this place. The carnitas here are good, but the asada just doesn't come close to what you can get at the other two places. The pastor was decent, but my least favorite of what I tried. It just wasn't as tender as other places. But, it did have a lot of heat -- at least for me. I can't handle really spicy foods, so while it was spicy to me it's probably mild to most people. Ten minutes after I was done eating I could still feel the heat on my tongue. I had to wash it down with a few glasses of water.

There was a guy selling CD's and movies from one of the tables. He had a huge box full. It may have been the same guy that Lisa mentioned in her review, but the guy was quiet and low-key about pitching his stuff. 

3.5 stars.
