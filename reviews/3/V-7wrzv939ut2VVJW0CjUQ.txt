1st visit---friend invited me to hear a band. Two played that night, both great.
2nd visit---I returned to see that band. Oh and it was Reverse Happy Hour so I had two goooood margharitas. Sat at the bar.
3rd visit----that band and Reverse Happy Hour with two margharitas and guacamole. Good guacomole, chunky like I like it. Sat at the bar.

So that's the extent of my menu exploration there. The manager comped that guac because per her estimation it took far too long to deliver. (We weren't complaining, simply asking about it, and she took charge. I think that was good customer service. But really for me, and almost most importantly (I'm always looking for good live music), the music has been great each time---funky, latin, soulful rhythms. Yup I go back for the music but the fresh margaritas and chunky guac don't hurt at all. 

*Sadly the bands names won't come to me, and that is NOT a reflection on their performance, but let's just suspect that going on a Friday or Saturday night won't disappoint!
