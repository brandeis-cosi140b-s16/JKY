Came here for a friend's birthday a couple weekends ago, it was a Saturday night and we had some food right before the kitchen closed and stuck around til closing.  It wasn't overcrowded but it was still busy. Its pretty small, with the "dance floor" shoved in a small corner.  The music also seemed to be dated canned bar music with nothing current.  Maybe if I was a little drunker I wouldn't have cared, but that part seemed pretty generic to me.
