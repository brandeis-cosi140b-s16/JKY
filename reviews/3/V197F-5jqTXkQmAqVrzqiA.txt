I really wanted to love it, but couldn't.  The food was good, but it didn't pop.  I had the garlic shrimp which had some nice flavor, but it wasn't unique and it didn't speak to me.  The guacamole was good.  The shrimp in garlic sauce was pretty good.  Service was solid.

I might need to come back because the menu was extensive and it could only take one or two excellent items to change my mind on the place.
