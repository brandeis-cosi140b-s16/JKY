PROS: Most of the food items like the lettuce tasted fresh. They have a great variety and give you exactly what you ask for. 

the staff inside was fast and friendly, a long line was a short wait! 

They served margaritas, beer, and bottled water, just in case you're really thirsty :) and it was pretty cheap, too!

CONS: I have been to many a Chipotle, and I was a bit disappointed; they didn't give that much meat at all. Plus, the chicken was colder than normal. They scooped me too much rice and mild salsa. 

Got chips and guacamole; the guacamole had way too much onion in it, or the pieces were way too big. 

OVERALL: This chipotle was average! I know you guys can do soo much better.
