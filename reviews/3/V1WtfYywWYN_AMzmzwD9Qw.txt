2.5 stars - Cheap and insanely huge....For $7-8 you can have enough food to tip the scale over a few notches...I recommend sharing 

I tend to go for the #33 lunch special with a tostada and cheese enchilada. I preferred La Paz's enchiladas but now they are gone....so these will do. The food is sort of one note- cheesy.. Speaking of cheesy their queso is some of the better I've had (I am not an imitation cheese fan). The guac is just ok - wish they spiced it up a bit more and added more lime. 

A co-worker of mine ordered the veggie quesadilla - and honestly it was beyond even what a large plate is and was filled with huge chunks of once frozen veggies - cauliflower, broccoli, green peppers, onions. She said the veggies must have been cooked in a thicker oil (not something like olive oil) - and the flavor was odd. So  if you don't eat meat I think a better option (taste and sadly even calorie-wise) is the cheese enchilada. 

This wouldn't be a place I would go out of my way to go to, but I go as a group work lunch and haven't been  disappointed - not the best,  not the worst....just plain ok...
