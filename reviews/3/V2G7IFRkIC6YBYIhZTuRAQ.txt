Having been to Tacos el Gordo, that's what I compared this experience to.

We went during the week at 6pm, so it wasn't too busy.  Steady.  

The staff was polite and guided us through ordering process which was simple enough; however, when you have a few people standing around looking how to order it can seem like a hot mess navigating through those other people.

I wasn't impressed with the carne asada tacos or burrito.  

My husband and I thought the lengua and the al pastor tacos were good.

Would I go here again? Maybe.  I would rather prefer the tacos from Tacos el Gordo and I would rather prefer their prices.  Unfortunately, there is not one closer to where I live.
