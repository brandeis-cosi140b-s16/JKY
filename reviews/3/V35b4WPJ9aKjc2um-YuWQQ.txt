Was craving street tacos & Yelp steered us here. We tried the carne asada, carnitas & al pastor - carnitas was my favorite. It was very moist and tender. Ordered a carne asada quesadilla to share. Stay away! It was super greasy. The grease had soaked through the paper bag completely by the time we got home. I thought the grease had filtered out into the bag but nope more grease as I picked up a slice - it covered my hands. This was inedible.

Verdict - tasty street tacos but stay away from the quesadilla!
