Nice place to go for a quick sit-down lunch.  The lunch special (changes daily) is always a good deal and will be extremely filling.  For example, two enchiladas (LARGE ones), rice and beans can be $4.95 with a soda bringing you to $6 and change after tax.  Not bad if you aren't in the mood for drive through or a longer meal at Tia Rosa's.  They'll usually give you chips and salsa too while the owner/cook is at work.  

Standard fare of tacos, enchiladas, burritos throwing it some fajitas and chile rellono too.   The chorizo wasn't too greasy either so thats always a plus in my book.

Not bad for an extremely filling lunch break.  They've started serving beers too with a $2 Corona, Tecate, etc. Happy Hour.
