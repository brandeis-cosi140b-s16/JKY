I was really looking forward to eating here due to the recommendation of a coworker who knows what's up. Unfortunately I'm going to have to give it a 3 star "meh"...for now. 

The place is like a mom-n-pop Chipotle; you choose your meat and they build a taco/burrito etc. to your liking with their fixings. I had a carne asada burrito, it was tasty but it was cold. I've experienced this same problem at Chipotle and I assume it's due to the misuse of their steam tables. The chips and salsa that are included with each order were very good, and so are the prices and their service. The place is new, so I'll have to give this place another go and see if they've got some of the kinks worked out.
