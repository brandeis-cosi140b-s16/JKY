They have Surf & Turf special now. If you're on their e-mail list you should get a $1.00 off coupon. I tried their surf and turf taco combo. It was o.k., The lobster taco was good but the turf taco tasted kind of like beef jerky because the meat was so dry, and that was not so good. Still I would recommend this place because usually their food is really good.
