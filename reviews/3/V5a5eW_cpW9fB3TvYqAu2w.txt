C4. I want to understand you. Like I want to understand why my neighbor wears a Members Only jacket. Like I want to understand gay Republicans. And who was the first person to put vegetables in jell-0. I do C4. But ya gotta help me. The bar decor is all about the 4 tvs. That's cool I guess. But other than that, where am I supposed to sit? My vodka cran was weak. When I asked for a remake and let's make it a double. It arrived in a pint glass. Yes a pint glass. I didn't want double the drink. Just double on the booze pour. I wanted a greyhound, but the bartender never heard of that. I'm sure he thought I was trying to book a trip to Bakersfield or something. Come to find out C4, you just don't carry grapefruit juice. The sushi rolls were actually worse than something I would pick up at the grocery store. The teriyaki wings were passable, but a little dry. I do believe someone in the group enjoyed a burger. The dining room has a big spot with nothing in it, right below the cool painting of, I believe a dragon of some sort. Hey, how about a sofa or loungey kinda area? Since I can't seem to find a seat in the bar. And since we're neighbors C4, I'm gonna stop by again. Maybe I'll bring my friend with the Member's Only jacket.
