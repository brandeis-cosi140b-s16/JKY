4am drive thru challenge!

Actually, I had just finished up another late night & thought I needed a burger (or something).  So this was a flashback to my Sonic experience.  However, I didn't hate myself in the morning, this time.

Ordered a Bacon Double Del (an underrated burger, IMO) and a breakfast burrito.  Drive Thru at 4am was surprisingly steady but they were pretty quick.  You should know, burgers are grilled fresh, so they take extra time. I actually like the food a lot.  It is my #3 fast food joint (#1 being CJ & #2 In-n-Out)

This particular store is usually clean and the staff is pretty competent.

My food items were tasty, as only a $3 bacon burger & $2 breakfast burrito can be.  Cheap, tasty & quick.  Also, they have a hot "hot sauce" that doesn't taste like battery acid unlike their ringing taco competitor.

One last thing, the taco meat is identifiable as beef & the beans actually taste like frijoles refritos.  The other place just makes me think, "Ah, cat food in a tortilla."  Hopefully, I didn't offend a cat food enthusiast.

Drive thru, pay with change, enjoy!
