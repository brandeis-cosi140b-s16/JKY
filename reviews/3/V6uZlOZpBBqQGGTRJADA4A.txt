This place is a little strange but it was good. I was sort of not sure what to expect at all and when the people behind the counter found out it was my first visit there, they let me taste a whole bunch of stuff. I really liked that idea since it gave me a good idea of their flavors and their heat (since they said some dishes were spicy...eh, not so much). 

I wound up ordering the jerk chicken with black beans and the jerk chicken fried rice. The jerk chicken had great flavor (I added their hot sauce to it which made it even better -- it's by the soda machine) and the jerk chicken fried rice wasn't skimping on the chicken. The black beans were probably my favourite part. They are just a little sweet and just a little spicy. They were excellent. I think next time I will try one of the cheese crisps or just get a tortilla to sop up the beans. The portions are huge; I got a small bowl and it was two meals, easy! 

Overall, I would come back.
