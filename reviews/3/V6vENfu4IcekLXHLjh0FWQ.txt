Mexican food with some history!

Read up on the history of the Garcia's and you can appreciate it more. This obviously isn't the original Garcia's, but it'll have to do.  On a Sunday whim, my bro needed some Mexican food.  Garcia's is actually one of my favorite places to attend because of their bean and salsa dip they offer at every table.  The bean dip is the best!  I ordered their beef tacos and tamales.  The taco itself was nothing to rave about and I was totally disappointed by the tamales.  I've had some bomb tamales and this one didn't pass.  It was too hard and couldn't really taste the beef.  Everyone at the tables ordered drinks and when the bill came we thought we had a deal.  Not with the food I guess.

The service was good, once they knew we were Yelpers!  Arrr! I hate it when my secret identity has been compromised!  The place itself has the old southwest decor and some pretty murals of random Mexican traditional paintings; overall a very beautiful restaurant. - Enjoy!
