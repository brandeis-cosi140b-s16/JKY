Okay, first time I went there it was with the office crew to help celebrate and co-workers birthday.  I liked the place, went back that night for a live show, beers were cold and the food was good.  A bit like being in Mexico.  Place is a bit outdoors and a bit unkempt at times but when you want a taco and a brew this is the place.  I don't want to sound like I don't like the place at all because I enjoy the live bands they have come through the place from time to time.  Happy hour was okay but the happy hour margarita comes out of the soda dispenser, that was a big turn off for me and the lady. It's really  funny because  I'm meeting two friends for lunch there today.  LOL.. like I said a place to enjoy a quick taco and a few brews, plus you will enjoy all the handmade wooden games they have around, pool tables and signs galore around the place that will keep a smile on your face... kids allowed!   Prices are fairly reasonable for Mex type dishes
