My first visit came here over the weekend.  I liked it....you underwhelmed with that statement?  Well, that's kinda how I felt about Cantina.  I like it, I really do but maybe my taste buds and palette isn't distinguished enough to discern between Mexican meals.  What I mean is, yeah it was fine and the fresh and all things good but I didn't come away from the place thinking OMG, I can't wait to get back.  One thing I will say is that I really like the upscale (compared to most Mexican joints) interiors.  So if I want to step it up a couple notches from some place like an Azteca, I'll visit Cantina.  But if I'm looking to just get down and grub on some Mexican cuisine I'd probably stick to the Azteca type faire.
