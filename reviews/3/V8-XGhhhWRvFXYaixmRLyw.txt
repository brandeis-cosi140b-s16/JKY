Seriously guys? Gotta get it together.

Every single time I've come here around 7pm-8pm, there is a line literally all the way out into the next parking lot where that school is!! That is absolutely unacceptable. I don't know why they don't ask customers to pull around front if they are that backed up. It causes traffic problems in the parking lot because the cars leaving taco bell can't get out! 

They have messed up the order a couple times but other than that the food is good.

Customer service has been great though, they always apologize for the wait and rectify any mistakes.
