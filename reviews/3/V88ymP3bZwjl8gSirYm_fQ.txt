Currently I am on a diet called the Paleo diet or in simple terms the caveman diet. While trying to order my strange burrito bowl without beans and rice the person who made my burrito bowl was pretty disrespectful.

Asking for half chicken and half pork he placed just a smidgeon of both meats into the empty bowl and just said okay is that all you want? After having another employee chime in by saying that's clearly not enough, i had to ask for more meat without stressing the option of paying extra.

Overall I'm pretty sure the employee is only used to the average status quo of a burrito. I enjoy Chipotle but probably wont come back to this one.
