This place WAS it, but it seemed to have lost it's special touch.

(cellar review)
I ordered the quesadilla-- big mistake, not good.  boooo.  It was micro sized and mega priced.  $16 for a steak quesadilla that seriously did not taste good.  Very disappointing.  

One thing that is never disappointing are the drinks-- always very special and made well.  

How do people sit by the fire in the cellar when it is 110* outside?
