I stopped here a few weeks ago when I was feeling under the weather and was craving something spicy to help clear my sinuses. I walked into the little shop and there was one guy enthusiastically manning the counter. I took a look at the menu and he asked if I'd ever been there before. I said no and he asked me a couple of questions to see what I was in the mood for and I went with the steak and salsa burrito. I ordered the combo (add rice and beans), a medium horchata (which is giant), and headed home. The burrito was a good size and I took a few bites before deciding to add some salsa to kick it up a little. The steak was not what I expected (think chipotle steak), but it was good, albeit a little salty. There wasn't rice and beans in the bag, so I'm guessing that it went in the burrito and if so, there was hardly any to taste. In a daze I didn't really check. I am a big burrito person so I would probably give this place a second try.
