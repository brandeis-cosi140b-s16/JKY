I had been hearing great things about this place for quite some time. I checked it out on Yelp and the place looked promising. My husband and I had been longing for a date night for quite some time. We came here at around 4:30 on a Saturday. It was quite busy. Good sign? Not really. I'm quite confused as to why so many people gave it good reviews. We ordered the $10 cheese y mas appetizer. And it felt like dipping a chip into a nacho cheese gordita (sans the pita) from Taco Bell. Wtf??? Tacos are lackluster to say the least. Over priced and underdeveloped. I ordered 1 chicken tinga, 1 pork adobo, 1 braised beef. I couldn't distinguish the difference between the pork and beef tacos. Bland. Service was really slow and most of the staff seemed annoyed or in foul moods. I'll take my chances and stick to the taco food trucks. Cheaper and more flavorful. I suggest people check out La Santisima for a better version of trendier Mexican "street tacos". Won't be returning for sure.
