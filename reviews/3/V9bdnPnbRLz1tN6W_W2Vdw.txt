I ordered three separate tacos and my girlfriend ordered two small tacos herself. The Super tacos run almost $6 a taco and are big but not huge. The regular fish tacos are really small and are not fried to where they are very crispy. They happened to mess us on my super shrimp taco and gave me a regular shrimp taco. Normally, that isn't a big deal but because it costs about $3 more, I felt the need to address that. The Az super taco was great though, by far the best of the three I ordered. Although they do provide good food and pretty good service, the prices are comparable to Joyride just down the road. LuLu's also charges 75 cents to run a credit card for payment which is a little bit of insult already due to the high prices they charge. I see potential because of the pretty good food but maybe they should change a couple things regarding pricing. The big tv's for the menu's above the counter do look great too. Food- 4 stars. Prices- 2 stars.
