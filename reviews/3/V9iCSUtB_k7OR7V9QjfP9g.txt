Good place for Mexican comparatively speaking.  They have a unique variety of out of the ordinary dishes.  I most recently had the spinach mahi tacos.  Very good.  Portion size for the price left a little to be desired and service wasn't very prompt.  If you're looking for a good Mexican place and a meal price of around $30, Macayo's is it.  I will certainly eat their again, but I think I will try to make it during their lunch hour when they have specials for $5.99.
