The Mexican food is pretty decent here. I was not so impressed with the quality of the margaritas though. The mix and tequila used for their standard margaritas tasted similar to those you get in a casino bar. For the price I feel it should have been higher quality. They had nice decor in the restaurant and the staff was very friendly. I did enjoy the Spanish rice as it was more of a wet rice and not the normal dry style.
