This place is trying very hard to be trendy! You enter and there are HDTV screens everywhere, kind of nice, with tall ceilings and weird artwork on the walls. The hostesses and waitresses are all covered in tattoos, which I don't particularly care for, but I guess that's the trend these days. Service was just OK, with the employees having a bit of an attitude. Clientele was also a bit snobbish! Anyways, kind of a gourmet Mexican joint, fancy dishes equal fancy prices. Not too bad, food was good, looked  nice. Personally, I think this place is trying too hard to be trendy, and I really don't care about what people are hanging out where and all that jazz.. Otherwise, food was good, service OK, and atmosphere a bit on the pretentious side.
