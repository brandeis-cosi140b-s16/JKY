Nice setting, okay service. 

I've gone here for my craving of Made to Order Guacamole. They are very inconsistant.  Sometimes, the diced tomatoes and avocado look old, so I'm always taking a chance.  They're very cincy with the tortilla chips that come with the guac, so don't be afraid to ask for more.  I've tried their Tequila Shrimp and thought it had a weird after taste and the shrimp was too rubbery.  I've had the 3 item combo, try to order something other than the taquitos with your combo because they are small.  Chips and salsa with refried beans are tasty. When ordering the nachos, ask for the refried beans on the side because they put a big heap of it.  You want to taste the cheese and meat but they smother it with beans to be cheap.  

Their breakfast specials are inexpensive and I liked the breakfast quesadilla without the egg.
