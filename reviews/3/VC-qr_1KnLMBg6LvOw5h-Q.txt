Picante just opened this week and it's a welcome addition to the Westside. When the craving for a burrito hits uptown residents no longer have to haul over to Southend or Dilworth.

The menu is basic with burritos, burrito bowls, tacos and salads your main options. El ni√±os get the option of quesadillas so chalk another advantage to being wee besides not having to file taxes.

Ordering is like you're used to, pick your form, protein and toppings. Is this place better than Phat Burrito? No, but it just opened and there are some flourishes here to distinguish itself. Spinach is one of the tortilla choices, the rice is seasoned similar to Qdoba's but with more subtlety, carnitas is one of the proteins and there are 2 seasonings to choose from for chicken. Another bonus: the availability of Mexican Coke! No Lindsay Lohan, I mean the made-with-real-sugar hecho-en-mexico 12 ounce bottles.

Grab your coke or bottled beer and grab a spot on the patio, I'm sure it'll be popular with a great view of uptown including Panthers Stadium. Parking is around the corner & shared with The Burger Co. There's bike lanes on 3rd St (cut through Wesley Heights to get here) or Morehead and covered bicycle racks in the parking lot too, so how about saving the planet when you get your munch on?

Hours are lunch to late dinner so consider a stop if it's Tuesday and you're still scared from your last stop into a Moe's on Kids Eat Free Day.
