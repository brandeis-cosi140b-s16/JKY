Bought a deal on Yelp after driving by this place for the last three months.  The staff were incredibly nice and attentive.  The food was just okay.  I really did not care for the pinto beans they use.  They had an odd spice/aftertaste.  The quesadilla was an average quesadilla.  If I go back I would skip the beans. but wouldn't mind hanging out here with coworkers.
