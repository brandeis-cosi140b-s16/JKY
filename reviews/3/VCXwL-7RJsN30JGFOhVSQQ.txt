This review is just for Taco Tuesday! 2 dollar tacos, everything on the menu except for the pescado (fish) and camaron (shrimp). 

The chorizo taco is where it is at! Delicious, definitely my favorite one since it is the most flavorful. The Al Pastor is supposed to be topped with pineapple, but it wasn't. I'm not sure if that's because if you're only paying 2 dollars for a taco you don't deserve pineapple. 

$1 margaritas as well, only in the lime flavor. Which aren't bad. I usually like mine frozen.
