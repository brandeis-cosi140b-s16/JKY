When I first came to the Valley a few years ago I had my first Caramba. I ordered the  shredded beef caramba burrito, It was amazing and so until I moved here every time would visit I would want to stop by.  For a while it was the best deal in town, but they kept slowly increasing their prices, from the best deal in town (5 bucks!!) to not so much and on top of that they have gotten stingier with meat leaving me with a burrito with more tortilla than beef.  I also don't like that they charge 25 cents to refill your soda. So that's why I knocked them two stars good place to eat if your in the area but not worth the drive anymore for me
