I loooooove Rubio's Original Fish Taco! Delicious beer battered fish. Even the Picante Salsa on the bar is up to par. 

In the midst of a serious cleaning rampage for a Sunday family gathering, I forgot to defrost some chicken. So off to Rubio's Dude y yo went! 

While the food is quality for a fast food chain, I just don't think it's worth $20.00 for 2 Two Taco plates and two fountain drinks.

Especially with Tortilla Fish being in the neighborhood now. Even Dude was having some sticker shock. 

Other than that, the two times I've dropped into this location: Friendly customer service, quiet, and always clean.
