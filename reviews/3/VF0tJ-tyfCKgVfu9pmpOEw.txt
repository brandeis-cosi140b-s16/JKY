Pros:
- Extensive Mexican beer list, plus drafts, imports and domestics.
- Three beers, a soda, and three entrees cost $53.
- Portions are BIG.
- The server was really friendly and the atmosphere was pretty nice.

Cons:
- The breading on the chiles rellenos tasted distinctly Italian and the sauce tasted like marinara.  The owner/manager looked Italian... but that's no excuse.  It wasn't bad, just weird.
- After the first basket of chips and dish of salsa, they charge for refills.  Only $1 per basket of chips and $0.95 for a dish of salsa, but still annoying.
- Once we finished our food, service got noticeably slower and we had to wait and wait for our waitress to take our check and get change.

Delivery available through www.wheeldeliver.net but I think the menu on their website is a little outdated.  Not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but certainly not the worst.  It is definitely more authentic than Taco Bell or Don Pablo's (there is tongue on the menu, how much realer does it get?)  I will probably be back.
