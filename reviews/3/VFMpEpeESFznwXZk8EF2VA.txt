Little unassuming, in fact hard to find and a bit sketchy, location behind another restaurant in North Las Vegas - but the torta I had was really good. We were actually headed to another torta place a couple doors down that I hear is wonderful but the other place was remodeling and we were told that this place was good, and it was. I had the Torta Pierna - some sort of shredded pork (I think)with lettuce and tomato and a red sauce, I am sure I am not doing the explanation justice. The only complaint was service was really, really slow and there was only one other group in the place. But two sandwiches and a drink for $12 - not bad. Also, tried the carne asada torta and it was okay but nothing memorable. I would go for the pierna over the carne asada. This place was a bakery too, I didn't try anything but they had a decent selection of Mexican pastries and there were quite a few customers for the bakery why we were waiting. So in closing, I would go hear again if I felt like a torta but I still must try the place a couple doors down to the east of this location.
