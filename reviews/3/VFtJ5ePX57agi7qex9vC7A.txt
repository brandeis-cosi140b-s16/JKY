I never thought I'd find a place with better preparadas than Bonito Michoacan on Decatur but I finally did. The best I've had and I would return solely for one of those.

Unfortunately I gave this place three stars because there is a laundry list of improvements that this establishment needs to make:

1. Apparently you seat yourself and if it's your first time (as it was mine) you wouldn't know that because there's no visible sign. So you stand there waiting for someone to help you and finally you have to go get help yourself.

2. The drinks came out in no time but when we wanted to order and when we were waiting for our food, we waited about 15 minutes each time for our waitress to come back. 

3. Literally the worst chips and salsa I have ever had. The chips were cold and stale and the salsa was so bland that we added an illegal amount of salt to it and it barely made a dent.

4. The guacamole and chips (they serve freshly made chips with the guacamole) were to die for BUT it took FOREVER to come out. I understand that everything was freshly made but 15 minutes?! There were maybe three other tables at the time - it shouldn't take so damn long.

5. We ordered a dish that isn't on the online menu - it's two long hollow cucumbers filled with shrimp and fish ceviche. They were great except too much lime for me - it started making my stomach hurt.

6. The dessert was great but they were out of vanilla ice cream. We ordered the fried ice cream and churros. The churros were soggy.


I would go back to this place but the service needs SERIOUS improvement.
