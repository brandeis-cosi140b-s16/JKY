I normally enjoy Rubio's but this last time was a bit unpleasant. When we first walked in, I noticed (the manager?) Erik yelling at the kitchen staff. He then took our order and rushed through everything and wouldn't let me get a word in. When my fiancé ordered, he also rushed through it and forgot to ask flour or corn for the tortillas. My fiancé realized this shortly after and returned to the counter (before food was delivered) to ensure his tacos came on his preferred tortilla. Erik said something along the lines of "okay, well that's why we ask what tacos you want when you order". 

The food was wonderful, but very bad service this time around.
