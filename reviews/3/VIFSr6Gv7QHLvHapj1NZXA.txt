Pretty decent food. The ordering process is a little daunting tho, lots of things to look at & chose from & imo, instead of ordering at the counter & then sitting, it would be better to sit & order from a waiter/waitress so there's time to really look over the menu without feeling rushed or like you're holding up the line. The guy we ordered from also wasn't particularly patient or great about answering some q's we had about some of the menu items. 
I ordered the fish tacos, 1 of them with the cabbage slaw, the other regular. Hubby & son got carne asada burritos & our other son got the carnitas bowl. 
My tacos were really good, lots of fish on each one. I def preferred the cabbage slaw topped one. We got a few of their sauces to try & I really loved the green sauce & some sort of spicy red sauce that they bill as being super spicy. It wasn't that spicy, but had lots of great flavor. The rice was bland so it was nice to have some sauces to mix in. 
The burritos were ok, nothing special but the carne asada had good flavor. The carnitas was done with some sort of sweet marinade which my son was not thrilled with. 
Overall, our meal was good & now that we've been once, hopefully it'll be a more streamlined ordering process next time!
