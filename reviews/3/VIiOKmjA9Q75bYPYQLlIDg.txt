I have been going here for years but now they have this girl who works the day shift and she has messed up my order 4 times in a row and has the worst attitude, I refuse to go there any longer as long as she is on shift. She has ignored specific request or plain got them wrong. You say thank you and she just walks away (and I have spoken to her in English & Spanish so there is no excuse) Shame because I miss the Bacon & Egg burrito.
