I ate with my boyfriend at this restaurant a few days ago and we ordered some tacos and my favorite was the al pastor one, the pork was tender and it had a good flavor, the chicken one was ok. My boyfriend had some tacos of lengua (tongue), steak and al pastor and he thought they were ok. Rice and beans were the same as la bamba, a a kind of dried rice with refried beans. The salsa and chips did not have anything special, I also tried a chicken tamale and the flavor of the dough was nice.
