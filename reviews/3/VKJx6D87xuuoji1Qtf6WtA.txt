In a time when the Mexican food from Patagonia, AZ to Anchorage, AK can be as consistently bland and boring as a meal at McDonalds, this little place makes a good effort to offer Mexican food with a flair. Friend and I had Carne Asado and Pork Adobada "street taco" plates.  They were very good and I saw enough interesting things on the plates of neighboring tables to strike my curiosity to try this place again.  Pluses: interesting menu, great Mexican beer selection, full bar, friendly service, clean establishment, reasonable prices and Mexican mariachi music piped in.  Minuses: TV in corner with basketball game blaring over music and nobody watching it and cheap, unimaginative decor (the lemonade fountains on the countertop is Sooo 1960's Dairy Queen).  A weekend trip to Nogales and $1,000 would go a long way to spicing up the ambiance, folks. You could do it a lot cheaper by just buying some colorful paints and texturing tools.  We did experience the "family restaurant" level of service mentioned by another reviewer, but the young man cared about doing a good job and was bidable to taking advice.  I will return.
