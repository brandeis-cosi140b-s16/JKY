I had brunch here last week. This place is open 24 hours and is located a few blocks from where I lived. My boyfriend read a lot of good reviews about this place so we decided to try it out. I ordered chorizo and eggs. I was influenced by my friend to order this dish as I normally would not. I wasn't particulary happy about my choice as my boyfriends order was far more tastier than mine. He had the Carne Asada tacos. I had a bite of his tacos and thought they were a lot better than Roberto Taco Shop and Felipitos taco shop which are both near me. They had a very large menu.

It is a very tiny restaurant. A typical hole in the wall with good Mexican food. I would return again, and try the other things on the menu.
