I live close to this place and have gone a few times. The food is okay, nothing special or authentic. The atmosphere is fun with good open air space in nice weather. However, my biggest beef is with the strength of the drinks. I ordered $10 pitcher of margaritas and they were pretty much juice. It might be a better idea to just order beers here because if you're looking for some Mad Mex strength margaritas you aren't getting them here.
