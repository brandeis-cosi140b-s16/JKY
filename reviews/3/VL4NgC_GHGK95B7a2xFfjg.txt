What can I say... it's Taco Bell.  I have a strange obsession with Chalupas so this review will be super biased.  Based on the fact that this location can sling out a great #6 (two chalupas, one taco, and a drink combo) I will give it a solid 3 stars.

I've eaten in the dining room before where there was a strange odor (probably because the water wasn't changed when they wiped down the tables).... but I've been in there before when it was fine.

The drive-thru at this location can get pretty long due to it's location near I-85 and the university, but it's taco bell and they move everyone through in good time (most of the time).
