WARNING: Small plates=tortillas with some lettuce on top....there wasn't enough fish to make one taco let alone 2.  They did however address it when I showed him the amount of fish by bringing me another ounce of fish......

The rest of the guests were happy with their meals.  Just shy away from the Small Plates if you want to get filled up.  I think I'll stick to the spinach salad I had previously.

The grilled cheese sandwich with soup is a delicious looking meal for those that are interested!
