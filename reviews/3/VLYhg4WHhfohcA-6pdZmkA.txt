Crannied inside a Shell Station, 3 Chiles offers the standard fare of Mexican food at decent prices. They lack a salsa bar but have a drive-thru. The service is a tad on the curt side and the food takes awhile but everything I've had so far is standardly solid. Though there's much better choices out there, it's a quick fix for that hankering for some beans, rice and carne asada tacos, no more no less.
