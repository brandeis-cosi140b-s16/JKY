I'm all for supporting local businesses. This mom-n-pop taqueria-esque shop is located in the Walmart plaza off of Rainbow and Spring Mountain. It's small and unassuming both inside and out. The lady at the counter (the owner perhaps?) was very friendly and happy to talk about everything on the menu while I stared at it.

She sold me on the al pastor burrito ($5.50). I love pork and this place is called "The Famous Burritos" so I figured it had to be good. Two minutes after ordering the food was ready. Surprisingly quick? yes. It takes me longer to make toast in the morning. I couldn't see back in the kitchen where it was made, but I don't think the al pastor comes off a spit a la Tacos el Gordo. More likely it's sitting in a tray like Chipotle waiting to be served.

While it wasn't a massive burrito, it was large enough -- filled with plenty of rice, onions, cilantro and beans. The pork lived up to its billing, providing plenty of heat with an array of spices. Not quite on the level of Tacos el Gordo's pastor, but still a-ok. The burrito also came with a small bag of tortilla chips. Not a bad option if you're in the area and want some cheap eats.
