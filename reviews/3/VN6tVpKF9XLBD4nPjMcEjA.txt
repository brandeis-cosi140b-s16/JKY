Oh, the problems of eating the hotel breakfast. Nice atmosphere on the back patio, the service was very good, and food was tasty (breakfast burritto, french toast) but the up-charges makes it hard swallow. Fair warning, the coffee was nar-nar and at $4 bucks a cup, it better be darned good (and have some booze in it, while they're at it).  Bummer to leave such a bad taste in your mouth.
