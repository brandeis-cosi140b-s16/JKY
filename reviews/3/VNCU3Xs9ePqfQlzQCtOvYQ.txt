The first time I went was really good, I had gotten beef and chicken tacos and they had gotten my order wrong, I think it was like two beef, then when they gave me another taco it was beef again and then the 4th taco they gave me was chicken. They didn't charge me extra and it was good so I had a great first experience but I have to say the more times I go back the more I'm not crazy about the food, price or the weird seating they have were the booths on the side are above other people and some make you face the people sitting on the ground level,  last time we spent half the time looking at the people 5 feet away from us because that's the way the table was facing. To be honest, if I can find another Mexican place she won't be picky about I don't think I'll make the drive here again. Plenty of parking spaces though and though I never go to the bar area those people seem to be having fund watching games and whatnot.
