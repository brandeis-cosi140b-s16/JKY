It's your typical Dos Gringos, except located in a deserted strip mall, which is a bit odd but I guess good for parking.

Same setup as every other Dos in town, except the help here is sparse.  It's impossible to get a drink, whether you have a server or go to the bar, as it seems everyone is in super slow motion.  Very strange.  Overall, what you would expect from a Dos Gringos in east Mesa/Gilbert area. Nothing fancy.
