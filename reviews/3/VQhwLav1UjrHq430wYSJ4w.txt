Los Compadres is an A-ok place to stop and have some A-ok Mexican food. You order via a friendly counter service and they give you a number. I ordered the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. They were good! Nothing fancy or spectacular, just straightforward. I wished for a little more flavor in the chicken, but it wasn't horrible. I also ate Ayesha's leftovers the next day... solid. 

If you're looking for a spot that's a bit "hole in the wall" simple Mexican, then Los Compadres is the spot for you! I would gladly return and try their other entrees!
