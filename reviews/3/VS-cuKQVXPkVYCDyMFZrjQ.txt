The food at Rosa's was pretty decent, but nothing extraordinary. I was a bit concerned dining here midweek around 6:30pm and being the only person in the joint. The ambiance is pretty nice for a taco shop. Very clean, very new - it used to be a Jersey Mikes Subs which usually has decent decor. 

I took advantage of their $.99 bean & cheese burrito special and it was definitely good. My wife had the enchilada w/ rice & beans and that was below average. I'd definitely give Rosa's another shot, specifically for the burrito (which btw, was huge) but definitely concerned that we were the only people in there before eating, during eating, and after eating. In Spanish they would say that's no bueno.
