I would have to say this is just ok.  I have had better Mexican food at other places. The server was nice but very hard to understand & I felt like he was rushing us out the door.   They were not busy when we went.   Back to the food,  I ate a chicken enchilada that $12, I got 1!  The sauce on the top was not good at all,  rice&beans were burnt.  The chips & hot sauce were good, just had to add some salt.   Over all,  I MIGHT go back.
