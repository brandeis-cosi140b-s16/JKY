We were there on a busy Friday night. The atmosphere is very nice with a fun decor and good spacing of tables. After 15 minutes, husband still didn't have his margarita. The waiter said the runner must have forgotten it. Waiter ran and got it. It came in a tall, unsalted glass. This is certainly not typical of any margarita we had seen. The waiter said he would not charge us for the margarita. I only had water to drink. Sadly, the water pitcher they continually used to refill my glass had NO ice in it. It's 106 degrees outside. Ice would have been nice. Employee after employee walked by our table and ignored our empty chip basket without offering more. The waiter was sat a huge party and had three other tables at once. He just couldn't do it all. He promised more chips, more salsa, extra sides, etc. but it always took forever. Not a single dish or plate was removed from our table until we left. Our table was piled high with "crap" and I had to juggle the mess to get to my extra tortillas for our fajitas. We were literally out of room and plates and dishes were STACKED on top of each other. 
As waiters came by with food for other tables, they would hold the huge trays over their heads. As they walked by us, these trays would be carried over OUR HEADS. I could hear sizzling fajitas zoom over me. I was NOT happy about this. One slip up and food and sizzling hot items would have been all over us. 
Sadly, the food was great but the lack of awareness to our needs brought this experience from a five star to a two or three star. 
It was baffling as to why all of these workers were oblivious to what was obviously going on around them.    This included servers, bussers, hostesses, and what looked like management. I should have taken a picture of our table - wait you couldn't have seen any part of the table because it was BURIED in junk!!
