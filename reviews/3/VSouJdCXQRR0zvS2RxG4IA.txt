It's probably dumb to review a chain fast-food restaurant, but I will do it anyway.  Such is my devotion to Yelp.

I like that this Chipotle has a parking lot; it makes it much easier to satisfy our cravings for burrito deliciousness.  Every time I've been here, the staff has been very friendly.  It looked to me like their scoops of rice, meat, and salsa, were a bit meager, but I didn't say anything about it.  Largely because Chipotle can be pretty high calorie as it is - I don't usually count these things, but I did today for kicks and my burrito was 810 calories, and I didn't even get sour cream!  But on the bright side, they claim to use organic produce, cows without hormones, sustainably raised ingredients, and you don't hear that often from a fast-food joint.  The food always tastes fresh.

My burrito was a little colder than I'd like it - maybe they're all that way and I'm just picky - but I had to put it in the oven to bring it to a good temperature.  Nonetheless, it was very tasty as always - "it" being a chicken burrito with corn salsa and cheese.  omnomnom.  It's a lot of food and the price is right.
