The food was well prepared, and in good timing. But the staff could be friendlier. When asked for special request (add cheese  etc.) they were almost irritated. They didn't greet/acknowledge or say thank you when we tipped them. One other time my friend ordered Carne Asada nachos, and they gave her fries so she politely took it up to the counter and let them know she had ordered nachos and they rolled their eyes and grabbed it from her and said nothing. I understand there are difficult customers, and that gets irritating, but when the customer is nicer than the staff it's a problem. Would still eat here and will continue to be kind to them even when I don't get it back.
