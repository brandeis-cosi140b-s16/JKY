Okay so we went in and I totally thought we were heading for a 5 star meal. It was around 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon and the place had like 1 other couple in the whole place. The bartender was also the server and he was really nice... On a side note he looked like a cross between BJ Penn and the chairman guy on Iron Chef America...

The hubby ordered the signature margarita and I ordered Manager's Choice margarita... It was a spicy cucumber margarita and it was delicious. The tri-colored chips and salsa were to my liking... I'm fine with unspicy salsa the BF kinda wasn't. 

We ordered the appetizer sampler and EVERYTHING on the plate was so good. The avocado egg rolls were awesome but the flautas were delish!!!!

The hubby ordered the hambugesa and I ordered the mahi mahi tacos.
We were really excited!! but well...we were disappointed. Their burger looked like a slider patty on a bun (I took pictures) and the hubby said it wasn't that great...especially for the price.

When my tacos came out they looked GREAT!! it came with a baby handful of rice and beans. The rice tasted old and mushy..not a fan. The tacos were just okay. It was fish sticks in a flour tortilla.. They were dying for some flavor though. I wish the table had salt and pepper. They were just okay. I was a bit disappointed. With how great the appetizer was, I had expected the entrees to wow us - I was mistaken.

Even with our 30 dollar groupon, all of the above came to 40 bucks. This was when I realized that we probably won't be back. Everything was a bit over priced. 16 bucks for the tacos and 15 for the slider...er. i mean burger (I mean they came out with ketchup packets) is a little too pricey.

If I could do it all over again, I would have come just for drinks and appetizers.

3 stars for the ambiance, service, and the appetizers.
