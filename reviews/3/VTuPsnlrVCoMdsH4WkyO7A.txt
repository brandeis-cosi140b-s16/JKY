Desperate to find a patio bar that wasn't packed and didn't require us to have our Scottsdale faces on - we found ourselves at Julio G's. 

We've eaten here many times and it's mostly "meh". Today we split the Pollo Magnifico and it was delicious. The service was prompt and courteous. The weather was beautiful- great day for patio dining.

The tables turned out to be an issue for me. They're those iron tables with all the holes in them..you know, like a grid. Okay well, stuff is going to spill, right? Yes, right. Even though I had a napkin on my lap oil from the cheese crisp (thinking about that oil makes me want to hurl) dripped through the table on to the napkin, through the napkin and on to my jeans. Salsa- drip, yep- on my jeans. 
I swear I'm not a messy eater but think about it, how many times have you dripped a tiny bit on the table? Now imagine that going right through the table on to your pants and shoes or whatever else is under the table.
 
It'sanissue.

If you eat on the patio, bring a towel.  What if you accidentally spilled a beer? Water? 
I don't even want to think about it.
