Came here for a little Cinco de Mayo lunch-action today. It's not my first time at this Salty Senorita location, so I pretty much knew what to expect. 

As a solo diner, I just pulled up a bar stool and sat at the bar. Service was actually phenomenal! I didn't catch the bartender's name, but she was awesome. Extremely attentive, and friendly. 

I arrived a bit earlier around 11:30am, as I expected it could get busy today. I chose Salty for two reasons:
a) It's Cinco and I wanted some good mexican grub
b) I wanted to earn some frequent flyer points in the Dining Rewards program

First of all, since it's been a while I've been here.... they have a new menu. It's a large one-pager. Alot of things seemed to be missing... like chimichangas! No Chimis?? But the bartender told me they could make any burrito a chimi. 

And $1.99 for chips and salsa?!? I thought those used to be free? sheesh... 

Oh well, I'm expensing this meal anyways... so I got the chips & salsa, diet coke, and the grilled chicken burrito. 

The burrito was fabulous... and fresh tasting. On the side was a large serving of refried beans. BUT.... I was rather surprised to see a $9.99 burrito being served in a cheap red basket. Kind of a turn-off... A $10 burrito deserves a plate. 

I asked the server if that was now customary to serve their food in baskets -- but she said it was just for cinco. Apparently it makes it easier for them to clean up. 

(I can understand maybe later during the drinking hours -- but not during lunchtime.)

Food was decent, service was awesome.... I'm giving 3 stars because I feel as though they're nickel & diming customers by charging for chips & salsa and putting $10 burritos in red baskets. Boo!
