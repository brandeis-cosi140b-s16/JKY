Brand new to this area. Alfonzo's has a place up in Prescott and decided to bring it to Phoenix. The place has been cleaned (which is a good thing) all fresh paint, tile, counters. No more picnic tables... real tables to sit at now. 

They are still working on some decor but it looks good. 

The food, standard Mexican style foods. I did not see anything out of the ordinary or anything that jumped out at me as a must get. 

I had a beef taco, cheese enchilada and rice and beans. The taco was cooked perfect not burn like Filibertos. The enchilada was under cooked (not melted inside) but the red sauce was good. The rice was dry but had potential and the beans were lumpy but fantastic flavor. 

All in all so far a 3/5 but I think they will get better.
