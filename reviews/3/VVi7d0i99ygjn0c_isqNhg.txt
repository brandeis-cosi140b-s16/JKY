I was brought here by my boyfriend while visiting Las Vegas because he loves this place and so do a lot of the people at his job. We both had the Carne Asada Fries (about $7). The serving size was very generous, you could easily split it between 2 to 3 people. I would have it again. 
Side note: the bae is from San Diego and loves him some California burritos and Carne Asada fries so he's picky about the kind he has.
