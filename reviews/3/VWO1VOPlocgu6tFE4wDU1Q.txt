I loved the atmosphere. If you're from Glendale or Scottsdale, it's very much like the Sandbar, just a lot bigger. It has a huge outdoor tropical theme patio. There's a huge indoor bar and many tables and booths. I went here for the 1/2 off appetizers and 1/2 off drinks. Bottled beer was $2. The appetizers were around $4. I ordered the drunk shrimp and wings. The shrimp were very good and came with a variety of sauces to choose from. The wings were average, but they gave me a lot, 18. Don't know why, but good for me. They definitely have a party atmosphere, kind of like something you'd see in Cabo San Lucas . They have misters all over the patio. I liked everything about the atmosphere and prices on the appetizers and drinks. The only downfall is I thought the bartenders at the bar were all unfriendly. They never smiled or asked how the food was. If you're looking for "personal and friendly" bartenders, it's not here. I think they're too busy. It's a very busy place. The other thing they don't tell you, is they place a hold authorization on your card. My bill was $28. When I got home, I looked at my bank account. The bartender put a $25 hold on my card and a separate $75 hold on my card!! So, for my $28 bill, they had $100 pending on my account. I called and complained to the manager the very next day. He said it has to be my bank because they will never put a $75 hold on a card. He did say they do put the $25 on it. I confirmed with my bank it wasn't them. I called him back. I told him who the bartender was who did it. He was very nice and apologized, and said he had no idea why she would do that. I had to wait 3 days for the $100 authorization to drop off. I would've ranked this place 4 stars if the bartenders were at least a little friendly and they didn't put $100 hold on my card for just me.
