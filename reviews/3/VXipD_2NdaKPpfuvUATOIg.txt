Shrimp burro well worth the few bucks. Don't go alone as this place is in a very bad part of town and the odds of you getting approached by a crack head or a homeless person is pretty high. Security guard may be standing out side which may give you a false sense of security, don't be fooled, he's just another valueable informant. Cashiers appreciate you speaking in Spanish.
