I'm a big fan of the location in Scotsdale so I grabbed a Bean Burrito here the other night.  First off it's the Mill's Food Court so there aren't a lot of vegetarian options to begin with, but my burrito was decent.  It was a bit on the cool, but not cold side as the cheese hadn't even melted by the time I had found a place to sit in the food court.  It still tasted pretty good and is much better than the other options here ( I know that's not saying much ).  I think if they keep the food hotter then it would be much better.  
I can't speak for the meat options here. The salsa seemed about the same as the other location so that's a plus.

So overall for the Food Court it's better than the other places, but if you want America's I would go to the Scotsdale Location it's much better.
