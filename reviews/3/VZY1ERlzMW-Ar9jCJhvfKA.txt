Tried this place on the way home tonight , Food was ok . Nothing to recommend , I got the combo plate and you have to pick what you want on your plate and what type of meat. Kinda cool I guess. The wait was very very long and the food was not what I had ordered. Our waitress was attentive and friendly so I gave her a good tip. I'm just not impressed . 
I agree with Monigue B.  ( " Better than Taco Hell " )
