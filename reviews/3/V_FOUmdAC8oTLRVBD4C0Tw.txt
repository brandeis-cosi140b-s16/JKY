The food was good, but the service was horrible!!!  We were sitting for 20mins before asked what we wanted to drink.. our food took about 40 or so mins, our two waiters were just very chaotic, not one asked if we were doing okay mid meal, so about an hour before we actually got to eat.. nonetheless the food was good and the prices fair.
