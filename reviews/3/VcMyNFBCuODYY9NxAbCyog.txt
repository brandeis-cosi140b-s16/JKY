We were in the mood for Mexican and decided to give this place a whirl. There was a wait for the restaurant, but tables at the bar, so we sat at the bar. Chips and salsa were brought immediately as well as our drink order. I thought none of the salsas were particularly hot (I love spicy) but had decent flavor. I had enchiladas and my hubby had the fajitas. Our meals were fine. There wasn't anything wrong with anything, just nothing memorable or special I guess. Our waiter Paul was excellent. He had all the tables in the bar full and running smoothly, he was quite impressive!
