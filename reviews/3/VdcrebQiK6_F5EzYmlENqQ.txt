Had a late lunch at this place for the first time last month. It was pretty slow at the time we went. I liked how the restaurant looked on the inside, it has a beautiful fountain when you walk in. 
I tried their Watermelon Margarita and was pleasantly surprised. It was not too sweet or too tequila-y. 
The chips and salsa that are brought to the table were so-so, fairly spicy. They had there different types they brought to the table and they  mixed a bit of the three on a plate. 
I ordered a burrito and my coworker had the fajitas, neither of us were impressed. My coworker had been there a few times prior to our visit and she was disappointed in how things tasted. 
Not some place I would go back to again. I'd rather drive all the way to Pedro's or go to pasqual's.
