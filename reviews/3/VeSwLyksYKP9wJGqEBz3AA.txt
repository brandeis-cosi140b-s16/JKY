Not the best Dos, but not the worst.

The food is good. Two words: taco specials. Mixed drinks are meh, except for their margs. Huge patio.

Every time weve gone here for HH lately, their live music has been way too loud. That mixed w/ people playing (and losing) red neck oversized Jenga, dont make for a good place to talk to the people youre hanging out w/.
