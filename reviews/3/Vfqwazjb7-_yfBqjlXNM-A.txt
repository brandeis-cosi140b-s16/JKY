Got Pazole two years in a row here to go.  Great job on the food, but shouldn't have to wait for an hour after I place my order to get someone to pour pre-prepared soup into to-go containers.  I was waiting in the front while several people came up to the front to complain about the service.  They are under staffed, but the food is really good. Call way ahead of time for take out, or be prepared to wait if you dine in.
