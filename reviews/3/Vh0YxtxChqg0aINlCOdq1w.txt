This place is pretty good can't say it's the best Sonoran style hotdogs that I've ever had but it's pretty close... The prices are pretty affordable too .. How ever the service is not that great they lack good customer service skills .. I had a Sonoran hotdog,salchi papas which are fries topped with jalape√±o nacho cheese and sliced hotdog and an horchata .. Prob will go back not to many places like this one here in Mesa :)... O Btw CASH Only!
