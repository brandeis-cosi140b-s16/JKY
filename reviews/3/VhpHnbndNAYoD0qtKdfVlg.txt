This could be much more, it is still dingy and dirty. The patio is huge new and a wasted opportunity.  Too bad it is dark and tacky. I hope a manager is reading this. You need lighting outside, you need plants, there should be a higher standard of cleanliness. The chairs should be placed neatly after they are bused. I didn't see a a manager once. 
The salsa is bland. The other reviewers liked it, inthe past they had a side dish of extra spicy now we just have the extra mild option.  The food is good but could use an update, I agree with other reviewers. This restaurant falls short and is geriatric. I don't mind that this is an older crowd 
, but  how is this good business? They have a prime scottsdale location. It must come down to poor management, they are squandering an opportunity.  Get a better manager. Re train your staff. You are heading for obsolescence.  It doesn't have to be.  I find it difficult go there. I went cause my family loves the tamales. They are excellent.
