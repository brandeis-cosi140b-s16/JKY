Let me start with the best part: the guacomole dip is excellent and freshly prepared at your table! Also great margaritas (TIP: try the jalape√±o margarita if you're in for some new experience!) to bring you in the mood, and service is very nice and friendly. Certainly better than average on the Strip. I ordered the fajitas and they were quite good. Prices are reasonable and therefore a great dining option on the Strip which is no rip-off. I would go back again for a causal lunch with friends.
