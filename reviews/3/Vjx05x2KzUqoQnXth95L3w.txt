I ate here the other day for a business lunch. I have eaten at the one in Manhattan Beach a few times, so it was a good choice to take a client. I totally love the tableside quacamole....it has never let me down! But a huge disappointment was the Ahi Tuna Wrap...it was a tortilla with seared ahi, lettuce, and tomato and some sauce I didnt discover til my last bite. it was flavorless and really watery. Eat there all you want, it has a lot of great items, but skip that Ahi Tuna Wrap...it was tasteless and the weird fries were not a good accompiant to it...
