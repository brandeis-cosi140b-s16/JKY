After a subpar Rubio's experience at another location last week, I decided to give this location a try because I was craving Mexican food for lunch.  I ordered:

Chicken Street Taco, $1.89

The food came out in a short period of time and despite being busy, the cashier remembered who I was and took the food out to my table instead of calling my name....great service!

The Chicken Taco was very good.  The Steak Burrito Especial was even better.  The Steak was juicy and full of flavor.  All of the ingredients were fresh and complimented each other.  Of course, I got the spiciest Salsa from the Salsa Bar to eat with the food.  I love their Salsa Bar.

Overall, a pretty good experience.
