My first time eating here. Okay tacos. Nothing to write home about. I did the three taco trio. Substituted the al Pastor for another Carna Asada. Little bit on the dry side. The red mild sauce, even a kid could eat it. Green sauce look like it was from a can. Chicken taco tasted best.Miss the salsa bar of the Baja Fresh that used to be here. Chips were room temp. Ordered the Horchata for a drink. It tasted kind of powdery. Staff was attentive. My belly's full. Kind of wished I went with my original plan and ate somewhere else for dinner. Dinner costs about $12 and some change.
