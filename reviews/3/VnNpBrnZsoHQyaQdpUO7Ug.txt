Not as good as the original in Glendale, but still good.  I had the machaca and it almost tasted a little too sweet, or more like Fajitas do... not my favorite taste for machaca anyway, but great chips and salsa and the kids seem to love their food (lots of options for kids)  Everyone else in the group said the place was a solid 3 stars and that they would come back.  Next time I go to this location I think I will just stick with tacos and see how that goes ...
