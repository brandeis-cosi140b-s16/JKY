Good, cheap food, and the only decently priced margarita ($8) I came across in Vegas. I had the 6-taquito meal topped with guacamole, pico de gallo and cheese. It was good, but I could have gone with the 3 instead of the 6. I was stuffed! You also get free chips and salsa with any $5 purchase, but the woman working behind the counter seemed very annoyed that we all asked for it even though it's advertised throughout the restaurant and all over the menu. My sister asked for hot and got some mild pico de gallo concoction instead...I had the hot and our friend had the medium. Pretty good salsa and taquitos and not bad prices at all.
