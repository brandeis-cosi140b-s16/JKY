I don't think this place ever closes. 

Carne asada burrito? Gooood.

Carne asada torta? Baaaaad. The meat is left in gristly sheets that are impossible to eat without looking...canine. Mind you, you are supposed to eat that like a sandwich. Deconstructing it and eating just the meat is nearly impossible, it just doesn't split apart with chewing or a plastic knife.

Guess who else had five of the gross kinds of health department violations. I just can't win.

And yet I will be there after Saturday night's dive bar rounds.
