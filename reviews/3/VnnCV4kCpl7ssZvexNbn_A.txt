I would come here for cocktails, but that's about it. We came here because my husband had heard amazing things about the freshly-made guacamole.  A few things - a 45min to 1:30 wait? Ehh ok, fine. I ordered a pineapple agua fresca (refreshing!) and my husband ordered a Michelada (props for having these on the menu), but it took a while for me to get my drink. It would have been nice to be offered a water in the meantime - but our server was clearly very busy. We ordered the guacamole and while it and the salsa were good, the $10 price tag made it hard to swallow. The bartender finally ended up bringing my husband his beer as we were almost done with the guacamole. I ordered the Camaron Asado & Cochinita Pibil tacos, and my husband ordered 3 Camaron Asado tacos. At $3.50/taco, we were caught off guard when the shrimp tacos came out with literally ONE SHRIMP per taco. My husband asked the server, who confirmed with the manager, that yep - the shrimp tacos only come with one shrimp. HUGELY disappointing considering you can get delicious shrimp tacos that are full to overflowing at some of the small hole-in-the-wall Mexican places. The Pibil had good flavor and definitely a larger quantity, but still not worth the price tag.
