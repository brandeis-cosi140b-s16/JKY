I think this place is awesome (among my 3 favorite food spots in the valley).  However, they do have some kinks to work out when it comes to their management and service.  Don't make changes to your menu options too early on, when things seems to be working.  I was very disappointed this evening when I went and asked for the 5 for $5 salsa option, and was told it had been discontinued.  That was an element that distinguished your brand and makes a huge difference on the dining experience - as each sauce could bring an item to life in a different way.  I then asked the server if they had any salsa or hot sauce...she offered me Siracha.  This was fine - but to market yourself as an upscale mexican - asian fusion restaurant, and not offer any fresh made salsas is very odd.  At least offer something original in the salsa department, if you don't want to make all 5 of those sauces.  Don't take shortcuts with the clientele you are marketing to, I can assure you it will not end well here.
