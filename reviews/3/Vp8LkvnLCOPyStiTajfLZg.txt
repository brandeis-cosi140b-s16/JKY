I went with multiple people one afternoon while we were staying at the Saguaro hotel. Everyone had different feelings about the lunch. I thought the carnitas were a bit meh and the guac was surprisingly salty. The feelings at the table ranged greatly. I was the middle ground. Roll the dice at Distrito if you dare!

I think the design of the room is kind of fascinating. Fun to stare at. The service was good, always had a full beverage. And the sun was shining.
