My son and I decided on  Baja fresh for lunch .. We  have eaten there before , I usually get the tacos .
This time I chose the steak burrito , unfortunately it had  very little steak , I think I got maybe three bites of meat ,pretty big burrito with a bunch of rice and beans .. This wasn't the first time this has happened my son ordered one  The last time we were there he complained  about the same thing , I just thought we'll maybe their having a bad day .. And today I decided to try again .. Never never again !!
Now I'm going to my little Mexican restaurant that's inside the Mexican store and have one of their steak burritos , always have lots if meat , not the best looking place but the good is awesome and prepared in front of you ..
