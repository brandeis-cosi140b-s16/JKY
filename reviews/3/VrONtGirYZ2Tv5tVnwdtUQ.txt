Hungry after a morning walk and an afternoon of shopping, we needed food.

It's been forever since I have eaten at a Baja Fresh...I think my age was still single digits.

We had just beat the crowd, when I ordered two carnitas tacos (baja style) and a grilled fish taco. We ordered some chips.

The chips, didn't taste very fresh to me. Kind of had a bite back to them. But, their green salsa, I would drink with a straw, so I just let the chips play in the pool....if you know what I mean.

The carnitas tacos were amazing. Tender, juicy, just the enough amount of seasoning.

The fish... I could have done without. Dry, almost tasted burnt. Flavorless.
