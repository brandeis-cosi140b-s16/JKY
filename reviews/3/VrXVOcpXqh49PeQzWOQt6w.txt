This used to be one of our favorite spots to frequent but, the last two times they fell short of the greatness of the first few times that we went... a dozen tostada with beans and salsa, when hot, are to die for.... Their "lite and healthy" menu all have been great in the past... I hope that they return to their top quality of food and service soon.
