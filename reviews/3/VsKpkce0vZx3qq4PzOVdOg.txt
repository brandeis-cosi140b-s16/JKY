Place is open and nice. Seating is comfortable wherever you sit. Only problem was we sat at our table for 15 mins and I'm not sure but there was nobody to wait on us. I figure we needed to go to one of the two bars to order drinks but noticed one bar had nobody there. We finally just left without ordering anything.
