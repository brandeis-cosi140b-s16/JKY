I'm a regular here for the Saturday night Latin music. 

Free for locals. Small ass dance floor, but plenty of seating and the music is great. DJ plays a variety of everything, mainly reggaeton, bachata, Cumbia and salsa. Mixed Drinks are $7-$12, shots $4 to $9. And then there's the food. Huge proportions so I recommend a mixed appetizer to share.
