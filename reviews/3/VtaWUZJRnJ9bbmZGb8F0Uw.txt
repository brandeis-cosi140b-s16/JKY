I had the Monday chicken burrito special and carne asada fries for 13. 

- Great chicken burrito deal. A regular drink cost almost 2 bucks so we just got the meal for 4. Also comes with rice and beans. 
- carne asada fries are crispy. similar to molca-salsa but without the nacho cheese and more expense.
- filthy. when i entered, i felt like i needed to take a shower. bathroom has graffiti everywhere. seating are uncleaned. 
- free refills for horchata! no fee like socal! :)
- they have specials on tuesday and wednesday. I may come back to try it, especially their breakfast burrito.
