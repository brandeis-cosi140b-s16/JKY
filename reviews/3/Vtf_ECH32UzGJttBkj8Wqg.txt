This isn't a restaurant that is going to impress anyone, and it is part of a chain, but it is reasonably priced and delivers reasonable food--not a bad place to grab something to eat.

I find the grilled chicken salad a good eat, though I normally go for the half size to skip the grilled tortilla bowl (never have liked those much).  I also like the beef or chicken sandwiches.
