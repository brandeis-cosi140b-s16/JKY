Went here for lunch today. A big "A-OK". Nothing special, but it did the trick. Order the chimichanga lunch special w/shredded chicken and the typical rice and beans on the side. For 6.99, no complaints other than the chimichanga was not fried. Came out as a burrito...hmmm? Probably for the best anyway. Service was a little slow, as we sat outside on the patio and were forgotten about once. 

Will I return...sure; if someone says "hey, I'm at Salsas come meet me" Will I seek this place out for a meal other than that...no. However; it's a decent place for a Mexican lunch.
