My wife and I have been here a handful of times. Neat little family owned restraunt in downtown Peoria. The food is really good. Authentic mexican food. Big portions. I absolutely love the shrimp burrito, enchilada style with the white sauce. I highly recommend it. The margaritas are quite small, and the service is sometimes lacking. Not rude service, just slow, and we have been forgotten for refills before etc. That is why it gets 3 stars instead of four (the service and the small margaritas). The food get's FIVE stars. I planning on going back here several more times
