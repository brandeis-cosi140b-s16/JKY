Charanda was a little better the second time around.  We won a gift card as part of a silent auction package, so we went back to use it.The service was much better this time.  They got our orders right and it was relatively quick.  The food was still average at best, and the guac is definitely from a bag.  It is very runny and tastes like Wholly Guacamole from the store.  I am glad there are more authentic options in Fort Mill (La Poblanita).

This also seems to be a place for the families of Baxter Village to bring their hyper kids.  One kept jumping up and down and kicking my chair in the booth behind me.  Several others were being way too loud.  I'll probably still only go back if I had a gift card but wouldn't set out to go here on my own accord.
