So they were our favorite. Now when we go they have too many servers that take your order and you never see them again or just don't come back to the table until it's bill time. I had the lomo tortas with a tequila Moscow mule. Don't order this at the wedge at the crossing. Sandwich is too thick and potato gets are never done all the way. The beverage was strong but all I tasted was tequila and lime. But if you see my pic I guess they couldn't fit the ginger beer because of the huge ice cube in my glass. It's gone down hill since it first opened. Of course. I'm sick of dining out.
