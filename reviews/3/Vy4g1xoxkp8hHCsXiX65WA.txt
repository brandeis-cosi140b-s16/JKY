Del Taco puts Taco Bell to shame. The flavors are fresh and it doesn't sit heavily in your belly. Their Taco al Carbon has less sodium and fat than the the fresco option at TB and is higher in protein!

Tuesdays bring forth a 3 regular taco for $1.00 offer while Thursdays bring 3 soft chicken tacos for $2.05. 

The staff is friendly, and the food is hot. I didn't feel like my food was prepared in advance and sat under a heat lamp; but rather made to order - which is how it should be.
