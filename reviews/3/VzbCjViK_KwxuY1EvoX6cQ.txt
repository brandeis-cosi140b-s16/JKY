If you want a cheap (good for the price) hang-over breakfast for $3.50 and $1 bloody mary's this is the place. Two locations on the strip, one down near MGM and the other in the Mall near Planet Hollywood.

Good decor, sat fast, staff was friendly.

The breakfast special beats the $15-20 breakfast buffets if you just want something decent and quick and save your money for partying later.

Choice of eggs, hashbrowns, meat, tortilla/toast, etc. Not bad actually. Beats McDs!
Plus the 99cent marys, well, are a 99cent mary. Ask for a double. $2 for a tall vs the short glass. Cant beat it really. Again, bang for the buck.

I'll definitely go here for my quick-fix breakfast to save some dough to just waste later in the day.
