I came here after spending a month in Mexico. I'm pretty sure that any restaurant (especially one bragging about George W.'s trip there) could even come close to even a taco stand south of the border.

However, after a few weak-ish margaritas were in me (the pitchers are great, but have a lot of ice, and are kind of spendy), I didn't mind the noise or the extremely cramped quarters (I don't even know how the waiters are able to serve having to constantly zig-zag between people).

The portions are generous for the price, but it's obviously more Tex-Mex than the real thing.
