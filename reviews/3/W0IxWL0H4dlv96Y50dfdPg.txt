Was excited to see they serve breakfast the setting is very nice with a great outdoor seating area which is wear I chose to have breakfast today. I ordered the biscuits with gravy top with a spicy chorizo sausage served with two links as well and 2 eggs the staff was nice but did not seem overly knowledgeable about the options on the menu, not well trained or informed . My breakfast came quickly unfortunately it was luke warm at best, I asked for my eggs to be poached and they came out basted which was no big deal but nothing was said by the waitperson not that the young lad probley new poached from basted from over easy ect. I might attempt this place again maybe for lunch or dinner
