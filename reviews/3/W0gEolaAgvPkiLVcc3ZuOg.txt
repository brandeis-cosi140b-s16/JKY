I go here quite often with the family and its always consistent. The people are friendly, the food is good. Its fairly typical Mexican fare. I think most of these restaurant's must get their menu and supplies from the same place. I went to a Mexican restaurant in Charleston, with a different name, almost the exact same menu. Azteca-same menu too. 

Here you start off with free chips and salsa. You can get fresh guacamole made at your table. A nice touch. They have a great white cheese dip. Be careful not to fill up on the free chips, because you have a boat load of food coming out.
 
I like the Burrito Azteca (mix of chicken, shrimp), with enough cheese and sour cream poured on top to croak you. You get a giant plate with beans, rice, and your burrito.
My wife got the steak quesadilla. Again, huge. My daughter got a "small combination", enchilada, rice, beans. My other daughter a streak fajita. We always have enough food left over for lunch the next day. And I usually leave here thinking, "why did I eat so much?"

Add in a cold Pacifico brew or a Top Shelf Margarita and you have a pretty decent meal.

The atmosphere is just ok. Its in a strip mall after all. But its clean. They recently installed new tables, lights, etc. The staff is friendly. They have an outside seating area if you like. I've sat there before, but tend to not like it because of flies.

All in, a pretty solid meal. Not the most healthy and not something you'll get too exited about, but pretty good. I find myself coming back, again and again.
