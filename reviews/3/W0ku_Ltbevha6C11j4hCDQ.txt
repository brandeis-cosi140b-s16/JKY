In general, I like El Pollo Loco.  This location, though, is brand new and appears to have some minor growing pains to work through.  First, I think they need to hire more help.  We were there at about noon and just about every table was dirty.  The whole time we were there, no one came out to clean.  I can't guarantee it, but looking behind the counter, it appeared that only two people were working.  And, second, the music is overly loud and pretty awful.  I'm getting tired of going into restaurants and being blasted with bubblegum pop (especially when the average age of the clientele is probably about 40).  Plus, this is a Mexican-ish restaurant.  Something a little more ethnic might be nice (I'm NOT talking mariachi bands here).  While we were there, only one of the songs played was in Spanish.

Neutrally, the food seems to be about the same as any other El Pollo Loco location (though our cilantro dressing was a bit thin, today).

On the positive side, I'd like to say that this particular location is very nice looking.  It's got floor-to-ceiling windows on three sides, so it has a very open feeling.

I also have a suggestion for all El Pollo Locos:  instead of microwaving your tortillas (which are just bland, commercial things), how about tossing them onto your grill.  You might have to watch the timing, but it might add some much-needed flavor to them.
