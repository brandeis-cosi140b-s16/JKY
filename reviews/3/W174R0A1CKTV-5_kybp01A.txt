Ok, I have to admit, I was bit disappointed...

No slot machine in the Las Vegas Del Taco ?

Come on ! who you trying to fool ? ! ?

I know behind closed doors there is some sort of strip club next to the tortilla deep fryer, I saw the reflection of a stripper pole. No bright lights or loud circus noises...WTF ?

I though I saw a midget dressed in the American Flag running around in the parking lot, but it was only my imagination...
