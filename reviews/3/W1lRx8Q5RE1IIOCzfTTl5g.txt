Blue Burrito Grille is a clean, friendly little place near gate C5. I ordered the Green Chili Carnitas burrito, and was pleasantly surprised at the speed at which the food came out, but also at the quality. The tortilla was warm, but not the same temp as the fillings, which made me realize it wasn't microwaved, but properly warmed. The carnitas was moist, flavorful and tasty. Definitely a good place for a pre boarding snack.
