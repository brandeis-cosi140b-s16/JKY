I'm from Silver City, NM. This is the food of my childhood. From birthdays to funerals, and everywhere in between, this food is engrained in a very special part of my life. So, my review may be biased....

I understand this restaurant is just over a month old, so small things like slow wait staff the place being a little unorganized from top to bottom really didn't bother me too much. 

The food, was...OK. 

I ordered the "hangover" smothered burrito which was far from being "smothered" in green chilies and my fianc√© ordered the Huevos Rancheros. Neither of us ate the hashbrowns because they were so unbelievably covered in butter they were almost inedible. Both dishes featured the green chile (as they should), but just fell short with the sides. Of course The hashbrowns, and the refried beans were over cooked and chewy. 

Our waiter brought us sopapillas on the house because of the long wait, which was very nice of him, but could not heal the wounds of not being able to taste the once forgotten green chile.

We will be back to try dinner, but breakfast just wasn't happening.
