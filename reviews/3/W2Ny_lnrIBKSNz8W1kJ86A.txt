The tacos were pretty good, but the restaurant was very dirty.  Service wasn't friendly.  I had been looking forward to trying this place for a long time, as a I love Mexican food--the more authentic, the better--but I was disappointed.

I got veggie tacos and my husband got the enchilada combo.  My favorite part was the salsa bar--fair warning, everything is HOT and I love my salsa hot!!  Another woman in the restaurant was complaining that the "mild" was "like fire."  I dumped plenty of the hottest onto my banana pepper filled taco and was quite satisfied. 

If you're in the area already and you love tacos, give it a shot--but I won't be making another trip from the north side to eat here.
