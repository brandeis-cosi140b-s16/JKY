As a local I've been here a number of times. I love coming here for the convenient location and the laid back nature. 
Expect to be in a loud noisy dining room with LOTS OF TVS. 
Food is white washed Mexican but it's decent and I've obviously like it if I've been here a number of times. 
Waitress and hosts are nice, but almost always busy so it's not a quick in and out dining experience. 
Drinks are strong but I almost always opt for a beer.  :)
