Man, it's a hard job discerning good from bad when it comes to Mexican food.  Good thing I have a place like Don Pedro to help benchmark 'good'.  This place is much like the run of the mill Mexican eatery but the finishes are just a tad bit of an upgrade in relation to most.  

The service is great and attentive.  We were there on a Sunday and there were a couple VERY large parties of people being taken care of so they know how to deal with larger groups.  

Table side guacamole on tap too is a definite bonus.  He'll make it spicy too!  I like that.
