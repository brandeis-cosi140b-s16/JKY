Food is actually pretty good. Go there maybe every other month. I took off a star because one time as I was ordering the cashier told  his coworker "This fool wants to use a coupon" in spanish. Guess I don't look like I'm fluent in spanish. Not a big deal, but it was a little annoying to be referred to as "that one fool" while trying to order.
