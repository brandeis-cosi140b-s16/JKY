I come to this chipotle frequently - more frequently than I would like to admit and it's ok. Sometimes the line is slow and one time they forgot to put my guacamole in my bag, so i got home and was disappointed that it wasn't there. Most of the time they have all the ingredients ready and their beverage counter is usually stocked.
