This is a fast-food chicken joint.  They put something of a Latin spin, but it's really just grilled chicken served with tortillas.  The chicken is pretty good, as are their sides.

When we were there they seemed to be having problems.  Their card reader was out, so we had to pay cash.  And there was something going on in the back, but I couldn't really tell what (someone was have trouble with something, and there was chattering back and forth).  So it's difficult to judge them on other aspects besides the food.  The person who took our order was nice enough, but distracted by whatever was going on.

I'd come here before KFC, but I wouldn't call this my "go-to" place when I want to eat out (or do take-out, which we did).  We had a coupon, and a couple of our other choices were closed.  But they did fine.  No complaints.
