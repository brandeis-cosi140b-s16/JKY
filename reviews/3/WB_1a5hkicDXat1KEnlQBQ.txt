I would not say this is the very best mexican food I have had. I do like it. I really enjoy their fish tacos and the salsa is tasty.My only gripe is they do not refill chips and salsa without a charge. One bowl. That's it.We had 5 people and it was a very small bowl. The problem is this is not the norm. So, it usually sends me to the places I can enjoy refills without an issue.I have had good service here and other days bad.Service is sometimes key. Make people fell welcomed and they come back everytime.
