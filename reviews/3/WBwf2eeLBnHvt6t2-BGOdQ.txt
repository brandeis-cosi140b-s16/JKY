Probably a little more traditional then what I was expecting, and more along the quick take-out side of Mexican food. 

The meat in the beef chimi was more the moist, it was watery. The mini platter was worth the $7 and that was probably the best thing we ordered.

The carne asada taco was the exact opposite of the beef chimi and was dry.

Over all the food was about average, the portions were above average, but so was the price. There are just better places to get Mexican food in the area for the same amount of money.
