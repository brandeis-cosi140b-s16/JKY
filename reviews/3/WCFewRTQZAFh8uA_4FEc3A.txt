The food was really good here but the service was awful and it took nearly 1 hour to get a few tacos at 5pm on a Sunday. As a former waitress I'm usually very sympathetic to wait staff but this was really bad. We had to get up and ask for everything every step of the way- menus, to order, our food, silverware, the check. 
Hopefully they can figure out the service end of the restaurant business since it is hard to find decent authentic Mexican food in Madison.
