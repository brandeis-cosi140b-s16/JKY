It did the trick, seemed real authentic to me because the beans were creamy and a soft brown/whitish color. The plate was full with my 2 cheese enchiladas, beans and rice I really was enjoying it until the lady started vacuuming during my meal. I wish she hadn't done that. I was enjoying the TV and the sights of the other patrons and here comes this lady with a vacuum besides I don't think that is the most healthy thing to do while people are eating, I could be wrong. Good food but overall experience, ahhh I'd go somewhere else with no bother.
