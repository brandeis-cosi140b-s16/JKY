This is continued from my post about the Princess Hotel.
So we walked over to La Hacienda after having a few drinks at Stone Rose. We walked in, spoke to the host and told her we do not have any reservations. She went on to say "we are fully committed for the evening" I looked around and saw 3 tables seated. She said "they should be arriving withing the next 15 -30 minutes. We decided to go ahead and sit at the bar and have dinner since there was room and the food had been very good previous times. Bartenders were great, and they have a server there who is incredibly knowledgeable about tequila who was very helpful as well. We ordered appetizers (Queso Fundido) and chips and Salsa. we could have been content with that but after a few "sol" beers and a tequila shot, we decided to order dinner. I went with the tampiquena (skirt steak) and my girlfriend had the mole poblano (chicken entree)  They both were great and we continued to watch the restaurant and see if guests started to pack in for all the reservations.  They did have a group of 12 from the WM company who came in. but that was about it. I few more 4 tops who did not have reservations who sat in the lobby/bar area. After a filling dinner on the way out, I asked if they were still fully committed for the evening? She said " Didnt you see that huge party we sat?" I was like, yes that party of 12? They took up 4 tables.

I understand completely that if they do have reservations they need to have room for them but they were turning away people who did not have reservations and we sat at the bar. I know $200 in the grand scheme of things does not mean a whole lot to them, but I will never go into a restaurant, who does not truly care about their business and want to try to find ways to get people in.
