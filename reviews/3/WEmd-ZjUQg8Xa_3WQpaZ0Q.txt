It's OK.  I went there for lunch with coworkers.  I was a little annoyed that we all ordered similar things and added Sour Cream,  however,  I was the only one charged for it, after I ran my debit card so I used change to pay.  

When we sat down to eat,  everyone who had not been charged extra had sour cream and I did not.  Only non Spanish speaking person...  Just saying.

In terms of just the food,  the meat wasn't seasoned all that well,  and I've had better at most Mexican restaurants
