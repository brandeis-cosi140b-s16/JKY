When I'm in a hurry, there's nothing like grabbing a Cheesy Bean & Rice Burrito and a 7 Layer Burrito from Taco Bell.  Yes, I would prefer more authentic Mexican food, but sometimes my schedule doesn't allow for that.

This particular location is clean and the employees here are very friendly.  They get my order right every time and as a bonus, they have their Hot Sauce out in the open for you to grab as many as you want.  They also have the newer Sauces.....Chipotle and Green Sauce.
