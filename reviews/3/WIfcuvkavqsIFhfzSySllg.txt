This was my first trip to this location and I don't think ill be back. 

Margaritas great.
Chips, guac great.
Cornbread great.

Our server "Bubba" was the highlight of the entire night. He seemed to be the only energy in the place. As the other location seems to be always happening we were kinda of shocked about the lack of any kind of vibe.

I ordered a vodka grapefruit and that one they were out of grapefruit so that was a let down. 

Not bad , not good.
