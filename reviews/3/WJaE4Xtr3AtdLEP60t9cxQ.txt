Came here for the first time last week for a hooked deal (2 tacos + rice/beans for $5) and was pleasantly surprised by the tacos. The tortillas are delicious but when I asked where they get it from, the waitress said she did not know and walked away. 

Pros: 
1. Tortillas/tacos are delicious! 4/5 
2. Salsa and chips are really good.. on the spicy side. 4/5 
3. $1 taco Wednesdays 
4. Sauces that come with the tacos. 
5. Reminds me of King Taco in Los Angeles. 

Cons: 
1. The ground beef tasted a bit off last time I was here. 
2. Chicken was dry and adding salsa did not help. 
3. Service can be slow. First time my friend and I went, we were the only ones there and was still slow. Takes some time getting things such as water, straw, fork, etc. Or maybe I'm just a needy customer.  
4. Ambiance/music - an ant was crawling on me while eating. Mexican music can get loud.
