I have to admit that I'm a tad confused by all the raves about the chips and salsa. OK- the salsa was good, but it must have been pretty mild because I could eat it. But unfortunately the chips tasted stale and even like the oil needed changing.

We were intrigued by some of the unusual combinations, so we went for the quesapilla. It was good, but in a greasy, boy, am I gonna pay for this later kind of way. It was described as sopapillas with Monterrey jack cheese inside. However, it was served as one large fried gordita-esque thing with cheese pouring out of it. 

I also decided to try the Mexi-Greek thing they have going here, and ordered the Gyros Chimi. The menu claimed that it was served with a side of rice and baked zucchini. The zucchini turned out to be a veggie combo that included eggplant. Good thing I spotted those dirty nightshades before I plunged into my "zucchini" or else Hubby would have had to stay home tomorrow to make sure I didn't die. Alright, maybe I wouldn't die, but the last time I ate a mystery veggie mix in a D.C. Moroccan restaurant, it turned out to be eggplant cooked in tomatoes- a double whammy for me- and I was so sick I couldn't leave my hotel room. Anyway, dangerous false advertising. The waiter asked the cook to be sure, and then very pleasantly offered to sub it out. The Chimi was interesting- tasty, but so huge I could only eat a third of it. Hubby did better with his superior Baja Chicken Chimi (thanks for the tip- AGAIN- Julie!). The sauce is outstanding.

We shared a flan for dessert that was pretty tasteless- maybe calling it "one note" is kinder. Comedor Guadalajara has no competition here.

I'm not sure we'll be back- maybe for the $1.75 delicious house margarita. The Original Garcia's is far better in our book.
