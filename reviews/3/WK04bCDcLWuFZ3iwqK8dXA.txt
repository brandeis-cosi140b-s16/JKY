Went for my birthday dinner this weekend and decided to try Javier's. I have to say that I'm disappointed with my experience. Food was so-so, definitely over-priced and it was small portions. Location is beautiful and decor is breath taking. Margaritas cost about $15 but they were probably the best thing about dinner.
