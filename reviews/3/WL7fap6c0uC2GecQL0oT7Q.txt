Mix and match cafeteria line burritos. That's what I think of when I hear Chipotle. The most recent time I came here I ordered a steak burrito bowl with: brown rice, both kinds of beans, and the corn salsa. I usually ask for more corn salsa. The server gave me a strange, and a little off-putting, look when I asked. Next when I asked for guacamole she plopped on a huge towering amount. While I love guacamole, this was way too much! I had to scoop half of it off and gave it to my dining companion.

The location is fairly convenient for students, but the service needs a little more oomph.
