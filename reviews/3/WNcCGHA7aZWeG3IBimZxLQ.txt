I still haven't fully decided where my heart lies with Chipotle. 

Half of the time when I come here, I get great food! The other half of the time, it sucks. I usually get weird pieces of chicken in my salads, or burritos (depending on my order). Once it almost even made me consider reinstating my vegetarianism. 
Honestly, though, the last few times I have been here they have done an exceptional job. I will have to update later.
