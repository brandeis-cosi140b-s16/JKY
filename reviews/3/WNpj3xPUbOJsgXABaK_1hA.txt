"Tourist Stop"  

Nestled off the Apache trail a little strip mall of an old west town sits.  It is really crowded with a lot of people, and we had a hard time finding a spot to park.  My husband and I were excited to stop in the saloon/resturant for some of there "famous chili" we read about on the web.  Walked into the restaurant and saw thousands of dollar bills stapled all around the interior with an old west vibe.  Hostess was really slammed with taking peoples names down for a table.  She told us a 10 minute wait.. I think it was more like 15, but whatever.  
We sat down and our waitress was off who knows where, we waited another 10 minutes to get our menu's and drinks.  I ordered a BLT sandwich, my husband ordered the "killer chili" and a burger meal.  Chili came out and was super bland, nothing spectacular about it....  Food was OK, Denny's quality, prices were descent.  Probably next time we will look for another restaurant in town before going on the Apache Trail ride...
