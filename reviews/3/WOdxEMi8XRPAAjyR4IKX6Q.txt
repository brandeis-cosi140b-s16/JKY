Being another single digit February day, I decided that some Tex Mex lunch was in order to warm the day up. I ventured out to Market Square to give Las Velas a try. It may have been a cold day but it didn't keep this place from filling early.  I was hoping to get a seat by the window (or at least a table seat in the dining area) but the bartender / server, noticing that I was solo and "encouraged" me to have a seat at the bar. I thought, "okay, so they want to ensure that couples and groups get a table... I'll play nice".

After looking at the menu, I ordered three tacos Tex Mex style (one steak, one ground beef and one carnitas) with hot salsa. The meal came with two sides so I chose the Esquires (Mexican style corn) and black beans.

It took about 25 minutes for my order to arrive which I think is a little long to throw three tacos together and when the dish arrived the tacos were sitting in a pool of juice from the corn making them all soggy on the bottom. I propped my plate up on one side by putting my phone under it so that the corn juices wouldn't continue to assault the tacos.  Other than being soggy, the taco's tasted okay, the black beans were uneventful and sadly, the corn was the highlight of the meal with it having a tangy, slightly salty zing.

I feel I'm being generous by giving Las Velas a three stars rating. If you were looking for Mexican food in the downtown area and you stopped and asked me, I would point you in the direction of Bea Taco Town on Smithfield over Las Velas (unless alcohol was a deciding factor). They put out a higher quality product with more attention detail in a much shorter wait time.
