Silvi's has Mexican and Southwestern and burgers on the menu.  Waiter told us that most items are homemade including soups, chili, salsa's and tortilla's.  Also, the owner/chef is from Texas and wife is Mexican.   

Chose a Creamy Corn/Poblano soup that was delicious.  Thick with nice flavors, still green poblano so not hot, just a nice flavoring.  The chips were good and the mild salsa was really tasty but spicier than expected for a mild.   The pork taco was good with a tasty corn tortilla.  The pork was not very flavorful and probably a little overcooked, but the toppings and salsa were very tasty.

The place is small and very casual.  Would expect a bigger crowd especially on weekends, once the Southside crew learn about Silvi's.
