Living in Avondale I was excited to check out this place due to the rave reviews.  I ordered the machaca chimi.  Delish!  The chips and pico are wonderful.  The other salsa is a runny, roasted chipotle (adobo) sauce - good and not too spicy.  I am a refried beans lover and I was unimpressed by the beans.  I'm old school and love REAL refried beans with lard - sorry, I just do.  These beans were clearly mashed with either cheese or milk....They tasted like they were from a can.  Mexican rice was very good.  Only 3 stars from me - food was decent but there are better alternatives.
