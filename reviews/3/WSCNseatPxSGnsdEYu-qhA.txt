Had the Taco Tuesday special: 3 tacos and drink for $7.  Ground beef tacos were good, crisp shells, fresh lettuce + cheese, beef tasted great. Steady stream of customers coming in, service was fast and friendly.  Small, only 3 tables inside and a small counter with 4 seats.   6 or so tables outside in the shade with a mister going.  Clean.  Everyone was ordering the machaca, so i'll have to go back and give that a try.
