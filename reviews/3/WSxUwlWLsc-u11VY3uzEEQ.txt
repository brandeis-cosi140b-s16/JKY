Many a lunch and a few dinners at Zapata's.  They do a good job with basic, but well-done Mexican meals.  And the ambiance is just like many restaurants that we have experienced in Mexico.  High ceilings, lots of space, separate party rooms and a big, full bar.  You can picture parties and, with the clearing of tables, dancing and a band.  Mexicans do like their dancing and music.

Lunch menu is easy to navigate with a pick-your-own combo section where you can get two or three items, as offered.  The basics, like enchiladas, tacos, burritos, tamals, accompanied by beans and rice on a burn-your-hands hot plate.

Dinner menu is larger and more complete, but mostly variations of what lunch offers.

There are also more jazzed up offerings like super burritos, truck tacos, salads and chicken dishes.  

Service is fast, so you won't have made much progress on the complimentary chips and salsa before your dishes are in front of you.  That also goes for their tangy margaritas.
