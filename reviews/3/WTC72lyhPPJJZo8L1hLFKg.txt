I had read about Mejico on the Chow Bella blog. I decided to give it a try. The menu is fairly small, but the overall the selection was good. There were four of us. We started with Shrimp Ceviche and Chips & Salsa. Both were very good. The Ceviche had just the right amount of citrus bite to it. The salsa had a good amount of heat without being overpowering. 

For dinner we had:

Chili Verde
Enchiladas de Rez
Backyard Carne Asada
Relleno de Pollo

All very well done. I did think that the black beans were pretty limited on flavor. They bordered on the bland side. 

In the end, the food was good. It was the prices that really limit my review here. With tip our bill was ~$125. Just seems expensive for 2 appetizers and 4 entrees. No drinks - just water.

N*joy...
