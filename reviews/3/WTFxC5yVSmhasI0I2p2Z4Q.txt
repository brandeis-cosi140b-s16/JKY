Well, that was expensive! Why do I feel like I didn't get the rest of my meal? I had Duck Confit, which was cooked delightfully. Just seemed like the plate was not complete... no starch? 

I am not against foodie places. I just usually feel like I have had a good meal when I leave. This meal seems to be inadequate. Waiter never asked hit everything was, perhaps he is sick of hearing about it?
