This place is okay. It didn't wow me or anything. Just a pretty run-in-the-mill place in my opinion. It was way too crowded for my liking. I stood in line for about 5 minutes before I even got to order my food. They give you a bowl 2-3 times the size of chipotle but instead of filling it with rice, beans, meat, and the salad items, they skimp on the rice and beans and pound it with lettuce. The shredded chicken was good but nothing special. Honestly this place is okay but it's not a must try or anything.
