I have been here twice now, once for lunch and once for brunch.  Both visits were on par with what I expected.  Decent food and fair prices right in the heart of uptown.  The service is friendly and quick, even during busy time (like brunch for Cinco de Mayo) and the portions are a healthy size to make it worth your buck.

I was seated upstairs both times I have visited, and though you get a little bit more of an intimate area, you kind of miss the buzz going on downstairs if you are looking for a scene.

Not sure if this is related to Vida or not, but while there on Cinco de Mayo, the most memorable piece for me was the DJ!  He was rocking all of my favorite 90s music, that I made a mental note to hopefully find him again!

Worth a visit if you are in the area and looking for a fair priced meal and good service.
