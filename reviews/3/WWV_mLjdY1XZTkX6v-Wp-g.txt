So slow! I refuse to eat here during peak hours! The staff is slow it's just amazing! The management needs to do a better job of training the staff. The Cafe Rios in Utah handle 4 times the traffic twice as fast! Company is losing big time money for being so slow. Don't come unless you're ready to wait around! Oh yeah food is pretty good...
