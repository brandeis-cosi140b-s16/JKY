I was excited to discover this place as it looks promising... The chips and salsa were excellent, but the food was unfortunately only so-so. I tried the chicken enchiladas and fajitas, and while both were decent neither was worth repeating. I will probably try this place again in the future but order something different and perhaps try the margaritas.
