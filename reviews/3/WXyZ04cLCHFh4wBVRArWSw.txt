If u order a coke instead if saying cola u get a Mexican coke in a glass bottle. If u say Pepsi, u get a fountain drink.

Aside from that. Really great service and polite people.   Food was ok. I'm from LA so I expect a lot from Mexican food places that claim to be authentic.  But for Wisconsin.
This place isn't bad.
