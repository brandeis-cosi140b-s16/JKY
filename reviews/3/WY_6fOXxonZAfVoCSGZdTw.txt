We were hungry and did not want to eat at Denny's or Ala Cart Steak house; so we came here for some Mexican food.  The food was ok and the service was mediocre.  I am from san diego so I expect great things from a Mexican food place such as Amigo's.  So I was not impressed or disappointed but I did walk away with a full belly and way over priced food bill.   Will not return any time soon!
