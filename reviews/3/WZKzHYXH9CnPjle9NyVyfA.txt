I took my mom here for breakfast and while she seemed to enjoy herself, I have a few criticisms.

Okay, one criticism.

I would have preferred some type of Mexican or Spanish rice, instead of little potatoes or home fries.  Also, some nice queso fresco sprinkled on the beans would have been better than the mixed blend of whatever cheeses they use.

Otherwise, everything was pretty good.  I ordered the chorizo omelet; which was a bit salty, but maybe chorizo is supposed to be salty?

My mother ordered a scramble that she enjoyed as well.

We also ordered some tamales that were easily in my top 3.  These tamales had a great flavor and a perfect balance of filling.

I think Fuego also makes their own salsas.  I tried the red and green and both were much better than what you are usually served at standard Mexican restaurants.
