This is a solid fusion street taco joint. It is not amazing and some of the tacos are grody, but some are awesome and I think its great for the give and take that way with different people and family grubbin'. Odd atmosphere for kids, but rock it, it is a good time. First time you go get a couple combos and do not get two of the same tacos. don't be tempted, you need to try them all out to learn your favorite.
Tough for a business lunch unless is ultra casual, then go for it.
