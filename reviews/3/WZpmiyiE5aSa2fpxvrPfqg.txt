Service was good.  Food was good.  We ordered the sampler for an appetizer.  It was plentiful; nachos, quesadilla, and 2 flautas.  Chips came with salsa and a bean dip.  Beans were good, but lukewarm.  We ordered, New Mexico platter, chicken enchilada, fajita salad, and flautas.   Fideo soup was brought to each of us.  It was mildly spicy, but tasty.   Server apparently misheard or scribbled, and fajitas were brought instead of flautas.  No apology was given and our diner felt pressured to keep the fajitas, which she graciously did.  Food was good, but not mind blowing.  We were still charged for the fajitas, which were more expensive than the flautas, even though it was their error.  Again, no attempt was made to rectify their mistake.  For this reason, and the fact that I found a long strand of hair in the salsa, I am giving Juan's 3 stars instead of 4.  I will go back, but I will have the waiter repeat our order next time.
