Just so we're clear here, the map does not correspond correctly with the actual street address.  This Fili's is on E. Pecos and not on Az Ave.

But man, Mr. Filiberto, you messed up my order today AND you cheated me out of a horchata.  The only reason I didn't notice is because it took so long for you to get my order out to me.  I was just glad to get my order.

This Filiberto's is no different than any other one around the Valley.  There all about the same with maybe a couple being better than others.  This one is run of the mill.  They do have awesome 'brown' salsa here.  I asked the guy for the other salsa and he said, "The brown one?".  Yeah.

24 Hours.  Cheap.  Relatively quick.  No biggie.
