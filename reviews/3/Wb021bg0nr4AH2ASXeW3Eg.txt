Last week I was driving down Broadway in Phoenix and a little yellow building caught my eye.  The sign read "Mims Burger & Mexican Food".  I made a few more passes by later in the week and last night I decided to bite the bullet and check Mims out.

The building appears to be quite old and the restaurant is nothing fancy.  A few tables and long counter style table with stools and some older pinball and arcade games.  The menu has various prices scrawled on it with some items crossed off.  Nothing fancy here.

The menu offers a mix of standard American fare, southern and Mexican food.  I was tempted to order a hot link or BBQ plate but I was a bit short on funds so I ordered cheap: green chili burrito and chili dog.  The burrito left much to be desired.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't better than a Don Miguel frozen burrito.  The chili dog, however, was quite delicious.  

It took a few minutes for my order to be ready but that's okay.  Everything was prepared as I ordered.  They didn't have dogs sitting there ready to go.  I don't mind waiting for someone to actually cook my food.

Mims offers a lot of BBQ options and I think that may be the bread and butter here.  When I return that's what I'm going to try.  If they can serve up a good BBQ plate then I may have to upgrade my star rating.
