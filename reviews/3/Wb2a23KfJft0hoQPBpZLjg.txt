I have been to this Roberto's alot and I always get the same thing carne asada burrito...I wanted to try something different so I got the carne asada torta. It was a good size and looked amazing...when I went to pick up the bottom was mush...saddd. the top was nice and crisp and buttery so I just disassembled and ate how I could. I won't be getting again back to my old fave.
