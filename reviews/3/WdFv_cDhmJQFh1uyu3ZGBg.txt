First time here & food was great but SERVICE was horrible!! 

We had fajitas & a seafood burrito was awesome!  

We will go back, but planned to ask for a different waiter.  The server,  Manuel,  was unpersonable & not welcoming!  He seemed like he didn't want to be there. 
-forgot my water with no ice 
-no utensils & napkins - got us forks but only 2!! It was 3 of us & baby.  Is there a shortage of forks? They had to bring 1 more & he sent a girl to do that. 
-forgot my guacamole 
-didn't get our Military discount after asking 
Few other things & just disappointing.  

Such a shame... 
Hope next post will be better!
