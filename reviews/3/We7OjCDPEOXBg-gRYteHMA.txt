Just visited the newer location on Centennial (Northwest Vegas).  This place gets all kinds of blessings from Zagat and Best of Las Vegas, but I just don't see why.  The food was ok, not outstanding, not poor, but nothing to write home about or rave over.  We started with the Nopalitos (cactus) as an appy, and that was very good, in retrospect the highlight of the meal.  For entrees we shared the PESCADO a la VALLARTA which was Orange Roughy, and for a chicken dish we had the GALLO al CHIPOTLE ESTILO.  The fish was ok, the chicken overly tough.  
That was enough, quantity was just fine but we came away thinking "why is this place so popular?"
