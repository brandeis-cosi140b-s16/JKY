Looked for a place to grab some eats and a couple of drinks before the Jason Mraz show. At 5:30 most places filling up with longer waits as we had a party of 8.

Found this place and they seated us quickly. Waitress was friendly, but service a bit slow. I only noticed two servers working, and with the concert and a Diamondbacks game going on at the same time, you think they would have been staffed a little better.

Ordered drinks. I asked for a Modelo, got a Negra Modelo. Still good, but not what I asked for. My wife ordered a Vodka/Cranberry (they were out of cranberry juice!) so she went with a Mojito. Now I like a good Mojito, but it's pretty poor when there's no rum and no sugar (this tasted like mint water, terrible) she ended up with a glass of the house white wine. One of our friend ordered a vanilla vodka with club soda and only enough vodka for a slight hint of vanilla. At least that was an easy fix with an extra shot.

The food itself was good. We had street tacos(chicken) and empanadas. Both good. The Chile Relleno was tasty as well. 

Some good food, some poor drinks, and some friendly, but slow service.
