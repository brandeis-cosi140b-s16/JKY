We live near this restaurant which appears to always be hopping and very popular.
I truly appreciated the welcoming and very attentive staff. Margaritas were good. My husband had camarones rancheros which come in a red sauce with beans and rice as well as a soup. I had flavorful camarones borrachas which were better- buttery garlic sauce with red pepper flakes.
We had very nice coffee and split a flan. 
I thought at around $18 the entrees were overpriced.
Portions are not overwhelmingly huge which is good.
A good solid family place- not Wow but Good.
