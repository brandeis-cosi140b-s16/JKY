Had the misfortune of doing taxes on Saturday and needed a drink and a nice place to sit and reflect on how much my husband and I got rapped by our government.  He wanted a Margarita and I thought of this place.  We wanted something not fufu which had a bar and some fatty apps.  
We drove not to far from our house and walked in.. My first time to this Macayos and thought it was a lot smaller then the location in downtown and off bell...  Pretty much same theme, Mexican, same menu, Mexican.  
We sat outside on the patio off the bar and our bartender took our orders..  We also had ordered two apps, a nacho platter, and a Mexican pizza.  It was nice chilling outside, it was a perfect day outside.  Our service was excellent, now onto the food.  
The nachos weren't anything I would ever order again..  Basic stuff on it.. Beans, cheese, chips, gauc., sour cream, and huge chucks of chicken, I mean big, the size of jawbreakers... Kinda difficult eating without some sort of fork to break it down.. The chips got soggy kinda quick.  I just wasn't all into them.  Now the pizza on the other hand I would've and should've ordered another.  It was really just a plate of yumminess.   The queso was so good, and the flavors just bursted in my mouth.  Prices were a little high for apps, like the prices of the main meals.  Quick service, close to home, yes, if I must have a quick drink I would come back.
