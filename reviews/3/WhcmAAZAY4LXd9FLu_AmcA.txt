I've been here a couple of times.  Each time, I've had difficulty ordering because it is just so confusing.  It's kind of like Chipotle but they have a ton more options and it's not quite clear what those options are.  I think you just have to lean against the glass and grunt, "I want that."  Very stoner.

I've tried the chicken tostada bowl, chronic fries, a battered shrimp taco, and a carne asada taco.  The chicken tostada was ok but it came with a pathetic amount of sour cream and they left off the guacamole I ordered.  But I don't think they charged me for it, either.  The chronic fries, basically covered in everything including salsa, were pretty damn good though.  For whatever reason, these are advertised on their website, but are not on the menu.

The carne asada seems to be their claim to fame, but I didn't like it.  Too salty.  Then again, I got the very last bit of carne asada.  They were out by 6pm.  So maybe I didn't get the best representation of this dish, being the last little bit they had and all.  Also, he asked me if I wanted it baja style.  I said sure and that was a big mistake.  Mayo, cabbage.... doesn't really work with carne asada for me.  However, the shrimp taco baja style = excellent.

They have Dos Equis and Blue Moon on tap - $3 a pint.  The bar was completely empty.  I'm not sure if it is worth it for this place to have a liquor license.

I'm willing to try this place again and maybe get some booze.  But I need to have a heart to heart with the staff and get the low down on the menu.
