Bar area is open to Westgate fountain which creates a nice feel for the area.  We had a chicken quesadilla and enchiladas.  Both were ok, nothing great.  

Two meals and one drink each $60...seemed a little high for the food.  Chips and salsa are extra charge, a little unexpected for a Mexican bar.

Great place to watch a game but I would skip the food.
