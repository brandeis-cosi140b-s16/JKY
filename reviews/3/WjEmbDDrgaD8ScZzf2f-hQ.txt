Good food for Anglicized Mexican. Only order the tacos for delivery if you have access to a microwave as they'll probably not stay warm on the journey. Still, despite that, enjoyed the food more than I thought I would and delivery time was more than reasonable for the time I ordered it. Overall, a little pricey, but taste wise it's worth it. Would still recommend saving yourself a few dollars and order for carryout instead of delivery.
