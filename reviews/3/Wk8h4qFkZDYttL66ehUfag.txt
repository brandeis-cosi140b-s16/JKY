Close to 4 stars...

Started with chips and guacamole which were on point for aure, 5 stars for that and the service.

Tacos, carnita and carbon, both hot and made to order. Carnita crispy and moist. Flank steak seasoned well and tender.  Tacos were topped with guacamole and queso fresco, needed a little more with the salsa provided. They give you 3 different kinds, verde, Rojo and habenero. Rice and beans ordered were great, especially the beans. Meal rated 4 stars.

Beverages disappointing,  worst water I have been served in a long time, so I ordered sangria. Sangria offered red and white, I got the red. Had a flavor of artifical coconut that I didn't love. Kinda reminded me of putting spray sunscreen on in the wind, the moment when the wind blows the spray right into your mouth and then you drink sangria to wash it down, yep that's the taste exactly. 2 stars on the drinks....
