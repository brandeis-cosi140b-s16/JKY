Based on other burrito places in the area, Chipotle on Pineville-Matthews Road was okay.  The burrito I ordered (pork) and drink was a bit higher in price compared to other burrito places.  All drinks are coke products, no issue there.  The burrito itself was good, though it had a lot more rice than other products in it.  The facility is next to a Japanese steakhouse and has limited parking as a result.  Limited seating, with one spot constantly being dripped upon by the A/C above.
