The food was good. I definitely had better. But you know these type of "Mexican" restaurants are everywhere and quite frankly it's super Americanized food but it's still edible food none-the-less. I got a chicken bowl...it was just ok...the rice in it was a bit crunchy...that didn't make me happy but who cares I was hungry! The salsa bar has a good variety of salsa and it was stocked well...they keep this place pretty clean maybe because they didn't have very many patrons besides me that day and there are plenty of seats if you feel like dining in. The service could be a little more service and lot less stale. Personality might help a little bit. Just saying. Y'all are lucky I was hungry and couldn't care less about how I was served. I'll come back if I ever feel in the mood for this type of food again...but I just found a Chipotle a few blocks down so it might be a long while before I'm back.
