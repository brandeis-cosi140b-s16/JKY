This place beats Taco Bell in the face with a baseball bat. I have a guilty love for Del Taco and I come in whenever I'm in a hurry or on a road trip. The fish tacos are delicious and truly rival some of the ones I've had from real Mexican places. The other favorite menu item is the Big Fat Steak tacos. They're wrapped in a pita and come with a spicy white sauce and finely shredded cheddar.
