I love tacos. Plain and simple. And that is how I like my tacos too; plain and simple; your taco meat (or vegetables for you non-animal eating people) with onions and cilantro. El Pastor gives it to you just like that. The tacos I ate yesterday were a 4-5. That is the truth. I was hungry and I wanted tacos. They themselves were brilliant. However, if I am going to rate the entire overall experience I am giving my experience from yesterday a 3/5. Maybe it was because I was crabby from being up until 4 am, but I felt like I was waiting for an eternity for my food to arrive. When I arrived to El Pastor we were seated but it took a while for our waitress to come greet us, and I actually believe it was the host that eventually came back to take our drink order and not even our waitress. For 2 pm on a Sunday afternoon, there were people in there but not enough people in there for me to have to wait as long as I did. 

I do believe my linner? Lunner? (lunch and dinner?) was the same as the man-friends. I think we both had the pork, chicken, and chorizo tacos. Bless those tacos. I would bill the chicken tacos as my least favorite of the three yesterday with the chorizo being the stand-out star. It was spiced beautifully and served at a perfect temperature. It was slightly more charred than what I would have liked, but hey, it was still pretty darn good. 

Will I be back?

Duh.

But will it be anytime soon? Probably not, as I am hearing of this new taco hot-spot on the east side that I believe needs to be checked out soon.
