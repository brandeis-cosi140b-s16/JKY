Pitcher strawberry margaritas. I needn't say more, but I'll continue anyway. 

Sorry, I'm not a Mexican food afficionado, but my mouth knows what it likes. 

I have this modified diet, so its kind of hard to find options in the way of poultryless and hoovedless options. Crab tacos at Dona Maria's are fantabulous, though. Portions are American-sized and everything tastes like a Mexican heaven.
