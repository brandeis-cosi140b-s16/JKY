So I went to pancheros after my manager at work told me it was the best thing ever and even better than chipotle! Gasp! So I gave it a shot, liked the whole fresh tortilla but was immediately turned off by how everything is extra, I got all the goodies I could; the guac, veggies, and the queso and I still didn't enjoy it as much as my chipotle burrito from the day before, ill go but only if I'm starving
