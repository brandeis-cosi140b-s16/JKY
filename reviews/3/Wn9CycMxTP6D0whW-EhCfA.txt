The wife and I had dinner at Bajio recently, which I think was our second trip back since my original review.  Based on the track record of the place, I thought any update I did would be to upgrade the ranking, but alas, it is actually to drop a downgrade on them.  

One reason I'm dropping their grade...the soda fountain still gives out bad soda, either flat or not good tasting depending on what you get.  Since I had the same issue last time, I'm assuming it is an on-going thing, not just my luck.  Another reason, my refried beans were not very good.  I remember getting them in the past and they were fine, but this batch had way too much bacon flavor for my taste.  Lastly, my wife ordered the fish tacos.  Part of the problem is that the fish was fried as opposed to grilled.  She wouldn't have got them had she known and didn't even think to ask as generally Bajio seems to indicate they try to be healthy mexican (at least that's what the mission was indicated to us on our first visit when we had a lengthy discussion with the then manager/owner).  Anywho, she was pretty underwhelmed with them.  On the plus side, my sweet green chili quesadilla was very good.

Adding it all up, I'm marking Bajio down to 3 stars.
