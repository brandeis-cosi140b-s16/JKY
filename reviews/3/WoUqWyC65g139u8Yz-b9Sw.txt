Decent. I'm sure the meat options are better but their vegetarian options are kinda strange. I liked the cornbread and the guacamole,  tortillas were made well, but the combo of these flavors are just a little weird. The spinach and mushroom isn't my favorite. Cool spot just didn't satisfy my craving for Mexican food.
