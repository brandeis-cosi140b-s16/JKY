I went here off the recommendation of a former teacher of mine. I love finding these local secrets. We went on a Tuesday night, and it was packed. You know a restaurant is good if it is packed on a Tuesday.

We were lucky to get seated right away. We had the whole family there including the baby. I thought they seemed a little put off by the baby, so that didn't make me feel too good. Its ok though because my baby surprises everyone by how much so loves going out to eat. She is a foodie in the making and tries everything.

Anyways, we ordered margaritas to start with. They were very tasty and strong but quite expensive. In fact all the drinks were too expensive. My "house" margarita was 10 dollars. 

Our service was a little iffy and our waiter kept disappearing and would not check back on us. This is why I didn't give them 4 stars. I felt the service was poor. We had to wait a long time to try and place our orders. We asked for more bread and he seemed irritated by it, and it took a while to get it. I guess I just did not feel the love. it took a long time to get the check at the end. No bueno. 

The food was really really good though. I loved the guacamole. I want all my guac to have pomegranate seeds in it now. I also liked my cheese and mushroom enchiladas. They were delicious. I thought it was weird that they didnt have rice and beans and wanted to serve steak fries. That is fine if you want to be different, but the steak fries were soggy and not very good. I would have expected them to be better if they are wanting to be different.

I think this place would have been 4-5 stars, but the service brought it down.
