Visited Azteca for a birthday celebration on Cinco De Mayo which means it was super packed and busy.  We waited almost an hour for our table.  The service was really not that great.  We had to ask for things multiple times and gave up after they never gave us hot sauce.  On the flip side, the food is cheap, with many entrees less than $10 that will more than stuff any person, so that really cancels out the bad service.  All in all, it was OK.  I've been to the one on Woodlawn and had a much better service experience, but maybe it was different because it was on Cinco De Mayo.

You can get a "free t-shirt" with a margarita, but the margarita is $11 which is more than most entrees, so it's really not that great of a deal, but still fun.
