One of my wife's favorite restaurant.  She loves to eat the salsa and the Guacamole Live (table side) is her favorite.  Made to order with just the right ingredients to taste.

I'm partial to the heart-attack Chili Con Caso, not that it is spicy, but high levels of things that are bad for you.

I usually get the burritos, not much else appeals to me.  The fajitas are so-so, and the other dishes are okay for some variety.  The beef triple sauce burrito is one of my picks.
