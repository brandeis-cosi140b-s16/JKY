El Pollo Loco is one of the best, if not the best, fast food options for calorie and fat conscious diners. Their under 500 calorie menu has expanded to approximately 10 items. The ones I've tasted have all been filling and flavorful. 

The variety of sides is fantastic for fast food or even semi-fast food. I don't remember steamed broccoli being offered at Chipotle. 

The restaurant is also kid friendly. What kid doesn't want a chicken leg and their choice of sides like mac & cheese. And did I mention they have chocolate churros? 

I really like this location. It's not particularly new, but it's clean. The salsa bar is always well maintained, The staff is friendly and is very patient with customizing orders in strange ways like my family is prone to do. 

Update 1-23-15: Second thoughts about this location. Dirty & mostly empty salsa bar (the entire 45 minutes we we there), empty napkin dispensers (entire time), a double chicken wet burrito that was dry and unrecognizable - and they screwed up our order. Reducing the rating to three stars, hopefully temporarily. Giving three stars due to positive past experiences, but tonight was a one star night.
