Food here was ok, not the best option. Personally I like El Paso and Emilianos better. When we walked in we were not very impressed, it looked more like a bar than a restaurant. They do charge for their chips and salsa which is typically complimentary at other places.

On a positive note our server was very nice and made the experience better.
