we were wanting mexican and decided this based on location. food was ok: margaritas- pretty good, not very strong; chips were very thick, salsa was spicy and fresh; beef fajitas- beef was charred like it like it (though they didnt ask how we would like our steak cooked); tortillas were not homemade- looked like they were right out of a plastic package and werent even warm. if a restaurant uses premade tortillas, warming them would be a good idea. service, however, was very good. we really didnt have any expectations of the place, so there was little room to be disappointed. we were seated on the patio and had a great view of the bellagio fountains, and there were misters all over the patio, which was a nice respite from the heat. overall, it was ok, and we woiuld go again, if only to have a drink and watch the fountain show!
