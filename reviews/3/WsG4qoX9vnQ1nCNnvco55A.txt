La Cabana was voted best place to get lunch for under $10 by the Review Journal's "Best of Las Vegas". La Cabana gets a solid three stars - not overly impressed but not disappointed either. This small restaurant is located right next to a UMC and Clark County's Social Services. I was in the area and chose La Cabana because it was the closest eatery that popped up in the Yelp's app search bar. 

BREAKFAST BURRITO ($7.95): Comes with a side of beans and rice. The burrito has eggs, hashbrowns, onion, cilantro and cheese. Of course I said hold the onions! Overall, a tasty burrito. 3.5/5 Rice was better than most I've had at Mexican restaurants and the refried beans were average. 

SERVICE: La Cabana's was real busy at 12PM on a Tuesday. I had to stand awkwardly by my lonesome for about 2 minutes before I was seated. Servers aren't ones to chat or smile, but they're efficient! 3/5

COMPLIMENTARY CHIPS AND SALSA: Chips were a bit crunchy and the salsa was boring. I only ate like 3 chips, which is unusual since I usually eat the whole basket! 2/5 

Random tid bit: I second Heather H.'s opinion that the water tastes good here!

Worth a Return Visit?
This isn't in my neck of the woods, so probably not.
