I prefer Qdoba over some similar places such as Chipotle mostly because Qdoba has more selections to choose from and because I am a hige fan of the Queso cheese.  Other than that this place isn't anything too special.  The food is pretty good, the prices are 'ok', and the place is clean which is about all you can ask; however these types of places are a dime a dozen and I can find better quality foods at Carlito's Burritos or places like that.  One thing that I do love and would recommend to anyone is order the Chicken or steak quesadilla and order a side of chips and queso.  They give you way more queso than you need for the chips, so take the Chicken quesadilla and dip it in the queso cheese for an amazing taste.  Also, sign up for the Qdoba fan club and you will get a $6 meal deal coupon about once a month which is a nice little deal to have.
