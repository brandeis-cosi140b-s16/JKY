Don't get me wrong I love authentic Mexican food but sometimes you need the American Mexican cuisine from Taco Bell :) I like the beef better than Del Taco and the supreme tacos are great! Sometimes I wish they would bring back the $.39 tacos, haha, just a suggestion.  This location is pretty fast with the orders and I haven't had a problem with any orders as well, check it out if you get the chance.
