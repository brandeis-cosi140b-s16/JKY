Good food. Nothing to rave about but no complains here. Very nice / friendly staff. No hard tacos :( but i guess that's what you get when you go authentic. There is 1 thing that my wife and I didn't not like at all was their sweet tea. Whatever they are using to make it can't be natural. Fake sugar or powder tea... something is really wrong with it.
