When we moved to Surprise four years ago, La Fuentes was the first restaurant we ate at. We really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Since then, we have came back many times. Sadly to say, their food have gotten worse as the time has passed. To the pont that we no longer come here. How ever, the only food I really enjoy here is there BBQ Ribs! Thats right RIBS! They have their all you can eat buffet, and BBQ Ribs is one of their choices. It's cheap, not the best of meat, but hey! All you can eat, and has enough BBQ sauce splattered on to cover all the defects. Good enough for me. Because of this, and only this, It raised their review from a two star to a three star!
 We do come by once in awhile when we're at the movies. But this is no longer our favorite.
