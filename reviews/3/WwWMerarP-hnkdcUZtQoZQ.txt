Went by today my wife and I both had the combo..... taco, enchilada with rice and beans. Taco was excellent the enchilada had green peppers in it??? WTF I have never had an enchilada with green peppers in it. Beans were really good and rice was okay. I will go back again but probably just stick to the Tacos. Price was $14 for both meals and no drink.
