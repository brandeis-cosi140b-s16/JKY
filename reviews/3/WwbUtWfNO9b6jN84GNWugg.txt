I wish I had brought my camera.

The first was nice but nothing to write home about though I went to this place specifically to try their menudo.  The menudo was nice and made decent.  I do not know about any other place within Charlotte that serves menudo everyday. I only wish they had bigger pieces.  The bowl came out with only meat.  I thought when I tried this in Mexico that they included some veggie or starches with the meal.  They offer guacamole though the menu does not say this.  the place is friendly and clean.  The customers are purely mexican and you may feel out of place if you do not speak spanish.
