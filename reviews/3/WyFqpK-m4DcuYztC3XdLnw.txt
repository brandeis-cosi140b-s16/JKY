Despite being founded oh so many moons ago and being one of the older continuously-operating restautants in town, Garcias las Avenidas does little to distinguish itself from the local chain that shares its name. 

The food is typical gringo Sonoran style. That in itself isn't a complaint. Sometimes a girl just wants a taco and an enchilada, and the original Garcia's provides that just fine. They also provide good service, though on occasion it's also slow service, particularly after the meal when we'd like to get the check and get out. And most recently they also provide loud, obnoxious kids that crawl over people's tables, throw food, and climb walls. Seriously. I was hoping someone would stop this one kid from using a retaining wall as a balance beam before he fell and hurt himself, but then when nobody did I was almost hoping he'd fall so his oblivious family would leave. I don't expect a business to watch other people's kids but I do expect them to say something when a kid (or an adult for that matter) is disrupting the meals of every other customer in the place. And this sort of circus is happening at Garcia's with greater frequency. 

Still, they provide a better Meximerican meal than Macayo's, Manuel's or Arriba, so they stay on my OK list for now.
