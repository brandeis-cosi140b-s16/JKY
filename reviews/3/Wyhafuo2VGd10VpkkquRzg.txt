If I could make a suggestion they need to go to the original cheese, and possibly double fried the tacos so they didn't get soggy.  The meat inside the El Paso flautas are better, the sauce is a thousand times better!
Those French Fries ... OMG are the bomb!!!  Don't know what you guys do to them but don't change a thing!!!
I do know you guys need to add burgers to the menu, if those guys in EL PASO are complaining about it F'em!  You're guys menu is way better than theirs, and they should have gotten a trade mark on it!!!
If you guys make these little changes theirs nothing stopping you guys!!!
