Rolled Taco Supreme is pretty awesome, 5 rolled tacos with carne and all the trimmings on top! Guac is pretty good! 

Had to deduct a star because they don't have al pastor tacos. WTF? They do offer some tongue, head, and a few other "parts" that most of the 'berto's don't - so if you are after that, then you may add the star back on.

The meat was a bit under-seasoned, and the salsas are not nearly spicy enough - but that's par for the course these days - so I won't dock them on wimpy salsa - that's why I have dozens of hot sauces in my fridge.

Mexican Cokes in the fridge, menudo on weekends - plenty of mexi-seafood fare if you are craving that. Worth checking out if you are in the area and want to try something just a bit different than the 'bertos.
