I wish we could use 1/2 star ratings to bump a place up or down.  2 1/2 stars here.  Portion size for price was great.  Beans and rice were not warm though.  Needed to ask for silverware and napkins, after dish was brought to table.  Needed hot sauce for every bite.  That tells you a bit about the lack of seasoning.  The service was good though, and two people stopped back at my table to inquire about my meal.  That is huge in my opinion.  Would not rush back.  Average experience, and not that memorable. Specific to flavor.
