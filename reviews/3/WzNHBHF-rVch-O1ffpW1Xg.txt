Just a heads up! For brunch the Green Tea waffle & duck is a VERY small portion. Like literally half a waffle & a baby duck wing. Like wtf?? )13-15$? For that meal. Don't get me wrong it was delicious but did not fill me up whatsoever! Like I could of ate another meal after that. && I'm a tiny person, 26 at 5'2 and 106 lbs. I was still starving after that. Ok. Rant over. Lol
