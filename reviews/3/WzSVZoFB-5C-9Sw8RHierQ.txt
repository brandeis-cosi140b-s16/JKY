I bet you suburbanites of "America's most boring city" love paying top dollar to get just decent Mexican food. When it comes to my search for great Mexican food, I just can't catch a break outside of the barrio. 

I ordered the Killer Burrito. Beef, beans, guac, and sour cream. Possibly a bit of cheese. The tortillas are made fresh from scratch, and taste amazing. Their beef tastes exactly like it would from someone's home. The salsa was nothing to get excited over, but the fresh, hot chips were great.

So you're probably wondering why I gave this two stars?

The prices are a joke! If you don't believe me, laugh at this:


Any plain burrito (carne asada, chicken, etc.) is $6, but if you don't like yours plain, it'll cost ya.

The horchata costs $2.75, and it's the fountain drink horchata, NOT the real stuff.

A quesadilla with carne asada, sour cream, and guac comes out to $11.00. Yeah, I made that face, too.

My burrito was $7.50. 

No, portions are NOT huge, they're the same as every other place. So in reality you're paying up to *double* the price for your meal (just think of that quesadilla!), and you're certainly not getting the quality to match. But does Mesa really have an alternative?
