This is a place that serves alcohol and pretty good Americanized tacos. All of the ingredients are right on, but the meat seasoning is unexciting. If you don't like Mexican food that is spicy, this is the place for you. Everything was very fresh, and the guy making the taco was very friendly.

Things you can have on your taco:

tomato
onion
corn
lettuce
cabbage
lime
guacamole
cilantro

While the tacos aren't particualarliy special, they are huge.  They call them "Fatty" tacos, because they are pretty big.  I ordered one, and probably couldn't have eaten more than two.  

If I was having a few drinks here with friends, I'd eat a taco, but I wouldn't come here just for the food.
