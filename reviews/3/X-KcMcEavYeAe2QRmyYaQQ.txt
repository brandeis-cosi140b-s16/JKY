Authentic its definitely not. However its pretty good for what it is. Not the greatest but by no means the worst. I had the taco and tostada plate. i didn't really like the rice but everything else was pretty good. The service was quick and the restaurant was very clean. I think its a family restaurant so that was nice. My only complaint is that chips and salsa isn't complimentary but thats okay. Will be coming back again.
