Went for lunch at the suggestion of a coworker. My tip... go early! I felt sorry for the crowds of people waiting at 12:15 for a table. This place is pretty packed, so it must be doing well. I had a lunch special that had a tostada and a cheese enchilada. We were served soup with our chips and salsa, but I am not a soup fan so I passed on that one. The chips were ok, I have definitely had worse. The bowl is pretty small so they have to refill a ton if you eat a lot of chips. The food was good, not amazing but I would go back if I were asked to.
