Was so looking forward to trying this place, Ambiance and staff members Awesome!! Loved the decor, food not so great I wish the taste was there specially carne asada tacos, meat was chewy-dry, tortillas cold, & if you are having tacos cilantro and onions are a must! with a choice of salsas....corn not to what I expected, guacamole needed some lemon salt & pepper. Salsa for chips needs more flavor.
I must say, was a bit disappointed on the food but place is great to relax and have fun. 
Moving on to try the other restaurants from Fox concepts.
