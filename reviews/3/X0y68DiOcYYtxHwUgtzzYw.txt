I hit Moe's regularly for their breakfast burritos when catching a flight out of the A gates. As airport fare goes Moe's is decent for sure and isn't priced too outrageously. There burritos are made to order as opposed to sitting under a heat lamp, service is quick and the serve beer and wine if you're there later in the day. Moe's certainly isn't on the level of a Roberto's or Pepe's when it comes to Mexican food, but for airport food they do just fine.
