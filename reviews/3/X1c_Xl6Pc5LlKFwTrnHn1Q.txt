The Good:
BEST Tacos in the valley. $1 Taco Tuesdays. Tacos are not skimpy! Their Tortas are super flavorful and juicy meat! The place was packed too, so that says a lot as well. 

The Bad:
Bring cash because to use your debit card there you must perform an ATM debit withdrawal and they charge you $2 not incl. whatever your individual bank would charge you (prob. $2 additional) for not using their ATM. Too easy with technology today, they should upgrade to a POS machine. This is why the less than perfect score. Otherwise they would get a 5!
