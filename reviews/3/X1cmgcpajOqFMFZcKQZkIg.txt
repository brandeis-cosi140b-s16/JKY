I have been to Super Mex before but it has been a couple of years. I ordered the super burrito on the value menu and my husband ordered the enchilada rice and bean plate also off their value menu.. We both had margaritas. I had banana which was really pretty good. My husband had a chicken enchilada that he said was very good. My burrito was tasty except that it had no cheese. No cheese anywhere. My husband's plate had cheese. I missed the cheese!  I asked the server and she told me that cheese is an extra cost. I have never been to Mexican restaurant that charged for extra cheese! We also had a problem when paying. The server messed up our check by charging the wrong table to our credit card which she corrected and was very apologetic. Mistakes happen so that was no big deal. I probably will return but I will order off the regular menu.
