This place can be quite good, but it's hit and miss.  I think the breakfast burritos and California burrito are the main attractions.  Chimichanga and tacos aren't anything special.  The rice and beans are average.  Again, go for the burritos!  They are definitely superior to Filibertos.  

Tip: ask for the bottled salsas when you pick up your food--they have red and green and both are really good.
