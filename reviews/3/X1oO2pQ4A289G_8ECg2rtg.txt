Do not, I repeat DO NOT come to this location on a Tuesday!  Apparently, kids eat free and every parent in a 20 miles radius has no intention of cooking!!  Therefore, the line is ridiculously loooong and the restaurant is filled with unruly adolescents accompanied by parents pretending to be oblivious to their poor behavior!!

As for the service, it was decent and not quite as slow as I expected, considering the line was wrapped back through the dining room tables, and there was only 2 girls diligently working the prep line!  The line moved slowly  due to parents who allowed their small kids to order their own food while they climbed up on the counter to point and fill their items with every free ingredient available on the line!

The cashier appeared somewhat frustrated as I observed her handle money and then leave the register to handle a customer's food... a huge no-no for me!!

On a better note, my burrito was prepared as I requested with extra rice and extra queso.  The ingredients were fresh and the chicken was well seasoned.  My burrito is always so huge that I can never eat it all in one sitting!

All in all, a fairly decent and typical Moe's carry-out experience... minus the 50 million children, of course!!
