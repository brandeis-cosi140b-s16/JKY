A little difficult to communicate directions because of the typical language barrier but you pretty much get that impression when you go there. It's a quick and cheap Mexican restaurant in a gas station with minimum wage employees...what do you expect. Anyway, don't go ordering anything special or complicated or it will most likely not turn out how you want it! Other than that, they're okay.
