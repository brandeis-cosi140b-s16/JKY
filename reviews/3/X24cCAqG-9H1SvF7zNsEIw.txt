Came by after picking up the kids from school. The gentlemen who took our order was very friendly especially for a drive-thru.  

The lady who took our payment was also friendly. We ordered a family meal with a couple sides. As for the experience it was more then you would receive at a typical drive thru. 

However, when I got home our order wasn't as expected. It was incomplete no Tortillas and the chicken well it was dryer then dry. I placed a call to inform them about our order and the gentlemen was very friendly he guaranteed to replace our order on our next visit. They took down my name and apologized for the inconvenience.
