Not the best Mexican place, and not the worst.  Chips and Salsa to start off are great, with two sauces and beans to enjoy.  I wish they would change up the menu, as there are plenty of other choices they could serve to add some zing to this place.

Staff is always friendly and service has always been good to us.  Food just needs an upgrade in my opinion.
