Yolo's is a lame name, but decent food! We had the street tacos and they were really good! Their guacamole was some of the best that we have ever had and it is fixed table side! The salsa was disappointing though. The only strange thing is that to make a to-go order you must do it there, they can't do them over the phone. Which is inconvenient because we were staying at the hotel it was in. That aside it was a pleasant experience, we even ate their twice during our stay!
