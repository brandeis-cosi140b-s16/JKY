I finally got a chance to try out Maki Taco at the Food Truck Rally in Noda.  I met up with a few friends to find out what the big deal was about these food trucks.  I ordered the Spicy Crab Tacos w/ avocado and the Shrimp Hibachi. The food was delicious but I wanted more for the price I paid.  Call me cheap but 2 tacos for $8.50 was kinda pricey to me.  I ordered the Shrimp Hibachi for my daughter and it was $9.50.  It was definitely a kids meal size but a grown up price.  The shrimp were small but overall it was delicious.  I was still hungry after devouring my tacos. LOL.  The wait wasn't long and the service was friendly.  I would consider coming back and trying other things on their menu.
