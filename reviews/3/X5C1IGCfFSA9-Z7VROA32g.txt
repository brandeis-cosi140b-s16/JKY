This place pumps out tacos as fast as Mcdonald's does hamburgers. It's a site to see if nothing else. The tacos are tasty, the salsa bar has plenty of options, and their soda fountain has a lot of choices. They let you pretty much design your own tacos from several different types of meats and salsas. I like the concept, and they execute it well. 

It's not kept very clean, and you might have to clean your own table. It's always over run with kids, but if you are looking for a quick taco on the westside, it's a pretty decent bet.
