Now we're talking. This place RULES! It's no secret that we love us some Mexican food and this place might even have some. To be honest we don't come here for the food. Diablo's has a great happy hour and and amazing vibe. Happy hour runs 3-7pm like most places but unlike most places,  Daiblo's has "The Wheel of Sin". The wheel of sin is just that, a big spin-able wheel with different happy hour specials: $5 Jose Shots, $7 patron shots, $5 margaritas, Etc. They spin the wheel every thirty minutes which makes for some good times. Say it's on $5 Jack shots and they're about to spin, we might order two more, just in case we don't like what come up next... Only in Vegas do we gamble on our booze. 

The chips and salsa are good but they do charge for 'em. The fajitas are also very good but $18 is crazy steep, in fact we only get them bacause we can split them. We don't come to Diablo's for the food or even the drinks, we come for the atmosphere. Diablo's is two stories, out in front of Monte Carlo. When you come in from the casino, you enter down a long dark hallway to the main restaurant. The down stairs has very little in the way of walls and feels like one big patio on The Strip. The upper level (where the bands play Thursday-Sunday) has it's own bar and is all out side. It feel like (and is) a roof top bar looking down on The Strip. We'll be there within the next few days because we don't go many days without stopping in to Diablo's
