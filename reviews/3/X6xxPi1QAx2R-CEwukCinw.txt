This was the first time I have been to conquistador. I am torn on my rating and I wish there was a half star option. With that being said I had to choose 3 stars. 

The food was very good and it was freshly made. I ordered the carne asada burrito with beans and rice. I have zero complaints with my order. The steak was tender, burrito was fresh, and the rice and beans were great. 

Our server was an older man who was nice, although it almost seemed like he was trying not to be. Maybe he is the owner and mad that he is working and can't find good help?  

We waited nearly 10 minutes to get water to the table and in az that's just no good. One bowl of chips and salsa arrived at our table 5 minutes after the water. In a Mexican food restaurant if this is promised in the menu please get it to the table.   No water refill and no chip refill. 

Food=good 
Service=could improve

Nice neighborhood place that I hope survives. I will give it another try and hope for more.
