Came during HH at the suggestion of other reviews: It's 3PM-6PM, Mon-Fri, FYI. Half-off limited drinks, no food specials. Only the Original Margarita is discounted (down to $5), and it's a full-sized glass instead of the typical lowball glass one might expect. I don't know if I'd splurge the $10+ for a specialty version, but the lychee one sounds delicious.

Food menu is pretty basic, with two-taco plates running $10, additional options for burritos and nachos. They get bonus points for offering vegetarian options and barbacoa, which has been difficult to find in Las Vegas- their version isn't great, but it's adequate. The $7 order of nachos (+$2 for protein) is on par with Chipotle in terms of size, taste, and price. 

The service was really great, Mario and his sidekick were friendly and outgoing and checked up on us frequently. Aside from that, this place was a bit more average than I had hoped for. Considering Hussong's has been around 120+ years, the food was very Americanized... as were the prices.
