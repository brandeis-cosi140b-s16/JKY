I have been here before and had good experiences all the time.
I came in today hoping  to have some good food, good margaritas and good Mexican music.  The food was good, the margaritas were good. The music awful.  They were playing american oldies. Wtf. Isn't this a Mexican restaurant???  I was disappointed.  Need to find a new Mexican restaurant to go to
