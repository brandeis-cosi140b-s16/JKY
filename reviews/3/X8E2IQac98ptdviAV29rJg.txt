We stopped in for a snack and wanted to try something standard to see how they were.   So we did one chicken taco and one steak.   We didn't specify anything and they didn't ask... So we ended up with chicken on a hard shell and steak on corn.   This may be their standard...I don't know.   The steak was fair but the chicken was really good - if you like salty and I am one of those people that like salty.   The red and green sauces were good and spicy.    The steak needed it.
