What a difference a couple of years make!   We came to Pink Taco on Saturday to get a good solid Mexican lunch.   Last time I was here I ordered the Pink Taco and had been seriously impressed.   This time I went with the Fish Taco and thought I got totally ripped off!   Thank God for the Queso dip we got as an appetizer.  In fact that's the *only* reason I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 2.    I'm all fine and dandy with the fuck-you-i'm-a-rocker-and-you're-not vibe everyone was throwing at me.  You're right, I'm not a rocker.  Fuck you too.    That said, I'm here for the food so stop inspecting each other's chiseled bodies and go make me some decent fucking food, alright?!?!
