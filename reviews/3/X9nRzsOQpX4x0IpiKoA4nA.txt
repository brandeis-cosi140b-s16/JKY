I wish Yelp gave you the oppertunity to give half a star because I debated between three and four stars on this one.  The reason I went with three is because it is pretty good food but generic.  I had the Chili Verde which is one of my favorites on this menu.  Also I had the house magrarita which could use a tad bit more taquila.  The service was great and our server was spot on tonight, though we have been here before and they have been the worst we have ever had.  All in all we would come back because the food is pretty good but probably also because of the location.
