It's decent, but not great.  Both the food and salsa are a little bit on the light side, so I suppose they are perfect for those who like Mexican-like food but not the full flavors of real Mexican food.  Prices are reasonable and the portions are quite large.

They have a salsa bar with four salsas available.  All were good, but again, all were a little bit too light and none had any heat to them.

I went here when my car was being serviced nearby, and I'd do it again if I found myself here again.  I wouldn't choose it on purpose.
