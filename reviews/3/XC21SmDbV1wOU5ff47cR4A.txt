Unfortunately this review is downgraded to a 3 star rating. 

Time for an update since I have been back a few times after my last visit. As mentioned before their original dba was El Taco Fresco. Everything is the same however I think they have trimmed the portion size of their food and increased prices a bit.

I often place my order then walk through the adjoining door to Money Plays bar and grab a beer and wait for my food which they will walk over to me when ready. Mexican food and an ice cold beer is a very nice combination in my book and I am not much of a beer drinker.

We ordered rolled tacos, excuse me I mean taquitos as they call them. In San Diego, CA where I am from the old school taco shops call them rolled tacos as they really are. I never heard of the term "taquitos" until I moved to Los Angeles. Anyhow, of course don't forget the cheese and guacamole. Well just don't expect much cheese or guacamole as the amount was laughable and yes they charge extra for guacamole in which they are very stingy with. Only two out of my five taquitos had enough guacamole to enjoy. A pet peeve of mine is if you charge extra for it then make sure you give a fair amount. They were tighter than a ticks as with the guacamole!

I was craving carne asada so I got a burrito this visit. I was disappointed in the size as it was very small and not very meaty. If I order a carne asada burrito I want to taste a decent amount of meat. This burrito was the smallest and least filled I have ever had the opportunity to consume.  It did not even look right, it was so small and empty the shape was not even of a burrito but rather more similar to the shape of a pear. I was very disappointed, thank goodness I split an order of "taquitos" with my sweetie or I would have left just as hungry as when I walked in.

I will give them some time and check back as I am turned off at the moment. :(

The name change in my opinion has only brought higher prices and less food.
