This particular Chipotle varies a lot on a day to day basis and the service all kind of depends on how busy it is, which I don't fault it for. The service is that of any fast foodish place and the people try to rush you down the line as quick as possible to serve the next customer. I usually get the same thing when I go there. Chicken burrito with black beans, sour cream, cheese, and brown rice. Kind of plan, but hey, still good. 

Once in awhile you get that person that doesn't quite know how to wrap a burrito and thus it falls apart easily, which makes me a little sad, but it's not really a big deal, since I generally end up eating them with a fork anyway. It's hard for me to be impressed with fast food joints because they are, well, fast food, but this place is at least pretty clean. It gets very busy at around noon though, so if you come wait until later if you have a chance. There is outdoor seating and parking usually isn't a problem to find. The service is sub-par and once and awhile they make mistakes. Nothing that good or bad about the place. Just, eh.
