Food was good as usual but service was extremely terrible. Normally the staff is friendly and polite, i don't know what it was, maybe because they were near closing but the staff was inattentive and the cashier left in the middle of nowhere for a couple minutes and she had her headphones in as if it was no big deal! Not satisfied if you every want to come make sure its not towards closing.
