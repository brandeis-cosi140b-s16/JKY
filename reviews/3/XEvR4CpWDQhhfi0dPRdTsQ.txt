Okay, so I may have been a bit premature with my previous review of Viva El Taco. I still think their food is good and very much like Robertos. There is one big problem I have with them when compared to Robertos though. I went back to Viva last night for the $0.99 chicken tacos I mentioned previously. I got there around 6:10. I ordered 3 chicken tacos and 3 rolled tacos with guacamole. The price came to almost $10. WHAT?!  By my math it should have been closer to $6. When I questioned this high price I was pointed to the small print of a hand written sign that said the special price was only from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. That is just crazy to offer cheaper tacos during non peek hours. After lunch and before dinner. No wonder the restaurant was completely empty when I walked in. And they would not honor the price even though I was just a few minutes late. So I cancelled my order and went to Robertos instead. And do you know what? Robertos was packed. Kinda makes you think.
