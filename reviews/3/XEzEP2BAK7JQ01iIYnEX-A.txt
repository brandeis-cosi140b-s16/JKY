Decent casino mexican food - full disclosure: they gave me a free margarita with my lunches. Do not go during peak times if you value your gambling time at all. I went here for lunch on a few occasions and the service is unreasonable slow and inattentive. If you are going to make your customers wait, then make sure their glasses are full.

Standard mexican food, but the rice and beans tasted pre-prepared. Everything else was good for the price I paid - less than $10
