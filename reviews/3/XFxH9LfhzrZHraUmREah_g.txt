Welcome to Moe's.  They are very nice here.

I wanted to get a bottled water with fizz in it and I had already bought a simple flat bottled water.  The guy at the register said don't worry about it and swapped it out.  I offered to pay the difference but he said it was alright.

That is service.  He wanted me to feel comfortable and was willing to let $.30 or so slide.

I always get the home-wrecker because it is two meals for me.  I get it all the way.  I get so much stuff in it they can hardly wrap it up.  If you really want to go nuts you get a burrito bowl version of the home-wrecker and that way they can give you more toppings than you could ever fit in a tortilla.

Moe's seems to have employees that are cooler than at fast food restaurants.  They also don't try to hurry you to the next station like at Chipotle.  When you ask for extra of something they will double it, not just give you a tad more.  I like that about Moe's.

This location can be tricky when it comes to parking since I usually park behind it and walk up.  The parking is fine but if you want that lazy 10ft from the door experience you won't get it.
