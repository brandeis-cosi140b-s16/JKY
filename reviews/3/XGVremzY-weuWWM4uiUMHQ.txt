This is a good option for decent Mexican food. I really like the reference as to how the local park and street "Dreamy Draw" gets its name. It seems there used to be a mine nearby that contain mercury and the miners would return from their shift a little woozy and in a dream like state, thus the name.
They have a nice outside patio to take advantage on warm days. I thought the food was ok, but others felt it was too bland.
