I had been excited for the opening of the new Baja Fresh in this area because Baja Fresh is good, and this location is close to my office.  Upon entering I noticed that the place it tiny, hence the "express" addition to the title.  It has a dining area, but appears to be set up mostly for take out.  The menu is an abbreviated version of the larger locations, but still has tacos, burritos, nachos, etc..

The only drawback to this location is the lack of a salsa bar, however all of the salsas are available at the counter when ordering.  I hope they run some specials too, because it is hard to pay $2.65 for a small taco, even if it is a good steak taco.

Overall, I am glad the place is here, and will occasionally grab lunch.  It is next to a Smashburger, Port of Subs, and Panda Express, which are all  good choices for fast food in comparison to some other places.
