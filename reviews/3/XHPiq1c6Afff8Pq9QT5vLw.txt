The food at Cabo is solid but nothing unique. It's the same type of menu items you can find at most Mexican restaurants these days. However, the execution of those items is pretty good. The steak in my chimichanga was tender and the flavor was great. The outside of the chimichanga was fried perfectly -- light and crispy -- and they didn't smother it in cheese. It had just the right amount on top. My wife's chicken tacos lacked flavor, but adding some of their salsa to it helped. And speaking of salsa, the chips and salsa they bring out are good, along with the guac and bean dip. The cheese quesadilla appetizer was big enough for 3 or 4 people and was also cooked perfectly. The service was great. Our waiter was always stopping by to check if we needed anything and to refill our drinks. It was a good experience all around.
