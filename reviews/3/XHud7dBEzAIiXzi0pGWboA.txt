Meh... It's ok. It's "white style" mexican food. I mean don't get me wrong the avocado enchilada is the best. The papas on the side R like mexican mashed potatoe version which R good, nothing to write home about. The flan tasted like it was out of a box. The green salsa w chips for appetizer is the delish. We had team style waiters which would be ideal if the amount of people actually attended to our table. We had to wait until they remembered about  us to ask for stuff. I mean I would eAt there again for someone's bday or gathering but not by choice. It was just ok. The service was ok too.
