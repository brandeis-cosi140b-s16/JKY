Closed Sundays, and seem to close early at night.  Located on the NW corner of Union Hills & 59th ave..  Food is prepared like Subway, right in front of you, but it can be challenging because the person who starts the line doesn't always speak English.  They're fine if you just say the order terminology and step aside but if you ask a question then they have to get somene else.  For no apparent reason the middle-aged overweight guy who takes the money was rude to me for asking a simple question.  This is retail, and I'm sorry you work the register, but there was no reason to be rude.

Food was comparable to other fast food places like Chipotle that are a notch up from taco bell and such.  Prices are a little high but the portion is large, and it comes with a side of those little churro-like straws.  Competition down the road makes this a tough option - Dos Amigos, Rubios, and more.  Seems to be a favorite of folks wearing scrubs!
