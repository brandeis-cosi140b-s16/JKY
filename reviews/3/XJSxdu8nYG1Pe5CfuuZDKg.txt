Second visit here. First time, the service was extremely horrible and the waitress got the order wrong..not once...not twice...but 3 times. Some old lady, very inattentive and rude. Management had so many complaints they comped the whole restaurant.

Tonights visit...much better, service was alot better. 2 of us got the fajitas, which were good, vegetables could have been seared a touch longer. Beverages stayed full, but the margaritas were a touch watered down & pricey. The other party ordered a combo plate and it was devoured quickly. I felt that the food was a little bland (but better bland then overpower it) and a little salt was needed.

They also have the $1 2-spot win a $15 coupon keno games there. We played $30 worth and ended up winning $60 dollars in coupons which almost covered the cost of the meal, so that was a great investment. Plus the keno runner tonight was very friendly too (but probably bored and she said it was extremely slow for her).

Overall, this visit was a 3 star, its an average run-of-the-mill mexican restaurant.
