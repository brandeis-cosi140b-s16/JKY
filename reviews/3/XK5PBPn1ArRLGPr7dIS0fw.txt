This restaurant is like a metaphor for Vegas itself - stylish to the point of distraction, creative and wonderful conceptually, and absurdly overpriced. And like just about every other Vegas restaurant I've eaten in, the food just seems not quite as wonderful as it should be. As a case in point, my dinner a couple nights earlier at The Palm. I've eaten at the Palm  100 times in probably 10 cities and its always consistently excellent. At the one in Vegas, it was good. For whatever reason, presumably quality of ingredients in the desert, I'm yet to have a "holy shit thats good!" moment dining in Vegas - even at the very finest places.

Anyway, back to China Poblano. The menu is really interesting and just about everything sounds great. You could probably eat there a half dozen times and be excited about trying new things. I had 3 dishes:
 - lamb potstickers, which were good. Beautifully and unusually presented under a fried disk of something which I frankly have no idea what it was. The edible marigolds on top added their own interesting flavor note.It was good - basically the Vegas thing where it sounds awesome, looks awesome, but just tastes good. 
- dan dan noodles. Also magnificently presented, with a very rich flavor of something different than the usual version. The hand cut noodles had a distinct and wonderful texture. And the taste was good. Just good.
- a braised pork tenderloin special. This was a very complex dish with meltingly soft tenderloin with crispy on the outside chewy on the inside fried plantains that added the perfect sweetness to go with a complex mole type sauce and some diced fruit (not sure what) and some couscous. It was very good.

Now back to eating here a half a dozen times - yes you could, but you better bring a big bankroll. I had 3 dishes (as they recommend) which was just about the right amount although I could have eaten more and a light eater probably would have leftovers. The bill - with one beer - was $60. While it wouldn't be the same innovative versions, an order of potstickers, dan dan noodles and roast pork - of similar portion size and similar quality (along with a beer) would be well under half that at a fine Chinese place. 

If the food was as wonderful as the concept and presentation, I'd be in love with this place even at the absurd prices. With 2 drinks (or some wine) and one more dish I'd be pushing $100 for a casual meal for one, but if its fabulous so be it. But they haven't hit that here - its just another one in the line of super-creative, insanely stylish but meh food restaurants that defines Vegas. I'd go back (and I have to say, I couldn't possibly think of a better hangover menu) but only because its Vegas (and I'd hope it was a comp, or someone else was buying!)
