Okay, I know I shouldn't have ordered nachos for lunch. But it sounded good. I also now know to order tacos at a place called mucho taco. All the tacos and other food flowing from the kitchen did look really good, so I was excited to get my nachos. Waste of $5. A little bit of bean and a little cheese, that's it. I do think I will come back at some point for the tacos but avoid the nachos! - see picture!
