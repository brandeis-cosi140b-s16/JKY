Lunchtime on a Thursday afternoon; the restaurant is empty, and the waitress tells us to sit wherever we would like. She's immediately over with water and to inquire about appetizers - she was very attentive for the whole meal. 
We got the chips and guac, which was good but definitely not the best I've had. The chips were a little too greasy, but still good.The guac was a good texture, but definitely could have had more flavor.
For my entree, I had two tacos - one chorizo & potato, and one barbacoa. The barbacoa was really really good. The chorizo was alright - there was an interesting taste of cloves. Both were really full with rice and pico - sour cream & cheese optional. My tortillas fell apart before I even picked it up, but it was still tasty. My boyfriend had some pretty tasty tamales too.
Only three stars because, although tasty and the service was good, the meal was not worth the $24 pre tip for lunch.  Definitely a bit overpriced. I probably won't be back just because there are so many other places that are just as good nearby that cost a lot less.
