Going back 17 years this building was my introduction to 24 hr Mexican restaurants in Arizona.  My sister, the frugal one, recommended this place because you could get a chimichanga for $3.50, split it, bring your own water and have a budget dinner night out.  Her husband is still skinny.:-)  The building was originally a Taco Bell and I think maybe a Filberto's along the way.  Currently it is undergoing a repaint and a new facade.

I got my normal #5 (beef taco, cheese enchilada with rice and beans, $5.79) and a small Horchata ($1.39).  The food was as I expected, filling, ok taste.  What I have come to expect. The restaurant was clean and the staff friendly
