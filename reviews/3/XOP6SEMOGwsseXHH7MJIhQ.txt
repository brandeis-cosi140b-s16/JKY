For Mexican food this place isn't great but for airport food it did the job. I got delayed an hour on my flight so I stoped in for a beer and a bite. They have dos equis on tap which was nice. I ordered the fajita burrito which was ok no real flavor but again for airport food wasn't bad. If you are at the high c gates it's the best of your options.
