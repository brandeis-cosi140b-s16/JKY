We had seen the giant sign outside many times and I finally talked my wife into letting me try this place.  It's bigger and nicer inside than I expected it to be.  I asked the server what the specialty was and she said the burger nacho so that is what I ordered.  The portion was very large and the chips were great and the cheese sauce was pretty good too.  The burger part was a chilly type sauce that you would find on hot dogs.  It wasn't bad but could have used a lot more flavor and some spice.  To kick it up I had to use a lot of hot sauce.  There were also no jalape√±o peppers. 

My wife had the vegan tofu nachos and loved them but this is my review on what I had.  The bottom line for me is if you are a nacho place and some gets your signature dish it should be oh wow.  What I had was ok not oh wow.  Average ok place.
