This is just an average quick place to grab a fast lunch. It is not horrible, it's just average and far better than Taco Bell.  It's inexpensive and I must say the enchilada sauce is quite tasty.  The daily special comes with a small side salad and some pretty spicy salsa. I sorta of mix it all up and make myself a lunch time casserole!  

If only they threw a few chips on the side....oh and maybe get an ice tea dispenser.
