So, every year we come back to this area for a conventiony thing. Every year, we stay at the hotel across the street, and every year, there's one time when we just need food quick, and there's a convenient Mexican place across the street. That was indeed the case when I was back in Mesa a couple weeks ago. Having looked up what I said about it last year, I got the breakfast burrito again... it definitely was not nearly as good as I had said it was last year - it was kinda dry, kinda flavorless, and the beef was edible, but not particularly great. Definition of a mediocre burrito. Felt dirtier than previous years, too. Wasn't bad, but I wasn't nearly as impressed as I was apparently last year.
