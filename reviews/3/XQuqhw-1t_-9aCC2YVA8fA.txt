Agreed with everyone else that the place is clean and still brand new looking (six months after and the 'Now Open' sign is still up) 

The pickled carrots were pretty good, had a pleasant sour taste with pickling seasonings and a slow creeping heat to it. 

2 Sopes one chicken one beef.
The beef was pretty tasteless
Chicken tasted a lot better but wasnt by much
Rice was okay
Refried beans were good reseasoned so they didnt have a canned taste.

Also got a Horchata for 50 cents extra. It was quite watered down.
