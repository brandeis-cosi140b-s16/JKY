We always eat at El Pollo Loco in California and we needed a little snack so decided to stop by. Apparently they changed the names of some of the things on their menu and did not have the soft chicken tacos I normally order or my husband's classic burrito.

Because of no soft chicken tacos I ordered the Taco Al Carbon and the husband ordered the El Tradicional burrito that was supposedly like the classic. We dug in since we were hungry and realized I prefer the old soft chicken tacos they used to have. Don't forget to grab salsa. My fave if the Avocado Salsa and Salsa Roja which is a little bit spicy. 

Overall good place to grab a quick bite. Still getting used to their new options on the menu. I love chicken so I really like this place.
