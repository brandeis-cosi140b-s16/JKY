Honestly, I would normally never go to a place like this. Fast food and Mexican food together just doesn't seem like a good combo. I love Mexican food so I'm definitely picky when it comes to it. This place was just alright, the costs were surprisingly pricy for fast food, I've seen close to the same prices at an actual Mexican restaurant. The service was just okay, the lady wasn't super friendly but she wasn't rude either. The chicken wasn't my favorite, and the red and green sauce were just pure liquid, nothing special. It wasn't terrible but I probably won't come here again.
