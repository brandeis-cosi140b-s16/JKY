La Sirena (stands for the Mermaid) is a place a co-worker and I stumbled upon for lunch. It's an a heavily Hispanic populated area, so the choices are endless for Mexican food. The question I always have is do I venture away from the mainstream. Of course. 
I had the lunch special that came with three small carne asada tacos, rice and beans. It wasn't bad. The price was cheap $4.50. 
The carne asada was overcooked a tad, the beans were the worst. It looked like poo-poo. 
The salsa was nice and spicy though just the way I like it. 
Not a bad place to come to if you need a quick filler upper and you're on this side of town.
