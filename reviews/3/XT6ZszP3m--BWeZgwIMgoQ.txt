After using the spa I found myself hungry and didnt want to spend alot of money so I saw Rubios had fish tacos and decided to try them out.
They were ok..not the best I ever had. The beans were a bit runny that came with them but the chips & salsa were pretty good.
It was fine for a quick bite but would probably just hit LBS next time.
