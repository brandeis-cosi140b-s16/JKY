I've been going to New Mexican Grill in Gilbert since they opened shop. For a few years now, the food has been flawless. The green chili, the burritos, etc were all the best i've ever had. 5-stars easy.

However, the past several times i've been since the beginning of the year, EVERYTHING has been extremely SALTY. The chili relleno, the carne... even the rice and beans all tasted like they had been cured in salt. I felt like a horse going to town on a salt lick. The first time, i chalked it up to a mistake... but now the 4th or 5th time in a row and i'm thinking the salt is here to stay. 

I still gave 3 stars because, even with this food is quickly depleting the worlds salt supply, its still better than most places out there.
