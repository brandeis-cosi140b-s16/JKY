I made a mental note to check Caramba's out during a visit to the Stir Fry Palace next door.  The place was packed, and I figured it must good.
I took my daughter there to dine on a couple of enchilada plates.
I think based on the great reviews here and the crowd that maybe my expectations were too high.  I thought the enchiladas were okay.  They weren't terrible.  They were just okay.  The beans and rice were fine.  I'll definitely give this place another try.  I believe in wisdom of the crowds, and Caramba's seems to be always crowded.  Those people must know something.  Maybe I got them on an off day, or maybe I was just off!
