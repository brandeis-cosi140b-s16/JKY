Inconsistent pricing dependent on who happens to be behind the cash register. I've paid both $1 and 1.95 for the same soda, burrito price can range as much as $2 as well. Love the Tacos but the other food items flavor depends on the cook. But hey it's the only place in Florence that's open all night, a good thing when you work graveyard shift.
