Bought a Yelp deal for Tequila Restaurante. The quality of food was much better than average. Priced on the higher end as well.

However, they got my order wrong. Twice. The second time I didn't bother asking for a replace, as the lunch was getting late already. And they weren't busy, at all. Only one pair of customers other than us.

It's a good restaurant in its own right, but considering that we have a lot of great Mexican restaurants in town, their chance for winning is thin, I have to say.
