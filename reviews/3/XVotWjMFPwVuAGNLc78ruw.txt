I heard about this place and wanted to try it out. 
Pineapple soju was great!!!! The chips n salsa with Guac is decent. Food was mediocre we ordered fusion tacos chix, bulgogi& spicy pork (these were my fav) kimchi bugulgi burrito ( this was so-so not that flavorful the meat tastes like its left soaking in sauce prior to serving it) pork belly masubi with egg added ( my husbands liked it. It had no flavor at all it was very bland )  bugulgi fries with fries extra crispy this was meh..... There were 3 of us and we all agreed we won't be craving this or care to come back for this food. What a bummer
