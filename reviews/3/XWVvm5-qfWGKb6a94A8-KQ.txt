The ambiance is modern, fun and interesting; 3 stars for that alone.  The food and service lack.

Upon walking in, two people at the hostess stand kind of looked at us dumbfounded.  Finally the girl said, "2?" We said we'd go to the bar.

Went for happy hr. to try it out before committing to a full-on meal; sat at the bar, yet weren't given or even offered the Happy Hr. menu. Asked the bartender, she then accommodated. She didn't come back to ask how our food was until the plates were empty! And it was pretty dead in there on a Tues. afternoon so she wasn't swamped helping servers or her own customers.

We ordered 2 diff. kinds of tacos; fish and chicken. I thought they were pretty flavorless, hubby liked the (fried) fish ones.  Drinks are very pricey ($8 for a Jack and water, even during HH) and with so many good restaurants in Scottsdale alone, we will not be returning for dinner or anything else after this visit.  

Sad, cuz the restaurant itself is so cool inside and we really wanted to like it.
