Saw that this place was coming to Metro and thought it was going to be another run of the mill mexi restaurant...and it seems to be so. 

Huge bar, margaritas, tacos, quesadillas, free chips and salsa. Pretty much the basics. Definitely a safe haven for the taco-seeking diner. 

One thing that sets La Paz apart is their Tamales. They are handmade in-house and are delicious. perfectly tender, just a little dry, hint of spice and the presentation is just as it should be. I got the pork Tamales. They come with slivered almonds and raisins and a few veggies mixed in. If you've ever had a sweet fruit like apricots, dates or raisins with pork, you know how much of a marriage it can be. This was nothing less than a welcomed flavor. Savory, salty and sweet with the pairing of a fresh Tamale. Definitely the bread-winner of the establishment. 

The rest of the dish was mediocre at best. Standard ramekin of black beans. "Roasted" veggie medley which was in desperate need of flavor. The sides were lackluster and were left untouched. 

My wife had the mushroom and spinach fajitas. Not too bad with all of the mise en place that came with, but there seemed to be a hint of soy in the veggies. I'm not calling shenanigans, but I'm thinking the chef is using soy sauce on their fajitas. Strange....

We at at a sunny, outside table. Service was friendly and attentive. 

Not sure what goes on in the kitchen, though. Took over 30 minutes to get our food. Seems like they need to get some kinks worked out. 

A-OK by me. Nothing spectacular, but I'll definitely be back for some Tamales.
