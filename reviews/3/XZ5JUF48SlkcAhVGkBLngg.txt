I would give Espo's more like 3.5 stars. The machaca beef is top notch as well as the cheese enchiladas but the service is so so. The last time I dined here it took over 15 minutes for our order to come and it was only two machaca taco's and two cheese enchiladas at 6:45pm on a Wednesday. It was not busy and no one informed us that the wait would be close to 20 minutes. 

The food is pretty good and I will be returning but I do think that service could be a little better. Also the hot sauce/ salsa is really good.
