I like this place. Great chips. Salsa & pickled veggies at the salsa bar are great. The only problem is that the veggie burrito is just so-so. Too saucy,  no beans and the guac is only OK.  And that's the only thing I order. Also, when I let them know they were out of TP in the bathroom the lady was like "Really?" and proceeded to do nothing about it. I may give them another chance in the future. BETTER VEGETARIAN BURRITOS, please and I will be a fan.
