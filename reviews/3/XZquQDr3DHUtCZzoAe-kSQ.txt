I really want to love this Chipotle. Yes, they are almost always busy, but it is understandable based on their location. Sometimes the food tastes awesome but sometimes it is oddly flavorless like today. The rice in particular usually has a hint of lime but today it was really bland. Some of the employees will happily add extra corn to my veggie bowl and others seem annoyed to. 

Side note/question: will there ever be green bell peppers in the fajita veggies again or has it been permanently changed to the red ones?
