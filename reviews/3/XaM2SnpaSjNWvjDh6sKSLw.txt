We drove 11 miles from our home in Maricopa to try out Raceway Bar & Grill. The atmosphere was fun, country, down-home, and comfortable. We enjoyed all the antique signs and the personal touches, right down to the old chairs that had seen better days. 

The food was just OK - we paid $11.99 each for fish 'n chips, and substituted onion rings for the fries ($1 upcharge) and skipped the jalapeno coleslaw. We paid about $2.50 for a refillable Diet Coke, which tasted odd, like the water had come out of an unfiltered well. The fish was fine - several long, squarish strips of white fish (cod?) that was tender and breaded just right. The onion rings were overdone, and it was hard to find the strip of onion under the heavy, hard breading. I wouldn't order them again.

Bottom line: the place was interesting, the service was GREAT, and we may go back to try the burgers and fries. Just not the onion rings, which is a shame, cuz we'd drive quite a ways for really good rings. We would like to support a locally owned business!
