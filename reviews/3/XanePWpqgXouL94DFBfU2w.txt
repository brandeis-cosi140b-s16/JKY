It is not cherries jubilee, but if it is an ungodly hour of the night and  you got the munchies head here. So many choices and so few brain cells by now, so let me help. Get one of everything on the menu, one crunchy beef taco one small burrito, small burger and their yummy krinkle cut fries. The strawberry lemonade has actual strawberries in it riiiiiiiiiiiidicuuuuulous, so freaking yummy yum yum it will be illegal soon. They also have every other munchies you could imagine if you are high get a driver or take a cab as long as you feed them they will not mind. I need you around to read my reviews, enjoy peace party people.
