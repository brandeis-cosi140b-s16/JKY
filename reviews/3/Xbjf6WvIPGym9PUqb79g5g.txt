A new place that still needs to work through service issues. Wonderful pitcher of margaritas and tasty seviche and corn fritters. The must-have appetizer is the corn on the cob - yummmmmmm! Chicken was dry. Fish was so-so. Enchiladas were good. Our table of four shared the tequilla tasting -- enlightening! Ask for an interior table or sit at the bar -- the ancillary floor heat was not working so sitting by the windows was freezing. We all kept on our coats. Not a bad experience -- will definitely return to find cause for four stars!
