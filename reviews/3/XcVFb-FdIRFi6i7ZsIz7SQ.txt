Just your average burrito place.  Really no different from Moes, Chipotle, or Qdoba.  Though, having this place closer than any other burrito place, I will probably go here more often.

It is nice that they have more choices: Multiple burrito wraps, types of rice, meats, etc.  In general, a little more variety.

Service was good, food was good.  I'll return.
