So let me start by saying no rubios will ever get 5 stars feom me. The prices are too high for the quality of food you get at all of them but this rubios in particular isnt so bad. Its pretty small on the inside but there are plenty of seats as the place is pretty dead even in the middle of the usual luch rush. The service is fast and accurate so thats good. The staff are all kind and respectful.  Im not crazy about rubios but if you are you'll probably be happy here.
