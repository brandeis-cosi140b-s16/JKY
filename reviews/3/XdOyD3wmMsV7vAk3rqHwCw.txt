If you need a fix for Mexican this is much better than Chipotle in my opinion. Although it is a little pricey for an everyday meal situation is is incredibly feeling. The only reason I give it three stars and not four is because its not a sit down casual dining restaurant.   All the items are pretty much the same ingredients just in different combinations.  

There is a wide choice of proteins that range from seafood to pork and this particular location offers margaritas although I've never had them before so I can't attest to their flavor.  The staff is down to earth and makes great conversation especially since I'm a relatively new repeat customer.   

In the world of generic Mexican/Southwest cuisine this difinitely the top of the barrel.
