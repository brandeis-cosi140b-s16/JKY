The portions are big I had the chicken chimichanga combo with rice, beans, guacamole and sour cream. It was good but a little bit to heavy for my liking. If I'm starving and in the mood for mexican food I would come back. This place reminds me of Roberto's. They also are next door to a PT's so that's a plus =)
