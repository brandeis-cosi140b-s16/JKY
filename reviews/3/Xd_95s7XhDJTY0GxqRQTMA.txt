The food at Chipotle is amazing of course!

But... There is always a line at this location because of how slow they make the food. They do skimp on the portions and seeing other people complain about it on here just reaffirms my suspicions. 

The workers have been courteous in my experiences... they just don't give a lot of meat.

ALSO, the online ordering really slows the process down. I waited a long time while online orders were being made. Get rid of this online ordering, Chipotle. This is ruining your customer service.
