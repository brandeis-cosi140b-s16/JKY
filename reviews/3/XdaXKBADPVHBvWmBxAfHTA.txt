great ambience, clean, very good.  a little pricey for my taste, but oh well. that's why it doesn't get five stars.  and they have this tamarindo margarita with lucas and chamoy on the rim (not at the tempe location just yet, but apparently the phx location).  it's delicious! you must try it!!!! AMAZING.
