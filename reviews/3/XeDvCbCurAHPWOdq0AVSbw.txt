Since you can't eat pizza for every meal in Vegas (your friends get annoyed).....we had dinner at Border Grill.   I had read lots of good reviews; so, wanted to check it out.   We had some taquitos, guacamole, chips and the "sampler" ceviche.  I had a mojito.   

Atmosphere- "upscale" Mexican 
Drinks-  very good
Food-  very good
Service- good
Atmosphere- good
Prices- it's Vegas......so like most strip restaurants.....high

3.5 stars for PN
