I have gone here on a few occassions, with a few different types of people. first time, the service was pretty below standard. The girls seemed a little irritated that we had arrived and they really just did not look like my standard perception of hippies. If you see them, you will know what I am talking about. Another time, I went with my mom when she suggested taco bell.. this was a much better option indeed. The man (who must be the owner), was super. He asked what we were in the area for, we told him we were looking for wedding dress material. We sat down with our food and next thing you know, man's brought out the phone book, turned to the right section, and he has his wife on the phone. Apparently, she knew all the hot spots. If this review was based on that alone, I would give it a 6! But it's not. The street tacos are really good, and the place is right up my alley in budget. I will rate it a 3 this time(but I wish I could rate 3.5), b/c out of the 5 or so times I have gone, the "man" has only been there once. He really boosts the rating for me. I will try again though, b/c it is good food. I might bump it to 4 later. Would give it more but it's on Mill. And I will have to use his word "douche baggery"- because really, there is no better word to explain the aura of the area.
