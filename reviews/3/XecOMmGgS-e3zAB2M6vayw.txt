My wife and I decided to stop by El Toro Loco on sat night bc we heard the food was amazing. We are seasoned bartenders ourselves. Unfortunately, we were not able to get a seat bc the place was packed so we sat at the bar. I was absolutely disgusted to see so much work dropped on their poor bartender David. The poor guy couldnt keep up with the printer spitting tickets out left n right n he didnt have hardly any time to fill ours back up. They ran out of margarita glasses too! Looks like childs play when it comes to management there. I would never ever work there unless they had more than one bartender. I felt so bad for the guy that I left him $20 tip n told him he earned it. As far as the food, it was amazing! Def worth every penny spent.
