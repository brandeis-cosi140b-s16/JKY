Came here on Mexican Independence Day and ordered their Independence Day special. It was an appetizer, a taco of my choice, an entrée, a drink and a desert. It seemed like a good deal and I suppose it is if you're looking for a good volume of food. They don't short you on portions with the entrée. I chose the guacamole for the appetizer and it was tasty topped with pomegranate. We chose a nopal taco which was also good. Why the three stars?  It's not that they did anything wrong but when I looked at what what was included in the "special" I realized it would have been less expensive if I would have ordered it all separately. To me this is a place you have to check out for the cool day of the dead art. Otherwise I would describe the food as lack luster.
