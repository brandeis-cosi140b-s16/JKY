Its nice to have some variety in the neighborhood. This is a quality Mexican restaurant. The place is a little divey but the food is really good. I came here for lunch during the work week and it was quiet. Service was good and food came out fast. I ordered the combination with two enchiladas (chicken and beef) and it was very good. A nice place to grab lunch if you work in the area. I'l be back to try some of their specials and take out service.
