Went here for lunch today & wasn't really impressed. Ordered jalapeno bean dip for a starter & it was tasty though it seemed to take a while to get something so simple. Ordered something from the lunch menu. It was a chicken enchilada with jalapeno cheese sauce. It didn't come with much cheese sauce & the enchilada was really wet. It didn't seem like grease, more like water or something. It was just unappetizing, though the taste was alright.  Husband ordered pollo con queso which was good. One of the few reasons this review gets three stars. Decor was nice too. Oh & the bathroom was smelly. Overall, not worth another visit.
