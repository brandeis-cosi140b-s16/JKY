I love Chipotle, so it hurts me to give this location only a 3 star rating.

It's a typical Chipotle so when you walk in you wait in the long line (there is always a line at Chipotle)!  The lines move pretty quick so no complaints there.  

When We got closer to ordering there were about three people in front of me going through the toppings part of the line, once they got to the lettuce part...all three of them had to say "Can I please have more?".  The girl was, not exaggerating, putting like five pieces of lettuce on all the dishes.  I thought maybe she's learned a lesson and I won't have to say anything.  Nope!  Had to tell her twice, "a little more please, a little more".  I guess I could have said  A LOT more but I don't like being rude when it comes to my food.  

My burrito bowl tasted great like always, but my 3 star review is for the cleanliness of the restaurant.  It was disgusting!  All available trash cans we overflowing to the max!  I overheard one gentleman telling the people at the counter that there was no more room for trash, and I heard him ask this when I started eating.  When it was my turn to throw stuff away, the trash still had not been taking care of!  People were just leaving their trash by the drink station or just leaving the mess at the tables they were sitting at!  The seating is already VERY limited so you could see where this could be a problem!

I love Chipotle, but this location will be hard to visit again anytime soon.  :(
