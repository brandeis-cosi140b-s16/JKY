Camerones mojo de ajo. Delicious! The shrimp were sauteed in olive oil, garlic and chilies. The combination was yummy. I asked for a side of corn tortillas so I could make my own little fajitas. It comes along with a side salad and a tomato vinaigrette dressing that was really good since I had never heard of that dressing before. The side veggies that the shrimp came with were a bit too buttery for me. A must order is the homemade guac made for you fresh at the table. It's a large bowl so hopefully there are a few people with you to enjoy it, otherwise you'll find yourself eating the whole bowl to yourself. A washed down my meal with a raspberry margarita. It was a little on the sweet side for me but good anyway!
