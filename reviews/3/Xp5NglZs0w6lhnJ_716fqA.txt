Was looking forward to grabbing a healthy meal here after hearing about it from many people. Got a big sack of beans and rice with some chicken in my burrito. Was tough to eat it cleanly, it just kind of fell apart. Flavor was okay but not very special at all. For the price I think the value is too low for decent Mexican food. The staff at this location was very friendly and helpful so that is good.
I can find no good reason to go back to Chipotle again.
