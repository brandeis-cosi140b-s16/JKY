Had a craving for carryout - something new and fun. Stopped into Tex Tubb's Taco Palace and got a burrito and some tacos for the wife. The atmosphere of the place was awesome. Staff was very friendly and very accommodating. Looked like a fun place to dine (will have to do that next time). 

Food was fairly inexpensive - and it didn't take that long to make for carryout. We both got the Carne Asada as a meat. It was tasty but a bit tough. Overall the food was yummy, just not knock your socks off yummy. What was good was the sauce/salsa bar they had. I took two different ones home. Neither were too hot - but both were very tasty! Yum!

I would definitely go back again - just to try some other menu items.
