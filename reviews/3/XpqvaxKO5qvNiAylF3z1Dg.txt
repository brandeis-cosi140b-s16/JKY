We went here last night on a whim, wanting to try a new Mexican place. The decor is gorgeous! The wait staff was a bit slow, but the chips and salsas were great - you get three with your chips - sweet/fruity, traditional, and a great smoky/spicy one.
The Husband order the chicken chimi and really liked it, and I went with grilled chicken tacos, which were FANTASTIC!
Outside of the slow service, it was pretty great. Not a place to bring kids though. I will definitely be back!
