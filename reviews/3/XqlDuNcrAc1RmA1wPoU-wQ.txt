I'll be honest - I am not sure I am very knowledgeable about the type of Mexican food they serve at Diablo's.  Is it Baja style?  I dunno - it definitely wasn't Mexican and it definitely wasn't Tex-Mex.  But it was alright nonetheless.

First off, I love that they offer pitchers of all their margaritas and specialty drinks.  Pitchers were running $30-$40 but there was one pitcher made with some fancy tequila for $270.  A PITCHER.  FUCK!  We got a pitcher of the agave margarita (which was NOT the $270 one) and it was pretty decent - not too sweet and the glasses were rimmed in salt and also chili pepper flakes.  Spicy!  The server informed us that you get more liquor than you would in the equivalent amount of margaritas ordered separately and for less money.  SO I guess it goes without saying that our server was awesome!  I also noted you could try tequila flights if you really were ready to party.

Chips and salsa did not come with the meal - they were extra.  The chips were pretty decent - not too thin, not too thick.  Three salsas came with it - one tomatillo one (I think) and a couple that had a very roasted smoky flavor.  None were as spicy as I tend to like my salsa, but I have a feeling it really wasn't supposed to be spicy.  Either way, decent.

I had the fish tacos that came with cabbage, pico, and baja type sauce on them.  I was skeptical of the white creamy looking sauce but it wasn't too bad after I added a liberal dose of hot sauce.  They were ok.  They also have choices of burritos, fajitas, taquitos, and then also BBQ pork, burgers, etc?  Very random menu.  I guess you have to please everyone when you are serving the masses.

The price - well, this is Vegas and you will pay even for average food.  You already know this though so you aren't shocked.  Stick to the appetizer menu if you want to save $$.  Or just drink your dinner.
