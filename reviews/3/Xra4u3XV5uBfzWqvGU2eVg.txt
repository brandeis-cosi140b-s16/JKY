We've been to many Macayo's locations and are rarely disappointed, this was no different.  It's always good food but not great food.  We shared a cheese crisp and a shredded beef chimichanga.  The cheese crisp was good but a bit overpriced (almost $7) for a toasted tortilla with a THIN layer of cheese.  The chimicanga was good but was quite a bit smaller than I remember and was $12.  I don't mind paying for good food, and I don't have to be stuffed when I leave to be happy, but it does seem like the value could be adjusted a bit.  On a high note, I'm always happy when a Mexican restaurant carries a variety of Mexican beers.  Yay, Dos Equis lager on draught!!!!
