My work crew ordered out for Cinco de Mayo. I ordered the Vegetarian Trio, it was good but nothing spectacular. Dinner price was kinda high in my opinion for take out and portion size.

This is definitely not a taqueria... with cheap prices and amazing flavors.. I have yet to find a place like this in Charlotte/the Southeast.

Maybe I'll return during lunch instead and try a special.
