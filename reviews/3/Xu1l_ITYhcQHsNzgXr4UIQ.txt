Last night, my husband and I stopped in this brand new mexican restaurant right at the corner of Flamingo and Rainbow.  The place is spotlessly clean and the decor is fresh and vibrant.  Service was very friendly and very fast..

I had a very good Chicken Quesadilla.  My husband liked his Chicken Burrito.  Both dishes came adorned with very fresh tomato slices and shredded lettuce on the side.  Great nachos, hot salsas, and ice cold Cokes rounded out the rest of our meal.  Fine ingredients and no grease. Unfortunately, they serve food as if it were "to-go" using plastic, paper, and styrofoam instead of more durable ceramic plates and metal flatware.  This is a huge turn-off for us.  This restaurant is WAY better than Pepe's Tacos though, which is right around the corner with great signage.  Go beyond Pepe's and try the more hidden Jarochos if "to-go-ware" doesn't bother you.
