Nothing about this place is average, but it all averages out to average.

Nice salsa bar. Good pastor, but not great. Good adobada, but not great. Self service ordering with table delivery that's a little erratic. Meal showed up first, then the margarita. It was hard to find chips to have with the salsa. It's in a old Denny's with a bright paint job added. The booths were spaced out oddly. If I sat back in my booth, I was about a meter away from my food.
