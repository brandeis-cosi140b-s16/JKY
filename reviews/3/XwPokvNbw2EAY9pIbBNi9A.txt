I hadn't been to Manuel's in probably 5 years. Afterwards, I remembered why. While the food is good, it isn't great. There is better at several other local places. I probably would have given the food a 4 star but the restaurant was so hot that I just wanted out. I am actually someone that likes being warm but when it is over 100 degrees outside, I want to walk into a place and actually notice a difference in temperature. It was to warm to be comfortable. 

The service was quick and friendly. They still have the best fried ice cream around. The chimis are good but not great. The refried beans were a little runny. Salsa is excellent. I would go back for another $15 for $30 deal like we got online but probably not without it. There are just to many choices in the area for a comfortable environment and excellent food.
