Food was good, flexible with choice of chicken/beef/beans/cheese being mixed (you don't need to have all your Enchiladas with one single choice of fillings), waiter for our table was very friendly and sweet, Margaritas were under $3 (for flavoured Margaritas add $1), but I'm giving 3 because of the Lady's Room.
Maybe it is unfair to rate a restaurant not for its food, and my apologies if this would offend those who were expecting food reviews and also can't stand toiletry issues... But I really expect to see a sanitary disposal in EACH of the chambers, not one big trash can in front of the entrance door that's for hand towels.
