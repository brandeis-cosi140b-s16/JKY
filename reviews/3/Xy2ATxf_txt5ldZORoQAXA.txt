The outside of the building and the interior is disconcerting, so the first time I came in with a friend, I didn't expect a whole lot.  

Then I ordered steak, chorizo and chicken tacos and what I found was fresh ingredients and some really authentic, tasty Mexican food.  The meat is always cooked to order, and the lettuce is always green, tomatoes fresh and corn tortillas are delicious.  All the tacos come with a slice of lime and adds a lot to the flavor.  Sometimes if its not busy, they'll add in some fried green onions.The guy that is always working there taking orders is always friendly and recognizes me from coming in before and even offered some free nachos and homemade salsa my second time coming in since I had been there the day before.

I've only tried the assorted tacos there, but their 1 dollar taco deal every Wednesday makes it worth checking it out.  Plus, if you are a HUGE fan of Valentina hot sauce as I am (check it out!) a similar bottle from one at Schnucks selling at about 3-4 dollars, sells here for 99 cents.  There's some generic grocery items on the shelves, and a huge fridge that has Coke bottled in Mexico (has real sugar and tastes better), assorted Jarritos and other drinks.

My only gripe about the place was the overall dirty feel of where people eat.  I gave it a 3/5 because the tables are dirty, garbage was almost full and haven't been cleaned.  They're pretty understaffed, so there is a wait time for wanting to pay, and probably why the tables look like they're never cleaned.  However, the cooking area and food storage is easily visible when you come in, and you can tell that, thankfully, it is sanitary and clean.
