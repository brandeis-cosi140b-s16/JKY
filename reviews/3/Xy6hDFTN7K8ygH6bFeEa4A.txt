Best time to go here is on Tuesdays. The fish tacos are only $1.50 each! The fish is a generous size, and not a dinky taco that you would expect for the price. I usually order fish tacos along with chips to utilize the salsa bar. It gets pretty busy, so get ready to get comfortable. It took about 20 minutes to get my order of 5 fish tacos today.
