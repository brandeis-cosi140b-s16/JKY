I have frequented some of the other Zabas locations in town, and I was excited when this new location at the Plaza Hotel opened up since it is close to where I work.  

I went there for lunch and was happy to see that the ordering process, menu, and prices were about the same as the other locations. The staff was fast and friendly. Although after ordering my chicken burrito bowl things got odd. 

The first issue I encountered was that they didn't have any fountain drinks, only bottled Pepsi products that cost about $2.50 per bottle. You can go over to one of the neighboring fast food places to get a fountain drink if you want.  With the overpriced bottle of soda, the price of my lunch went up to over $11. 

Then the only seating available are some tipsy and uncomfortable tables and chairs about 50 feet away from the restaurant. While I was sitting there a homeless looking person walks up to my table with a cardboard sign saying that he is stranded and needs money and just stands there about 2 feet away from me and my food waiting for me to give him money.   

Encountering these folks outside the casinos in downtown Las Vegas is pretty commonplace, but inside the Plaza Casino? This person went to the other tables in the area and did the same thing.  The person finally left on his own and I didn't see any security come through.  

I got a very sketchy vibe from that whole experience which will probably prevent me from going back to this particular Zabas or any other restaurant in the Plaza for that matter. It is a shame, I was really looking forward to this place opening.  Although I still give this Zabas three stars for the food being good. But the Plaza really needs to clean up its act.
