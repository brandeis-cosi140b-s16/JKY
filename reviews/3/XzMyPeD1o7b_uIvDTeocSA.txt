We have been here twice now and the first time was very good. We had the Mahi-Mahi Fish Tacos and we loved them. We wasn't all that impressed with the service either time with exception to the guy who seated us the second time with the dreads. He was very, very nice and helpful. The food the second time just wasn't near as good as the first. We will have to try it again some time soon.
