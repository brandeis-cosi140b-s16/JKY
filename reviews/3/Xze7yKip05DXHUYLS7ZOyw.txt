Once upon a time I was a huge fan of this Baja Fresh location.  My coworkers and I  use to come here all the time for lunch.  Then, about 4 yrs ago I noticed a rapid decline in their food quality.  Their Chips started to become thinner and not so fresh.  Their Beef didn't taste as good.  And when they started posting nutritional info online.....I was afraid, very afraid.    Most of my favorite dishes here had a gazillion calories!  Oh no!

Well, every once in a while I'll visit an old friend and have a Beef Burrito.  Was at this location recently and enjoyed one for lunch.  Nothing special though.

Will I return?  Possibly.
