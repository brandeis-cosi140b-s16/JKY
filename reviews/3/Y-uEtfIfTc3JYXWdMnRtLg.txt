An inconsistent location. Sometimes prompt and nice, sometimes not. When El Pollo Loco changed their menu a few months ago, this location refused to even consider making the discontinued item, a sharp contrast to two other El Pollo Locos I frequent. The food here is nicely prepared, however, and remains a relatively healthy fast food alternative.
