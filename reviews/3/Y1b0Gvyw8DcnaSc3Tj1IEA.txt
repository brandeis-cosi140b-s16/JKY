There is so much potential yet it is diminished with average food and lackluster service. We made a reservation for 730pm last Saturday night for a party of four at the Hayden location. The decor is great with comfortable seating and chic Southwestern decor. Once seated, the average came alive. We all remarked that it was good we were engaged in a great table conversation as it probably took 15 minutes before our presence was acknowledged. One of the managers finally came over and reluctantly took our drink orders. With a motion of his hand behind his back (we assume we weren't meant to see the finger snap) he beckoned a lost waiter to his side. The guy was nice enough but not very motivated. Had we not asked it's likely that the special of the night would never have left his lips. 

We ended up ordering two fajitas, a stuffed pepper, and an order of tacos. The fajitas came at the recommendation of the waiter as being extra special. They turned out to be extra ordinary. The stuffed pepper was actually very good and spicy to boot. The tacos were uninspiring as well. 

We passed on dessert as our entrees were average at best. As others have noted, free chips and salsa would probably be a nice gesture, especially considering the slow service offered by the wait staff. 

Would we try it again? Probably not unless improvements are noted in future reviews. 

A creative name, nice atmosphere, and average mexican fare. 

Three stars as it wasn't bad and has potential.
