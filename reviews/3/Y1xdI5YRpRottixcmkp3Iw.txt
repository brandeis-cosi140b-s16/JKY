They would have gotten at least 4 stars, but when I asked for a tea to go the great server told me she couldn't do that. However, she was happy to up sell me a bottle of water. 

Service was also at first to be seated and then to have an actual server stop by the table. It was a busy time as loads of flights had been delayed and they were working to close up shop around 9pm. 

Once I got a server...everything was great. Table side guacamole was good as were the pork tacos. 

I would stop by again if I was on a delayed flight in terminal 4.
