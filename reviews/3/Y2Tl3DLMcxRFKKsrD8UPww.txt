Ate here last night, our second time. The first time we had their guacamole and it was delicious, you can order it mild or spicy to suit your taste.
The chips and salsa tray was not very flavorful. We had the chicken enchiladas and the veggie tacos. The food was tasty but lukewarm. Gotta get it to customers when it's hot! draft beers are cold. The setting is nice and the service was good but our waiter gave us the wrong bill, take your time!
