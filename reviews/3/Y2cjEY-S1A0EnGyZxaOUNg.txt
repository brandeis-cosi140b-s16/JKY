A-OK

Stopped by the Northgate area for a Grimaldi's run.  However, they were closed due to servicing their oven and they recommended BCC as a substitute eatery.  

Nice little restaurant with a few flaws.  There was only one guy working the front on our visit, but he was pretty quick about things.  I haven't paid for nachos and salsa in a long time as you have to here. The three soft taco dish was good and our girls liked their take on cheese quesadillas.  I thought their wings were only okay-- nice acidity on the tongue, but little flavor.  

One star off for the apple juice we ordered and some of the clientèle.  On the AJ, the taste surprised our 6-year-old.  My wife and I tried a little and she thought he gave us apple soda by accident.  I thought it was just bad apple juice starting to turn to vinegar.  I asked if they sold apple soda, to which the answer was "no".  So, I gave the drink back and asked for a fresh juice.  He apologized and got it  On the clientèle, there was an individual making occasional loud racial epithets as the Ray Rice story was on the news.  He may have had too much to drink, but no excuses.  I should not have to explain away crude commentary to a child when out to eat.

Price is reasonable, good-looking patio area, and it's hard to hold the establishment fully responsible for the behavior of other patrons.  A little more polish, and BCC could be a go-to place for some folks.

On an aside, it's sad to see the Northgate area withering away.  Such a nice shopping area, but too many shops are closed/closing.  Just Harkins, Grimaldi's, and Blu are hopping.  I really hope the location doesn't fail.
