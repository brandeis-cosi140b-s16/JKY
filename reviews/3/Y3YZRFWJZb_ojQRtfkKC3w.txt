Los Gringos is a good place to stop before heading out on the Apache Trail.  My husband and I stopped by the family-owned place and ordered up some delicious tex-mex style food.  
The food is cheap and delicious and the large rooms make it feel like a Chevy's or other chain tex-mex place you're used to eating at already. Friendly service - and check out the electronic ordering pads!
