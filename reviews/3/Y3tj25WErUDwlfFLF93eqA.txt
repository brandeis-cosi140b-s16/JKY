What a strange bunch of reviews for this restaurant.  Of course, you always get a few people who had a bad experience, sometimes because of something the restaurant did and sometimes because they just had a bad day.  And of course you always find a few people who LOVE everything.  But the mixture here makes me wonder if there aren't two restaurants named Ajo Al's at this address, or perhaps a time warp, virtual reality, or witch's spell.

The truth is -- Ajo Al's is an average old-school Mexican restaurant.  The chips are ok, the salsa is ok, meaning if you are hungry you'll eat them.  Some of the entrees are good, but you have to know what to order.  I recommend the chicken enchilada, which is overflowing with white meat chicken.  Some entrees are just decent, like the beef tamale -- lots of beef filling but it had a lackluster flavor.  The beef tacos are ok, the rice is ok, the whole beans are ok.

If you just need a quick fix of standard Mexican, and Ajo Al's is conveniently nearby, I don't think you will be seriously offended.  If you want anything more, this is not your burrito, amigo.
