Jose Cuervo wins by default because it has a monopoly on the airport as being one of perhaps two non-fast food options. This is like being the smartest kid on the short bus - not much of an accomplishment, right?

Totally famished and spent after a few days of work, my co-worker and I were so happy to find an actual "restaurant" to sit and have a decent meal before our flights back to L.A. She was also looking forward to watching the Lakers game on one of their many TV's.

Well, I ordered the enchilada plate with black beans/rice and had a mango margarita to help me unwind. The food reminded me of the crap you would get at El Torito or one of those places, and it was so salty. Since I was so incredibly hungry, it did the job. The margarita was pretty good. The bill was steep, though - about $45 each (including tip) for a meal and like two margaritas. 

Shoot, I spent less the last two days I was in town and I blew what I saved on food that blew.

My co-worker and practically everyone in the place was totally irate because they had a hockey game playing on all the screens about 30 minutes into the Laker's play-off game. The poor servers had to deal with everyone's harassment and could only reply by saying they didn't have access to change the channel and that they already paged the manager to change it. Let me tell you, I left for my flight about 45-60 minutes after this charade, and they still didn't get the channel changed.

Dear Jose:

You are located in Vegas, NOT Canada. No one gives a shit about hockey here. We're in the playoffs for f**ks sake! I'm not even a Laker fan and even I have the sense to know this is bulls**t!

Next time, invest in a REMOTE CONTROL - I'm sure your waiters/waitresses are competent enough to handle this sophisticated piece of hardware without your help!!

Smooches,

Joy B. on behalf of all of Laker fans stuck at the McCarran airport on 5/19/09.
