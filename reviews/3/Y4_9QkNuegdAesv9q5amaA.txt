Reviewing as it happens:
Unsavory location prevented me from visiting sooner. It's 5:36 pm on a Saturday night and the place is mostly empty. It's bigger inside than I expected. Friendly staff seem honestly grateful for customers. They really want me to order a drink but their margaritas are made from a mix (meh) so I pass. Free chips and salsa are a C+. Not stale but not fresh either. I ordered a trio of tacos - pork, chicken and fish. Served in double homemade soft corn tortillas. Meat, cilantro and onions are the only ingredients in each. Chicken is very good; moist. No cheese. Could have used something. Fish taco is also OK. Pork has more flavor (duh) but is a tiny bit dry and super salty. Perhaps their best dish isn't tacos but that will have to wait until next time. The prices are reasonable and I'd come back.
