I wish I could give it 3.5, because it wasn't quite four but it wasn't quite three. Decent food, but not amazing. Tour server was super outgoing, but everything else was pretty bland. Granted, this is coming from a girl who lives in New Mexico where everything is spicy and flavorful. I was definitely expecting a little more from this place.
