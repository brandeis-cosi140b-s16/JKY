I will say, the main reason I didn't love this place was the service. We came here on cinco de mayo and the place was not busy at all. My group made it quite clear that we were there to eat and drink and the server didn't come to us even though our first round was empty for at least 20 minutes. After we got our food, I got the burger and all I wanted was some ketchup. The server did not come and ask us once whether we needed anything or how our food was after it was dropped. He dropped the check without even asking if we wanted another round or if we wanted dessert. I could understand if they were at least busy but it was super quiet while we there so he had the time to give us better service. All that being said, the queso is amazing. I just wish we had a better server.
