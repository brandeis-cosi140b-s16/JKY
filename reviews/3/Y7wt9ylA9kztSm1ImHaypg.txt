Let me first say that I spent hours looking for chimichangas in Phoenix at 730pm on a Friday.  Locating the lost City of Dorado may be an easier task, so I jumped for joy when I came across the menu for Los Taquitos.  They service chimis with various fillings, enchilada style upon request.  

The restaurant is easy to find from the freeway, and there is plenty of parking.  The walls are full of colorful murals, and the menu is extensive.  The cleanliness was questionable, but it didn't turn off our party from the chimichanga goodness that awaited us.  Orders are taken at the register, and the women we spoke to was helpful and pleasant.

I ordered the shrimp cocktail, my boyfriend ordered the chimi with sauce, guac, and sour cream. We shared the chips and salsa.  The red salsa is full of smokey chipotle deliciousness, but we were unable to secure a bottle of the green salsa.  The pico de gallo was bland, a solid 2/5.  My boyfriend enjoyed his carne asada chimi, but I thought the meat was burnt and could have used more oomph.  My shrimp cocktail was weird.  The shrimp were hot, the sauce was cold, it was a mess.  I don't recommend it. Overall I'd say it is asi-asi.
