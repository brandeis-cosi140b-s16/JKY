Yeah, this is a rock solid 3 stars. Nothing great, nothing horrible, just a middling place.

I take clients out here sometimes since it is close to the office, relatively inexpensive to take a group of 12+, and most people enjoy generic Mexican food. So, it is usually a win-win on my part.

They have lots of standard dishes, nothing of which I've tried that stands out. Happy hour means 1/2 price beers even in the dining area, which is always helpful on my expense report budget. 

They actually serve a 32oz (at least, I believe it was a 32oz), Blanca Carta in the bottle. I felt so embarrassed when I ordered it. Felt I needed a little paper bag. But luckily everyone else was enjoying themselves, so I didn't feel too self conscious. 

Service here is 2 stars. They don't go above and beyond, but don't necessarily ignore you (most of the time). But yes, it can take a while to get someone's attention.
