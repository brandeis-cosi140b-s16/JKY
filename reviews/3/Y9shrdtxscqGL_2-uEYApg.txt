I usually write long reviews but I'm going to keep it simple. Don't believe the hype. This is nothing more than fast food Mexican. If you have been Carambas, it's exactly the same tihng except it has more hype and there is more seating. Otherwise, the setting, format and style of Mexican food is exactly the same.  Carolinas is good but I heard amazing things about this place....along the lines of Best Mexican in Phoenix and nothing could be further from the truth.  Again, it was good food but if someone served you this food and made no mention of Carolina's, you wouldn't be able to distinguish this food from several dozen Mexican style pseudo fast food eateries. 

The salsa is also overrated. There is nothing special about it. Imagine if you took pico de gallo and regular runny salsa and combined the two.  That all this salsa is.  It's as if they poured the two into a vat and just mixed it. 

Sure, if you live near this place or your work place is near it, you should certainly check it out. You will enjoy it but you will not be mesmerized by it. I would definitely not go out of my way to eat there or take people there.

In short: Highly Disappointed but still enjoyed the food.
