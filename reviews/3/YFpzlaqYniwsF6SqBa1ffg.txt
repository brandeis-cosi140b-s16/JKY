The only thing I can say about Macayos is "meh". I was unimpressed by my tacos, the queso was good and my husband loved his margarita. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful, even if over worked and under staffed. I would imagine they are great for a more family fun enviroment and less on the night out with your friends or "date night" experiences.
