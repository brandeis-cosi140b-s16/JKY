I've heard a lot about this place over the past eight years and being from New Mexico, I finally went. Overall the food was very good not sure about it being "New Mexican" as some of the dishes I've never seen. The salsa was great and very spicy, the green chili casserole wasn't what I was expecting but good with an egg on top! The green chili stew wasn't what I am use to for New Mexico style but had good flavor as well. Great little Mexican restaurant.
