I called the day before my family came here and told them there was going to be 8 of us. Needless to say when we got there they did not write my name in the books but got us a table together right away. They were also just opening when we got there. The service from our waitress was horribile, there was a point where my sister had to go up and grab us all silverware. Our food was brought out 1 by 1 about 5 min apart. I ordered a green chili burrito and got a red..but it was still good. The salsa in a bottle is amazing.....also they weren't even busy when we were there so not quite sure why the service was horribile. I will give them 3 stars for the food.
