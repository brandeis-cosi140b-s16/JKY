this neighborhood  restaurant has undergone it's 3rd reincarnation, this time as a mexican restaurant. the inside is pleasant and comfortable, but unremarkable. the service was outstanding, although the food was ordinary. My margarita was just a little too unfrozen, and the chimichanga was smaller than one might expect. all that aside, the food was very tasty, and the salsas served with the chips were very good. it wasn't busy when we went, so the fact that we were the only people in the place was somewhat disconcerting. in any event, I would definitely go back!
