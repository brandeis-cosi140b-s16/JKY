Just ok. Husband has asada nachos which he liked but got the sour cream and guacamole on the side because he doesn't like those. I didn't see anything that appealed to me so I just got a side of chips and salsa and figured I'd use his guac and sour cream. Chips are good and fresh, served warm. Guac was served in a tiny cup and pureed, yuck not the kind of guac I like. Salsa was served in ketchup and mustard bottles. You get red, which is hot full of seeds and runny also ( not the kind of salsa I like to eat with my chips ) green salsa was a little more mild good thing it had a good flavor or I would not of been very happy. I will probably not be back there again as they had nothing that appealed to me and I rate my chips and salsa high. They were friendly though.
