When I am in the mood for Mexican food in the Ballanytne area, I generally think of Senior Tequila or Cantina 1511 instead of Zapatas. Its been quite a while since I have eaten here because my last visit wasn't very memorable.  However, when someone suggested it for lunch the other day, I was game to give them another try.  We arrived at around 12:15 and were seated immediately.  They offered a good selection of lunch specials in addition to the normal lunch menu.  I decided to go with one of the chicken burrito specials which was served with a side salad.  The food was pretty good and the service was a-ok.
