I had a taco combo plate with a couple flavors. It was not great, and only ok.  Maybe there was so much hype and good yelp reviews, I expected a lot more. 

The restaurant also looks dumpy and dirty. It didn't help that we sat next to the bathroom. 

I would not come back only because it is a bit out of the way and not worth the drive.
