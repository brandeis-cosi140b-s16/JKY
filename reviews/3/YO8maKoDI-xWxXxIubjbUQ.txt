We ended up coming here because Holstein's was too crowded and we didn't want to wait. 

If everything here was 15% cheaper I would be giving it more stars, but the portions are really small for the price you pay. Granted, I get that it's Vegas and everything is more expensive, but I don't think the food was THAT much better than other similarly priced restaurants. 

With that said, I do think that the food was very good and I really enjoy the ambience of the restaurant. 

I was at first a little weirded out by the Chinese/Mexican combo, but in reality the dishes aren't necessarily fusion dishes but half the menu is Chinese and half is Mexican, though there are little flourishes that would make it fusion. 

There were 3 of us and we each got a taco and a main dish. My taco had mushrooms and crispy pork skin in it, which was pretty good, and I also ordered a Mexican knife shredded noodle dish which had corn truffles and mushrooms. It was very tasty. My friends also ordered the Dan Dan mien which was very similar to traditional dan dan mien at a Chinese restaurant so I didn't see any fusion aspect to it, and we also ordered the steamed buns.
