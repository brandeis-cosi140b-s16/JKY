When I'm thinking of going to a Mexican restaurant I never think of Azteca, but my friends always seem to love it there.  I can't say I have never had anything there that I didn't like, the food really isn't bad, its just not amazing by any means.  The service can be hit or miss, but they area always friendly.  The place is rather small, and connected to a Days Inn Hotel.  The prices are also not bad.  I have never had a Margarita there so I can't review that.  So for me its a place I would never turn down if suggested, but I just would never suggest it myself....lol.
