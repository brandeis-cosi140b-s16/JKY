So so so rude! I've actually never been here but I doubt I'll come here based off of the service I received on the phone. I accidentally placed an order for pick up here instead of a different location. When I realized my mistake, I called right away to cancel the order. When I called to cancel, the girl said "okay, we'll cancel that for you." And I said "oh thanks, don't you need any of my info?" She then said in a very snarky tone that they only received one online order so she already knows who I am so why would she need my info. I kind of chuckled because I couldn't believe how abruptly rude she was. I then said "oh, okay then...." And then she just hung up. What!!? Anyways, I go to the Garcia's in Mesa occasionally and the service there is so much better and friendlier. I would usually give one star based off of how rudely I was treated but I've never physically been to this location so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume not everyone is like that girl.
