3 stars.  Cold food was sent back.  Kinda snotty waitress. BUT - if can get passed that, the food was AMAZING! Completely traditional Mexican food.  I ordered a Paloma to drink (2 of them) and potato filled Flautas with Mexican corn.   The green salsa will make you reminisce of GTO. Ay mi comadre, que te adoro!
