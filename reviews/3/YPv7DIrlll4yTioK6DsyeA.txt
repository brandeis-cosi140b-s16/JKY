These Burritos Make you Moist...

Durangos Mexican Grill resembles a few other Mexican establishments in town in appearance.  There is a walkway leading up to the counter where you order and pick up your food, a handful of tables in the middle of the dining area, a self-serve soda machine, and the expected decor.  

The food here is good.  The burritos are smothered in sauce and if you like, cheese.  They are definitely knife-and-fork burritos, so forget about the burrito-on-the-go you know from other joints.

I had the Chicken burrito on this visit.  You can have chicken breast or shredded chicken, I opted for the shredded.  The all-white meat filling was high quality, but not so flavorful.  Fresh, crisp lettuce and great pico de gallo saved the day, but overall this was nothing to go crazy about.  

The small burrito, which is perfect for lunch, is only $4, making Durango's perfect for a quick bite during the work day.  Have a bigger appetite, go for the big burrito and enjoy.
