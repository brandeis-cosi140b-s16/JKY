Food was good but took way too long to serve the food. lunch took 2 hours and 15mins. The food was good, but they did mess up one of the four meals and we weren't about to wait another half hour for it to be made correctly. Staff was friendly...just...so...slow... It even took about 10-15 mins to get the credit card back. Great food, but by the time food got served, we were all half way full from the four bags worth of chips we munched on during our wait.
