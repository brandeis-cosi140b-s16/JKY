Pasqual's menu at this new location is as good as ever, if Southwestern green chili style cuisine and great Margaritas are what you seek. The renovations are tasteful and basically attractive. HOWEVER, the acoustics in the main dining area are horrendous. This is one of the loudest rooms in town, and conversations blur easily. They need to get an acoustic engineer in pronto to correct this situation. Hopefully this will happen soon.
