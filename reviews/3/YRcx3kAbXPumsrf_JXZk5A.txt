Came here on a Friday night right around 6:30pm as happy hour was ending, it wasn't too busy.

Service: Server was busy too know what was going on. We asked if we can get a spicier salsa...He forgot about our request and when the salsa came out, all we tasted was Tabasco sauce. We also had to remind him about getting our 2nd round of drinks.

Food: I'll be real, I am no mexican food snob but this was the run of the mill Mexican restaurant. Nothing special or over the top good. We ordered the Ceviche = way too salty, the Enchiladas Veracruz = really bland, Taco Pollo = still bland, The Fajitas with the steak+chicken+ribs = really avg.

Atmosphere: it's decent for wanting to be a "gourmet" restaurant. The place is clean and the staff for the most part was nice.

I've been here a few times, but there is no particular reason for me to come back.
