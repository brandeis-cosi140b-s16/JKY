I am a fan for their breakfast  great stuff and super good deals. 

You can get eggs hashbrowns toast for about 3.00 and if you want to add bacon its about 75 cents more. 

Their coffe is great and they have homemade bagels all kinds that are super yummy. 

As far as lunch goes Im not the biggest fan.

The people who work there are super nice and I have never got bad service.
