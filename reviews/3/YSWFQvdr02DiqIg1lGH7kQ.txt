Neighborhood place similar to Moe's or Chipotle. I find those places a little better since there are more options. For example, as a vegetarian, at Moe's in a burrito I can opt to choose tofu instead of meat and also put in mixed cooked veggies like peppers and onions. Picante does not have a tofu option. I saw a man making peppers, but it was not available when we ordered so I cannot speak to it being available. Also chips and salsa are not included, they are extra.  Now, on to the positive feedback- the burrito itself was pretty good. I ordered a vegetarian burrito with a spinach wrap, white rice, black beans, lettuce, tomato, corn salsa, cheese, guacamole, cilantro, black olives, onions and pico de gallo salsa. It was decent sized and tasty. Went on a Tuesday/yesterday, which has specialty pricing- $5 burritos and $2 tacos. Also noticed that Thursday's specialty pricing is get a free fountain drink with your burrito purchase. Not too shabby! I'm not in this area of town much, but suppose I would possibly return on a Tuesday.
