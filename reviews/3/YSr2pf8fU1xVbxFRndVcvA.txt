Yeah I know it's a chain so wth?

The cornbread (complimentary) with butter is very tasty, quesadilla app and the chips and sauce trio with melted queso is highly pleasing for your taste buds. Just saying...

3 stars only because our server was kinda lazy and he just plain sucks! He was slow and never checked on us, forgot to bring us what we asked for and just plain irrelevant at this point. Nonetheless id go back to other z tejas loc for the food.
