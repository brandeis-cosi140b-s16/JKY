Chipotle has lots going for it:  with a the burrito-bar format it's really easy to make sure that everyone gets exactly what they want.  There's lots of protein options, and the ingredients are usually pretty fresh and appealing.  Even on super busy days the line moves fairly fast, and with their new pledge to go non-GMO they've added more appeal.
But...it just seems hyped up and a little overpriced.  While their chips are good, (love the hint of lime!) they're spendy!  Seriously?  They're tortilla chips!!!  Also, it's noisy.  And often we look at the line and think "Nope, not worth it"  The steak and chicken can vary from tender and good to "Oh yuck, trim your meat better"  So, do we eat there anyway sometimes?  For sure.  If the kiddos didn't like it so much we would go less often.
