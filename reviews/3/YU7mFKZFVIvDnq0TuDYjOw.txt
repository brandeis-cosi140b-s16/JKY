Three Stars

I always get excited by dumplings and Asian/Mexican fusion but I am usually disappointed.  This place was no different.  The atmosphere was fun and had unique eye catching design elements.  The Negro Modelo was only $6 dollars which was cheaper than any other place.  We started with Chips and Guacamole for $15 which was good but I rather make my own.  I had a $5 Carnitas Taco with Pork Cracklings which was delicious.  I also had the Lucky 6 Pork Dumplings ($13.88)*, which had three different types with three different garnishes: Tobiko, Radish, & Gold Leaf.  The dumplings were overly salty and you can easily get better ones at any Chinatown restaurant.  

I guess I was hoping that there would have been more fusion but instead it was just place to eat Mexican or Asian food.
