We took my sister to Z Tejas for dinner on Saturday evening and had a relatively nice time. The decor is southwestern, but it's done in a tasteful understated way, unlike some other places we have been to here in the Valley where it is so overdone it borders on tacky. We were seated right away since at 6 pm, it was a little early for most people to be dining on Mill Avenue. Our waitress was very nice and paid us just the right amount of attention. 

My sister had the Patron Fruzion margarita which she really liked, and I had the 6th Street Rocks which was also really good and I am not a huge margarita person. We enjoyed the Tejas Trio as an appetizer, which was chips and a trio of queso, guacamole, and salsa. The queso dip was fabulous and our favorite of the trio. We also had the cornbread which I thought was very tasty - not dry at all which was a plus. I think if we had just stuck to the drinks, appetizer and cornbread, this would have been a four star review. However, we also ate dinner which was very so-so. My sister just stuck with a burger which was a good size but not obscenely large. Chris had the chicken enchiladas which he thought were pretty mediocre, and I had the five cheese macaroni and chicken. Now I like cheese, but this dish had a much too high cheese to macaroni ratio. Also, I think if the dish had used penne pasta instead of the macaroni noodles you get in the Kraft blue box, it would have been much better.

Our bill came to $81 after tip, which we didn't think was bad at all. Chris and I decided we will go back for happy hour (1/2 price on appetizers and $1 off drinks), but not to eat dinner.
