Went here for lunch recently in a group.  We paid separately and the server cut our change.  For instance mine was 11.61 and the server only gave me 8 dollars back.  He didn't even acknowledge it.  Its ok though, we took it out of his tip.  The food seems to be going downhill also.  Chile Relleno tasted like it was from the microwave.  It will be a while before I go back.
