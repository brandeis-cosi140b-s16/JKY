Food was good for coming from Florence with very little restaurant choices. But was very disappointed with the bill at the end. My date and I shared meals and I got four a la carte enchiladas that ended up costing me over $5 each. Ended up with over a $50 bill for two. Would have been OK with paying $15.00 but over 20.00!!!
