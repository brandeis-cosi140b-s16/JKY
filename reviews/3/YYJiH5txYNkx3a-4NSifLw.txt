This is the newest Taco Bell on the block, but retains all the staff from the ol' Taco Bell that was down the street. I've know been to this Taco Bell a few times as it is kinda close to home, and it's not bad...

The service here has been great on the few occasions I've visited, which I think is pretty cool. I mean, these places don't pay their guys the best which sometimes leads to not the best service. However, it's great here. Everyone was cool taking my orders, the food came out quick, and there were smiles and "thank you"'s all the time. 

The food here was awesome by Taco Bell standards. It was pretty good, the food was hot, and it came out quick. Really, nothing to complain about at all.
