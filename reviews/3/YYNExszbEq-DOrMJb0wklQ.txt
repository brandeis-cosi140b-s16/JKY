I really wanted El Rico's to be great!  The good points were the rice and the smooth, creamy beans.   The chips were deliciously light.   Service was attentive and prompt.  The only problem was that all the foods were too salty.  I am one who usually puts salt on the bowl of chips in a Mexican restaurant---and also the first in our party to remark on the saltiness.   Even the entrees were too salty.     I have heard that the crispy tacoes are fabulous----so I WILL return....but....please....cut down on the salt in your recipes!
