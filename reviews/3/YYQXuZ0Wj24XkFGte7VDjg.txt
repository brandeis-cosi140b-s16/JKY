I noticed they finally opened in the strip mall I work in and decided to give them a try. It was okay. Like the other review, I just wanted something more. It was not horrible, but it was not the best. Just so-so. I will come back and try something new and maybe after they are open for awhile it may be better. The staff was nice and the place was clean.
