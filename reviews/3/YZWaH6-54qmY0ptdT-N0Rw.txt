A great place to have a few drinks during the week (they have awesome specials on drink and food).   The bartenders and staff are very friendly and extremely accomadating.  The place has a nice laid back ambiance.  Come as you are...sandals, tshirts, hoody..whatever.   They have a jukebox and serve grub till 2am.  This is my local favorite.  I would give it 5 stars, but sometimes there is a slight douche factor in the clientele is to be expected per the location smack dab in the center of old town.  Check this place out for a quick drink or just to hang out and relax in the sun.



Update: 3/2013

This place has gone downhill steadily over the past year or 2 since new management.  The majority of all the cool bartenders have quit or moved on..as a result alot of the regulars (like myself) dont come here nearly as much as they used to.  While it is still a cool place during the day for a cocktail, its no longer my first choice for a hangout at night.  Maybe its just that im sick of spring training?  The upper bar is my choice if i do happen to come by for a pre-show cocktail. Its usually a little easier to get a drink upstairs and the atmosphere is a tiny bit more relaxed.  Overall, its still a pretty decent place for a drink and some good folks still work here, but id much rather go to Pattys, coachhouse, pranksters, or grapevine.
