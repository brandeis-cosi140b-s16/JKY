If you are going to go to Barrio, do not go for their tortas. Unfortunately, that's exactly what I ordered. The torta de pollo pibil that I ordered was extremely dry. I would have sent it back had the occasion been less formal. A $15 mistake on my part. Tortas el Rey would have been a MUCH better choice.

The dishes that my friends had looked very appetizing. When I get a few more dimes to rub together I will return.
