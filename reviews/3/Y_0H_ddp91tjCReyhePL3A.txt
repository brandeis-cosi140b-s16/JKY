This was my first visit to this restaurant.  You have to pay to park, about $2 per hour, but you can use your credit card to pay if you like, that was nice.  We were the only people in the place at 11am, we were directed to sit wherever we would like.  The lady behind the counter was a tad cool and a little rude, maybe she was having a cruddy day, no worries.  Anyhow, onto the food, the same woman brought us some chips, pico and two bottles of salsa, the green was my favorite, I poured it all over my food, good stuff and not too spicy.  The chips were forgettable, not impressed, but they were free, so no big whoop.  I ordered a steak taco and a chicken gordita.  The steak taco was one of the best I have ever had, well seasoned steak, fresh cilantro and onions on 2 corn tortillas, I wish I would have ordered 2 of those!  The chicken gordita wasn't that good in my opinion, needed a healthy dose of the green salsa and the chicken was pretty dry.  My husband ordered a chicken gordita and a chicken quesadilla, he thought they were just fine, but needed to give them both a good dose of the salsa on the table.  The side of rice and beans were forgettable and pretty expensive for the amount they give you, lesson learned, won't order those again.  Soda is free refilled, but they should be at $2 a pop for a small glass, might just get water next time.  I loved the steak tacos and the green salsa, the service and the other food I tried, not so much.  If I am near that part of town and have a hankering for steak tacos, I will stop in.
