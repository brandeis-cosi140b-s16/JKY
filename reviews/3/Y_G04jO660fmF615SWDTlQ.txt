This place is near my house and great for a late night Mexican craving. Nothing special about the food but pretty awesome that it's 24 hours.

Pros: 24 hours, convenient location, decent food.

Cons: Service is always poor and unpleasant. Quality isn't consistent.

Will eat here again when I get the late night urge.
