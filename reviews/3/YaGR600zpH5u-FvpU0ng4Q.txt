Clean, great customer service, agua fresca pretty good all natural. Prices are comparable to Roberto taco shop. I ordered Super Nachos carne asada. There's plenty of meat and beans all though I thought the portion was big enough for two it was small. The food is made to order and the kitchen seems to be clean.
