The food is great -especially the tortillas cooked right in front of you. 
The customer service is a bit lacking. Sometimes they don't listen to your order/or prepare it as requested. 
Biggest issue today- Yelp indicates that they close at 10pm (Sunday). 
I tell the cashier that maybe they should contact Yelp to have that updated as I am watching them turn away multiple customers as it just past 9pm. Then when I leave I notice that the sign on their front window indicates 10pm as the closing time too. Simple things...smh 

Oh and I swear they turned on the AC or cut the heat- to encourage customers to eat and leave promptly. (It was 48degrees outside)
