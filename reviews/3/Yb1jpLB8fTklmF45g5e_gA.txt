HOT! HOT! HOT! HOT! HOT! HOT!HOT! HOT! HOT!HOT! HOT! HOT!HOT! HOT! HOT!HOT! HOT! HOT!HOT! HOT! HOT!

I'm not talking fresh-out-of-the-oven-burn-your-mouth hot. I'm talking all-jacked-up-on-steroid-spice hot. 

But if hot's you, then you ought to eat here. 

I've been here a handful of times with the family... particularly because it's my dad's favorite place. From the spicy beef pizza to a shrimp dish, my mouth always burns! 

Forget the salsa. Don't go anywhere near it if you can't stand the flames. 

Order a margarita. They're heavenly and HUGE! And the perfect companion to the dishes this restaurant serves up.
