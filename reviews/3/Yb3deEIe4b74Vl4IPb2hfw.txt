I'm also here from the East Coast for business and was looking for some decent Mexican. I ended up getting the number 8, which was 4 rolled tacos with a side of rice and beans. Not bad - it was good but not fantastic. I will say that I devoured most of the combo pretty quickly so it was tasty and hit the spot but it was nothing too out of the ordinary.
