Chips and salsa are VERY good. 

Steak fajita meat is delicious. 

Pollo fundido is also very good. 

Everything else on the menu is very average. 

Their beans arent very good, and their rice is terrible. 

There are much better mexican restaurants within 15 min of top shelf, but if proximity is a priority, then you go to top shelf. 

Also, there is one waitress there that is awesome. She used to leave phx each summer and come back each winter but i havent seen her recently, but she makes the place 10 times better.
