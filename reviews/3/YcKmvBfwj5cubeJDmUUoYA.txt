I have been to Barrio Queen once before and the last time, I ordered three tacos, all of which were very tasty and that had distinctive flavors

This time, I ordered a variety of tacos and was a bit disappointed.  All of the tacos are street style which means they are smaller than your typical taco.  Not necessarily a problem.  

On this occasion, The first taco I ordered was the Suadero Azteca, which is a taco that has shredded beef.  The taco was very plain and the salsas did not add much to the flavor.  I then had the Al Pastor and the Carnitas, which were fine but did not really stand out to me.

The last taco was the Shrimp Taco.  When Barrio Queen says "Shrimp Taco", that literally means all you get is one shrimp.  I have had plenty of shrimp tacos in my life and this was ridiculous.  Who puts just one shrimp on a taco?

I motioned for the waiter to come over and asked him, "Aren't there supposed to be more shrimp here?"  He replied that they just put one "large" shrimp on the taco.  

On the plus side, the waiter and everyone there was very friendly.   I may actually go back and order something else but my advice to anyone reading is to definitely pass on the shrimp taco.
