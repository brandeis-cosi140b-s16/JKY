Homestyle mexican food nothing fancy but tasty. Not too pricey. The steak meat in fajitas was kinda chewy but not bad .Salsa and guac are good. Generous portions. Full bar. Waiters are friendly and helpful. Wait for food is long but does get packed for dinners. Even then wait for table is usually never more than 10-15 minutes when I've been. No huge tables for groups but I see all different size parties in there all the time.
