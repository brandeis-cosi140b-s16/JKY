We arrived later in the evening (10:30) due to having seen a show at 7pm. They were still serving a full menu which was a plus. We were seated right away and were right next to the mechanical bull pit so we had some entertainment. The food was decent, the Guac, which the waitress claimed they were well known for, was horrible. It had way too much lime juice and was runny. The salsa on the other hand was fire! Well worth the $3 for chips & salsa. I had Carnitas tacos which were good once the guac was removed and my husband had the steak burrito which was good. Our waitress started out well but went down hill thru the meal as it became hard to get her attention and we had to routinely ask for the obvious, like utensils and napkins when our meal arrived. So, decent food but mediocre service.
