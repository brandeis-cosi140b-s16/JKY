You should have two types of chips,  one with salt, and one without .  High blood pressure is a major issue and salt, is the major demon. Give people the option.  I'm a regular customer and love your food but it really pisses me off when you bring me a of  bucket full of salted chips. Next time I come there I have been promised  by a shift manager to cook a basket of salt free chips. Thank you. Dont be like Bojangles salt infused!!!!! Their's salt on the table!!!!!!!!!

We love the tofu here. We're vegetarians. They are a few choices you offer. Thank you!!!!!

But this salt that the cook puts on these chips after they come out of the grease is under unnecessary!! Enough is enough!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

You would have 5 stars with out this issue.....
