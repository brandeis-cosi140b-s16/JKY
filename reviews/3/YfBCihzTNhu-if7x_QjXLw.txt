Here's my review when it was called Roberto's
(why? 'cause it's the same place with a different name
and I don't feel like writing something new):

How does this chain place still retain such a local feel?

Allow me to count the ways:

--  the people working here try talking to me in Spanish (I applaud the effort) and then abruptly stop when I give them my "I don't understand" look.

--  each store is set up a little differently: meaning some locations look grungier than others.

--  the inconsistency of the food makes you believe they are actually cooking.

--  there is no dollar menu, volcano taco, or mascot to promote their food.

Overall, Roberto's deserves a 3.5 star,
but I have to round them down
(even though they've filled my belly
many a time in the wee hours of the night)
since the stuff I order is totally greasy
and unhealthy
and my heart just won't
allow to give them four.
