Amazing service!!! Definitely made up for the food which was so-so. I ordered the chicken fajitas and the chicken was a tad dry and the veggies were completely burned, couldn't get them off the skillet that was a permanent home to them I guess lol. The flour tortillas were way thick kind of like a pita bread. I would have preferred corn tortillas if that were an option. I'll still go back because like I said the service was amazing!!!! I just won't be ordering the fajitas.
