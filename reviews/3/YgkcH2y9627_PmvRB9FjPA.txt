40 minute wait for a table of two is a real bummer to start out the evening.  The guacamole was good, but the excitement of having it made tableside was lacking here.  The tacos were tasty, but as other reviews said they are really tiny.  The Arizona burrito was really good with a nice heat in the green sauce.  The churros with caramel were yummy but could have used another couple on the plate to share.  The server was very nice, but busy so we felt a little neglected at times.
