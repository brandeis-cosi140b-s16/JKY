From all the great reviews from other Yelpers that I follow and whos opinions I value, I came away from the Sloppi Jo's tasting experience a little underwhelmed at the recent Costco Food Truck Fest.  First it is not "sloppy joe" on the menu, just well, Mexican food.

I tried the signature "Sloppi Jo" which is slow roasted prok with red chile sauce, served with fried egg, pickled onions, and flour tortilla.  The pork was tender, but I thought it was too salty, and the flavor was kind of plain and one dimensional.  The pickled onions flavor was really subtle to the point where i thought it was just regular onions, and I didn't think it added to the overall flavor profile of the entire dish.  I do like the fried egg, but I crave the perfect simple fried egg with the runny yolk even when I am full and eating dessert.

While eating the Sloppi Jo, I was told that the Green Chile Stew was the bomb, but it was off the menu because the weather is getting too warm now.  I think if it is back on the menu, that will be the item I will definitely want to try, and maybe get a more positive food truck adventure experience in the process.

The super tall lady who was taking the orders was super nice (I didn't realize she was standing on a plastic crate until I walked by later in the day) and I have to say that it takes a lot of guts to get into the food truck/mobile food service business.  So best of luck with the venture.
