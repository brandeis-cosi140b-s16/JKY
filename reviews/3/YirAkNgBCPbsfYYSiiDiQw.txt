We went here last friday around 10:00pm for dinner and drinks. One of my guy friends suggested this place for their heavily alcoholic beverages. We definitely got the hook up with $3 house margarita coupons and free house margaritas with entree coupons. 

There were seven people in my group. When we got to the restaurant, they told us that it was going to be an hour wait for seven people. No biggie - we took our $3 drink coupons to the bar window that they have for people outside. We ended up waiting less than 30 minutes for a table, sat down, and ordered another round of drinks. 

We ordered food right away. Another round of cheap drinks and our entrees came out right away. The food was ok - as expected for a group oriented restaurant in Vegas. I ordered the steak nachos - nothing special, but the portions could probably feed 3 people. 

The entertainment was, well ... entertaining. There were a bunch of amateur dancers on the bar that kept our dinner conversation interesting. One of the girls apparently was a ballroom dancer during the daytime hours.

In total, we ordered 7 entrees and probably 6 or 7 rounds of drinks. Our dinner total was $180 including tax and tips - not bad at all considering we were full and very intoxicated! All in all, Diablo's is a solid Vegas restaurant.
