I used to eat at this restaurant when it was on Decatur and have always been fond of it.  Now that it's in Sun City Summerlin it's a little pricey for lunch, but the food is good.  The crowd is a lot of seniors so it's not a party place and it's American Mexican food but the food quality, portions, service and drinks are all good.  Friendly ambiance too.
