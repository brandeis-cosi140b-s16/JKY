If you work downtown and need to escape the office for the lunch hour, this is a good option.  

I am generally in and out of here within an hour's time.  The service is predictable and usually good though there are the occasional hiccups.  

The food is pretty standard for your "Americanized" Mexican food.  If you're looking for authentic Mexican food from someone's abuela's kitchen, this is not it.  

The parking can sometimes be problematic, as it's shared with the other business in this strip of shops, and it feels that the spaces are sometimes too narrow to accommodate most SUVs (which is only really an issue if you drive said SUV, like I do).
