The only way I heard about this place was through Groupon. It popped up a few weeks ago and we couldn't resist since it's on our side of town. 

We came here about 10:30 last Saturday and brought my mom along. I was pleasantly surprised that they were open for breakfast. The restaurant is located in Village Square, across from the theater. They were completely empty when we entered the restaurant, but we were greeted warmly and taken to our seats. Our drink orders were taken immediately and then we perused the menu. 

Their chips and salsa were standard and so was their food. I had the carnitas tacos, my fella ordered chicken enchiladas and my mom went with the chilaquilles. The food was just ok. Nothing amazing, but it was standard Mexican fair. It didn't really stand out to me and now that I'm writing my review a week after our meal there I actually had to review the pictures I took to remind me what I ate. 

The restaurant is really pretty and there is plenty of space for bigger parties. They also have $10 all you can eat taco Tuesdays and they also seem to host quite a few sport and happy hour specials, so look out for these. All in all, this place is a nice little spot if you're in the area or have a coupon.
