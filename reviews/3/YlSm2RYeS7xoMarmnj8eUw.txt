Solid restaurant. A gringo wonderland. I have lost my license and needed a dinner spot close enough to my hotel that I wouldn't run the risk of getting pulled over (i'm a hysterical driver...watch out Phoenix) and Ajo Al's reviews were pretty decent so I headed down to get some fish tacos. 

I was scared about anything saying "Del Mar" after my Frank & Lupe's experience but though the Hawaiian Ono in the Tacos del mar ($11.95) was previously frozen, it was an enjoyable experience. I've never had Ono and to me the texture was like that of swordfish, which is just fine for a tiny soft taco. It was a little chewy, but again that's because it's frozen. The beans and rice were okay, and there was some sauce for the tacos that was okay too...not exciting enough for me to remember what the sauce was though, or what it tasted like. 

When seated you will be presented with the world's largest basket of ultra thin tortilla chips you've ever seen, whether you are one person or 6. They were a little greasier than i prefer BUT they were warm and that makes them yummier. 

I don't think I would go back here but I don't regret trying it. It was a good meal and the servers are very friendly and welcoming.
