Yelpers take heart: Texicali has heard our cry, and now serves free salsa and chips with every order.

That said, the food is good. Not rock your socks off good, but good as an alternative to Matties for a daytime lunch when I want to sneak in a drink. Speaking of drinks, the bar is where this place really shines. I'm unfamiliar with fully half of the liquor brands they stock, but each time I've been surprised (pleasantly) by the balance and flavor of the libations, particularly the tequila-based drinks. Friendly service, too.
