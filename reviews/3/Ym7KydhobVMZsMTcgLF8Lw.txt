"Holy cow that was fast!"

That's the typical response of someone who got their dinner here.

They don't mess around.  Even for a group of 4 if you wait 15 minutes for your food, something is seriously wrong.  In the meantime, enjoy some chips and salsa.

As for the food?  It's okay.  It's not anything stellar, but you won't leave disappointed.  It's a good Mexican offering.    

But it's the service that makes this place.  They're fast, they're good, and it's an overall decent establishment.
