Always a fan of this restaurant chain and will continue as a customer. Went to this location at 9:40pm on Jan 3rd for a Chicken Salad and I guess the cashier, Jessica wasn't too pleased to have customers so close to closing. Very unpleasant personality, ... even when we tried being overly friendly ... but everyone else was very nice. Food was great as usual.
