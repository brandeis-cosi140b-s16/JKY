Ok, so I am a Southern Cali native, and I was spoiled with some fantastic burrito shops back home. So when I moved to AZ, I guess I just assumed that a state so close to Mexico ought to have some kick-ass burritos. WRONG! I tried a few places the first year I lived here and I was burned so many times, I just gave up.

So today I got a craving so I searched Yelp for the best rated burrito shop in my local area and I come across this place, "La Salsita". 

So here are my opinions listed in order of appearance, the bad ones first.

1. 311 W. Main St is NOT LA SALSITA. They have moved a few doors up Country Club right next to Taco Bell. And it's called Salsita's. 

2. It's right in front of a Motel 6, and there are a bunch of skeevy people hanging around the area. 

3. It's tiny inside the restaurant. 

4. You should probably be fluent in Spanish to order here.

5. They rung up my order wrong and didn't figure it out until they made the food, and I had to pay additional cash at the end. IMO, they should have eaten the cost, it was their mistake. 

6. There were only 2 people ahead of me, it shouldn't have taken 20 minutes to get my order. 

7. The lady making the burritos was throwing tortillas around on the same counter as the order receipts and people with long necklaces dangling in the food were hanging around the food prep area.

Ok, here's the good stuff. 

1. It's in a convenient area of town.

2. You can watch them make the food right in front of you. 

3. The food was pretty decent. I ordered a carne asada burrito with rice, beans and cheese. Meat was good, not dry and not greasy. They didn't add any junk that I didn't want. I did NOT get peas in my rice as some other poster noted. 

Overall, I would recommend that people go when they're not in a hurry and just take it to go if you can. I would go back when I'm looking for something with a little more substance than Taco Bell.
