I have been to the California Taco Shop twice.  

First time had great fish tacos with their spicy habanero salsa.  The tacos were great (breaded fish).  The total bill with rice, beans, and drink was $12 - a bit much for lunch.  

Second time had the carne asada plate.  The meat was not seasoned, the salsa bar was missing, and the beans were barely warm.  Not a very good second visit.
