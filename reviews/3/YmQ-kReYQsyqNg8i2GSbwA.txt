Hello... The Taste is fabulous as close as to my gmas home cooking as it gets. It's normally 1 server 1 cook but I think they should invest a little more into their staff I'm sure the customers would appreciate it and that delicious food would just keep on yielding profits!! Great food but I gave it a 3 cuz that poor girl works her butt off and it's not fair.
