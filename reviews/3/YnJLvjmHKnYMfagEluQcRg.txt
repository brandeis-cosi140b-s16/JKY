Great spot for lunch...Nothing too fancy, but for the price it's a decent meal.  I had the pizza today with queso for the base and lots of cilantro, red onions and cheese...very good choice and a full serving for lunchtime!  Chipas and queso seemed to be pretty popular around us and service was good for an order at the counter kind of place.  Great go to for a quick bite...check it out if you are close by!
