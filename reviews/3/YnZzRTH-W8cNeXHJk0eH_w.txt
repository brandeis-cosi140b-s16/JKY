Good food, fun atmosphere though the service was slow at best. Guacamole had a touch too much lime, but that is not unusual with pre-made. 

My boyfriend had the fajita combo (shrimp and steak) save the dollar and get the shrimp. I had the 4 cheese enchilada, which could have been warmer,  but they were understaffed that day. 

All in all, we would come back for lunch again, the free margarita was enticement enough. It would be nice to have the margarita in a glass, but this is Vegas and you gotta walk and drink!
