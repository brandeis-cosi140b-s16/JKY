The lunch special was a great deal when it was 4.99.  Unfortunately it went up one dollar.  The chicken and pork is hit or miss...some days it's great, but others it seems undercooked and strange tasting in the case of the chicken, or too fatty in the case of the pork.

The salsa is excellent.  You can also get a baked potato with your lunch, which is a nice change.  

The other meats are pretty good, but more expensive.
