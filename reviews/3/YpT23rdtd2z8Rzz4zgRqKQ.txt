The Burritos are really what you want to get here. They are top notch, incredibly delicious, especially the Surf & Turf which has shrimp, a white sauce and steak. 

They USED to have very good prices, 5 bucks got you the burrito a-la-carte but now it's $7.95. Most of the people who work here are very friendly but there was one girl who worked here for awhile who definitely was not. She gave me the wrong change one time and when I asked for the correct change she threw a fit and literally tossed my coins at me. After that each time I would go in she'd give me a strange attitude, including one time when I was watching something on the TV (I was the only one in there) and she purposely changed the channel then looked at me and smirked. Not cool!

I've been to the one in Scottsdale, it's MUCH better in my opinion. Either way, I can't deny how delicious their food is...
