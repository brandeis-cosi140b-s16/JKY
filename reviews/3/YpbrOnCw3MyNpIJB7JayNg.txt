My old friends always seemed to love going here. I never went with them though.
Finally tried it, it's just typical Mexican to me. 
The service is always friendly and attentive but LOL@how the waiters are dressed. I feel sorry for them. Also, the decor of the place is really odd. It has a painted sky on the ceiling as if it's trying to mock the Venetian or something. 
It's a shame I wasn't impressed, it's supposedly a Vegas classic that even my aunt used to eat at back when she first moved here in the 80's, could it be because it has so many locations now?
I still would go back just to try that Toasted Cheese Tortilla everyone raves about though.
