5 stars on iced tea
4 stars on bean dip and beans
4 stars on the salsas both are pretty good
3 stars on chips, they are cold
2 stars on taco , pretty basic and $8
2 stars on tamale , ok taste but only a very small amount of meat and a lot of masa 
Didn't like the rice but I'm not much of a rice person anyway so idk how to rate it

Ambiance is nice , service is okay , prices are high
