We could not determine where best to park or even if the restaurant was open so we entered via the adjoining/connecting Chi'Chica'Ron Sports Bar.  The restaurant was not busy on the Sunday afternoon of our visit, but we did witness a few people coming in for takeout orders.  After reviewing the menu, we placed an order for (1) chicken and (3) al pastor street tacos at the counter.  Taco chips and 2 fiery salsas were brought to our table while we waited. The tacos came with lettuce, guacamole, salsa, and cilantro.  These were pretty good, but with several more conveniently located restaurants serving better fare, this will likely be our last visit.
