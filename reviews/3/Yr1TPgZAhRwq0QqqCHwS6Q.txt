As we're part of the 'hood, La Fonda has been a frequent stop over the years. Sometimes the food is great, sometimes it is a bit below average. The chips and salsa are consistantly awesome. Margaritas are cheap and are good, not great. Never had bad service here. Overall a good value when you are hungry and thirsty, but I'd stop elsewhere when in a gourmet mood.
