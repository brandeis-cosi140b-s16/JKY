First of all, they were really close to getting a  fourth star from me but I just couldn't do it. The tacos were delicious, but I'm an atmosphere and experience person and those just did not deliver for me. 

Food: I got the Gran Tacos with no meat. Vegetarian options here are great (soyrizo, saut√©ed mushrooms), but I wasn't feeling super adventurous at the time. The salsa was my favorite. Not too spicy, but super flavorful. I also had black beans, cheese, and guacamole on mine, and they really were excellent. They melt the cheese right on the tortilla, and then you can get more on top. My friend got the Mexican street style corn on the cob, which was amazing. Definitely will go back for that alone.

Atmosphere: I feel like the layout is all wrong, almost backwards or something. They explain to you the different lines that are available for different items that you order, but the area isn't big enough and the lines sort of all run together, and I witnessed multiple people think they were being cut in line, and wonder what the hell was going on. Not to mention the burrito/bowl/fries line runs the other way, right into the street taco line.. Not laid out very well at all. The topping bar is also kind of in the way of these lines. Not sure how that will work during a big lunch rush...

If customers can get past the clusterfuck of a layout, taco y taco will be successful. But if customers get frustrated/confused like we were today, they could easily walk out and go to any other restaurant in the plaza. I know it's a brand new place so maybe they are still just working out the kinks! (I hope!)
