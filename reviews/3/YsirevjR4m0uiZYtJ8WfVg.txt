In a little mall right on the strip.  The food was good, a small step up from Chipotle. They had a large selection of meats and toppings for taco.  Nothing was very fresh except the tortillas because it is all sitting there.  Since there was not a lot of people,there's not a lot of turnover.  The rice was hard and some of the meats had dried out a little.

The service however was not great.  The staff was not particularly friendly and was really slow considering we were the only ones ordering.  They were not particularly friendly or helpful.  They did however accept the yelp deal I bought  with no issues.

If you want a cheap meal on the strip, it might do the trick but otherwise skip it.
