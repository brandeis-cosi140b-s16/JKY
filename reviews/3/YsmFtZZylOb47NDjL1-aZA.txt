Depends what you are in the mood for, but for $3-5 for a good sized carne asada or breakfast burrito, it's hard to beat. This is by no means 'traditional' Mexican food though. It is good. It is 24hr. It's not going to win any authentic or best of XYZ awards, but if your looking for a burrito fix, hangover remedy, or just something cheap - this is your place.
