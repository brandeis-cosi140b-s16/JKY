Your friendly neighborhood Taco Bell. It's about what you'd expect. That is to say, it tastes like all other Taco Bells. If you have orders, they will get it wrong about 1 in 5 times. I used to live right by here, and it seemed like they could never anticipate how much Baja Blast they would sell because they'd be out about 10%+ of the time, which is a REAL bummer. They lose a star for that (on top of the star they lose for all the wrong orders). I rarely got stuck in the drive through here, but it happens occasionally. Mostly though, it's a shorter drive through, which ends up being to your advantage. I wouldn't bother going inside if you have the option.
