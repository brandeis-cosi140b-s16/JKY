VEGANS Beware !! All the beans have cheese at his location only !! We love the other 2 locations in Vegas but went to this one tonight & were told all beans have cheese mixed in. Never been to a restaurant that didn't allow you to say no to cheese. 

They made our 2 daughters avocado & Rice burritos no xtra charge. Everything else was good - what we've come to expect from our favorite mexican restaurant in LV. They offer Veggie fajitas, enchiladas & Avocado tacos with cabbage (ask for no mayo to be added) so we like it here but won't return to this location.
