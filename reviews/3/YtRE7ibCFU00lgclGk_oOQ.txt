Had a standard burger w roasted jalape√±os, fries, chicken and short rib tacos - not all for myself... We were sharing. :)

Food wasn't too bad, but the place is a bit overrated in my opinion. I really liked their simple menu and friendly staff. However, their items were not worth four stars. Their burger was very mild - meaning no flavor.   Not sure which part of the beef that they use but I can tell that they are using quality beef but it lacks flavor. Fries were super soggy but tasted pretty good. I did like their sauce though. Tacos were pleasant but not something that I would crave for or want to go back for.  Overall, it was just OK for me.
