I was craving Mexican food.  Plain old delicious, refried-beany, flavorful, familiar Mexican food.  I wanted to go to Dos, but my boyfriend wanted to go to Chevy's.  In the end, I finally caved and made my first visit to the latter.

The chips and salsa were great (we ended up eating two baskets worth).  I ordered the flautas, my usual.  I was wary when I read that they came drizzled with mango habanero salsa and jalape√±o jelly.  What the fuck?  I ordered flautas, not a bloody fruit salad.  I wanted sour cream!  Guac!  Pico de gallo and shredded lettuce!  I struggled to put my biases aside, but sure enough, I found the salsa and jelly too sweet for my taste - the whole thing really could have used some more spice.  And the tortillas the flautas were wrapped in were strangely flakey; Gavin D. aptly describes it as a "Mexican egg roll," which was good, but not really what I wanted.

Let me put it this way: let's say you're craving Kraft Mac 'n Cheese.  CRAVING it.  You NEED it.  And then you go to your friend's house and your friend's mom promises you a delicious mac 'n cheese dinner, so you get all excited.  When you sit down to the table, you are dismayed to find that this isn't regular mac 'n cheese at all: it's some scary brand and she's added capers and sauteed mushrooms and parsley in an attempt to fancy it up.  I mean, sure, it's okay, but ALL YOU WANTED WAS KRAFT.

Three stars, though, because the service was friendly and fast, the chips and salsa were a win, and the sweet corn tamalito that came with my meal was great.
