I had my heart set on Los Dos Adovada Ribs and Garlic Pork Platter. Until someone told me this little place in Awhatukee was even better than LDM. Even better than LDM? That I had to try.

Long story short; not nearly as good as Los Dos Molinos. Not by a long shot. Yes, LDM has bad service. I dont go their for the service I go for the best food in town. This place had great service and a very nice ambiance. It was dominated by the bar, which made for a festive environment. The drinks were tasty and strong. Overall 4 starts for service and ambiance

The wings someone ordered for the table were fantastic. Actually quite possibly the best wings I have every had. Unfortunately they were the highlight of the meal. The salsa was bland and mild. My adovada pork, which was supposed to have the hottest sauce available on it, tasted more like catsup.  The meat was so overwhelmingly smoky that I thought someone must have accidentally poured liquid smoke all over my plate, until everyone else at the table said the exact same thing. 2 stars for food.

Overall, if I want a drink and an appetizer in a fun environment, I will consider Secreto's if I am in the area. If I want Mexican food, I will put up with the bad service at my beloved LDM every single time.
