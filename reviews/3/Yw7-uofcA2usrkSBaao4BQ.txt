Lupitas moved to this new location and it is A LOT smaller than the old place. Its in the same location as Castillo's was located before it closed. The difficult part about this location is that it is oddly designed. The restaurant is all booths, one right after another in two rows. There are no tables...just booths. And if you need a high chair, it makes it difficult to get around them because of the layout of the room. 

The decor is more subtle than the previous location. There are a few pictures up on the wall and the painted mural from Castillo's tenure is still on the wall. Because of the layout of the room, the decor is low-key and very understated.

The food is good although nothing terribly special. The chips are fresh and hot. The salsa is chunky and flavorful. I wish they had seafood on the menu. All they offer are beef and chicken items so that kind of limits the selections. Mexican food is all pretty similar in its ingredients--all contain meat, cheese, lettuce, sour cream, and have some sort of vessel containing it all. There is nothing unique to Lupitas that you can't get at any other Mexican restaurant. But it's good tasting food, served hot, with a friendly staff at a good price. It's worth a visit.
