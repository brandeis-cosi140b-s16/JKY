To be honest, I have not tried a lot of items at Someburros but what I have tried would not bring me back for more. 

On my last visit I had asked the cashier what he would recommend on the menu. He gave me a few of his favorites and I decided to go with the machaca shredded beef burro with red sauce. We also got chips and salsa with our order. When the burrito came out it was hot and when I cut into it, it shot out piping hot liquid right on my lap. Not necessarily the burritos fault but still not a good start. The burrito itself was a salt disaster. The amount of salt in burrito tasted as though they went over to the pacific ocean, dipped it in a few times and let it dry. The salt lick burrito is what it should be called. I know that sounds harsh but it is an accurate description, at least on this visit.

The good thing is that the manager did replace it with a bean and cheese burrito. It was okay. I would not come back for it. The service was good so they do deserve credit for that.

Mostly I just feel like things are prepared before hand, frozen and then reheated. I'm sure that is the case in many restaurants like this but unfortunately Someburros just does not do well. I might be back to try other items and to give them another shot. But for now, I'm just not feeling it.
