I don't know what it is about Chipotle I've just never liked it.  The food is good, average to me.  The staff is always friendly which is always a plus.  I don't know if its the decor and/or food.  

Who picked the most uncomfortable seating?  And it's in every location.  

I really have nothing further to add.
