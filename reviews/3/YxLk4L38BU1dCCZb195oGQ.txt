I am not a hipster... or a fan of the mod style so I didn't really like the ambiance here as much as some of the other reviewers.  They have a nice patio, though. The food was pretty good, too.  As others have remarked, it is not exactly traditional Mexican but I don't mind places that put their own spin on things. I had the Pozole which was very tasty.  My hubby and I often debate with family and friends from Mexico as to whether Pozole broth should be red or clear - everyone seems to have their own opinion of which way is right.  I was happy that at Gallo Blanco they had a clear broth but served it with a chile paste that you could add to your taste and so make it as red as you want.  Our Queso Fundido appetizer (with chorizo) was just as tasty and the special key lime dessert was d-lish as well.

The biggest disappointment was the menu.  I was surprised at how limited it was.  I would not recommend this place for dinner.  But I am sure the tacos would be great for happy hour.  And I would love to come for brunch to try some of the breakfast items.  I noticed they had Micheladas on the drink menu and so that would work nicely for either occassion.  So, three stars for now but it may increase in the future after subsequent visits.
