I had passed this restaurant dozens of time without knowing what magic was behind the plain building. I was very pleasantly surprised upon walking in at around 9pm on a Friday night to see ducks and turtles swimming around. The tables outside were filled with lovers, adding to the romantic ambiance of El Encanto. There was a older gentleman singing Spanish love songs while playing the guitar. It was like another world from the street that we entered from; it almost felt like a secret club for some reason. And I was happy to have found it.

Anyway, on to the food. I shared the pollo fundido with my other half. I wasn't TOO impressed, because I still think X Tapa Joe's has the best Pollo Fundido in town, but the yellow rice that accompanied the dish was superb. Usually, I am disappointed at the dry and bland Mexican rice that comes with entrees. Not here. It tasted like the yellow rice that I make, which is moist and rich in flavor. The margaritas were a bit too sweet but still okay. Overall, I thought it was a great place for a date night as it seeped with romance. I would love to try another dish sometime to give them a higher rating, but so far, the 3 stars I gave it seems right on point.
