lol, i say this in every review, but i will have to do an update! 

we came here to celebrate taco tuesday and $1 tacos. To be honest, we waited a little for our server to come.. like a good 15 minutes. Luckily, bobby tracked someone down and the server mentioned there was a new person that night. Three different employees came over to apologize so that was very sweet of them.

Bobby and i both ordered tacos.. the $1 tacos on tuesday and thursday only come in beef... but you do get to choose a hard or soft taco unlike other reviews/tips stated. We enjoyed the free chips and salsa and bobby ordered a margarita. Loved their salsa. Not too spicy but not mild what so ever.

We filled up on the chips and when the taco arrived i kind of felt full. To be honest, I havent really had an appetite since losing my dog. I'll eat lunch then not eat again till lunch the next day just from the stress and heartache i've been dealing with. I literally ate half of one taco then gave bobby the rest. I do have to note that i asked for no tomatoes twice (just to be sure) during ordering  and still received tomatoes on all of my tacos -_-

Even though we were only there for taco tuesday, i checked out their menu. It seems like they have great options and great prices. I'm excited to head back very soon and check out some other menu items. I've tried both Emilano's and Steel Cactus in South Side and was underwhelmed at both, so I really hope this mexican spot is the winner... especially because i live a 5 minute walk away from here! 

i will update after my next visit and trying other items from their menu! :)
