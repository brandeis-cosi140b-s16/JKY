Today was our first time at Cafe Casera and everyone was very friendly and welcoming. I think there's a lot of potential, but there are a few things to iron out.

We really like supporting mom & pop type restaurants and have been to Albuquerque on many occasions, so we're very familiar with New Mexican cuisine.

We started off with chips & salsa, which had good flavor, but was a bit on the mild side for us. $3.25 for chips & salsa is a bit on the steep side as well considering the vast majority of restaurants offer them complimentary.

We had the CC Sizzle sopapilla which was a little disappointing. The sopapilla was very dense and a lot more like Navajo fry bread than a light, fluffy and airy pillow of love that we've come to expect from a good sopapilla. Also, I was expecting a stuffed sopapilla, rather than it being folded taco style, with very little meat.

The CC Sizzle meat was quite good and we really liked the flavors. However, for $8 I think it was really lacking in the quantity department and was pretty skinny for my liking. Look at my pictures, there is a little bit of meat below all that cabbage. We had them add Hatch green chiles, add $1, and would've liked a few more of those as well. The rice & beans were pretty standard fair.

Worth going to? Yes, but I definitely think there is some room for improvement.
