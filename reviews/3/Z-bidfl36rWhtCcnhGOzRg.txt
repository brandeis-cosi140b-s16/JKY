Came here for lunch with some coworkers.  The place was pretty packed - we waited about 20 minutes for our food to finally come out.  The food was pretty decent.  I had the chicken fajita and it was very tasty and made me very full.  I'll try the nachos next time as my coworker had it and it looked fantastic!
