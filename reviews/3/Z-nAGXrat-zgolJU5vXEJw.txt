This place reminds me of the Mexican pavillion at Epcot, a little.
As in overdone, but awesome. Hello, 2 story waterfall. The menu is exactly the same as Azteca's, so that's a plus, since Azteca is decent, veg-friendly tex-mex. Pretty sure they're all part of the same local chain. Service is always over the top terrific and we end up leaving a 40% tip often since the bill is always so low - the most expensive thing I've ever ordered here was 9.50.

Chips are good and plentiful. Nothing here is blow you away, but most of it is passable, sometimes even good. Don't order the huevos rancheros - probably the least impressive thing on the menu. 

My favs, at both Pedro's and Azteca, are the Enchiladas de Espinaca - rice, beans, and fresh spinach-stuffed flour tortillas smothered in queso sauce. Yeah, there's veggies in there, but this is heart attack land.

Another fav - machos burrito. I guess eating cactus puts hair on your chest. Its a pickle burrito. It is awesome. Have them add some fresh jalapenos for a kick. Its as big as your head, so you'll take some home - fry an egg, stick it on top, you got yourself 3 dollar brekkie.

And hey, since Skandalos is right next store, you could stuff your face AND see mexican heavy metal, all in one night. Hell yeah.
