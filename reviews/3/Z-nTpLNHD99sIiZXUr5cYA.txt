When it comes to fast-casual burritos, I really prefer Chipolte, but given that Qdoba is much closer, I go there more often. I do really like their poblano chicken burrito with cilantro-lime rice.  When I have stopped into this location, it is not too crowded so service is generally pretty fast here and you have plenty of options for seating.
