I waiver between 3 and 4 stars. While I know others who have grabbed eats from here regularly, thus far, I have only ordered from here once. And therefore, this review is based solely on my one experience.

After hearing about the Nate Dog, it clearly became what I was jonesing for. As a side, I opted for the sweet dough.

The hot dog was good, it just wasn't great. It's skinny and the toppings are far from plentiful. But the flavor is there and it's cooked well. I think if it had a better quality bun, I would have enjoyed it more.

The sweet dough was yummy, but nothing that left me craving for more. It was just average.

I am anxious to try out the tacos and fries, though, so I will definitely be back. And everything else about the experience was great. 

What is really nice is the pricing. The pricing definitely makes me lean more to 4 stars. There's really nothing overpriced about this place, and that's a nice change of pace.
