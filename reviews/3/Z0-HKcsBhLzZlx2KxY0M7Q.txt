Yelptariat wins again--3.5 stars. What place doesn't split checks even at the bar? That's absurd. If I walked up to a bar and struck up a conversation with somebody, would my drink be added to their tab automatically? Major dislike points for this policy. 

I'll spare the ad nauseam of every last detail, but I had a lunch here for 7 people. For $16, my enchiladas were okay, but not the most fantastic. Everyone else seemed just "whelmed" by their meal as well. Service on the slow side as well. 

I would definitely come back to the bar (alone, obviously, or with cash because of their stupid no check splitting policy) for the excellent margaritas. I had the pineapple and the Javier--both were excellent. My friend had jalapeno--also excellent. 

The ambiance is great, but with all the other details lacking, it would be hard for me to patronize this place again for a meal.
