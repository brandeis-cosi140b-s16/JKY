Went in on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't crowded. The waitress was friendly and quickly brought us our drinks. They give you bean dip (refried beans w/japs in it?) and salsa. The bean dip is something I've never seen given at Mexican restaurants, so it was a nice touch. 

I got the fajita salad; it was fine.  My boyfriend got the pollos funditos, which he also thought was fine. Nothing was spectacular, but it wasn't bad.  I'd go back. It's your typical Mexican restaurants. The place was clean and the waitstaff was friendly.
