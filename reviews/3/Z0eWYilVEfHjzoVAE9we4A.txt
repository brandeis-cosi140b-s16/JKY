I really wanted to like this place but was sadly disappointed.  I ordered a chicken taco and side of rice.  I asked for cheese between the tortillas but the cook was taking s much, he didn't listen to my request.  I had to scrape the chicken out as it was over cooked, dry and chewy.  Store bought tortillas.  The rice was moist but lacked any flavor.  I tried to put done red sauce on it and it made it worse. Red sauce has no kick and tastes like watered down tomato soup,   Hubby on the other hand liked the carnitas burrito but wished there was a decent salsa to add to it.
