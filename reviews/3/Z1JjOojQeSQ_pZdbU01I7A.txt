I guess no place can get it 100%. It is crowded and we've always had to wait. No big deal for the right place. We like the patio though the fake grass wall is weird. Like many others I suppose, we have a favorite place for one dish and another place for another dish. We've only been there twice, each time we were a party of four so we tried several different dishes. Their cheese crisp is standard (not as good as Los Compadres if you like a really crispy tortilla which we do), tacos were just okay, the enchiladas were a bit better, the salsa was ordinary, beans seemed canned and the tamales were downright boring. The best dishes we had were the Pollo Azteca and the Pork Carnitas. We'll probably go back occassionally for those since they are walking distance from our house but when we want really good Mexican food, this is not our place.
