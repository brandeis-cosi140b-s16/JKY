I LOVE Mexican food, so even average food will probably garner 3-stars from me.  I would say this is pretty average.  Everything was good, nothing was disappointing (except maybe the tortillas), but nothing was crazy good either.

I will say that while the prices are "affordable", I wouldn't call it cheap.  This type of food is not expensive to make nor difficult to prepare, so I think $4.20 for a single taco, for example, is too high.  Combinations run about 10 bucks, specialty dishes $12-$15.  Expect to pay about $8 at lunch.

Overall, not a bad place to go.  I will most likely return if in the neighborhood.
