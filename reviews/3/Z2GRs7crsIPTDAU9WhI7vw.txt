Inconsistent. I may sound sexist, but I've only gotten good food and service here when the middle aged man was working. When he's on, the food is perfectly cooked, the sauce is thick , the salsa is thick, and you'll actually get a refill if needed. Otherwise, expect poor service, bad, overcooked food and a lack of over all consistency.

My chicken quesadilla was awesome when the guy made it, had sauce and a nice whipped sour cream, otherwise it's a bland tortilla with salsa on the side.
