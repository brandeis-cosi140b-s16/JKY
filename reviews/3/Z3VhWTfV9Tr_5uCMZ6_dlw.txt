First visit: Chicken chimi & rolled tacos. OK. Place is clean, new, and staff very nice. Place quick...not fast food quality...better than a taco bell but little bland, salsa OK and not many options. Chimichanga good but rolled tacos had little meat. Beans excellent but could use some seasoning. Rice boring. Needs spice. Maybe I will come back but chili verde express is way better.

Second visit: Carne burrito/carne taco/carnita taco. Flavor better than chicken. Add fresh lime..much better. Still clean, fast, and OK in a pinch.
