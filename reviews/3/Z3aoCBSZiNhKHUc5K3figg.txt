Judging from the line of white shirts and SUV's you typically see at Cafe Rio and Mattas this place has definitely earned a following. The setting in the Orange grove was really nice and I kept hearing about their great brisket and burritos so I ordered a brisket sandwich and a red chile burrito. I can't think of a reason of why this place has such great reviews. My red chile burro had good flavor at first but about half way in I found a large portion of unmelted cheese that when I opened the burrito looked and tasted like it came from costco.  As for the brisket, it looked great when I opened it up. Nice smoke ring to the meat but unfortunately it just tasted like liquid smoke.  The lady at the register said I'd love the coleslaw on top for an additional dollar but I it didn't add to the sandwich at all and I love slaw on top of my BBQ normally. Its obvious that the people that think this is good brisket have never had BBQ outside of AZ. The place is a bit overpriced and if you didn't live in AZ you could probably justify paying their prices because it's still better Mexican fare than you find outside our state. But This is AZ! You can get a red chile burrito without the unmelted costco cheese for half the price and all of the flavor almost anywhere in town, or at least a side or two thrown in for your $8.50 1/4 pound sandwich. This joint does have one thing going for it though and it's their Mexican Red Hot sauce. It's awesome!  I won't be going back for any of the food but I'd definitely swing by for a pint of the sauce.
