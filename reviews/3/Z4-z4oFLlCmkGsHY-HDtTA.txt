I did not feel like eating Mc D's with the Family so I stopped here to get my fix of Mexican. It did that. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about either. 

I had the carne asada burrito. I loved the salsa bar, I was able to try 4 different  kinds.

As food courts go, its run of the mill.
