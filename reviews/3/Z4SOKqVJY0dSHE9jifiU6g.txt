Who doesn't love Don Pedro??  Owned by the same owners as Azteca - this is a good go-to Mexican joint.  They can accommodate big parties or they have nice cozy booths for a smaller get-together.  LOVE Dos Equis - but geez why don't they have it on draft??  

The table-side guac is always a must.  It is kinda strange to of tip a guy for making guac at your table when you are also paying for it BUT it is made to order.  He will make positively sure you like it before he rolls his lil cart away.

The chips and two kinds of salsa are usually there before you even see your waitress!  The workers here are very attentive and fast.

So the food?  It is just fine.  I have had the salads and flautas and fajitas.  All YUM.  My favorite part of the meal is the little dessert that comes with the check.   Even more so because the boyfriend hates them - MORE FOR ME!!!  It is usually two thin crispy deep-fried flour wedges with both a sugar sauce and a strawberry sauce.  YUM!!!!
