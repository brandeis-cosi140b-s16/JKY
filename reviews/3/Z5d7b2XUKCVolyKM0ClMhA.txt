We drive down to C.G. twice a month for business, and always stop at Ochoa's. Old school all the way, but the food is always tasty, and consistent.  The tamales are fantastic. Home made and definitely a favorite.  The chip bowl is too small, and the dip is hot sauce - no salsa.  But the hot sauce is very good and spicy...  The cheese crisp is a folded soft one.   I wish it was crispy.  Always good service.
