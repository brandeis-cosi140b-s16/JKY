I haven't been to Ztejas in quite some time as I used to work here like 15 years ago. My wife was shopping at the mall so I thought I would grab my iPad catch up on the news and have a Margarita. Bellied up to the bar and was greeted by a friendly and smiling bartender asking what I would like. Ordered my favorite from years ago which is the Patron fruit infused frozen margarita. It never used to disappoint still doesn't - great drink.

We were supposed to go to four peaks brewery for lunch but my shopaholic wife was gone too long so we decided to have a bite to eat here. Chips and salsa are really good. The chips are always hot and fresh here and they taste like it. It used to just come with a cup of chipotle salsa if I recall correctly but now comes out with a trio of salsa - habanero, Verde, picante. Good stuff. Whitehead the beef street tacos in any one of them and they were superb. My favorite appetizer here has always been the catfish beignets. I was really disappointed with these as they used to be served crisp and crunchy and these were served moist and almost to the point of sogginess. I literally picked one up and it broke in half by itself it was so flimsy. That was disappointing. I probably would've given four stars but because I know that was a really poor execution it went down to three. Restrooms needed to be attended to as well. Lastly, seriously ... No Wi-Fi?!?! There's a mall connection but it was weak and up having to tether to my cell phone. 2014 and in Scottsdale and no Wi-Fi just seems odd to me.
