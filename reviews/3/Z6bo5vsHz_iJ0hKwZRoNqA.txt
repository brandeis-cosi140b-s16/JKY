I'd love to give this place more stars and I think they could get there with a few fixes. My family decided to try this place a couple of weeks ago on a Friday, even with the lower scores - some are dead on especially those who mentioned the wait time. We were seated within 15 minutes, place our order 20 minutes later, then waited another 45 minutes for our food. If we were there just for drinks and chips it would have been fine, because the atmosphere is fun and the mariachi singers were excellent - but we were starving. Food was good and plentiful. My husband had steak fajitas which were so-so, my chili relleno was great and the rest of our party enjoyed their enchilades. Our main issue was the wait. Our server was fine, but we waited for everything including drinks, napkins and silverware. Great place if you are looking for a place to hang out - but don't arrive hungry. Overall the kitchen really needs to pick up the pace!
