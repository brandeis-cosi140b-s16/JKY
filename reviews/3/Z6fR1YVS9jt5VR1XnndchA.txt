Super B Burrito arrives to the Las Vegas Strip, south end!

Located in a somewhat hidden location at the intersection of East Wyoming Ave and South Las Vegas Boulevard, behind the corner ARCO gas station, Super B Burrito is now open for business to feed the hungry masses large quantities of Mexican specialties in Super B style.

Menu items include favorites such as burritos, tacos, salads and the like.  I sampled the breakfast burrito, a simple creation with eggs, bacon and other filling items in addition to a couple of Mexican style street tacos.  Unfortunately, no lime was provided and the tacos were a bit flat.  Overall, the food items ordered were somewhat average in flavor but the quality of the ingredients would make me consider a return visit.
