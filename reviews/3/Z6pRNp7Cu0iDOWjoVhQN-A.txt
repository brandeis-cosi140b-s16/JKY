The best attribute to this place is the patio.  There's a great fire pit in back with couches.  The music is good. 

I like it.  I've only been after 10 so keep that in mind.  This place is always packed on the weekends when school is in session... beware.... a lot of kids are in adult baby mode after midnight.  I remember my first beer.

The bartenders aren't super attentive.  I usually just stick with beer but I've heard some good things about the margaritas.  Then again, can you mess up a margarita at a tequila bar?  Their house shot is pretty tasty as well.

The dance floor gets packed.  Not exactly Tempe's finest either but it's fun to watch.  Go to the bathroom before hand though... the women's restroom is impossible to reach when it's crowded.

Stick to the patio.
