This place is clean and nice, a typical walk in and order experience.

Chipotle food is good, however I prefer costa vida or cafe rio...unfortunately they are in Mesa and Tempe and haven't come out to these neck of the woods yet. The food is just drier here in my opinion.

One AWESOME thing about this place though is that it is free to order a side warm burrito...technically you can get as many as you like (but don't be that guy). Seriously, kudos to them for providing this, it makes me much more willing to keep going back.
