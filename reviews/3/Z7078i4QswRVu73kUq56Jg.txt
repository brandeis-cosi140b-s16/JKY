It was a gorgeous 70 degrees in Vegas yesterday.  Today it was about 50 degrees. The only thing colder was our food.  

This was our first time visiting this small local Las Vegas chain of "quick service" Mexican food restaurants.  After a long morning of braving the cold hiking Red Rock (yes, I'm well aware that it is below zero in Wisconsin ... which is why I don't live there, but that's another story), we were looking forward to warming up with some lunch.   

The food choices at "Downtown Summerlin" are rather sparse, and Zaba's won out over Italian.  

I ordered the chicken bowl, she had the veggie burrito.   OK, so I'm exaggerating a little when I write that the food was below 50 degrees ... more accurately it was luke warm at best.  Having noticed that the cheese hadn't melted as we paid the cashier, we inquired if the food could be warmed up; a direct "no" was the response.  Alrighty then; at least we knew where we stood on that topic.  

Aside from that, it was your average QSR Mexican food.  The food was tasty enough - nothing special, but nothing horrible.  While they served beer, which was a nice touch, it was disappointing that they didn't have a place to recycle the bottles. The restaurant was quite clean, and the staff (although not very helpful) was friendly.   

In short, if you're starving, it'll fill you up.  But hopefully as more restaurants open at "Downtown Summerlin", there'll be better options.
