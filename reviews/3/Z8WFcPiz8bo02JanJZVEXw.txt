Drove all the way from the NW at the recommendation of a friend. Maybe the only Roberto's in town that has Carne Asada Onion Rings. Someone needs to tell the owners they should have that at ALL locations so I dont have to drive so far next time. Came around 3 in the afternoon on Monday and the placed was packed with kids so I ended up taking order to go. Other than that, same great late night eats as other locations!
