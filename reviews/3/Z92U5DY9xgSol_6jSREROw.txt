I still have fond memories of El Pollo Loco when they introduced their spicy orange Fuego sauce. It was so good, I could've poured it on a flip-flop and eaten it. Sadly, the Fuego sauce is no longer to be found. And I was hugely disappointed in the quality of the condiments available in the salsa bar.  Upon my most recent visit to this particular restaurant, I found the salsas to be watery and flavorless. I had stopped in to try their new fish tacos and was disappointed. Not only were the fish tacos unappealing and tasteless, but the equally unappetizing salsa couldn't do anything to improve the flavor.

I also ordered a individual piece of chicken and found it to be as I remembered... delicious! So I don't know what is going on with El Pollo Loco's menu nowadays, but they can still do their chicken right. I am once-bitten, twice-shy about coming back here, but if I do, I will stick to the chicken.
