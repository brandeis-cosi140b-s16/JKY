I postponed writing my review of Tortas Paquime I July since it was my first visit and our experience was 2.5 stars.  Today's visit brought them up to a 3 star rating. 

The Good ~ They use very fresh ingredients, their tortas and variety of postres are very good.  They offer a soup of the day.  The service is friendly and they are fairly quick to make your order.  Their prices are very reasonable and cheaper than most other places that offer the same menu options.  

The not so Good ~ Their Aguas Frescas are not made fresh to order and tasted very watered down.  The tortas are very good however their Tacos Volteados was more of a melted cheesy tacos than a shredded pork tacos.  They were also a too greasy.  

The Bad ~ We had to sit on the side of the restaurant that has the TV and it was too loud.  It was playing some kind of Mexican comedy that was not appropriate for the children to watch that were dinning at the time.  It was also very hot in in the restaurant.  I will blame that on the Arizona heat.
