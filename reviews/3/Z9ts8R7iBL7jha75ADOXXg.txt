Tuesday is Taco special day. The price is 1.29 dollar per taco, which is really inexpensive. But the taco is really small and the worst of all, it is cold. 
Which I didn't expect is that even I bought tacos with super low prices they still offer free drink if you can show a valid student ID card. 
But I have to mention that the tacos on Atwood street are way more better. I'd rather get cash from the nearest ATM and walk there.
