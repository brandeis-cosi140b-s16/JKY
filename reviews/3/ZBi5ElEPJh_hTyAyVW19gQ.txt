I actually really loved the margaritas and beef enchiladas here.  The margs were unique and had a kick and the enchiladas were actually incredibly flavorful and had some spice without being hot.  

What I didn't like about T&T was the atmosphere.  It sits in the dungeon that is Luxor. Its dark, really dark.  Plus since it is open air so it lets in all the noises from outside.  

Its a restaurant ont he strip so expect small portions with a big price tag, but it is tasty!
