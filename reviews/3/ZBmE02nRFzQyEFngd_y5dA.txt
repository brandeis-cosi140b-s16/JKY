My boyfriend and I had El Fish Taco bookmarked since we saw all of its great reviews and for our love of tacos. We were excited when we finally came in. We were expecting the typical taqueria, but it's actually a casual sit-down restaurant. Once you walk in, they allow you to select your own seating, then they come to you with the menus. Woah, the menu is priceeeyyy! The tacos are $3+ EACH omg. lol I mean, they do have some interesting/bizzare tacos you wont find really anywhere else, but its still pretty pricey. I opted for the Surf & Turf Taco, and since many people on Yelp enjoy their "Costras" I also ordered the Al Pastor Shrimp Costra. What's a Costra? It's like a melted grilled cheese taco with your choice of meat. It was decent. The two didn't fill me up so I also ordered the Fish & Chips Taco. (I ordered tacos I thought were interesting). My boyfriend got the Chipotle Shrimp Burrito. Everything tasted good, but they definitely are not worth the price.. Tbh, I would rather opt for a cheaper joint with good tacos.. if they drop their prices to typical prices, we may come back, but we both agreed its just too much for okay food
