Pretty good. I would prefer to give it 3.5 stars though. I've been here enough to know that I like it overall. The tacos are fine, nothing special, but then again I wasn't expecting anything special. The drinks are of average price and decently strong. I've only been here on Fridays and Saturdays, both nights the DJ tends to spin pretty good music. It's VERY crowded during peak hours and the line can get somewhat long. More than once I've been overlooked at the bar and that's annoying. The bartenders do seem to be doing their best though during busy times. I know damn well one of their door guys recognizes me (my tattoo is very recognizable) and he got snippy with me when he was checking my ID and I had my sleeveless hoodie on during a rainy night. Policy I'm sure, but c'mon dude, I've given you a enough of my business for a better attitude.

Also, you should befriend the head of security, Corell. He's a super duper nice guy but will fuck you up if you mouth off!
