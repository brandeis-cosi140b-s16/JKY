The place was clean and bright. The portions/burgers were small but OK. My buddy had the Chicken Parmesan burger and though it was small - he raved about it. Specifically the sauce. The bearded bald guy at the counter was super mellow - not sure if he was smoking "Colorado cigarettes" or what. This place isn't bad but it's not that great.
