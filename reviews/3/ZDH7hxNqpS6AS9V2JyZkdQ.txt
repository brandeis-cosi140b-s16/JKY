Went to Senor Frogs and had a good time.  Fun atmosphere.  Had huge drinks and nachos that were really good!  Lots of toppings on the nachos...waitress was inattentive at times but it seemed like she had a lot going on.  The games they play with the guests are fun and the DJ was funny.  I'd visit again!
