Wow.
I must have hit a bad day.
I was so excited from the reviews.
These little "local dives" usually have the best food too!

I would maybe give 3 stars... Only if the price weren't fairly high- for a local dive.

Last week I had enchilada / taco combo at a close and decent chain restaurant.
It was 4.99 and surprisingly good!

I'll review it next.

I ordered the lunch special of the day:
3 enchiladas w/rice and beans.

The good: service was good- man very kind.
Chips good.
Salsa very good.
Rice (which I seldom like ) good.
So... 3 stars.

Now- bad part:
The enchiladas were barely warm. Cheese hadn't melted and the tortillas were stiff- as  they were almost cold!
Worse though (well... Maybe) was the sauce.
It wasn't deep red, but sort of light orange.
It had short of sour taste.
Could barely eat them.

If I hadn't been hungry and rushed- I wouldn't have.
Beans were great texture and nice cheese. But their. Taste seemed a little off too. Not enough not to eat them- just 
Enough to not really ENJOY them.

The price was almost 9.00- but that included a drink- which I never get as all I drink is water for lunch.
But I got iced tea and it was good.

I don't think I'd come try again- but I must have hit an off day.
But I would advise to NOT order the enchiladas .
