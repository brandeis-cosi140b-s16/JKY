Good, cheap mexican food.
 I don't do the chicken because once, it didn't agree with me and that lasted for about a week. 
Their bean and cheese burritos are delicious. The tortillas are soft but sturdy enough to hold a fair amount of ingredients. If you're careful they don't explode beans and cheese from the last 1/3 of the burrito. 

I don't find the place that clean. While i'm waiting I notice dirty sprinkler heads, dirty soda fountain, dirty tables. Granted, I probably go during their busiest times but I've found myself wanting to ask for a clean rag to wipe all the tables. 
The paint job is horrendous but I won't hold that against them. 
..and the tip jar? Seriously?

Also- I've heard they will deliver to the TallyHo next door. I'd give them 1/2 a star just for that. 3.5
