Cinco de Mayo - you have to eat or do something Mexican on this day.  The BF and I headed to Viva El Taco to satisfy this Mexican craving.  

I would say Viva El Taco is similar to the Roberto's Taco Shop chain.  The pictures and menu on the wall are mirror images.

I went with the #5 Combination Plate (Beef Burrito & Cheese Enchilada) for $5.65.  However, I substituted the Cheese Enchilada for a Pork Tamale.  It also came with rice and beans.  The rice was kinda dry, and remain untouched, but the refried beans were pretty good with  melted cheese.  My beef burrito had chunks of tender beef oozing out along with peppers and the BF wouldn't stop eating my order.  The tamale was on the dry end though, and it's covered with cheese and sauce to make up for it.  I didn't bother finishing the tamale.

The BF had three Al Pastor tacos at $2.15/each.  He thought they were pretty loaded compared to what he gets from Roberto's Taco Shop.

The self service "salad bar" had fresh cucumbers and radishes to neutralize the heat from the chipotle sauce, green hot sauce, jalapeno peppers, carrots, and onions, and fresh green onions.

The gigantic horchata was pretty good too and is a must with all Mexican food.  

Overall, Viva El Taco is another chain among the chains of Mexican food in Las Vegas.  It's definitely better and more authentic than a Del Taco or Taco Bell any day.  It's casual enough for a quick bite as well.

Sidenote:  They have coupons offering $0.99 bean burritos, three rolled tacos, beef tacos, and chicken tacos.
