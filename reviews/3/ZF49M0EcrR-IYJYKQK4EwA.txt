skip the food... but come for the drinks...we did eat there... the food was your standard tex mex, nothing digusting but pretty pricey... They charged for the chips and salsa to start your meal... The Freda drink was fantastic! It was made with fresh blackberries... Also If you're planning on splitting the check , they won't do it... so make sure to have cash and a calculator, after all those drinks who can count?!? lol
