I am a frequent diner of multiple locations of Cafe Rio.  This location is the worst.  Rice is always undercooked.  Meat portions are never consistent.  Southwest limeade is also very inconsistent... sometimes way too diluted and watered down.  Service is also questionable at this location.  They have trouble when busy and there always seems to be a bottleneck at the cashier.  S Eastern location much better, even UNLV location is better, if you can stand the drive.
