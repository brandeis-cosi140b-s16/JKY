My first Q'doba experience also happened to take place in Madison, WI where I would visit a good friend of mine while living in the Chicago area. This was back around '99-'00 or so, I believe, and I'd never experienced a Chipotle to compare it to. I really enjoyed it at the time, so much so that when I moved to Michigan I would occassionally drive almost an hour to get to the closest one. I was pretty psyched when the one on Rural opened up out here because Chipotle never sits right in my stomach (not that it necessarily stops me...but I always dread the impending doom that eating there brings). Unfortunately, this wasn't exactly the Q'doba I remembered, and it's just sorta average. I like the chicken, but the steak is blah. Queso is ok, but I've had much better. This is the one place where I actually enjoy the flavor of their green salsa, and I like the hot as well. No salsa complaints here. I usually end up spending just slightly less for my order here versus at Chipotle, which consists of three tacos, a drink, and chips and salsa (queso at the Q).
