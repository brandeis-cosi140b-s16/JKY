got the chorizo breakfast burrito... not bad i actually went back and got it again one time, only like 5 bucks and was massive, considering trying other things.  i wouldnt say it was "awesome" but it was good if that helps.  but i havent tried anything else like i said but id give it a chance if ur starving and want to go through a drive through.
