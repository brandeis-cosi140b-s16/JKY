Food was good...nothing to rave about but enjoyable nonetheless.  The booth we were seated in was darker than normal....even if it was for "mood" lighting.  Our biggest disappointment was the mediocre service....almost snail-like for a relatively empty establishment.  On the plus side, the chips and salsa was good.
