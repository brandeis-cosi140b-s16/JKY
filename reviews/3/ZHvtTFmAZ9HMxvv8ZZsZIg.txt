Ya know what, it didn't suck nearly as bad as I thought it was going to. The service was really friendly and laid back.. I have to say that the server assistant was hot as hell and really flirty.. apparently Pink Taco wasn't on his mind.. maybe more like Pink Burrito.. I digress.. 

Chips and salsa were fantastic! Served in a bucket, their piping hot and came with some very tasty salsas.. neither salsa was hot so we asked for something hotter.. she brought out habenero salsa which was very tasty but not that hot either.. I think my tolerance might be high for spicy.. 

Order quesadillas, chicken enchilads and the burrito mojado.. the quesadilla was fantastic, cheeselovers unite! Their quesadillas are packed with a cheese blend and tons of it! Served with guacamole, chile paste and sour cream so the mixing and matching options are great!  

Burrito was humongous and filled with tender pork then covered in a nice smoky salsa, avocado and cheese. Along side wasn't your typical rice and beans but a very refreshing mixed green salad.. no iceberg here, dandelion leaves instead.. dressed very well with a light vinaigrette, very nice! 

The green chicken enchiladas were extremely tasty and get this, the chicken was fresh! These were served with rice and beans.. the beans were decent enough, pretty run of the mill but the rice sucked. Was either really old or really undercooked.. either way, suck.

All in all I was expecting far worse from The Pink Taco but was pleasantly surprised by how a-okay it really is. Id certainly go back when I'm in the mood for some good chips and salsa.. oh yes, and they really cute busboy!
