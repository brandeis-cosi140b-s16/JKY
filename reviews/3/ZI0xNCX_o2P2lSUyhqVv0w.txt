Food was somewhere between alright and good here.  Nothing special about the salsas, the beans or the rice, and the meat was kind of chewy and bland.  Guacamole seems like it's premade/canned as well, which is kind of unusual at a sitdown Mexican Restaurant. Tastes alright, and is reasonably priced, but this is a classic case of you get what you pay for.  Spend a few extra bucks and go somewhere more authentic.
