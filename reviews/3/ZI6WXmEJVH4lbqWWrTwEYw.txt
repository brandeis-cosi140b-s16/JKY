Gotta say probably one of the best street tacos around Vegas. Why not 5 stars? The price for the tacos is a little too expensive considering the size of the taco. $2.25 people let's not forget we still talking about Fast Food. Ok the question is...How many will you eat? And if you are paying for more than one person....it gets a little too expensive.
Now if you only eat 2 taquitos and a drink it's alright!
