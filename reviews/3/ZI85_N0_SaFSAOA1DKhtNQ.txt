Used the app to order lunch for my wife and I.  Food was ready at time promised, however when I got home both chicken bowls were wrong. They confused ingredients in both bowls. I had pinto beans, not black. And no lettuce.  My wife had black beans, not pinto and no cheese.

The computer must have printed the orders out wrong because I saw the employee diligently following the ticket. 

Food was good as always, and plenty of it. Process was efficient.

Just not the right recipe.
