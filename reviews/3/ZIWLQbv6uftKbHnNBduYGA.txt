They used to have the best steak tacos in Pittsburgh until they swapped out the real chunks of steak to basically Taco Bell meat. I was extremely disappointed when I learned of this transition. I actually have not returned since... Dont get me wrong, the tacos are top notch. I love the soft greasy shells and the authentic Mexican feel this place has. They also give you lime for the tacos which gives it that extra zesty taste! I also have had the pittsburgh burrito which has french fries mixed in with the burrito, it was ok but when I go to a place like this I am looking for as authentic as I can get. Still good food besides substituting the best tacos they had. I have to give it 3 stars because that was the only thing I really kept me coming back. Disappointed :-/
