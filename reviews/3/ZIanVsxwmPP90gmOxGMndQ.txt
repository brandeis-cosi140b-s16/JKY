An above-average airport spot.  I was there on National Margarita Day - 2/21 - Yay!  Only I had a beer, Rita's were a bit pricy.

Any who -- I had a chopped salad & was able to sub pork al pastor for the grilled chicken.  Great call!  The Al pastor flavor was very nice & a great complement to the cilantro dressing on the chopped salad.

Friendly service & easy in and out.  Best part was I could see my gate & was able to sit comfortably until they started boarding.
