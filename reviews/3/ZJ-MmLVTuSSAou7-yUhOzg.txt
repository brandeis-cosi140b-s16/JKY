I used to go to this taco bell all the time because we lived near it. Unfortunately we don't anymore, so I haven't been in ages.

Our order was rarely wrong at this taco bell. We always check our item bag before leaving and pretty infrequently was it missing anything.

The quality of food seemed to vary wildly. Sometimes I'd get such great foods that it reminded me why Taco Bell is one of my favorite fast food restaurants, and other times I severely regretted not going to Jack in the Box across the street instead when I needed a quick fix.

I don't know why, but Taco Bells are really lacking in 24-hours open around here. I only know of one taco bell in Las Vegas open 24 hours, but it's pretty far. This is only a minor complaint, though.

Finally, there was the mobile app. My partner and I really liked using the mobile app so we wouldn't be rushed at the order window and could also claim additional little discounts through the app. Taco bell coupons are like nonexistent after all, for some reason. Anyways, at some point, the store no longer was available to us on the mobile app. It said "Mobile ordering unavailable at this location." Kinda made us sad.
