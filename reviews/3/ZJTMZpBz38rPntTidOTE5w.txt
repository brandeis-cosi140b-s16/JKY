I've been here 3 times now. The tortilla is delish. And my husband really likes their chips con queso. The establishment is clean which is also a big plus.

What I don't like about this place and makes me hesitant to go back.. Well, all three times we ordered the same things: 2 steak burritos, 1 chips con queso, and 1 soft drink. The first time, we were charged 16-something. The second time, 18-something. And this last time, my husband paid 24 bucks. I obviously went up and spoke with the cashier (my dear husband could care less--so frustrating). He apologized immediately and gave me 7 bucks out of his own pocket. Whatever. I got our money back. But if we do go back to this particular location again, which we probably will, I will be the one to pay for sure. I do not want this to happen again.
