An improvement over my last mexican meal here in Arizona, but just pretty average.  The chicken burrito was ALL chicken inside, not spiced or seasoned, just cooked chicken.  A bit dry as well.  The green chile sauce over the top was outstanding and the moist tortilla made up for the insides sort of sucking wind.  Tacos were a weird deep fried flour tortilla.  Not so good.  The tostada shell was soggy.

Good service and nice decor, but just OK food.
