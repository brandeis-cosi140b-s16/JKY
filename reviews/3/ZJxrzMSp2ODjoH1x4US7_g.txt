I will have to say the veggie enchiladas my sister and I ordered were very delicious and enjoyed every bit of it.  I was also impressed when the waiter told us the pinto beans had pork in it and replaced it with black beans. As much as I would like to give this place a 4-star rating, I can't because we were not told there was a "sharing" tax!!
I have never heard of place that charges you extra if you share your entree with someone, so much for curbing portion control when restaurants offer a entree that could feed a family of 5 now a days. I was not thrilled with the hidden charge until we received our bill.  If you want modern Mexican I would suggest Vida in downtown, they have yummy food and there is NO share charge!
