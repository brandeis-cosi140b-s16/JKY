I have to say I love food, especially American-Mexican burritos, just not here.

 I got the Joey with organic tofu and the make your own subway style burrito build. I have to say I was highly unimpressed with the quality of the ingredients and the freshness of the veggies. I thought the entire burrito felt fake.

The one plus though that allowed me to give this place 3 stars was the salsa bar! OMG... the pineapple salsa was so good, I suggest you do try that if you do end up here. 

Also the coke machine is one of those freestyle machines so you can mix and match and make your own fun new concoctions. 

Overall I will not go back, but if I am forced I'll stick to the chips and salsa.
