Been coming to this place for about a year now and the food is always satisfying. 

I am giving it a 3 star because every time I have come in, they always say I cannot split the bill. It states on the menu, "We do not split bills for parties of 5 or more." So, I don't see how that applies to me when I come in with just one other person. 

Also, during my last visit I noticed the one of the waiters was sweating and wiping it off with his hands and continued serving people. 

To sum it up, the food is amazing, the service could use work.
