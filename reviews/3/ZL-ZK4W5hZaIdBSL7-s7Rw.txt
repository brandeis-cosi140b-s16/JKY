I've been to this place a few times and the food is really good but I think it's too expensive for being Mexican food....okay contemporary Mexican food. Name it what you want but I think it's a good $8 caliber food that I paid $15 for.
The service has always been good but you better get there early or you will wait and they don't have much room for you to wait in so you will be outside. 

The one thing you do have to try when you get there is the churro in ice cream dessert. That is always the highlight when I go. If you take friends or family I really don't think they will be disappointed but your wallet will.
