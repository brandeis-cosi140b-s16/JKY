I visited los Compadres 2 days ago, i ordered a couple things one being a bean and cheese burrito huge mistake cause for 3.50 you should get some thing bigger than taco bell size burrito. I saw the burrito and told them i needed some thing else and they did just that for me i was pleased after that. Food had good flavor and customer service was great ! JUST STAY AWAY FROM THE BEAN BURRITOS PLEASE THERE A WASTE OF MONEY.
