My wife and I popped in before heading over to the remodeled Bookmans.

What was the first thing I noticed upon entering the restaurant, you ask?

Well, it was the woman in the back, hand pressing fresh tortillas.  Oh yeah baby.  I'm loving it.

Another thing I loved was the all you can eat chips & salsa bar.  Yeah, its a bar, well, more of an island style service tray with sneeze-guard.

But as in life, all good things must come to an end.  My adobaba tacos had a few too many fatty pieces inside.  So, I'm not loving it so much anymore.

But I'll return to try the steak or chicken.
