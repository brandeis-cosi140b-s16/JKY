We were looking for a hearty late-night meal after being picked up at Sky Harbor from LA and my friend that lives in town suggested Filiberto's. Now we have Alberto's in LA and my friend who grew up in Los Angeles said this was the equivalent so I had to try it. We ordered at the drive-thru. We got 2 carne asada nachos, 1 carne asada burrito, an order of rolled tacos and 3 churros. The total was around $33.

The nachos were great. The meat was thicker than I expected cuts of asada. That was good to see and it tasted great. The cheese was good, the chips were crisp, the sour cream, guac and refried beans were all quite delicious. Adding some green salsa gave it a nice kick. It was a more than generous portion. I was starved and I could barely finish that order of nachos. The rolled tacos were good but the guacamole looked suspect. Not sure why it was a darker green color on top and brighter (more normal guac) green underneath. That was weird so I ate around it with trepidation. I didn't like not trusting my food. 

Service was friendly at the drive-thru... especially since we added the churros when we got to the window. The nice lady said no problem and added the churros to our total. Food was good. It was rather tasty... It's just that mystery guac, I dont know. At least I didn't get sick... That I must say.
