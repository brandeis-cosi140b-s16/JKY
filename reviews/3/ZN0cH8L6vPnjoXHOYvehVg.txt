Not bad, not great. The better realization here folks might be that those who eat fast food think fast food is awesome.  Those that came in with 5 star expectations who ate at a fine steakhouse last night will have their hope crushed. Expectations people. 

I'd personally suggest to come in with zero expectations, possibly on a Thursday because you get a free beverage with a taco salad. Just enough food to hold me and another yelper over til we arrive home later.  

You could always downgrade a notch and try out burger kings mystery meat next door? 

Good luck Mexican foodies!
