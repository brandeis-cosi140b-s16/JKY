This place is next to my son's karate location so we ate there one day before his class. 

For a fast mexican food place *similar to fili-b's* it was very good. The shredded beef and carnitas are flavorful and hard to finish because of how big they are. The sides are bland but add some salt and they are better. I will go back again when wanting an inexpensive, fast mexican food location. 4 people (including drinks) for a little less than $20. Can't beat it!
