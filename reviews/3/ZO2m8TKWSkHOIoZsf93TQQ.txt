It's been a while since I've been to a El Pollo Loco. So I've been going to this one on N Durango in Centennial Hills area.  I've been here twice and I've been disappointed.  The chicken takes a little old, I can't quite put my finger on it.  I can only say that the flavor of the chicken is not what I was use to when El Pollo Loco first came to Vegas.  I'd rather buy a roasted chicken at Sam's club or the super market.
