.99 chicken tacos on Wednesday? Hells yea!

This is basically the only reason why I come here. The tacos are super oily but they actually taste good with some of their red salsa! If you come here their food consistency is not always the same, the tacos anyway.  The first time they were hella hard with a little bit of chicken, the second time they were perfect and this last time they were perfect shells with a little chicken and not enough cheese. For .99cents you really cant expect more though.

My coworker got the rolled taquitos with guac and asked for sour cream, they charge 1.10$ for that, WTF!? They also charge that for guac. Its totally insane to charge that much for sour cream though! The guac was already oxidizing by the time we got back to work, like 5 mins away.

They have a salsa bar, but the place is cramped and people always take wayyyy more than they should. They do offer green onions here, which not all Robertos offer. 

The place itself is pretty clean, and customer service is so-so. The cashier is usually in a hurry and just trying to get orders in as quickly as possible so she isnt super nice.

I will continue to come here for their cheap tacos, but thats about it LOL.

Yay!
