6-19-2015 - I stopped in this location for a quick burrito and some beans and rice.  The place was almost empty and I ordered a beef burrito and a side order of beans and rice.   My order came with the beans and rice in the burrito, and I did not reorder as I was in a hurry.  It did not come  on a plate,  just wrapped in paper,  They had a little station to add salsa, etc.  The burrito was ok but nothing special.  This was my only experience at this location and I can not rave about my food, or service like other reviews I read.  I did not get the rememberable thumbs up experience that a person gets after having had  something above average.
