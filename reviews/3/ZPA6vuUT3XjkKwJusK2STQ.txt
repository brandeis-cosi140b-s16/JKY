I visited Las Vegas last days.
I decided to go to this restaurant.
I waited 15 minutes,before server bring us menu.
5 star that it's work 24/hours
1 star for guacamole-it's just avocado and nothing more,no lime,a little cilantro,no salt!no taste!! I was so disappointed 
1star for salad, chicken was cold.
Also they charging for chips and salsa!
