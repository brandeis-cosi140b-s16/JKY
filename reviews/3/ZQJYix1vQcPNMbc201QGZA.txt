late lunch or an early dinner...don miguel serving large sizzling fresh fajitas....largescale nachos....ceviche 'n' quesadillas....half priced at under $five each from 2pm to 6pm....complimented by 99 cent flavored frozen blended pre-made margaritas served straight from "slushy machines"....probably would only pay a $dollar at most for a plastic cup of margarita "slushy"....only recommending an odd hour day snack during happy hour for fajita at don miguel....
