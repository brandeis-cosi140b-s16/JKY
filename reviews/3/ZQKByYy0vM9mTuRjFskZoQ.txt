Met a good friend here for lunch while I am in my ole stomping grounds of Scottsdale. This place has been around forever. I remember the old days of staggering out of the joint on a Friday night after shots of tequila and coronas. Dang that was a long time ago. Anyhow...this time I was there to eat. I ordered the steak tacos and although they were tasty they really were just average. Tasted more like a steak quesadilla than steak tacos.  The service was great though and obviously by the past reviews this place is still doing great. Enjoy! Have some tequila!
