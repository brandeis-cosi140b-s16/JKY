I like the food at this place. It's not the best authentic mexican restaurant, but it's better than a lot of others. 

The location gets a lot of their patrons during the week because of the businesses around. However, during their lunch rush they don't have a dedicated person to take to go orders. 

I initally tried to call in my order twice and no one picked up. So I had to wait an additional 8-10 min when I got the location to place my to go order. My food took another 12 min. or so. If I didn't work close, then this would be an issue in getting back to work.
