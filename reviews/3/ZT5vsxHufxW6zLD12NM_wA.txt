Mexi-Casa is what I consider to be an A-OK local neighborhood joint.  The owner is friendly, the clientele are overall nice, and the food is good (read not great).

Grilled whole wings (great deal during the late night 1/2 off deal), ribs, and burritos all have been good.  The portions are generally huge so you definitely won't leave hungry.

Beer selection features a decent variety of crafts, with the only problem being that the drink menu, dinner menu, and draft board all never match (be prepared to just ask the server if what you want is available).

If I had to sum up Mexi-Casa, take Mad Mex and yinzer it down a level...  not exactly a bad thing.
