Ate breakfast here. Food was decent, cute patio...Had the veggie omelette with toast. 

Service was poor. Waited over 30 minutes for our breakfast and no one even apologized. Needed refills and no one came by till we were done with our meal. 

It was close to our hotel so this is why we ate here, but I prob wouldn't go back.
