I work just across the street, so it's a good default place to go right after work with co-workers. Dos Cominos replaced Agave, but since I was only there for happy hour, I can't really compare the two. 
They have a great patio area, however I do wish they would offer better happy hour specials. To name a few, you get 25% off Sangria pitchers, $1 off margarita's and $3 Coors beer. There are better deals to be had in Summerlin. At least they give you 50% off appetizers. 
At this time, they do not make one of my top places for happy hour places, but it sticks around as an option.
