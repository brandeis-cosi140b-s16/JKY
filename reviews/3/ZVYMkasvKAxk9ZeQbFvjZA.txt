As a tourist we stopped here before leaving the Phoenix area. It had great parking garage above the Restaurant and was told by someone that it would be validated. Turned out the Restaurant only validates half of if. Ugggh. 
Went in side, cool looking place. Fairly packed on a Sunday. Ordered our food with a nice waitress. We had chips, very watery salsa. Not very good. Our food came out fairly fast, and then the Mariachi started I really liked that. My lil niece enjoyed it as well. 
The food was good and satisfying. But the did notice the menu is all over the place. Burgers, sandwiches, Mexican food. If I am in that area again, I would go back to try again.
