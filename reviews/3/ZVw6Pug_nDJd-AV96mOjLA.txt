Exceeded my expectations 

I am very particular about the places I choose to eat at, I drive most of my friends crazy.  I was apprehensive when  my friends suggested Valle Luna for lunch. I had always seen cupons and  specials but never went there to eat. Finally tried Valle Luna and happily, it exceeded my expectations. 

Service was great; chips & drinks were served quickly. The flatas were topped with sour cream, guacamole, and cheese and we're  good, as were the asada tacos. The portions at Valle Luna are generous enough to have a little leftover for the next day. 

I was pleasantly surprised at the service, quality, and ample portions. For american style mexican food Valle Luna was good. Definitely going back again!
