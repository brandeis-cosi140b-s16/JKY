I'm a recent convert to the pescatarian way of life. So, eating out, something I truly adore, has become a tricky task. Craving tacos and missing "Al Pastor and Carne Asada," I decided to venture in to Panchos as people have raved about their vegetarian/vegan tacos. 

The place is small and has a super clean, family owned Robertos feel to it. The food was super fresh and made to order. There weren't huge vats of food needing to be reheated.

I got the special of the day: 2 tacos (any kind), beans, rice, and a can of soda for $7.99. Not too shabby. I also picked up some carne asada tacos for my roommate and an order of the shrimp empanadas.

The empanadas were made-to-order and the lady told me it would be a 15 minute wait. Â¡No problemo! The empanadas were definitely worth the wait! The MAIN reason I'm willing to give this place another go!

The potato tacos (carbs on carbs, yo) were okay. They weren't amazing, the weren't good, they were okay. Along with the vegetarian beans, and the rice. They did have vegan cheese which pleased me greatly. (I don't know why I like it so much because it doesn't taste like cheese, at all.) The homie really enjoyed the her tacos, agreed about the lackluster beans and rice and raved about the shrimp empanadas!

I really struggled with 3-4 stars, but they forgot my sodas and the tacos were just a-okay. I will be back to explore the menu more.
