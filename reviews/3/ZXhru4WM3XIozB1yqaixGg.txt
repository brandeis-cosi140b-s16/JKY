Wasn't busy on this weekday late morning, and I received prompt attention upon entering and my server greeted me within a minute or so.  Chips and salsa were provided and just ok, and I ordered from the lunch special menu which was a little better deal than regular menu items.  Food was average to above average, and my server did a good job checking in with me.

It was a little pricey - just under $10 for a lunch special with soda, plus tip on top of that.
