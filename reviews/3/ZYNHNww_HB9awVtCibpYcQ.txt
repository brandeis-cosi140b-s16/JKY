I like to go through the drive thru, but i have eaten inside before as well. If you are inside they give you lots of chips, on the to go orders ,no. I got the green chili bean and cheese burro with rice and beans.  It is ok ,not the best. But it is very  cheap.       It is a quick meal when you are on the go.    I would rather have spicy and tasty, however i am sure i will go there again at some point.
