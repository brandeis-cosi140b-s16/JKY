Nothing fancy but will do in a pinch.

Like the name implies, La Cocina Economica  is an economical place to eat.   They offer Authentic Mexican food at decent prices.   The food is good and I have never had a bad experience.  The food is made fresh to order, so you may have to wait for 10 minutes for your order.  La Cocina offers several daily specials for $4.99.

If you want something fast and inexpensive La Cocina is not a bad choice.
