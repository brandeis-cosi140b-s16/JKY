I ahve gone here a few times. It is convienent when at work. The staff is great. Always friendly. Will answer any question. Make suggestions. 
The food is ok. I really like the refried beans. Love the guacamole and chips. Of the meats I tried they are all to salty for my taste. The prices are reasonable. You can get a complete meal for under 6.00.
