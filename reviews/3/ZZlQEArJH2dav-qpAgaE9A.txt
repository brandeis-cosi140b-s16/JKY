I ordered a basic bean and cheese burrito and a large drink to go.  The burrito was very heavy on the refried beans, which were too bland, and not enough cheese and as a result the burrito was too bland and did not have much flavor; however, the beans were not as dry as some other Mexican places I've been to and the tortilla was very soft and fresh tasting.  I took some green verde salsa to go and even that tasted bland.  The drink tasted flat.  What I can say positive about the location is that the cashier was very pleasant and professional and the store is clean.  A nice touch is that they have sandwich bags out by the salsa bar so that you can package up the assorted condiments neatly without leaking.  If I go back I think I'd like one of the other burritos or will request sour cream and extra cheese and a little less on the beans.  Definitely worth another try.
