Nothing special here other than the location. We were headed to a show at the Visualite up the street. This is your same old Mexican food joint with a large tall open dining room. I had the steak tacos and my friend had the enchiladas - both tasted good, not great, we left a little on our plate. We did have the 1/2 price pitchers of sangria - again, good, not great. 

I was just as ready to leave as I was to arrive. Will I go back...only if I am around the area with no other options - too many other places to try!
