Gonzalez Y Gonzalez is located inside the New York New York Hotel and Casino. It is a Mexican themed restaurant. I didn't really know what to expect after reading the reviews so I decided to take a chance and eat there.

Our waitress was very friendly and let us know what the popular dishes and drinks were. At first I had ordered the steak nachos but our waitress was quick to point out that the portion was really small and it was more of an appetizer. I truly appreciated her honesty. I ended up ordering the chicken quesadilla which came with pico de gallo, sour cream and guacamole. The shredded chicken was very tasty however I was quite disappointed by how small the quesadilla was. My friend ordered the Gonzalez nachos which consists of nacho, cheese, ground beef and guacamole. I was able to try some of it and it was good.

While my experience at this restaurant was very positive, I thought the restaurant was a bit pricey for the amount of food served (both our bills added up to $26). If you are really craving or wanting to eat Mexican food while vacationing in Las Vegas, I suggest you look for a place away from the strip.
