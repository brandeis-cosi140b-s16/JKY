Went back.....eh...

Staff friendliness went down the drain. She at least cracked a smile, but it was just like take your food and go. She would just hand it and slam the window shut. She gave me my food and walked away, I had to walk back in to get extra sauce (gave 3 small ones that could use at least 6). Still she was gone, luckily they have a salsa bar. 

Breakfast burrito was good. A little bit too much potatoes, but I feel like every fast food mexican joint does that. They should just call it a mas patatas burrito con uno bacon, uno egg, uno queso, y uno salsa. 

Joking aside, I will come back. Los Favs is very good.same issue with the burritos...but there salsa is terrible...no flavor.
