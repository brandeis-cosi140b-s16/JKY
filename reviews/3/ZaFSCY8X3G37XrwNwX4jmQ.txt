We were returning from the Laughlin River Run and stopped in Wickenberg to eat as we were having a Mexican food craving.  The Chevron attendant recommended Anitas.  We were seated right away.  Restaurant was busy which is always a good sign, I think.

Well, the food was just okay in my book.  My husband had the SHREDDED BEEF CHIMICHONGA and he really liked it.  I had the two SHREDDED BEEF TACOS COMBO.  The rice was undercooked and the refried beans were watery and cold.  The tacos were in a soft corn tortilla so it kind of fell apart as I was eating it.  The food was tasty, portions were average/small for Mexican.  We finished everything and ate a bowl and half of the chips which were the best ever.  We were hungry.

Service was pretty good, seating was uncomfortable and bathrooms are to be desired.

Just okay.
