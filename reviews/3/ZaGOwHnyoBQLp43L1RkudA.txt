Amado's is pretty great for the price and availability.  They are open 24 hours, nearly every day in the year.  The food is what you would expect from a divey Mexican fast food place, but it's miles better than Filiberto's.

The best items are the rolled tacos, carne asada burrito, carne asada quesadilla, bean burrito w/ cheese (best ever), sausage breakfast burrito, and the Amado's breakfast burrito.  And of course the hot sauce!

The only serious downside is that both the Dobson and the McClintock locations are right next to high schools.  If you end up needing a midnight burrito, you'll likely encounter a troup of drunk high school kids.  All in all, it's worth it!
