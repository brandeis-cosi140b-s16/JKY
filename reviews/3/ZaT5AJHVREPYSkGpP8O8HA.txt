Tacos Sonora Grill is now open for business. The neighborhood is rather sketchy and parking is limited so you may want to consider visiting during daylight hours. The menu is limited and the tacos are small. However, the carne asada is flavorful and there's a self-serve toppings bar to personalize it all. This is a very small restaurant with absolutely no seating indoors. Plan on take out in case you can't find a seat at one of the four small outdoor tables. Considering those eating at the restaurant are likely to sit outdoors, I would recommend they place a trash can where people are most likely to use one. The only one I saw was indoors. The prices are right at $1.50 per taco (two dollars for bottled soda) but if you're paying with a card, be compared to fork over an extra $.50.
