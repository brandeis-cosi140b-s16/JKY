I'm sorry, but I think Chipotle is vastly overrated. I know I may be in the minority here,but I simply think their food is average. The burritos are good, but not worth the price- and it still irks me to the core that getting guac on your dish costs so much extra. Yes, I'll continue to stop by there once in a while- but I don't know what all of the fuss is about.
