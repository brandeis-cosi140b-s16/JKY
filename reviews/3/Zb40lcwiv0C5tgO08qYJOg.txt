This is your run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant. It's decent food, decent prices, but nothing extraordinary. It's a bit small and a little stuffy feeling. I'm not so much a fan of feeling like I'm in the way of the servers trying to get food to the tables or other patrons getting around, but it's inevitable in such a tiny space. It kind of detracts from your meal.

But I will say, the Arroz con Pollo is OUTSTANDING. Probably the only reason I really go back to this place at all.
