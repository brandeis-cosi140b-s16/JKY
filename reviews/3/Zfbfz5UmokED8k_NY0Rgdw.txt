Looking  for a burrito in Las Vegas? I found this Mexican drive through that is open 24hours when vacationing there. Try the Super burrito with everything or the steak and egg. These people make burritos for people who are hungry. I ordered two and the bag weighed about three pounds. The price is low less than four dollars a burrito and others less then three. Also if you are a seasoned burrito eater you will appreciate that this place can roll a proper burrito that will not fall apart on you. These were tight and stuffed. I had a poor chicken burrito on a subsequent visit but the steak and egg was still awesome. The salsas provided are to be avoided as they are dismal. No chips come with burritos here so if you want them ask.
