Visited here on Valentine's day for dinner.  I got the pork carnitas meal. The meat was steaming but the rice and beans were on the cold side. My date got the shredded beef chimi de macayo. She said it was delicious abd everything on her plate was warm or hot. Although our margaritas were awesome!!!
