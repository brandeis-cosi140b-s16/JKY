Not fantastic, but not bad.

Salsa was good but needed a little more heat - we added a few drops of the hot sauce on the table, which helped.  I had 2 cheese chile rellenos, which most restaurants cover with red enchilada sauce.  Here, they were covered with diced tomatoes, pineapple, and something else - green olives, maybe.  The breading was a little thick and tended to overpower the flavor of the chile.  The chiles could have used a bit more cheese.  On the side, instead of rice and beans, these come with rice and steamed baby carrots and broccoli.  I thought the veggies could have used a little more time in the steamer.

Overall, I felt like they were trying to make a healthier twist on chiles rellenos, which is nice, but I kind of like them covered in sauce and oozing cheese.

Other minor gripes: they were out of plain Pepsi - only diet and Mountain Dew.  They only take Visa, not Mastercard.  The atmosphere was a little quiet and subdued.  I think this place is ok but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again.  Coupons available on their website.
