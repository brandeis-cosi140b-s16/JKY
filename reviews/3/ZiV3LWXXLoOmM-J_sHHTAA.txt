We have been to Los Favoritos twice. The first time we had nachos and were disappointed, I could have done that. We tried a second time for breakfast and found the bean and egg burrito and the green chili burrito to be delicious! We will try again as we have heard the ceviche and the burgers are delicious. If they turn out to be a hit I will raise my star level!
