I think this location obviously has some kinks to work out but otherwise our meal here on opening day was nice. I'm a big fan of the location in Mesa and didn't like the food quite as much at this new store in Phoenix. I can't pinpoint it and I'm not sure where the difference was but my typically veggie salad just didn't have the same wow factor. Having said that, the customer service was great and all workers were extremely friendly. This goes for both locations but I take issue with places that charge extra for something like sour cream. Overall an OK experience, will return after they've ironed out some issues.
