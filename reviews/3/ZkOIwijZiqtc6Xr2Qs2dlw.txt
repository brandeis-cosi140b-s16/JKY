The food is delicious and a great price, however this review is in regards to how I witnessed employees treating what appeared to be a new trainee. I felt uncomfortable as a patron because a redheaded seasoned employee was barking orders at the new trainee and proceeded to make fun of her with the a tall, slender, brunette cashier. It is upsetting that such unprofessional treatment of employees is tolerated, maybe she is a new employee and a little slow and doesn't get it, but there is no excuse for humiliating her in such a way.
