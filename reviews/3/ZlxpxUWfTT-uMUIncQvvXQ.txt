I've been here a couple of time and it's an ok place. The Mexican food is ok, I usually get the burros but if you want rice and beans and other ingredients inside its a 50 cent charge per item... Really?  The chips and salsa are good. I've also tried some of their ceviche tostadas and these are not fish these are shrimp ceviche, not the best I've tasted by far. Overall, I'd expect better from a hole in the wall but this place is just ok.
