Much improved experience here the other night. The salsa bar was loaded up and fresh in all of its offerings. Tons of fresh cucumbers, loads of crazy good onions, free chips and three kinds of salsas. The three rolled tacos were actually crispy, but they still are using fake guac to top those off. My other order looked nice in the foam tray with compartments of rice and beans nicely separated. Both of those items were tasty enough, but the taco shell was mushy on the bottom and beef was a bit greasy. The cheese enchilada was average also. Wouldn't mind just coming in for the salsa bar, but might have gotten lucky that night entering at the right time (10pm), who knows.
