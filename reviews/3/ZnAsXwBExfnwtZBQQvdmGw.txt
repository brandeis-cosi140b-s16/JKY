Typical Americanized Mexican food menu. Don't expect a lot of unique items, but do expect a lot of the standards.

Split a green chili cheese crisp to start. Quite tasty. Green chilis were not fresh roasted, but still good.

Chicken fajitas completed the meal. Chicken was good, but not great. The veggies (onions and peppers) were cook well, but did not really have any seasoning. Beans, tortillas, sour cream, and guacamole were good.

Would definitely go back. Especially since they are open late.
