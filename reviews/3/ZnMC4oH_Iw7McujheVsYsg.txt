Ajo Als rocks, but this location is hit and miss.  For some reason their chips are consistently not as good as the other locations - it's like they are soaked in grease.  If you can go to either of the Scottsdale locations, you are better off, based on my experiences.

The pollo con queso is great!!! It's the best thing on the menu if you don't care about calories (deep fried chicken burro, smothered in cream cheese and cheddar cheese, mmmmmmm).  If I don't want 2,000 calories in one meal, I go for the Salad Carbone with Chicken.  It's seriously one of the best salads I have ever had.  They marinade the chicken in something wonderful, it's so tender and flavorful, and served with the best jalapeno ranch. !Muy bueno!
