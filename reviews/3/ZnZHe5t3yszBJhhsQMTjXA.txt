I've been a lover of Z'Tejas for several years now but today was blah, at best.  The only thing saving this review from 2 stars, the special of the day, lobster enchiladas!  The waitress was bothered at best, my mom was ordered an ice tea, about 2 minutes after it hit the table we noticed, no ice!  She took our order and left, she brought our check, and left.  We used my birthday coupon and she seemed annoyed! 

The service and food both left a bit to be desired, not as all like I remember this location in particular.  The Shea and Tatum location is better by far!
