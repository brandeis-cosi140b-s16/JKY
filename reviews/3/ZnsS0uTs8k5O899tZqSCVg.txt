I knew I'd be back to visit Steel Cactus, I just didn't realize how quickly! After having lunch there this past Saturday (see my original review), I ended up there later that evening to meet some friends for drinks.  They did have a few interesting pumpkin beers that I haven't tried yet, so that was a plus. We were seated upstairs and given menus, as the other two people in my party wanted to have a late dinner.

The waiter came to take our order and my friend was a little too drunk and not paying attention, so I told the waiter her order: a chicken quesadilla.  As soon as she (my friend) heard this, she said "no no no, it's fine, I don't want food after all." So I asked the waiter to cancel that.  Our other party member proceeded to order his food (the 412 Burrito) and then tell the waiter to go ahead with the chicken quesadilla anyway.  I'm not sure what happened, but we ended up with TWO chicken quesadillas and the 412 Burrito.  I wasn't very hungry but figured if they made it, we might as well eat it.  I had one piece of the quesadilla and wasn't terribly impressed. Again, with the black beans, except this time they were inside the quesadilla.  Every time i picked up a piece to eat, the beans came plopping out and onto my plate, the table and the floor.  Also, the cheese was minimal, if not nonexistent... and I don't know about you, but about 75% of the reason I order a quesadilla is for that ooey gooey cheese!

I really, really want to like this place. I just think they are in over their heads and need to really focus on what needs improved, that being the kitchen.
