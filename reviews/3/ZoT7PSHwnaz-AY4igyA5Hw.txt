We went in for lunch today, and the first thing our waitress says to us after bringing our drink order is, "We can't bring you chips and salsa, because we are out of salsa...and chips."  HUH?!  How in God's name does a Mexican restaurant run out of salsa and chips in the middle of the day?!  We ordered anyway....with great trepidation.

I had the combination lunch fajitas.  Jenny had the quesadilla Lupita.  We were both quite pleased.  The food was good.  The portions were big.  The prices were CHEAP!  By the way....they offered to substitute the salsa and chips with queso dip and flour tortillas.  I guess we made out there as well.

It's close to the house, yet I somehow often overlook it.  The truth is....it's hard to beat the value proposition....at least for lunch.
