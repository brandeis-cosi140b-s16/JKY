I've been here a few times and I love their chips and salas. The chips are extra thin and very crispy. I get salsa and they ask if I want the hot sauce, yes to both.

This visit I ordered the Breakfast Burro (Chico Bean Burro topped with green chili beef and egg). First, the side was red potatos with grilled veggies (red bell peppers and onions). The potatos were egh and the veggies tasted like they over did it on the oil. After a few bites of the green chili beef with scrambled egg I pushed it aside and attacked the bean burro. The chili was bland and salt/pepper helped but it just wasn't that great. I was craving the bean burro, so either it was good or I was just satisifying a craving. 

It was something different but next time I'll stick to the plain bean burro, the beef and chicken tacos are pretty decent (a bit more expensive than I'm used to).

Service was attentive: 1. I felt bad that she was very pregnant and I was making her work. Even though I wasn't demanding I felt bad for her feet. LoL Silly I know. And she kept calling me Hun..
