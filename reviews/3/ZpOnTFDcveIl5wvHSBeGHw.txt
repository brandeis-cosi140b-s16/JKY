Taco Bell is one of my go to places when I need to eat on the go.  I stopped by this location to grab a quick bite.  Ordered my usual:

7 Layer Burrito, $1.99

Cheesy Beans & Rice Burrito, $1.59

Both were tasty on the fast food scale of taste.....cashier service was quick and accurate.  The only negative was that it took a while for the food to get prepared.
