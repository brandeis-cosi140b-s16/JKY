I tend to avoid suburban chains unless under duress or facing desperation.  As i was on foot in this suburban sprawl, I had very little choice.  Surrounded by shopping centers and every chain restaurant and big box retailer known to man, there was nary a unique independent store or restaurant to be found.  I was truly facing desperation. The lesser of dozens of roadside evils, On the Border seemed the best option in part because it was unfamiliar to me.  Lunch prime hours had just passed, so the place was quiet.  Service was prompt and friendly.  I had been hankering BBQ so I was pleased to see BBQ brisket tacos on the menu.  The lunch portion of two tacos (8.99) came with Mexican rice and black beans, both of which were completely tasteless.  The tacos themseles were good, though the portions were skimpy.  The brisket was ok but not of the highest quality, with a few chewy pieces, but a redeeming aspect was the chipotle BBQ sauce and fried onion rings, all on freshly-made flour tortillas.  The salsa and chips - the best part of the meal.  So, if you want a reliably consistent decent meal at a good price, this place will satisfy you.  For me, if desperation strikes again in a similar suburban wasteland, Ill try the enchilada combo.
