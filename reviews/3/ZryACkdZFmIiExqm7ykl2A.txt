My co-workers and I like to come here on Taco Tuesdays for their $1 tacos.  You can order either chicken, steak or beef tacos, (3 taco minimum) for a dollar, and you get a side of fresh tortilla chips and you get to choose from their salsa bar. 

The chicken tacos are definitely the best, the chicken is flame-broiled and you definitely get that flame-broil flavor.  They are on double corn tortillas which is a bit much for me, I can never eat more than two (which is why the three taco minimum kind of sucks, but who can beat $3 for lunch with leftovers?).  The steak tacos are nothing compared to the chicken, the steak just isn't very flavorful, I definitely would not recommend them.  I have never tried the beef, which come on a crisp taco shell.  I tend to prefer soft tacos over hard tacos, so I haven't really been interested in trying the beef.  

I think the rest of the menu tends to be a bit expensive for what you get.  I Wouldn't really recommend coming to Chico's unless its for the dollar tacos.

The chips and salsa bar is pretty great.  Lots of different types of salsa with varying levels of kick.  This is a great place to come for  a cheap, fast, working lunch!
