I agree with everyone here the food is good fresh but just the service is terrible i've been here several times , and they just don't have a good customer service , i'm not saying don't go here just letting you know they're rude ...  The Ceviche is great that's why I keep coming back whoever is the cook is good that's all I got to say !!!
