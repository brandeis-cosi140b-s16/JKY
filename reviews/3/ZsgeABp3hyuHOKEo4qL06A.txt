It's Saturday night and you don't mind waiting for your food then it's worth it.  If they accept reservations then you need to do it a couple of days before.  We had a party of 11 and I was impressed at how fast we were served.  We called ahead to be added to the list and then waited about an hour to be seated.   The place was packed.  The parking lot was full and once it's full there isn't any other alternatives to parking.  

The atmosphere was nice and they have a magician entertain you while you wait for a table.  Which is really great if you have children with you.  

My husband and I were not happy when the waitress forgot stuff for his meal and we had to flag down the manager.   She was great at making sure we all had water and drinks.   Also when we got our bill it took her about 30 minutes to take our money and then rounded up and kept the change as her part of her tip when she already included an 18% gratuity on our bill.  It is little things like that can make people upset.  

Now for the food.   I had a quesadilla that cost $12 served with rice and beans.   If anything I enjoyed the beans the most.   The quesadilla was okay but I prefer the one I get at Qdoba more.   The rice was uninspriring and rather bland.   

Their green verde salsa is to die for.   The group as a whole seemed to enjoy it the most and kept getting refills of chips.   I also ordered ice tea which I wasn't warned about was passion fruit.  Not my favorite type of tea either but it was okay.  So I drank more water instead.  

Anyway, it's an okay place to eat at but I can't say I'll go there often.  Not a big fan of overpriced mexican food.
