New menu alert: went here Sunday and was heartbroken to see that my favorite item was no longer on the list. Moment of silence please. 

Tacos fundidos are my go-to here. Grilled chicken and cheese dip. Come on... yum!  The waitress saw my sad face and asked the manager if I could still order it. He said yes. Hooray!

Starters wise- The cheese dip is a good sized portion. So is the guac... and it's made is made table side. To put it in perspective for you: with a group of five girls we did both of these. We still had guac leftover. 

I hope the tacos fundidos do not go away permanently with the new menu. I don't want to pick a new go-to. If so, fajitas it is then.

Parking is available on the street. Just make sure to pay attention to the meters. There's also a lot across from Nothing But Noodles.

I like this location a lot better than its counterpart on Park Road. Bigger restaurant, better service.
