Stopped by for a quick bite before a show.  There was a short line that moved quickly.  I ordered the fish taco combo with a melon agua fresca.  Food came out fairly quickly and tasted great.  Price was a little high for what I got but that is to be expected in a casino.  This is one of the better places in the Caesars food court.
