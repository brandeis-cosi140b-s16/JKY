I still love the food after I gave this place another chance.  The grief I have  now is I noticed last night as I was picking up my to go order that they have started charging to take  the food out.  I don't like that I'm coming to pick up my own food and I'm being charged, not cool.  When I asked about the charge, it couldn't be explained to me. I don't think I'll be doing take out any more.
