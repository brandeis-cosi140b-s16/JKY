Drive by this place everyday on my way to work, figured I would try it out. Big language barrier, Asked If I could have an egg and chili verde burrito. He kept on telling me it's a machaca burrito. After about 5 mins of trying to understand each other, and I was begining to run late for work. I drove off with my machaca burrito. It was good, not bad at all. But not what I was looking for.
