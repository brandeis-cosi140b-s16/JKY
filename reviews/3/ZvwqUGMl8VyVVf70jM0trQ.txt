Wow, what a nice surprise. 
Fresh.
Tasty.
Well-made.
Yummy.

Sure, it is still airport food, but decent airport food? Seriously?
Yes indeed.
I had a burrito with shredded chicken and all of the fixings. No refried beans here. Nope, real black beans. Even better.

Defininitely a winner and a healthier (I think) alternative to the fast food places located in the airport. Certainly better for your heart than Cinnabon.
