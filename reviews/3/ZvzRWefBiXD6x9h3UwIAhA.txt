I am not sure why everyone loves this place so much.   I went here many years ago and I liked it better then.   Chips were good, salsa was tasty but not very spicy.  I asked our server whether the red or green chile was spicier.  He stated the salsa was hotter than either of them.  I am glad he was honest but I was a little disappointed.  I had the spinach enchiladas which were actually quite tasty.  Wait staff was very attentive.    It's not terrible, but I like my mexican food with a little sting to it!
