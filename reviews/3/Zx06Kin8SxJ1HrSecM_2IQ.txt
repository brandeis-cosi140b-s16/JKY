I've been to the location in Charlotte (Hawthorne Lane) and only tried the tacos there. At this location, I branched out and tried other items on their menu along with tacos of course. 

I had the quinoa avocado bowl (name might be a bit off) and I created a bowl. The bowl was disappointing. I chose grilled steak as my protein but I barely had any in there. It felt more like a vegetarian option for me. As for the quinoa and avocado selection, it tasted....healthy. The avocado was great and the sauce that came with it was tasty but there was nothing memorable about it. I'm so glad we still ordered tacos because I devoured those. I wish they had chicharron as an option! 

Service was great though, very friendly staff.
