Pros: The Papi and Conchintia tacos, cubano sandwich, and location.

Cons: Salsa was flavorless, micheladas aren't prepared well, service is slow, I like free chips and salsa (what, don't judge).

I expected more from this new restaurant, but it is new. I'm sure the business has a few kinks to work out. I believe the gentleman that greeted us halfway through dinner was the manager? It was a two word conversation. I would expect a bit more friendliness, especially on a Saturday at 9:00pm when there are a total of six people in the restaurant. 

The tacos are good! I would maybe get take-out for the tacos.
