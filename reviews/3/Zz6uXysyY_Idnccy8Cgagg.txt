I've been here way too many times now, and felt it was time to review.  

The service here is generally just okay.  They often forget to give me my drink or Doritos, but fix it without any hassle when asked.  The food itself I've never had an issue with; always pretty good.  Location is pretty convenient, even more so now that the 22 Illini bus stops right out front. 

Up until about a week ago, they had a bunch of "out of order tables" (broken tables), but recently they installed new menus, removed broken tables, and removed the railing for the wait line, so it's looking a little better, but the restaurant still isn't in that great of condition.

All-in-all, for being cheap and reliably good food, i'll give it 3 stars.
