Stopped here for lunch yesterday after an event at the Overture Center. I was looking for someplace that still had outdoor seating, given the beautiful day and this fit the bill.  They don't seem to have a lunch menu, though Tuesdays are $2 tacos (excluding the seafood tacos) and they had a decent wrap selection.  I went for the steak fajitas wrap which was tasty, but light on steak.  The 99 cent margarita was overly sweet as another reviewer mentioned.
