I do love me some Roberto's food! No, it isn't fancy or good for you in the least, but I do enjoy it from time to time.  I just wish I could talk my hubby into eating here more often.  Here's why I like Roberto's:

1. Huge portions!  I rarely can finish any meal that I order from here.  I almost always have leftovers that are great the next day.  

2. Good and cheap! My wallet is never crying after I pay for food here. You get a ton for what you pay for.  I love a good deal.

3. Super fast! It is totally fast food! This is great because I am usually in a rush.  I do think they should add a drive thru window though.  I rarely go, because I usually have a crazy 2 year old in the backseat and getting her in and out of her car seat is too much work most of the time.

4. It's open 24 hours! 

Why only 3 stars? Well...

1. The staff isn't particularly friendly.  They aren't mean or rude, but they aren't very welcoming either.

2. I do like it, but I don't make a huge effort to go there, which means it is just ok in my book.  I know that is totally subjective, but it is the truth. 

So I do enjoy Roberto's and everyone should try it at least once.  And if you do, try the Carne Asada fries!
