Solid little Mexican restaurant hole in the wall place.  Very friendly staff as  well as very clean restaurant which is a big pet peeve of mine.  Red and green sauce are good. If you like spicy go for the red it is pretty hot, good flavor though.  Portions are a little small and for street tacos 1.89 per taco did not seem worth the price.  Overall it's a solid 3 stars.  Honestly don't know if I'll be back, but would recommend to someone who has a Mexican food hankering....
