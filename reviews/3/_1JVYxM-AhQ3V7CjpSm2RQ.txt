I was excited when I saw that this place offered street tacos.  As a result I ordered 6 total tacos, carne asada, carnitas and pollo.

I would have given this place 3.5 stars after trying the pollo and carnitas tacos.  They are fresh and great tasting.  The carnitas was a bit too salty.  

The horchata was a bit too sweet as well, so overall, 3 stars is a good amount.
