Not my fave place but pretty good. They have a great Sunday Brunch Buffet  in which they have everything from fresh Menudo, to Carne Con Chile, Cheese Enchiladas and much more. They also serve complimentary Champagne and for a small extra charge you can order OJ and have some Mimosas. It's a great location to grab some food on the way into Old Town
