Love this place and would have given them 4 stars if I wasn't a little disappointed this time and the time before when I got delivery orders. Their food is usually really good and I feel well worth what they charge. Even though I live just a few blocks from the restaurant, for the first time in about two years, my food arrived cold. I had to put my cheese enchilada combo in the microwave before I could eat it. The raspberry tea which I always order was too sweet this time. My hard tacos were ok, but the pico de gallo (that I paid extra for) didn't look fresh. I paid 75Â¢ for about 2-3 tbs of guacamole. I think it should be free for that size. The first few times I ordered from Los Huicholes (sp?) I would have definitely given them 5 stars, but I'm disappointed now because as their fame and followers have increased (prices too), the quality consistency has decreased.
