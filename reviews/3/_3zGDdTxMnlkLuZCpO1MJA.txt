Salsa needs to be thicker...sorry. I didn't ask for water downed tomato juice with a little cilantro and chopped onion, but what did you give me....just that. Seriously this place is legit good. I am bitter about the salsa, but I will live. Decent service(it seems like when you ask they don't acknowledge you they just walk away and you hope they bring you what you want). All and all good stuff. 3 out of 5 ain't so bad.
