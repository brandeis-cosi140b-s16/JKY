Fast, reasonably priced. Not particularly stand out. You should really just go to Taqueria Guadelajara, but barring that...

Bottles of Sprecher's available for purchase (usually get a cream soda). My friends like their margaritas, Their rice and bean sides don't really do it for me, but if friends want to go I know I'll always enjoy a half order of the nachos  (which is plenty for me) with red chili pork.
