We strayed from our usual spot and wanted to try another place to get our 5times a week Margarita and bean fix on. (lets just say our house is named house of constipation :)) I found this one on Yelp and I have passed it several times as well

FIrst off: dont let the outside fool you. You will find a pretty decent mex restaurant inside. The prices are really good! The food is ok, i have never been to mexico so I cant judge. But i have had better :) but its cheaper for sure, and cheaper beans for the gassy night is always better :)

The margaritas are.. naja. thats german for so so. ITs ok :)
