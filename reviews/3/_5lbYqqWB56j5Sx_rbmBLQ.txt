I found this a little on the pricey side. We ordered the Cadillac Fajitas for two of us. There were like 6 small slices of meat. I mean, it was enough to feed us, but the price of $21.95 was very high for this amount of food, in my opinion. Waiter got our order wrong and when we brought it to his attention, he said it would be another 20 minutes or so to fix it, so we just ate what we had. Also, the waiter let us run out of water and once we had paid our check, never filled our water glasses again. We were on an extended dinner visit with friends we had not seen in a long time. I can understand not filling our water glasses if the place was crowded and they needed the table, but there were two other parties in the entire restaurant. We ran out or water, so we ate our ice, but when we ran out of ice, we had to leave.
The only reason I gave it three stars is that the food was really, really delicious.
