I'm not actually mexican, so I may have a bit of a bias for the more american vein of mexican food.

I waited for the perfect time and for when I was in the perfect condition to try this place- slightly drunk, and 12:45 AM. Upon walking into this fine establishment, I noticed it smelled like urine- like, as if I had walked into a public rest room. Because of this, I did not stay long here

I ordered a carne asada burrito that I enjoyed in the car on the way back home. And it was a-ok! The meat was good, loved the veggies and guac.... the highlight was definitely the tortilla. It tasted fresh. I do love me a fresh tortilla. It cost around 5 dollars, which is a great deal.

If you're up late and want some late night munchies, I definitely sugest roberto's. If you enjoy eating at establishments that don't reek of piss, then I would maybe hit up somewhere a little more expensive, where they probably pay their employees to clean.
