This La Canasta is OK. I'm sure some of you have your favorites but this defiantly is not mine.  We went here at lunch and it was busy but not over packed. It was around noon.  They don't clean off tables as soon as people leave so we were standing awkwardly asking them to please clean the table.  The waitress looked at us with this are you talking to me look on her face when we asked if we could get a table cleaned so we could sit down.  The chip area is a mess.  My food didn't arrive until half my coworkers were done eating.  I ordered the soup and when I went up to check on it they looked around for my ticket and then said it takes a little longer to make the soup.  BS you make that stuff in the morning.  You just have to slop it in a bowl and put in the microwave.  I know how it works back in the kitchen.  Finally my soup came 20 minutes later.  Do they offer me a refund? No of course not.  

To be fair the food is good.  But its the same food at every la canasta its owned by the same family.  This particular one is part of a group so you can consider it a local chain not a mom and pop.  They also own Silvia's.  

I would recommend not going to this one as the staff is terrible.  There is a way better one right off 7th ave in Phoenix.
