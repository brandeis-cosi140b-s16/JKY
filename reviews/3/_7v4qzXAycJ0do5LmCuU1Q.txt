This place is very very old. It can be a little bit intimidating when you first walk in ( we came in the back door). If you go in the back there is a little bit of Mexican history on the walls. Pretty neat reading all the little articles and looking at what the original cafe looked like. The lighting is dark and you feel transported to the magical year of 1980. 

Now to the real part the food! So like most Mexican restraints you start out with chips and salsa. The chips were fresh and the salsa was tasty but be warned they bring out three kinds from week to hot and they don't let you know which is which. Our waitress was on her break she was eating her dinner she stopped to wait our tables. I'm guessing they are short staffed. She took our order I got the steak machaca dinner and my woman got the taco and cheese enchilada. 

Food was brought out real fast and it was hot. I'm guessing that everything is pre made because it came out literally five minutes after we ordered it. The food taste very good. Very authentic but be warned the only difference between this place and the taco stand is you get to sit indoors and have to tip. My Machaca had so much grease there was literally a pool of oil in the bottom of my plate. We spent about 28 bucks on 2 beers and 2 dinners. 

We probably wont eat here again but its good to try once to at least eat at an original Glendale restaurant.
