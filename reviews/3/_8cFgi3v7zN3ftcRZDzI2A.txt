The food was excellent, but the service did not match the feel of the restaurant.  The restaurant is set up to be trendy and mexican, and all of the employees seemed to match the aesthetic.  It almost seemed like they hired their waiters based more on their look fitting in the the restaurant than their actual abilities.  We went as a large group, so it was expected that we would be there longer than if there was just a few of us, but 3 hours is a bit excessive!  It took 45 minutes to have our order even taken.  
For an upscale establishment, one expects better service than that.  

Fortunately, the food was awesome.   I ordered the special pork taco and their yucca fries.  The flavors melded so perfectly together in the taco, and it contained a lot of meat.  Also, all of the desserts were tried at our large table, and they were all tasty, but VERY sweet.  It would be nearly impossible to finish any one of them by yourself.  

Overall, the food was very good, but not redeeming enough for me to want to return.
