Manuel's makes it easy for me to go for long periods between visits with their forgetful servers, overpriced menu items, and bland tasting food. 

Here's my suggestion.

On those special nights when you're craving Margaritas, they have a Monday Margarita special; two dollars off any margarita. The perfect way to start the week.
I also recommend offering to babysit your niece or nephew, load him or her up on sweets before leaving the house, come here and use the little bastard to order off of the "Lil Bandido' menu. That little maneuver alone will save you a bundle off your bill.

The servers here are rushed, likely to not notice your ganking the Lil Bandido meal for yourself, or how you gave his Ritalin prescription a healthy shove with the Margaritas. 

When they do stop by to check on you, They'll be too busy making a fuss over how cute he / she is. 
A little tequila, a little Ritalin, no lullaby for this little guy....not on Monday nights anyway.

Note; It takes me two Lil Bandido's to get full. I don't recommend this. As lame as the servers are, they have a nose for Lil Bandido thieves.
