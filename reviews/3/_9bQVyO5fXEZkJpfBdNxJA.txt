We went to this place when they first opened and felt they had a very limited menu. We decided to go back and give it another try. While the food was tasty, the special on Friday was the Sopa de Marisco ( a seafood soup). The amount of seafood in it was a joke. A few shells and a couple of shrimp, 3 crab leg halves....I would of expected more for 14.95. It comes with a small piece of bread as well. The service was good and the food came out very quickly.
