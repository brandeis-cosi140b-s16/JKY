I live close to the Mexico border and am used to authentic Mexican food, so my review is maybe harsh. I would give it 2 stars, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt since the guac was spot on. The chips were good, and the tortillas are made in house. But everything went downhill from there. We ordered the fajitas, and they were a serious disappointment. Still trying to figure out why my chicken came out so greasy and red? And I also didn't get the beans. Were they aiming for the refried taste? I won't be back. The name of the restaurant is more appealing than the food.
