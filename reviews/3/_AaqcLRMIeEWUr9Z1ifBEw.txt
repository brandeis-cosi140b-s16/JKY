I ended up here one ill-fated Valentines Day.  I should have taken it as a sign.

We wanted to go get burgers at Ichabod's, but they were only serving lobster.  We were in a rush to get home and try the merlot I'd bought for the occasion, so we ended up here.  It's a place I've driven by countless times and have heard rave reviews about, but it was just mediocre.

We had to wait for quite some time until we were seated, and when we were the service proved to be pretty slow.  The chips and salsa were brought out and since I absolutely can't resist chips and salsa I drove right in.  Minutes later I was still sitting there with my mouth on fire and no drink.  We had to ask for them again.

My enchiladas suizas were good, but the tortilla was mushy as if the plate had been sitting under a lamp for a while, and the sauce was more of a sour cream than an actual cream sauce.  My dining partner enjoyed his selection (I can't remember exactly what it was) but like me he didn't have any rave reviews.

That boyfriend and I are still friendly, but we're not in close contact.  Same thing with Chapala's and me.
