I really love Chipotle and I wanted this review to be better, but there are a few problems I had with my most recent jaunt to this particular Chipotle in Henderson. 

Typically I order the same thing all the time: Chicken Burrito, black beans, easy on the rice, cheese, a bit of sour cream, hot salsa, and lettuce. I will note that this incident has happened to me before at Chipotle, but this one was the most recent. It is when the people making it don't take care to make sure the ingredients are dispersed throughout the burrito. Sometimes I can deal with this, but the reason I was so disappointed in this particular case is because it was not even busy in the place so the employees had no excuse not to make me a perfect burrito, which is what I expect.

I'll still return here if I'm in the area, but my favorite Chipotle in Las Vegas has got to be the one on Maryland Parkway directly across from UNLV. They are always nice, and consistently make me perfect Chipotle burritos. 

Chipotle is awesome in and of itself. I love that the owners are dedicated to serving the freshest of fresh veggies, cheeses, and meats. (They even indicate in the store if they happen to be having problems with getting the meat as fresh as possible). I do wish Chipotle had a cheese sauce option like Qdoba does, but I guess that might be because it wouldn't hold up to their "freshest" possible standards.

Chipotle is definitely my go-to quick, Mexican burrito place in Las Vegas. They have locations pretty much everywhere and the food is good.
