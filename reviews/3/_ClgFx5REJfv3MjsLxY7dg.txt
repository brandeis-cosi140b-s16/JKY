Do not stretch your arms out wide at this place.

It's a small joint, so I thought they would have some kick ass food.  Wellllll....because the lady who tended to us was so nice I really don't want to speak ill of the joint, but I was hoping to have some good Mexican food like I was used to having in Southern California.  

When I walked in, I could smell the aromas of masa and tortillas in the air.  I thought I was back home.  Not.

The menu was colorful and had a nice variety of choices.  The basics are served here:  tamales, enchiladas, burritos, tacos and breakfast if you're there on time.  

When we were all seated, we were served freshly made corn chips, fresh salsa and drinks.  I chose the chicken enchilada, beef tamale and rice & beans combo.  While waiting for my food, I noticed the restaurant had a personal touch and was kept clean.  It was small and very old, but at least the service was prompt and friendly.  

My food was slightly disappointing in that it was "ok".  I doubt I would go back there, but I wouldn't refuse to go, if that makes any sense.  It didn't blow my dress up, so I just have to go with 3 stars.
