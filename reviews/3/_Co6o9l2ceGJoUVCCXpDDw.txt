Cool place in Charlotte's Southside (in my gangsta voice). Went in and they were playing Prince so they had me at hello! Was really interested in trying the bbq burrito so that's I did. Interesting mix of flavors there...burrito was HUGE so I had to save some for later. Had plenty of parking across the street. Was a little disappointed in the salsa bar...looked like it needed to be refreshed a little so I passed on that. Overall it was ok...I'd go back again but it's not on my crave list.
