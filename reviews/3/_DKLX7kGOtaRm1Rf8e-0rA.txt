A solid little lunch spot with lunch specials priced from $6-10.  The atmosphere is a nice, quiet reprieve from the hustle and bustle of the office on a stress filled day.  I like to take my phone for reading and entertainment during a solo mid day chow sesh.  The staff is really nice and attentive.  I can normally get in and complete my meal with plenty of time to spare before my lunch hour has expired.  

Although I enjoy Mi Tierra for a midday bite, I can't honestly recommend them for dinner time.  I've been severely spoiled by the gourmet Mexican grub at Bonito Michoacan.  If I have the time to make the drive, then Bonito is my destination.
