Baja Miguel's has some good Mexican at an okay price. Not the best Mexican food I have ever had, but certainly not the worst. The tray of dipping items is nice and their guacamole is good. 

The wait time can get lengthy the later you wait to go. It's best to get there earlier in the evening. The hostess we had was very rude. She acted as if we were imposing on her time by even coming. Our waitress was nice, but never seemed to be around. My husband's glass was empty twice and we had to ask for the refills. 

Again, the food is good but don't expect exceptional service.
