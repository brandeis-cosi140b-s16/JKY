the last few times I've been here I've been disappointed. the pizza is rich and I would probably rather eat it over grampas, ians, roman candle, pizza brutta, or Greenbush bar, but at the same time I've had better pizza at the sun Prairie location. there was a lot of anticipation for this location to open, and they didn't seem quite ready for it. on one occasion, I ordered the forestiere, which reads on a menu like the single most delicious combination ever, but it was simply underwhelming. my guess is that the consistency in the kitchen is lacking. I've had bad service here too. I consider myself a pretty low maintenance diner, but the wait times were so bad I had to get the attention of other employees. and they're a little self indulgent. one time after we eat, the server checks in with us and asks almost rhetorically "best pizza you ever ate?"

Umm, no, not even remotely close.
