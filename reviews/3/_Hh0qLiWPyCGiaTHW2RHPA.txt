I would have given this place 2 stars but the food was good. Staff was fairly inattentive, only checked on me once. Beer was not ice cold, and no draft selection. Food was pretty good. I can't remember the name of what I got but it was pork chops on top of a bed of typical Mexican restaurant salad fixings, shredded lettuce, tomato, with a side of white rice and refried beans and fried plantains which were good but some of them were dry and almost cold. Overall I would say meh, I've had better. Also the restaurant seems to be for Latino people not Americans. I did like that everything on the menu had a pic!
