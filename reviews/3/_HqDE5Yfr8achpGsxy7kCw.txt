I can't move beyond the scolding I received for attempting to sit at one of the three empty tables in the bar area. It was on off-peak time and indeed the tables remained unused for the duration of my visit, and my only option was the main bar with lighting inadequate for my planned perusal of the Phoenix New Times.

I'm not sure why the New Mexico platter includes bacon-wrapped shrimp. Is that a traditional New Mexican offering? The chicken burro was somewhere between Applebee's and movie theater concession caliber. The relleno was good. But the best part of this platter is the chile. The green is as excellent as its reputation and the red gives a fiery kick.

The carne adovada sliders put the red chile to good use and were also larger than typical sliders.
