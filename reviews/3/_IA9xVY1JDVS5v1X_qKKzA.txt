So I came here twice, once for happy hour and once at night.

I would not come here just for the food, even though I hear their food is pretty good and the menu is huge.. Visually, the atmosphere doesn't strike me as a place id like a nice "hot plate" from, but rather just drinks and maybe some tacos to go. 

For Happy hour its cool, and I would recommend. They have cool bartenders and a cool crowd..
Id pass on the Night life here. The crowd isn't very attractive, not just on looks but over all. Bad night idk?
