Normally, I would prefer not to come to Mad Mex, especially the Shadyside location. It is always crowded and loud and just not fun. I have always felt the service to be sub-par and the food to be just not good. HOWEVER, this time I came for the Gobblerito.

I think it goes without saying that the food was good. The Gobblerito really is a delicious item. The gravy is good, the turkey meat quality is good, the ingredients aren't soggy or disgusting. It really is a quality thanksgiving meal.

Also, this time, our waitress was actually really great! We were having really absurd hilarious conversations, and she finally walked by and mentioned that she thought we were hilarious. She also accurately gave us all our orders (easy, cuz they were all Gobbleritos, but we did have some modifications). Alcohol service was also quick. And she really was quite pleasant and didn't even bat an eyelash when we asked to split our check 6 ways (which, we know is a pain, and so we all tipped her extra well).

So, all in all, my last trip to Mad Mex in Shadyside was a great experience even though I usually find it obnoxious there.
