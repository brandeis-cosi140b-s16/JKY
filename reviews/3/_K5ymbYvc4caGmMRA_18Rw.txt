A small group of us came here on 5/17/13. We went here for breakfast and among the 5 of us we had everything from Huevos Rancheros, Chilaquiles,Micheladas, Pancakes, Los Huevos de Nacho and I had the Cabo Special Breakfast Platter. 

I tasted a bit of everyone's dish, (I was the belated celebrated birthday girl,) so I was taking advantage of my moment. All the dishes were tasty. The micheladas were decent. The bacon was perfectly crunchy. The pancakes were fluffy. The coffee was average. I really liked the potatoes in my dish, but the meat was NOT asada and I had asked for it well-done and got tough charcoal. 

Overall, for our first visit here, it was a good experience. Our server was really friendly, and attentive and went along with all our goofiness and antics. 

I give it three stars because it was just our first visit and I have not tasted anything from their lunch and dinner menus. but would return.
