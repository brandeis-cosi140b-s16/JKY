I'm absolutely in love with the decor and the whole look/feel of the restaurant. From the mason jars, the wooden walls, opened garage doors to let in that beautiful 72 degree weather and a John Wayne movie in the background.

*Food wise: I highly recommend the pastor and short rib! Whatever fish they used for the tacos tasted kinda cheap. Their guacamole had lots of lime in it and was way too chunky (looked like they half-assed putting it together... a little cilantro, maybe?)

*Service: Slow. It took forever to order and get our waitress' attention. I asked for a water AND a coke right away but she gave me the water halfway through my food. It also took forever to get the check after! It was already 9pm and I was suppose to leave to drive back to Atlanta after dinner.

I'll give this place another shot since according to my friends, it's the new hotspot. Until next time, Bakersfield.
