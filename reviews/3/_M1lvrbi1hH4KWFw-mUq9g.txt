Man, I don't know how to feel about this place.

I mean, I want to like it. It's near my office. The prices are fair. The food is good. The place is clean. They have a lot of salsa and stuff. But, that's just it. Everything seems par for the course here. There isn't anything that really blows me out of the water. 

The only thing that makes me like this place is that the service is always fast. That cannot be denied! Still, that's not enough to keep me coming here over going to other places.
