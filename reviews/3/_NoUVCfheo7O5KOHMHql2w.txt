Was in the area for an event at Surprise Stadium and was super hungry.  Dropped by here to grab a quick bite.  

Ordered:
Veggie Works Burrito, $2.89

Of course I had to get a ton of Inferno Sauce...yum!  The employees were very friendly...have to give a shout out to the cashier, Anna Lissa, who had a great smile and service.
