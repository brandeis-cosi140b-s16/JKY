Not impressed. 

I came here with a friend recently for dinner. They have a huge menu, and, not being familiar with their food, decided to play it safe with a chicken burro (also, it was less expensive). What I was brought at first looked akin to a huge, flat fish on a platter -took me a bit to realize it was a burrito. It was literally just a flat, super (or should I say souper) saucy burrito with a splash of lettuce on the side. It seriously lacked flavor, and wasn't worth the price. I'm sure some of the fancier things may be good, but I wouldn't eat here again unless I had to.
