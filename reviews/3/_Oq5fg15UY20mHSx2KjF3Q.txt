I had three cheese enchilada plate with rice and beans. It was very tasty. No complaints from this order. Mom ordered combination #23 and was very unhappy because Enchilada was stiff, the taco and the tostada were both soggy and were made with Taco Bell style ground beef. Hubby ordered shrimp chile relent, shredded beef taco, and enchiladas and was pleased. I ordered the pancake sandwich plate with eggs and sausage for my son.  He loved everything. Atmosphere was very traditional, however, it was extremely dirty. There were spiderwebs above our heads and on decor.  Seats were very old and uncomfortable. Not sure I will come back.
