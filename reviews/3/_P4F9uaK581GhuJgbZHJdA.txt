The food is great. And for a fast food restaurant, the menu seems to change often. It's never the same boring stuff. 

The reason I gave them 3 stars, the staffing and production is a little wacky. I have had them take my order, give me a table number and a cup, then 15 minutes goes by and they never cooked my meal. 

Long waits at the counter to get them to take an order, yet there's plenty of staff. You feel ignored. It's almost like the catering and drive thru orders are more important.

Today they took my order and gave me a table number sign, and my drink cup. Then when the order was ready, instead of bringing it to the table like they have in the past, they were shouting my number. Why the number sign then?  Every other place that hands that sign to you uses it as a way to find your table. 

Just bizarre
