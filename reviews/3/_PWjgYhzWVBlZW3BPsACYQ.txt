Pancheros is 50 feet from my house so it's great from a convenience and laziness standpoint. I typically get their chicken quesadilla. It's tasty and gets the job done. Their tortillas are good, but I don't love the rest of the options on the menu. The tacos are alright but they only come two to an order...

When it's busy, it can be painfully slow. The service is friendly, but they usually only have two people working at a time so if there are more than 3 people ahead of you, expect to wait a while. 

It's so close and convenient that I'll continue to visit often and keep dominating their chicken quesadilla.
