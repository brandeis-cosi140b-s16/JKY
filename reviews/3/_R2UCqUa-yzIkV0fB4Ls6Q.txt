I like the combination of pan dulce and breakfast or lunch burritos all in the same place. I can take a meal to go and some pan dulce for the next day! The food is very tasty, not the best ive tasted, but no where near 'not good'. 
Only draw back was the salsa was a lil watered down, overall, i likes, i would recommend and would go back, I give 3.5 stars.
