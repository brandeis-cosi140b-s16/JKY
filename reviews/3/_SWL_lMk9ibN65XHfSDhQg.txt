First time I have been in the Southside Works in forever. Stopped down to see a movie and decided to stay for a ute to eat after. Roamed along and found this place. I would say typical Mexican restaurant. 
Decor looked a little like a cross between lower end dining of Chipotle and higher end restaurant. Service was friendly and quick. There is outside seating but none available when we stopped. Would be nice to sit outside. 
Beer and margarita specials.
We ordered guacamole which is made to order table side. A little on the pricey end with 9.99, but it is pretty big and chips are complimentary. Very good guacamole! I could probably have eaten this and the chips and salsa for me meal. 
I ordered the chimichanga cancun which is with shrimp and their cheese sauce. This was really good and huge. Comes with rice and fresh lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream. I took more than half of this home. Friends had same and chicken chimichanga. All was really good. Priced fairly for portions and the service was excellent. Place was very busy. 
All in all it was decent Mexican food. Don't eat beforehand as you'll be stuffed when you are finished.
