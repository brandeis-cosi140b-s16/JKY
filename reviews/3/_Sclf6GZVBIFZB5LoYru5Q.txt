My family came to this place after reading about a new Mexican restaurant opening. I like these restaurants that are converted houses. They've also decorated the inside to have a more "traditional" Mexican restaurant feel. 

The salsa was very watered down and not very good, but the chips were good.

To start, we ordered the chicken and pork sopes as an appetizer. Both were good and filling. Could easily be a meal in itself. 

For our dishes, the best was the al pastor taco and the chicken tamales. If you add a radish and rajas to the taco, they're as good as you can find. The tamale was very good too with some salsa splashed on it.

Other than that, we ordered a variety of enchiladas with mole and the green salsa. The mole wasn't my fav but it was ok. The green salsa enchiladas were similarly ok. Can't really object to them but probably wouldn't get them again.

Overall, place is alright. Would go back for the tacos
