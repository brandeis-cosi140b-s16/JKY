We arrived at 10:05 and were disappointed that the menudo was not ready which was the reason we went.  The horchata was not homemade and was on the sweet side with no hint of cinnamon. I had huevos a la mexicana and it was OK. The best item we ordered was the carne asada quesadilla. I will try it again to try their street tacos.
