I'll pretty much always go back because they are so close and delicious, but the service here is definitely lacking. 

I'd say about half the time, they get our order wrong, which is bizarre since we're there so often and pretty much always order the same thing. 

One time we ordered a bean and cheese burrito, and a kid's carne asada quesadilla, and they made us a normal sized quesadilla and a bean/carne asada burrito... which was pretty gross. 

The staff is rarely polite, and get annoyed when you ask for green sauce. They still get three stars though because the food is crazy yummy!
