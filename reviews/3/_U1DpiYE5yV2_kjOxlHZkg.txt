Three stars is OK thats what this place is. The only thing we had that had any flavor was the guacamole this is the one thing we had that was good. Nothing we had had any flavor the meat was not seasoned at all. The only thing that kind of saved the tacos was a little tabasco and some of the guac. The service was like everything else OK, had two people waiting our table, one guy took our drink order and dinner order but then we had a girl that was getting us refills on things then the guy was back with dinner, both of them were busing the table and he asked about desserts we asked for the check and he said that the girl would bring it to us. The girl was really the better of the two, so who am I tipping? So nothing bad here, but nothing good here either. Prices not bad about $35.00 for the two of us with drinks. Probably not going to be a repeat customer can do much better in C-U then this.
