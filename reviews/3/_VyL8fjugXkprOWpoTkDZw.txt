I can see why people like this place (big portions, chips!), but I didn't find the food memorable.  It could be it's one of the few eating places in Wickenburg open past 8 p.m.  It's difficult to find unique Mexican food in the Southwest.  And you're not going to fin unique Mexican food in Wickenburg.
