We go here quite a bit due to convenience. I think the quality's gone down a bit since they first opened. The food's decent but nothing really stand out, the service is mediocre but they're fairly quick and close to our house.

The California burrito served at other locations includes sour cream and guac, not at this one though they charge you extra.
