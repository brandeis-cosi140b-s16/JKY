The food wasn't as good as I hoped. I got chicken enchiladas with red sauce. The sauce tasted like something you could get in a can at any grocery store and the enchilada filling was mediocre at best. Really just boring. My dad ordered something that looked like a pile of melted cheese with chili on top. He loved it, but I thought it looked disgusting. I'm still not sure what it was that he ordered. The best part of the meal for me was the chips and salsa beforehand. The green sauce/salsa was very good and the chips were nice and fresh with just the right amount of salt.

The service was fine. Neither terrible nor amazing. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time, but mine was not very hot (still warm, but barely). Can't comment on my Dad's plate, as he didn't mention anything about the temperature.

I would probably give this place another shot sometime to see if maybe I was just there on an off-day.
