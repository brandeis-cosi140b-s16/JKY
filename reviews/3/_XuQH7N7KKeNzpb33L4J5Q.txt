Went in for happy hour before the Coyotes game. I liked the laid back feel  the service was good. We shared chicken nachos and it was a good size portion. Between that and chips and salsa we were full. Good specials in beers. The margarita was so so. 
It seemed like later in the evening it would be a happening place. There was a band setting up outside in the area where it was set up like a beach and more people were coming in the later it got. We loved that you could buy buckets of beer. This would be a fun place to be with a large group of people.
