The inside is decorated really divy by in a nice way. It kind of reminded me of a place on the island of Hawaii. The tacos were good. I ordered the $4.99 special of 3 tacos and a drink. We ordered the steak, chicken, fish, potato and carnitas tacos. The steak being our least favorite. Not very flavorful but the carnitas was good and the potato taco was different. The owner was extremely nice and very helpful. They have a TON of hot sauces to chose from (all bottled).  

PROS: Good prices and specials that included a beverage. 

CONS: Tacos were smaller than we expected (like street tacos in Mexico). Therefore the filling was a small portion.
