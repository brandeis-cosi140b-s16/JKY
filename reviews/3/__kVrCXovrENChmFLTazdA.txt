This place has a great atmosphere and location.   Also overrated.   We were seated and didn't get chips and salsa until we ordered an entree.  The salsa had a burnt taste.  Different strokes for different folks.  I preferred the chicken tacos.   Nothing fancy. My palette was expecting a bit more from all the reviews.   My wallet was not expecting it to be about $25 per person for an entree and 1 beer.  #beentheredonethat #next  maybe it was an off night.  Idk but we won't be going back.   Too many other places calling my name!!  #yoquierotacobell
