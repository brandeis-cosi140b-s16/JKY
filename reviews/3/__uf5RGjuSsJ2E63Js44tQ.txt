I usually really enjoy their margaritas and limited menu but I tried the skirt steak this time.  I would avoid the skirt steak at all costs. It's the second worst airport steak I have ever encountered. Over cooked, fatty, and I was unable to cut with a knife. I will stick with the chicken next time. 

Great location (between C and D) and quick service.
