Ive eaten here for 7 years or so now. I enjoy the food, typical mexican. Their shredded chicken is one of my favorites of all the mexican places I eat it. Good service, never had to wait, patio is nice when it isnt blazing hot. Lunch prices are good, dinner I usually split a combo since its a good amount of food!
