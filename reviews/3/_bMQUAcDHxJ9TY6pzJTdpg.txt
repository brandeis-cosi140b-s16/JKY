I've come to this location or another many a times but never gave a review. Today I came in to treat my Mom to a Father's Day lunch. We got here at around 11:30am to beat the lunch rush and glad we did. Figured it would be a hot spot for Father's Day. By 12:15pm and almost done with our lunch, the place was packed. We could barely hear ourselves think. Good for them! 

The staff was really nice and attentive. Something that I appreciate. Where it missed the mark was the food. I have never left here or any other Lindo location raving about the meal, so I knew what I was getting walking into the door. I wanted my Mom to try it out to see if I were just being too picky in comparison to my other favorite Mexican restaurant. The chips and salsa were amazing and the highlight of the meal. I got the veggie burritos and Mom got the chicken chimichanga. While both were pretty good, we had both had better elsewhere.

At the end of the day, if you are looking for true, authentic Mexican food, I don't think this place will do it for you. At least it doesn't do it for me. I like the true, authentic feel other Mexican restaurants have given me with a more intimate setting. This place is built to accommodate the masses, which leads me to believe that something is bound to be off if there's a full house.
