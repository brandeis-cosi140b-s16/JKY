So I came here when they very first opened. And it was a train wreck. The employees sucked, the manager wasn't managing, and the food came out like a retarded cousin of a burrito. I was truly upset because I used to love going to the Moe's in BloNo. But I figured it was literally their second day open I will come back in a few weeks and give them a second chance.

2nd time around, service was a lot better, and the food quality has improved. 

If you don't know what Moe's is, it's basically chipotle. As an admit hater of chipotle i actually prefer the Americanized Moe's. Because let's be real chipotle is not real Mexican food it just pretends to be. 

If you like burritos and don't want to shit yourself for a week come here over chipotle. But don't expect beautiful scenery or super cheap prices. Yeah it's probably going to cost you 10-12 dollars for your meal, do you think you can swing that? I like Moe's maybe with time the employees and the service will get better. My advice is come here at an off time or else you might get stuck waiting for a very long time
