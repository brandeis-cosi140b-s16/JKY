Womp womp. We went here for dinner and sat at our table for more than 15 minutes without a server coming to see us. My husband stopped a server to ask if he could help us and it appears there was confusion as to which server's section our table was in. Once we got a server to help us though, things ran smoothly. Our meals came out quickly and our server was attentive.

I ordered the enchiladas verde and thought it was okay. It was a little lacking in the flavor department. The green sauce was good and spicy, but the shredded chicken inside the tortillas was very bland. 

My husband got the chorizo tacos and really enjoyed them.

We had the guacamole as an appetizer and I thought it was good. We actually ended up getting a second order and devoured both! The chips were freshly made and delish.
