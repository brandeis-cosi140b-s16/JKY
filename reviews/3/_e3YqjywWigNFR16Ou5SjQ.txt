I have been going to Chinos since I was in elementary school before the Chandler location existed. We would go once a week growing up. Once I moved to Tempe for school, I was having some serious Chinos withdrawals until finally they opened the Chandler location. For a while, it was hit or miss with the food and It seemed that the Chandler location was the red headed step child. The recipes weren't being followed as closely as they should. I made the necessary calls to the Phx location about the questionable jade red chicken that tasted more like a ketchup chicken and after that, the chandler location seemed to get better. Until last week, the staff was rude and the red pens to write down my order disappeared and when I casually asked what happened to the red pens, the 16 year old manning the cash register gave me a dirty look and said 'I dunno?' -which wasn't a big deal, aside from chinos having red pens my entire life. It's just a way of life at chinos. You wrote down your order on the piece of paper with the red pen and then you come up w a funny name for the order. And the whole place kind of smelled like sewer which isn't ideal when you are eating. Anyway, the food didn't taste up to par either. It wasn't bad- it just didn't taste the same as it always has. I love chinos to the moon and back but someone needs to take a closer look at the Chandler location and stop letting it fall too far from the tree.
