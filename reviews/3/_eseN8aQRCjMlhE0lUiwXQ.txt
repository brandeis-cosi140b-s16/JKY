This restaurant was recommended by a hotel staffer from the hotel nearby. She mentioned that it was authentic Mexican and that it was one of her favorite places, so my co-worker and I decided to try it out. Seeing as I love Mexican food, it was an obvious decision to go. It wasn't too far from the hotel, just a few hundred feet actually.The staff was very friendly. We were greeted and seated  within seconds. Chips, salsa and re-fried beans appeared on our table within minutes. The restaurant was very clean, with brownish walls and decorated with the typical decor you'd see in any Mexican restaurant. We were there around noon, it wasn't overly busy, but busy enough during lunch. Our waitress was friendly and prompt. I'd say our food arrived within 5 minutes of us ordering our food. I had ordered the 2 combination special, and had chosen a chille relleno and a chicken enchilada. I'd have to say, that both were just okay. I was expecting the chile relleno to be quite delicious,but it was just all right. The chile had some heat to it, but the egg batter was all mushy and the cheese wasn't gooey and melted enough. The chicken enchilada was a little better. The chicken was tastier and soft.  The rice was pretty dry. Wasn't as great as I thought, or was expecting. I probably wont' be back, I'd like to try other restaurants in the area. But, it was definitely worth the try. Great service though! Maybe it's what I ordered!
