A veg burrito is not where it is at.

On my second trip I went for the vegetarian burrito $3.75 again it came with a small tray of chips and a lettuce garnish. The wait was a bit long this time. I felt the tortilla was far too large for this burrito creating large amounts of extra tortilla, and it did not seem that soft to me.  The filling of beans, lettuce , a few veggies and guacamole was not well distributed and lacked inspiration.

The hot sauce is still good but  I am in no rush to head back here.
