I love Taco Bell. It's my fast food of choice. This location is like most other locations. It's the closest to my house, so I go here quite often. The service is always fast and friendly. The food is consistent. As much as I like Taco Bell, it's still Taco Bell so can't bring myself to give more than 3 stars.
