I have been to many taco, burritos, and carne asada fries places and this place is alright. 

First, they really need to turn down the tv in order to understand me when I give my order.  Place isn't too crowded nor too pricey.  I had to give their carne asada fries a try.. I'm a sucker when it comes to french fries.  Overall, I think that it was not too bad, but they should have put the sour cream and guacamole on the top of the meat.. It just made the fries soggy and soft.  I did give their salsa and pico de gallo sauce a try, but was too impress since it wasn't hot enough.  I believe they have another spicier sauce, but you have to ask.. I think it would be much easier for them and me if you just put it out..

Place does accept major credit cards and offer cups for water. Seating is open and it's a clean it yourself when you're done kind of place.  There is a TV and a salsa bar.  Drinks are soft self served.
Parking is pretty open since it's a huge parking lot with Vons.  

I'll def give this place another try since they have that huge 2 foot long burrito for $15.  Just have to come when I'm really hungry.
