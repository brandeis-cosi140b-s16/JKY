I am going to give this place only 3 stars.  The reason is I went in today and ordered a Vegetarian bowl and the people behind the counter had NO IDEA what that meant.  They did not know that it included guacamole and tried to charge me for it.  Even though they have fajita vegetables, (bell peppers & onions), apparently this is NOT included in the Vegetarian Bowl at this place and they want to charge extra.  

So, I guess a Vegetarian bowl in their eyes is the same as any other item but without meat.  The menu even specifies guacamole is included but they are clueless.  If the vegetarian items do not include any and all vegetables they have available, I DO NOT see the point in visiting this place again.  There are a lot of competitors who will give you what you desire without question.

Hopefully someone in management will read this and respond, otherwise I DO NOT RECOMMEND this place for Vegetarians.
