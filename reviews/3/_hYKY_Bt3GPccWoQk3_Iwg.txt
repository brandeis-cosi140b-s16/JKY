The food was awesome, the service was horrible. 

I got the Alambre tacos sans bell peppers and it was one of the best things I've tasted. The tortillas were perfectly thick and soft, the meat wasn't over-cooked, and the bacon and onions were a perfect compliment. The complimentary chips and salsa (comes with three types) were great, too - especially the verde sauce.
My mother is on a restrictive diet so she asked the waitress if it was possible to get a side of vegetables instead of beans and rice. We expected a nice selection of squash, corn, peppers etc. (as are listed available for their vegetarian options). However, she received a bowl of what looked like canned mixed vegetables. Nonetheless, everything else on the plate was fine.
Prices were a little higher than your average Mexican restaurant, but what I got was quality, so it's worth the few extra dollars.

It took way too long to get our order taken and our check given, and then the waitress gave us the wrong change (short $10!) and it took awhile to get her attention to fix it. While it was dinner time (6-7pm) on a week night, it was not busy at all. 
I would go back just because my tacos were so great tasting but I will have to try a different location to see if the service is more timely.
