I have been here twice now. First time it seemed expensive so I avoided it for a long time. In search of something different we ventured here again and while it wasn't as expensive as I remember the food just wasn't quite on. 

Margaritas: way too much sour. I didn't finish mine. That never happens. 

Empanadas: seemed frozen/reheated

Dates: can't go wrong here. Tasty but only 4

Tenderloin from tapas: tasty. Potatoes weren't the real deal but I thought it was good enough. There was something cheap about the steak. 

Corn cakes: sugar bomb. I honestly didn't taste anything corn about these guys. They were dressed with maple syrup seemed more like a pancake. The bf enjoyed them so they got a few points. 

All in all, tapas are no bueno. I will try one more time because I like the area, but I'll go for an item off the menu -- sandwich or entre.
