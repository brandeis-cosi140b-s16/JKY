I love me some fajitas so since it's in the name of this place it should be good. Note that I said "should be" good. I want to first point out that the service here was great. Our waiter came back to see if we needed anything and even brought more then 1 bean dip and salsa for the table without us asking. Most of the time you get a tiny cup to share with a group of people but these were decent sized salsa and bean dips and requesting more was no charge. I didn't care for the salsa and it was thin. The bean dip was good and liked by our table. A cup of Fideo soup was included with the meal and it was really good. For dinner I had a 2 item combo. Chili Relleno, Cheese Enchilada and of course rice and beans. The beans were good because it was probably the same bean dip we were eating previously. The rice was dry and nasty. My plate was swimming in red sauce and some of it was soggy. The relleno wasn't great but I did enjoy the enchilada, soggy and all. This plate could have had less sauce so you could get more flavor from what was under it. My wife and a friend had fajitas and I ended up eating a couple. The meat was tough and chewy and the vegetables weren't even cooked. My wife is also in love with avocados and was not pleased with their guacamole at all. Maybe we came on an off night because this appears to be a popular place and the restaurant had plenty of customers in it. I just can't say I ate anything that I would come back for.
