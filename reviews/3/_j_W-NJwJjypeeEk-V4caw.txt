They get only (3) stars simply because they advertise things they never seem to have. I went in one week everyday for (4) days asking for Pasole and they kept telling me they didnt have it. So on the last day i said " Can i get discounted on my burrito then since ive been coming everyday for Pasole and getting something else"? They gave me a $.50 discount. Really??!! Then i made a suggestion that they remove the sign in the window that says Pasole since they never have it. Its still up there right today and ive called to ask if they had Pasole and of course it was no. 
Dont advertise something as an everyday item if you dont have it everyday. Thats all im saying. The food is good but ive had better.
