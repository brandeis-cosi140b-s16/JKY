So this is a place I'll come back to -- if other people want to go.  Meaning our experience was okay, with no big failures to keep me away, but I wasn't blown away by the food either.

The chips were good, if under salted, and the salsa's were alright.  The anathema I feel for cilantro means I'll ask for an alternative if all salsas include it.  They chopped up some fresh tomato, onion and jalape√±o for me even though the hottest salsa was cilantro-free. This was actually one of the highlights - and much appreciated.

My chili relleno was very cheesy and beef enchilada pretty standard.  Filling and acceptable, though I agree with some other reviews that mention under-seasoned dishes.  The wife had a shredded beef taco and chicken enchilada which she was happy with.

The virgin strawberry margarita was freshly blended and completely finished by wifey - while my "Julios Margarita" on the rocks was your standard marg - tasty and sour and reasonably poured.

So we left - tummies filled, wallet appropriately dented, having been pleasantly served (if a little slow at the start given the very few late diners, but the speed the food came out made up for it).
