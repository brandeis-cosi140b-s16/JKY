GREAT MARGARTAS!  Still, I'm not a fan of chain restaurants.  If you're looking for really authentic Mexican, don't go here- BUT this place isn't bad if you just want some Mexican cuisine.  

I've been here with friends and family and the margaritas always make it a good time.  My food has never been that memorable though.
