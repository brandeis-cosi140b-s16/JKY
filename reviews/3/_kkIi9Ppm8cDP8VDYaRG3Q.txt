This place has a fun atmosphere. It has a live band on Friday night as an example. I ordered the Sea Food Enchiladas which was pretty good. It was stuff with cheese, shrimp and scallops wit sides of bean and rice. I cleaned the whole plate and I don't usually eat beans.  Tip - parking isn't always the best.
