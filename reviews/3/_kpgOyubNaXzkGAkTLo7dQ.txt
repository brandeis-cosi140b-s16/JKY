I haven't been to Chapala's in a long time, 
I just happened to be around the area so I decided to drop by. 
I was seated fast by the hostess, and I didn't have to wait long for my food which is good. However, while I was waiting for my food, the silverware was exposed the on the table without being wrapped in a linen cloth. I thought that was weird. 

I ordered the Mole Enchiladas, it was good.
It could have been seasoned a bit more then it would have tasted great.
The flan was sweet but it lacked flavor.

Overall I had a decent experience.
