Every tale about drinking involves greasy food that makes you want to die. El Taco Feliz is just that place. You can get your drunk on and not get belligerent. Connected to Money Plays, they give you the option to dine in or get it delivered next door. 

The carnitas tacos are not super fatty and that is what I liked about them. The massive amount of meat is also a plus. For a couple of dollars, it is enough to fill up on less than $10. The rolled tacos were okay. When I am drunk. anything fried is the way to go, but not these. If Mexican does not sound good, that is okay. They have wings, burgers, fries, and more. At first, I did not see the Mexican fare in this hog pog collection. Having a nibble of most of these items, it was a good option for the proximity.
