Well I can't say that I have eaten the food here as they mixed up my order via drive thru. And I will say don't expect to go thru the drive thru quickly. I called to explain my situation and the phone call didn't quite make me feel great about this place but I was refunded no questions asked when I went in so I do plan to revisit this place again soon as I so badly want to find some good Mexican food in NE Mesa. I will repost when I get to try the food.
