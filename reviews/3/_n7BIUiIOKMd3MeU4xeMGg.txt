Love the food here! It's also super fresh and delicious and worth the wait. I don't get to frequent it as often as I like, but when I do go here I end up craving it again a few days later. 

However, the staff here always seems to be upset or angry. Yesterday I went to claim my free birthday meal, and I asked the cashier a question to make sure I was ordering something covered by the coupon. She rolled her eyes at me, and responded as if I should have known the answer (which I didn't, because I don't frequent Rubio's very much.) Then I told her that since the coupon covered that meal, I would get it. She sighed, and stuck her hand out for my phone so I could give her the coupon.

It was a bit insulting and put a damper on the meal. I am giving it a three star rating because: 1) the ancho citrus shrimp burrito was delicious and 2) the chef who brought me my food was super friendly, and almost made up for the cashier's sour attitude.

I will return to Rubio's, just not this location.
