Went for lunch today with my husband.  He had the lunch special and I ordered 2 items al'a carte.  The prices on the al'a carte items are not listed on the menu.  I was very disappointed when I received the check and it was more expensive than the lunch special (which include rice and beans).  I asked them about it but the manager couldn't be found.  We won't return.
