Food is amazing, I really like it and would like to go back again. Except I agree with another reviewer about the attitudes of some of the employees. They are not pleasant. I have experienced one who wouldn't even talk. I ordered a sour cream and it sat on the other side of the counter....another employee asked what I was waiting for. I pointed at the sour cream sitting there and she just said "OK" and kept walking. Seriously? With that said, there are some who are super nice. 

Also, orders get mixed up and they keep asking you what you want on something that isn't even yours. They need to focus on one at a time. They get caught up in trying to take everyone's order who is in line and it just gets to complicated. It makes the line move slower!

The other thing is if you're going to charge extra for sour cream and ranch (which I didn't like) at least give us a heads up. $1.00 for tomatillo ranch and .59 for a sour cream that isn't even full. Geez. 

I never leave reviews but I felt like I had to. This could be an amazing place if they know what's going on. Secret shop your store, you will see!
