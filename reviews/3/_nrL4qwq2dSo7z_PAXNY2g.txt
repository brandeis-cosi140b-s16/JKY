This place is a lot larger than I expected walking in. The bar selection could make Scottsdale clubs green with envy. Everything on the food menu is less than $8... The Yelp reviews didn't leave me with high expectations. But my shredded beef chimi was great! It didn't have any cheese, onions or peppers inside but still packed a lot of flavor. I also liked the chips and salsa. My server was nice. The only thing I can complain about was that they use plastic silverware and styrofoam plates... The hippie in me (also a Sustainability Major) wanted to shed a tear, but I just took off a star instead.
