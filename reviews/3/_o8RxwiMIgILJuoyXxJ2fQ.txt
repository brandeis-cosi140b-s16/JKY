The portions were HUGE! Especially the complementary chips. They gave me enough chips to feed an entire family of 4. However, the food was average but the price was reasonable. I suggest the restaurant to serve less chips for smaller groups, this can probably save them some money because there was no way I could finish that whole bucket of chips.

I ordered the beef brisket enchiladas because it was suggested by other yelpers. This was served in a small iron skillet. The first few bites were decent, but then the grease came out, a lot of grease. It would be better if they served some fresh salad with this dish (instead of the beans) to balance out the grease. Also, this dish was over-seasoned, I could not eat it without the rice. The salsa for the chips was very bland.
