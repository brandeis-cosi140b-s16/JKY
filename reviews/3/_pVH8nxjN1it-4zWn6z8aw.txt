I was told this was the best place for Mexican food in the downtown PHX area, so I tried it without checking Yelp first. I would have to say it was just ok, the decor, the service and the food was not "mexican" as I know it. Maybe living in SoCal for a while has jaded me, but the tacos were bland, the rice terrible and the beans not flavorful. I should have taken notice when the chips and salsa were tasteless, but figured it was full of people, so THEY must know something. The prices were reasonable and overall I've had worse, but EXPECTED more from "the best mexican food" in downtown PHX.
