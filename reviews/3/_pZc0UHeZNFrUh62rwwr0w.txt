I really do prefer Qdoba, but Chipotle is so close to work that it is an easy jaunt for quick easy inexpensive vegetarian food. Chipotle started near the campus of the University of Denver. At one time McDonald's had stock in the company, but a couple years ago the owner of Chipotle bought back that stock. The owner is a proponent of healthy food, and even sponsored showings of Food, Inc. I can appreciate that.

My typical order is a veggie burrito with rice, black beans, fajita veggies, corn salsa, pico and lettuce. I've never had a bad experience with any of these ingredients. I could probably eat this a few times a week, but I am glad I don't have to. 

I think that the staff at this Chipotle are probably the nicest and the quickest that I've experienced. This is probably due  to the location near UNLV. On my last visit last week, each person working at the restaurant acknowledged me and said "hi". It was pretty busy as it was dinner time, so that was really surprising. 

An added bonus about this location is that if you show your UNLV Rebel Card you get a free soda.
