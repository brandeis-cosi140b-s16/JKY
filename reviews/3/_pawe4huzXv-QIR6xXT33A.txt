Salsarita's is a great place to grab a quick lunch while in a hurry. They've got tasty tacos, burritos and enchiladas, among the other Mexican staples. Fast and Fresh is a good way to describe the food here. It's not 5 star dining, but if there could be a quick way to get Mexican, this is it. You choose your own ingredients, which is even better, and your order is prepared right in front of you which is always good. There always seems to be a line here for lunch, which is a good sign, and the line moves quickly which is even better.
