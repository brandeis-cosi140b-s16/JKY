One-of-a-kind little Mexican restaurant that distinguishes itself from the others? Yes, I'm in!

Things they are good at: 

-Knowing how to actually season their food and cook it correctly. No one likes carne asada that looks and tastes like it was fished out of an old stew (I'm looking at YOU, Filiberto's). Great seasoning, clearly finished on a grill

Things they are bad at:

-Making horchata, which is just too sweet. 

-Portion sizes are skimpy compared to competitors. I mean, it was still enough, but I suppose I'm spoiled now and used to gargantuan burritos and whatnot

-Salsa is good, but I disappointingly mild

It's not blowing my mind, but better than a lot of stuff in the area.
