No. This is not authentic Mexican food. Did you really expect it to be? I don't get the obsession with this place either. This chain is extremely popular in Utah and everytime I visit I struggle to see why. 

I consider this place a few notches below chipotle. And here's why:

1. The wait. Cafe Rio does the exact same thing as Chipotle. Make a burrito, a salad, or quesadilla. How long does it take to throw some toppings in a silver bowl? At most I've waited 5 min to make a burrito at Chipotle. Cafe Rio, I've been in line 15 min before I can even order. 

2.  My blood pressure rises every time I've eaten here. Can we say salty food?? The rice, the pulled chicken. Lay off the salt!! 

3. Ok I'll give you an extra star for giving me a scoop of guacamole. Including it in the price is a good idea. 

4. How much was my salad?! $8?! Wow. This is the most expensive salad ever. Do you think layering the bottom of the bowl with a tortilla warrants an extra $2 more than a chipotle salad?!

So basically, this is an expensive fast food joint where the food is so-so. I guess if there aren't any other options it'll do. 
The service is extremely slow.
