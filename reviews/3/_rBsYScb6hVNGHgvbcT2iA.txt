My crew boys swear by it, busy busy but fast service, not really my taste in food but it was well prepared and really generous portions.  Heaps of reice with lime, salas, guac, balbacoa and sour cream, in a burrito bowl, tasty.  Other offerings included burritos and salads with chicken beef and balbacoa.  Good fast food for $10.
