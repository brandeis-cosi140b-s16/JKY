I went here this past Saturday and was pretty excited because I'd been wanting to try it out for sometime. Everything started out well. Hostess and waiter were friendly. The two salsas that came out with the chips were delicious. I ordered the carnitas tacos and my wife ordered the fish tacos.  Both of us were pretty underwhelmed by the tacos. As for the carnitas tacos... It's not that they were bad, the flavor was good. I was a little put off by how messy they were. There was a lot of liquid in there and I'm guessing it was juice from whatever the carnitas were cooked in but I cannot say for sure. Like I said they tasted good but were quite messy. $15 for the three tacos I had was way too much. Without much effort, I can think of at least 5 other places where I can get three better quality tacos for $10 or less. The wife pretty much felt the same. Her fish tacos were good but not $15 good. 

After tip... I paid $54 for six mediocre tacos, one beer and one margarita. In the future I will go elsewhere.
