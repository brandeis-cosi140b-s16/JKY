Went to Qdoba for the first time and it was just A-ok.  Had the naked bowl with chicken.  Serving size was ok.  They charge extra for the fajita veggies, where chipotle doesnt.  I think the only thing they have going for them is that they offer queso and do some other combinations that are a little different that Chipotle.  Next time I'll probably try the tacos, but maybe next time I'll just got back to Chipotle :)
