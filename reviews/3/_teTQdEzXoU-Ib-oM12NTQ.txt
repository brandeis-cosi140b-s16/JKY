Came here again... I just really want this place to be.good! Well, the Bloody mix is awesome! Loved it in my michelada and bloody mary mix! Yes!!! Happy hour is still getting worked out but dollar off is.a great start. To.change.up the margarita they added triple.sec... Ugh. I don't like it; makes the margarita too.sweet, in my opinion. 

Had the farm salad, which.was good. Would order again. MY gf had the shrimp taco... Again, one shrimp in the taco but the taste has improved.significantly!

Decor has changed. Sleek n sexy. 

Keep improving, Cafe Tranquilo! Puhlease! You're too close to me!
