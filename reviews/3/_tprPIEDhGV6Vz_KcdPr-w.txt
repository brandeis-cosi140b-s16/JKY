I like their salsa spread and love the tamales. The only issue that I have with Carmba's is that the food if you ask me is a little pricey for a fast casual Mexican restaurant. The price is very similar to a full service restaurant so am a little disappointed. Otherwise the food is great and most of the folks that work here are very friendly.
