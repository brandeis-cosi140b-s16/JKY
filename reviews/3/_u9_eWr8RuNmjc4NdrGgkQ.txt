This is a tough review to give in that I enjoyed the food, the atmosphere, and the service but I have a tough time dropping $100 on dinner and drinks for two at a Mexican place...a nice Mexican place, but a Mexican place nonetheless. 

We got the corn and black bean empanadas which were amazing - the crust was moist on the inside and flaky on the outside and the Ancho slice was very tasty. I got the carne asada which was tender but could have used a bit more flavor. My wife said the fish tacos were very good. 

So, am I cheap or am I the equivalent of a profiler...designating which types of restaurants are worth $50 per person, disregarding the quality of the food?  

Guilty as charged. Although it was good, I would rather drop $100 at Salt of the Earth down the street.
