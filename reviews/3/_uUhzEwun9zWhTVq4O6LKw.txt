Great for a quickie lunch.  I've never been to the restaurant side, just the takeout one.  The flautas are delicious even though I avoid the beans and the rice is usually kind of dry.  The beef tacos are good and the little chip/salsa bar is a nice touch.  I have yet to try everything, but so far it's a good little place to hit in a pinch.
