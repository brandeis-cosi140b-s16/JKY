We've been going to this Filibertos for several months.  Our old go to spot - Amado's keeps raising their prices so we said adios!  

I've never eaten in the restaurant before so I don't know how the dining in ranks.  We always take it to go.

We've always been happy with the food.  If you go to a place like this, you pretty much know what to expect.  I don't think people go for the atmosphere!  :)  

The best thing about this place is the Mon-Thurs .99 deals.   The salsa is pretty good too!  My favorite is the pico.  

Sometimes there's a long line, but we've always seen hard workers who are efficient workers.  They do get slammed though so it does tend to back up during the busy times.
