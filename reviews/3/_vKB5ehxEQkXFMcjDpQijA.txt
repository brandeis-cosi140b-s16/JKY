After eating breakfast at Flatbreadz, my husband told me that it was our breakfast and lunch.  Since I get nauseous when I'm hungry, I had to buy something else to eat.  My husband and I walked to Moe's and I ordered the vegetarian nachos (without beans).  The ingredients were fresh and the chips were light and delicate.  I'll definitely come back here to eat if I'm at this airport again.  Next time, I may want to order a burrito.
