Picked up dinner for kids tonight. They were out of chicken nuggets before 5 pm and mentioned they are "phasing out" the French fries on their menu so they didn't have any at the time. Every visit lately it seems like they are out of one thing or another. Not very reliable. Customer service is great, but the food is going down hill.
