I'm a fan of this place. It's cheap and a good place to go to when you have a late night hankering since it's open 24 hours. I like the California burrito and their chicken tacos; they're not as greasy as some of the other places I've tried. Their cheap beef tacos aren't bad and I do like their french fries. It's good a good place with good food and I come back here whenever the mood strikes.
