We eat their shredded beef fried tacos regularly. They are hot and cold on the quality. sometimes we get home on our carry out and find the shells all broken so badly that they are difficult to eat properly. Many times they are under fried and greasy not crispy, which makes them chewy not crunchy when biting into the shell. Sometimes there is the right amount of lettuce and cheese, other times it's sorely lacking. We do like their red sauce though. If you catch the right cook, you'll be in luck. I don't notice them as they are hidden away and many times my husband buys the tacos to bring home, so we can't keep track of who's good and who's not good.
