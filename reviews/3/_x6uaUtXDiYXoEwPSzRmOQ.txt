Ate here two days ago. I've eaten here many times. This was my sisters favorite place to eat so we ate here a lot. The service was just fine. I was a little disappointed in the food. I don't know why it was different from the many other times I've eaten here but the food was just blah. I got a cheese crisp to start which was really burnt around the edges. Plus it was a little skimp on the cheese. I got the bowl of green chile with the flour tortilla on the side. It just had no flavor. Even their salsa was a little blah. I would still recommend someone to try their food. It was my first bad experience after numerous trips here.  I will go back and eat there again and hopefully this one bad experience was just an accident.
