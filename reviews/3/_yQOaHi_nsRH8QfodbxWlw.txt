Family owned Mexican joint close to the office. Friendly service, seated me promptly during lunch rush.  Very pleasant staff.

Nice fresh chips.  The standard salsa they bring is OK for your rice & beans but ask for the good stuff (habanero based) they keep in the back, nice scalp tingling affect! I never order specials - the shredded beef tack and bean tostado were quite tasty and had no unpleasant after-effects!

Here's the Pizzaz factor for me - on WEDNESDAYS during lunch there is a piano player and his musical offering made a pleasant backdrop to snap you out of the mid-week slump!  Just added this to my Lunch date list!
