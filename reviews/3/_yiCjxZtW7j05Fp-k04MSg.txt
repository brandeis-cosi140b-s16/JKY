6th time here as a Vegas visitor and unfortunately as much as I want to live this place, the service is just such a negative.  Decent margaritas, good chips 'n salsa, nice table side guacamole (tho's it's evident it's not the servers favorite thing to do). However, the service is a major detractor. One behind the bar during happy hour, and as it filled up she quickly got frazzled and we had to ask for every little thing, napkins under our drinks, a set up etc. Same story all the other times, staff is friendly but in attentive to customers needs and not good at checking in to see if anything else needed. We always leave frustrated wishing it could be a better experience. Upgrade and train the staff on the importance of good customer service and this place will go far.
