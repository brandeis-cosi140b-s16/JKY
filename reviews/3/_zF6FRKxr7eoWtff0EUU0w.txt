Had my hopes up for this place based on all the reviews.  It was not as good as I expected it to be.  Very clean restaurant and very nice employees.  However, the food was not as good as I was hoping for.  I ordered 2 chicken tacos and a carne asada quesadilla.  The chicken was rather chewy.  The asada was good.  I would not go to this place again.
