My wife and I had a taste for Mexican food today so we stopped for lunch.  After living in California for the first 25 years of my life, I have yet to find a Mexican restaurant that reminds me of home.  This was not it either but will review based on the food only.

We both had a combination of different enchiladas.  My wife had one spinach and one avocado.  I had one shredded pork and one shredded chicken.  My wife loved hers and I thought the pork had lots of flavor.  The chicken was very bland.

The search continues for authentic Mexican food in the Madison area.
