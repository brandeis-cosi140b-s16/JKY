My husband really gives this place shit, so I was surprised when it turned out to be decent.

The salsa was terrible - basically the worst I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant - so I very quickly ordered a top shelf margarita, which was on special the night we went.  The margarita was fantastic - sufficiently strong and delicious (probably had a lot to do with the awesome tequila) - and that really elevated the remainder of the meal.

I appreciated that La Paz marks its vegetarian menu options - it saved me the hassle of having to comb through every section for something I could eat.  I ended up ordering (I think) a spinach burrito of sorts (with all the fixins), and I enjoyed it very much.  The spinach was fresh and limey, and that's about all I expect in a spinach burrito.

It seemed a couple bucks more expensive than it should have been, but the margarita made up for it.  I imagine I'll go back just for a margarita next time.  I can make the spinach burrito at home.
