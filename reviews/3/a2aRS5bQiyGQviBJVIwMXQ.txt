Tried the Cantina Burrito with chicken, man it was delicious! I usually don't frequent Taco Bell, but this was worth the time. The counter person was friendly. He saw that the sun was beating thru the window when I was eating my meal and offered to drop the blinds. I didn't even ask. Point for this Taco Bell!
