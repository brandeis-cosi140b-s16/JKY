For being about the only restaurant in this general area, is was not too bad.  I ordered the pulled pork BBQ sandwich which came with fries.  Overall it was good, but I had to ask for a side of BBQ sauce as it was a bit dry.  The side of cole slaw was very good--who doesn't love to dump it on top of the sandwich?!  My wife got the cheeseburger, and said it was just like off the grill, pretty good.
The d√©cor was obviously Old West and where they staple signed $1 bills to the wall from customers, very similar to the restaurant in Oatman, AZ.  Outside on the patio  there was live music, daily between 12-4.
