At first Maria Maria seemed like a cool concept. But after listening to an hour and a half of nothing but Santana's music, it can start to grate on your nerves... 

The place was about half full, though we still had to wait about 20min for a table. The decor is nice and our server was pleasant. Chips and salsa were above par (with three types served by default). We ordered the chicken fajitas and a Mexican salad. Both were good, but nothing to really rave about.

Maria Maria seemed like more hype than substance to me.

What is with people bringing young children into a place like this? The decor should be a hint that this is not a McDonald's playland. The rule I heard awhile back that stuck with me is "that the menu price should match the childs age". For example at McDonalds you can get a kids meal for under $3... good for 3-year olds and up. At Denny's you can eat for about $10, and at a place like Maria Maria a really cheap bastard can get away with about $15. What a simple and elegant formula for parents to follow... (I grant an exemption to parents of extremely well behaved children).
