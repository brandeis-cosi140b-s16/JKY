Chain Mexican...the bane of my being. 
I've little use for these types of places, but they do serve at least one useful purpose, at least for me anyway.
The food is good enough to pass off as your own, but not so good that your guests, the suspicious Mexican couple next door will sniff out your ill-gotten culinary skills.
That's right. I said it...there.

Similar to cheating at horse racing, poker, and the way too easy, waiting for my wife to leave the room while I fast-forward puzzle answers on Wheel of Fortune, I routinely have friends and neighbors over for Mexican food I pass off as my own creations.

Here's the funny thing. 
Whenever anyone asks for the recipe, I hand over some bullshit recipe I found on the internet. The next time they come over, saying; "Cheryl made your red chili, but it tasted nothing like this," just shrug your shoulders as if to say, "Sorry Cheryl that you can't cook for shit, it takes years of know-how."

Anyway, Manuel's has quite a few dishes that when reheated, taste even better than fresh.

Thanks Manuel's for making me an award-winning Mexican chef.
