The food was tasty and the happy hour very reasonable, but my father ordered a rum and coke during happy hour and I think the drink cost 8 dollars. I was surprised to see how expensive it was on the tab. The well rum was captain Morgan (not that good- 14 dollars a bottle). So Gallo charged 60% of the bottle cost for a shot of rum. Seriously? 
   The restaurant felt odd, but I can't put my finger on it. I probably will not return.
