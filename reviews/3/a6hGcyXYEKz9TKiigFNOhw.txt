This is a review based on a breakfast burrito, not any of the tacos.  The burrito is very large, a great deal for $4.99.  We had bacon, but you can also get ham.  The bacon was thicker than you typically get in a breakfast burrito, which was nice.  The eggs were overdone, they got very dry.  This was exacerbated by the lack of salsa.  There was a little pico, but next time I'll definitely ask for more.  Overall, the burrito was very dry.  The verde sauce was good and had no heat.  It adds flavor, but if you are looking for some spice get another salsa.

We'll definitely return for lunch/dinner, I've heard good things.
