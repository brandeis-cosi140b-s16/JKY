My husband and I decided to give it a try as it's really close to home.  As other review's have said, it is a little pricey for what you get, it's not real spicy (which was fine by me but not my husband), the chips are too thick.  The salsa is now cold and we enjoyed it.  I really liked my classic margarita which was listed as $9.  I asked if the "hefe margarita" was bigger as it was $12. He said no, but ignore all the prices. All of them were $6. What?  But hey, whatever.  We both had the beef enchiladas; mine with red his with green $14.  They were good but again, a little pricey.  The beans and rice were really good.  
Our server was a very nice eager to please young man.  We found out he was the manager which was kind of surprising as he didn't seem very experienced but I'm old.  We bought the $40 for $25 coupon and didn't use all $40.  He didn't know how to credit us the rest but bent over backwards to try and make it right.  He took the coupon with my name on it and posted it and told me when I came back he would honor the rest plus a little.  Not what I would've liked but hey very creative!  
There was one table when we got there and another when we left.  We were there on a wed afternoon at noon.  VERY quiet.  Cute patio but it's 110'. 
I'll probably stop by for my margarita but I doubt we'll eat there again just due to cost.  It's not that I NEEDED a bigger portion but I don't think I got my money's worth.  Would like a lower price not bigger size.
