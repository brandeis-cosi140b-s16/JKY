I was honestly pretty surprised by a few things here! To start the salsa had a nice kick, I hate bland salsa. Chips were warm. 
Waitress was very nice and accommodating, although it took quite a long time to get a beer.
Had brisket tacos, were pretty good, wasn't a big fan of the bbq sauce they had on them, although the onion rings on top were a nice touch. Re-fried beans were really good! I kept grabbing chips and scooping up the beans. Couldn't stop! On the other hand I didn't like the rice at all.
For what they serve the prices are a little high but not too bad. Typical chain fare. You tend to get what you've come to expect, never wowed, and usually not disappointed.
