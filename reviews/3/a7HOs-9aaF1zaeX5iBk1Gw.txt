What I like:

1. Freshly made tortillas - what they're known for
2. That they mix up the ingredients inside the burrito before wrapping it
3. Their nice selection of hot sauces
4. Guac is cheaper (though they give less, so I guess it's the same)

Why I still prefer Chipotle:
1. Fresher ingredients
2. Tastes better still
3. Chipotle Tabasco sauce
