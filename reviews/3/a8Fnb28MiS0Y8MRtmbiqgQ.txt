I was excited to try this Mexican place in Mint Hill.  I really wanted to love it because good go-to authentic Mexican restaurants are becoming more and more difficult to find around here.  

Everything was exactly what the 3 stars represent on yelp..."A-OK."  Nothing was amazing, nothing was puke-worthy.  It was just OK.  I am not desperate to return and no new cravings developed from my visit.

I tried the shrimp fajitas and hubby ordered his usual beef tacos.  

My meal came with a salad before the entr√©e and it was basically just chopped up iceburg lettuce.  It was the oddest thing I have ever seen.  I guess in theory it was a nice "addition" but they can keep their bag of lettuce...seriously.
The fajitas were okay.  The black beans were dry and bland and I ordered a side of guacamole that tasted like water.  It was gross.  

Everything else was just ok, as mentioned.  The salsa was okay, the service was decent and the food was basic/decent.  If in the area, it isn't a bad option for a quick bite of Mexican food.
