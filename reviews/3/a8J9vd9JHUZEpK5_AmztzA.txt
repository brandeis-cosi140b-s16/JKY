My husband and I came here last night to grab a quick dinner.

Chips and salsa came out fast (with some slaw that we didn't eat). The salsa was decent. A bit runny but the cilantro in it was flavorful.

We both ordered margs, as they were on special. Huuuuuge drinks! Very tasty. I could probably have handeled mine a bit stronger :)

We got the cheese dip as an appetizer. Very large portion that probably could have fed 8 but, of course, we devoured! It was very tasty and a good consistency (aka, not super congealed white stuff!).

We split the shrimp fajitas for dinner. Definitely plenty for two! They came with rice, beans, a small bit of guac, onions, peppers, and shrimp. Slightly dissapointed in the refried beans cause they were fairly flavorless. Plenty of shrimp to go around!

A-Ok meal!
