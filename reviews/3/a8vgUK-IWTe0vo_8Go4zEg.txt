We stopped in 10 minutes before closing to grab a quick dinner.  They close at 8 so we had to be sure not to be late.

My hubby is adventurous and asked the nice cashier what the "best thing" is on the menu.  He said the steak burrito.  My hubs went with that.  I tried the b2 pork burrito.  As we waited for our to go order I could help but noticed they warmed something in the microwave... Maybe just melted the cheese?  It didn't give my that home-cooked feel I was hoping for.

When we got home with our precious cargo, we were glad to see they had marked the top if the container with our order.  There was a bag of chips (nothing special) and 2 little salsa cups.  Next time I will ask for more salsa because it was pretty good though quite a bit if cilantro, which I'm fine with.

The pork burrito had a yummy tortilla and is served enchilada style.  The pork was slightly different than I expected.  I thought it would be like a slow cooked tender chunk kinda pork but it was more of a diced pork chop saut√©ed in a pan.  Don't get me wrong, the flavor is good- nice and smoky.  The texture of the pork was just on the edge of being rubbery.  The hubs really liked his steak burrito.

I would go back again since it is nearby... But it's nothing too impressive.  No really spice is used here so I just give it a middle of the road rating.
