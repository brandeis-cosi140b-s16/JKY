Just had the free biscuit taco that they were giving out today. What I got, far exceeded my expectations. I was expecting an "egg" patty with some nacho cheese inside a stale "biscuit". What I got was eggs that resembled real eggs in both taste and texture and cheese that also resembled real cheese in both taste and texture! What a surprise! The biscuit was soft and pillowy. Who'd a thunk.....edible biscuit taco?
