Chillin' with a bunch of friends and we were all hungry as heck.  Undecided the group was so we just threw out Pepe's Tacos in our option of the night.  But the girls were complaining that it was ghetto and I'm like ya'll ghetto as hell too and they agreed, so we went.

Not the best mexican restaurant I've been to.  Everything was pretty average and though the carne asada fries weren't part of the menu, they still made it for me.  I prefer Roberto's Tacos carne asada fries over Pepe's and the burritos as well.  Nothing really special about this place.

Outside smells like effing sewage and Pepe's actually have their own song bumpin outside.  It goes something like this, "aaay aay aaaaay Pepe's taco aaay aaay aaay", with their traditional trumpet blastin' in the background.  

.....Sh*t the burrito is starting to kick in and I'm at the Grind Coffee writing this. I hate taking a sh*t in public restrooms.
