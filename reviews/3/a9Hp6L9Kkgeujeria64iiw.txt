Don't get the wrong idea about this place it is absolutely Mexican food, so don't think it is some quaint little hot dog stand. They have one Mexican style hot dog that is pretty good but the rest is tacos, enchiladas, burritos ek cetera. The clientele is primarily people from the neighborhood the seating area is very small unless you count the patio which is as big as the rest of the seating area. Don't be surprised if they're closed the seem to take a random vacation days.
