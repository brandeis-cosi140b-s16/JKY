okay, here's the skinny. Went there last night with my wife because I have heard a lot of good things about this place. Yes, as other reviews have stated, the eating area is a little crammed so an order to go may be the way to go (look at that, I'm a poet and didn't even know it!). I got the number one, it was three tacos, chicken, pork and the El Pastor. My least favorite was the El Pastor, the chicken was pretty good but not mind blowing and the pork was the best, as long as there isn't too much mango on it. My wife had 2 of the same tacos and the mini bean and cheese burrito. She really liked the mini burro but was not a huge fan of the tacos. We also ordered a side of ceviche, which was good enough given that it was a fast food place. My wife made her meal a combo adding chips, salsa and a fountain drink. The grand total was 22 some doll hairs with a place to add a tip (which I always do because I'm nervous negative repercussions will follow otherwise, you know, like fat loogie in my food). The food was really not bad but I doubt we will be back anytime soon.
