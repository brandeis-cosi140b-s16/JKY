Food was good and the service was great! I would say if you want more than Taco bell but not a ridiculous price this hits the spot. Not the best but far from the worst.

We had the original fish taco which was very good. The salmon taco was OK but it was the freshness of the food that we enjoyed.

Definitely worth a shot!
