The food was decent. It isn't a place I wouldn't go out of my way to return to, however it was a standard Mexican spot with pretty good food. 

The service was great and the food came up quick. The salsa was good and the chips were endless which is always a great thing to have at a Mexican spot. I just wasn't blown away by anything. Nothing stood out as above average.
