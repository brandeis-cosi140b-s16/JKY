Always wanted to try the 3.95 breakfast.  It was indeed cheap and filling.  The potatoes were actually surprisingly good with onions and peppers mixed in.  My daughter had some unimpressive french toast, which at six, she actually enjoyed and devoured.  

Good for a cheap breakfast if in the area.  Friendly service.
