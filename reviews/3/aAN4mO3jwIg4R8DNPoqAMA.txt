Nicely swank place in Scottsdale that has pretty good drinks and some pretty massive food dishes.  It kinda felt like it was along the lines of PF Changs but a lil classier and of course a different cuisine.

We were there a bit later so it was pretty empty but I can't say too much aside from the fact that we got a nice little buzz and filled up on food pretty well.  The guac was a little small though for the price, but otherwise it was nice enough.
