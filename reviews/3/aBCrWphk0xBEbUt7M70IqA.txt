My friend was in the mood for Mexican food so we decided to wander into El Segundo Sol.  We really like the ambiance of this place.  The food was surprisingly better than we expected.  She got a vegetarian taco plate and I got a pulled pork taco plate.  

My pulled pork was not what I was expecting, but I thought it was okay.  

The service here was lacking though.  Our waiter brought us chips and salsa even though we said we didn't want any when he asked.  And then he insisted that we had ordered it.  Of course he had to take it back, and we felt a little bad but we could noticeably tell that he was annoyed at us.  

He was overly attentive though.  He kept on filing my glass of water even though the pitcher of water was on the table.  And he kept on coming by to ask us, "do you have everything you need right now?" often interrupting our conversation.  

On the whole I think if you're in the mood for slightly expensive Mexican food (about $15 a plate) then this place is worth checking out.  But I probably won't be back here until after I've checked out all the other places on the strip.
