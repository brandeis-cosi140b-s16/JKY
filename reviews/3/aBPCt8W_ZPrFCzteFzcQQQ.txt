Located at the head of Tempe Marketplace's gimmicky "District", Maria Maria is, I think, intended to be the capstone destination for the Marketplace. Inside, the ambiance is reminiscent of Scottsdale's doomed "Pink Taco", but with more guitars. A Rivera-esque mural dominates one wall, while the bar is backed by a sprawling tree of candles that evokes images of an intricate family tree. Ceiling-high windows inside give picture-perfect views of the Barnes and Noble neon sign, just feet away.

The food was not bad. The steak tacos were better than I expected, actually. Portions were generous yet still consisted of what seemed to be fresh ingredients. The three salsas we were brought weren't bad, either. However, the prices were a bit steep. We tried the $9 guacamole appetizer, which was fine, but worth half the price. We didn't have any problems with service. In fact, the food came out in less than ten minutes. 

As another reviewer put it, Maria Maria is like the Mexican P.F. Chang's. If you know what you're in for, it's A-OK. I'd do Maria again.
