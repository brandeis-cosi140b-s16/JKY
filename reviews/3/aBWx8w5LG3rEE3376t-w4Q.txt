This place is cute! It started pouring down rain when we got there so we ran inside as fast as we could. It was really crowded and the place is kinda small. Its family owned and has a lot of menu items. It wasnt bad I just wasnt a fan. Their chips were really greasy but their salsa was really good! The people we were with ordered 2 Chili Rellanos for our 2 tables and I wasnt impressed. When you look at it you're thinking like "wow" but there was barely any chili and mostly all egg whites. blah. I ordered one of their lunch specials for my entree which was a burrito with red sauce, chicken and it came with rice and beans. I was expecting it to take a while for our food since it was so crowded but it didnt really take that long. I would prob go back and try some other stuff.
