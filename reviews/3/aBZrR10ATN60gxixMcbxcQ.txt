This place is CRAZY at about 1pm on a weekday since it's right across the street from the UNLV campus. Overall it's not too bad in terms of either food or service. In fact the staff is quick, effective and polite so A+ for them. The food is reasonable... I've had their stuff a couple of times now and the barbacoa pork on anything is pretty good (you can get it in a burrito, a salad, etc.). Really on the sweet side, it seems to be a crowd favorite. Pricing is the middle of the road for "fast" food (service is somewhat like Subway where one person starts your order and others add stuff as you like as you make it through the line). For like $12 you can get a big buritto and a drink. If you attend UNLV like I do though and need a quick and filling lunch it's a good place to head to.
