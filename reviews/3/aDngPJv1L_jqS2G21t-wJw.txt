It was good, but not great. The prices are good, but in both burro's we ordered, there was only a very small amount of meat in the middle of both burro's. It was a bit of a rip off in that sense. 
Flavours were good, but you can get a massive meat stuffed burrito at Filiburtos for 5.50. 
The taco was pretty terrible. The tamale had so much masa that it was literally inedible. 
The chips and salsa are great. 
The best thing is the green chile burro, green style, but again, 4 chunks of meat in the middle doesn't make up for the price.
