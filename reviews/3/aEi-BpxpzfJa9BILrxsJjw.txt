I had a mixed  experience here. So math will do the talking...
1 atmosphere                                                                                      = 5 stars
2 Time of drink delivery                                                                      = 4 stars
3 accuracy of drink order                                                                     = 1 star
4 accuracy of food order                                                                      = 1 star
5 timeliness of the check                                                                   = 5 star
6 quality of the food                                                                              = 2 star
7 price                                                                                                     = 2 star
                                    Total   = 20 stars           / 7  items                                                           
                                                          = 2.86 stars (round up for the benefit of doubt) 
To make my self clear I am pushing towards 2 stars because of my expectations where Not met. As a stated above the Restaurant is better off if I let math do the talking.

Now to elaborate on where they failed me: 
3 accuracy of drink order  ....I ordered a Blue Smurf virgin (I am driving) was very good, but I asked for a water ALSO. I had to ask twice. I don't like repeating myself.

4 accuracy of food order ..... my wife asked for no beans, she hates them. She got beans! They never told me I had rice and beans on mine also, or asked if that was okay.  

6 quality of the food .... my wife thought the rice was terrible ("not worth the carbs"), I thought it was okay but that she wanted it because she had asked for extra rice. So we left 2 plates with rice and beans on it. This next part was my fault for not reading: I cant stand sauteed vegetables, which is what they had in it. This was the first time in well over 30 years (I won't say my exact age, damn it my birthday again, and the wife keeps reminding me) that I left Mexican food on the table. I am Not using this as a basis other wise it would be a one star for the Restaurant instead of 3 star. .  

{We never return food to the kitchen, we have watched way too many documentaries to know better. }

My wife asked me to give them a chance, so I ordered coffee & dessert. Wow, that was really good; leche, I tried a little bit, that was much better then I had in the past. (reason I rounded up)

If anyone reads this from the Restaurant, take this as ways to improve:
 The customer should only ask one time, & make sure the customer knows what to expect. Set expectations. Read back what they are ordering to ensure you have it right, then it is my fault I didn't read it thoroughly.  You only get one chance to make a good impression. You never know, I may try again in the future to give a second chance to change this.
