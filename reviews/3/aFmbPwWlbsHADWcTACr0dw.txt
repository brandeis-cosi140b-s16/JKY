It's not uncommon in certain areas to see an off combination of foods in the same eating establishment; Chinese restaurants serving BBQ or Mexican restaurants serving Fish & Chips. And, although the concept of combining Mexican & Asian cuisine on the same menu wouldn't be my first choice (I'd honestly pass up the option every time), I can honestly say that I'm glad I tried it.

Pro's:
- Inexpensive
- Food has exceptional flavor
- Free samples of what you want to order if you're a first-timer (every time could be your first)
- Decent amount of food for the amount of money you pay
- Simple enough menu to order from (though there aren't too many items, there's enough to make you want to try everything on the first try....at least it did for me....you don't want to order behind me, you'll be waiting and hungry. LOL)

Con's:
- Chandler location is hidden from traffic (there is absolutely NO signage on Chandler Blvd or Dobson Rd); it would appear that most, if not all, of their business comes from word or mouth and/or return customers
- The eating utensils were EXTREMELY flimsy. And, they only had spoons and chopsticks! Argh! Why no plastic forks? (Insert puzzled look here). Can I get a fork please. Geez! 
- The bathroom door entrances are an accident waiting to happen (it swings open in both directions AND directly across from each other. Man - woman exiting simultaneously...OUCH!)
- The overall feel of the establishment could use a makeover to make it more attractive (it has a cheesy cafeteria vibe going); if NOTHING else, they can stand to step their game up by updating the menu on the wall (tacky)

I'd like to give them 3 1/2 stars but, YELP only offers whole stars. Damn! Lol. Nonetheless, I'd still patronize the establishment.....To-Go please.
