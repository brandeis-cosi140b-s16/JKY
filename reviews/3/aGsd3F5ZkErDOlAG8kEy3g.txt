Been here several times for lunch during work. The service is usually quick (unless there's a woman ordering 6 burritos in front of you). Burritos and nachos are pretty tasty, and since I've found things I like, I stick with them. 
Seems kinda pricey though--nachos and a drink came out to almost $9. Better than Taco Bell, obviously, but with their nachos being under $2...
Apparently, they have some sort of reward program, but employees have never mentioned it.
