Today's breakfast burrito was too burnt and crisp for me. The bits of ham were charred on one side, flour tortilla was heated for too long. I should've just stuck with a carne asada burrito, but it's only 10am, so I figured get something breakfast. What a waste of 6 bucks and a 3/4 burrito worth of food. I am still hungry too :(
