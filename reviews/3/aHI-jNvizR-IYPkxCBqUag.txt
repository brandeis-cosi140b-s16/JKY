Came here early last Sat night and we got seated right away. It looks cute inside and the outdoor patio is nice as well.   Our Joan Cussak look alike waitress was very nice and took lots of time explaining the menu and the fact that mama Ninfa invented the first fajitas and therefore they had the best fajitas in the WORLD. well we had to get the best fajitas in the world so we got the big combo plate for two $40. it came with carnitas that hubby liked alot, chicken that I liked alot, steak that was OK, 3 shrimp that were overcooked and a big green chili with melting cheese in the middle. rice OK beans good. Really felt like a chain to us upselling in all. We were seated really close to the kitchen area so we got to see how it all works, watched the douchy looking manager having his pep talks and not really doing much else but looking at all the really cute hostesses mill about. not sure if we will be back, maybe for the lunch specials to try something else. Now the question were they the best fajitas in the world Hell no!! not even close but nice try.
