The setting here is fantastic, overlooking the faux canals of the Venetian with gondoliers rowing past and giant ceilings painted as the blue sky. I just wish the food here was as good. The service was efficient but the meal itself was on the bland side and lacked the flavors and spices that I would have expected from someplace billing itself as a taqueria. The salsa did not have any kick to it. The meat in my tacos seemed as it had been cooked and then left in a heating device before it was served. The tortillas were at least fresh and fluffy. It was not a bad meal overall, but it could have been better.
