I ordered delivery from here via grubhub. Yes, it took an hour, but I don't consider that unreasonable for a non-chain, and 10 minutes of that time was the driver trying to find my specific apartment. Had the Italian sub, Chicago dog, and carne asada nachos. Food was fresh when delivered. The dog was good. Sub was cold cuts and fresh veggies on a decent Italian sub roll, big enough for two people to share, taste was good, better than what you would get at a subway. Nachos were corn tortilla rounds with nacho cheese sauce, chopped meat, onion, jalapeno, and sour cream. Again, nothing spectacular, but it was about what I expected for the price. It's not bad food, for a relatively low price, and they deliver, so if that fits your craving I think you'll be satisfied.
