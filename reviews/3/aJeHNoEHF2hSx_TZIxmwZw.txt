The most amazing Mexican place I've ever been to was the original Ninfa's on Navigation in Houston.  The tacos al carbon were amazing back then......  For some strange reason, that signature item was renamed and is not on the menu.  In fact, very little about this place has any resemblance to Ninfa's other than the name.   The fresh tortilla's are fantastic, salsa's are pretty good.  My beef taco's (which were supposed to be the same thing as tacos al carbon)  consisted of two awesome tortilla's rolled around three wimpy strips of skirt steak.  Nothing else inside.  On one side was a small pile of beans and rice, and on the other side there was some mediocre guac and chopped tomatoes and onions (PICO???).  That was it.  No lettuce, no sour cream, no fresh cheese, no cilantro.  What got me was, one taco I had to pick up with beans smeared on the outside, and the other I had to pick up with guac smeared on it.  The queso cheese dip tasted ok, but it was barely luke warm, and could have been poured out of a bucket from Taco Bell.  The fried tortilla wedges are a serious mistake and should never be served to anyone.  Chips are thick, pre-bought, and served cold.  On the bright side, my wife had the ribeye steak which was great.  My skirt steak was well prepare, but there was very little of it.  Our server was wonderful.  She brought me lettuce and sour cream for my tacos and brought my wife some tortilla's. No extra charge.  She was very attentive through out.  I mentioned the plating faux pas to her and she passed that on to the chef and knocked $6 bucks off our bill.  One star for her.  The fresh, hand rolled tortilla's are really the star of the show here.  Though I was disappointed, I think there are easy fixes and great potential for improvement.
