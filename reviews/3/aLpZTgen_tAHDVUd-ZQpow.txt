This is a restaurant which also houses KFC and I think they have issues with that in regards to speed of service. The lady at the drive thru smiled and thanked me for coming and asked if I wanted sauces.. I asked if that cost extra and she said yes. I declined.. Also if you have an issue with food they are very strict on refunds per sign on window so be cognizant of that
