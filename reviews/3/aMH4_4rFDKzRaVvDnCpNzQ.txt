We went there this past Saturday evening. The place was very busy, but we were seated on the patio pretty fast. Music was nice. The service was non-existent and we were noticeably ignored by several waiters on the patio for
more than 40 minutes- we were getting ready to leave when a server finally asked us if we were ever served.  Then the manager apologized and a waitress appeared.  Food was very good.
