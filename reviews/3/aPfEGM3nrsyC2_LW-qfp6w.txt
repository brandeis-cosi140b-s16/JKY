4 Stars for any day dining with coupon.

The first time I ate here was on a Monday night and had the AMAZING House Roast and ordered the Grandisimo Margarita, as I already mentioned the HR is a MUST, trust me... and ironicaly the Margaritas SUCK ASS, have a Pacifico like my smart hubbie did. He also had the Carne Adobada which was also very very very good.

Every year we buy the Las Vegas Advisor Coupon book, so we used the 50% here and only paid about $50 so LIKE THAT I thinki its a great deal, would not pay $100 for that.

2 stars for Sunday Margarita Brunch

As mentiones I cannot believe the Margaritas are so bad here, its an insult... anyway, price has gone up to almost $20 pp and that is NOT a good deal for what you get, the "buffet" is oh so incredibly small and although the food is decent there are waaaaay better deals around town, and cheap champagne ranks way higher for me than cheap margaritas.
