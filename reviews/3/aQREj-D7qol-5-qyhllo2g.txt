What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn't serve chips and salsa? You can order chips and guacamole, you can order a side of salsa for your entree, but you can't order chips & salsa together? Wth...
Service not so great either, manager checking out guests, rude servers and slow service. Too bad I wanted to like it... I like the restaurant in Phoenix, so I was excited to try in the a/p... Mistake!
BTW... I did ask for chips & salsa
