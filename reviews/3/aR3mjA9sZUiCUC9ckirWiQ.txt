My buddy said it's the mexican red lobster. The music is obnoxiously loud but I guess they take breaks when it isn't busy. Besides the surround sound it was ok authentic Mexican seafood. The ceviche is decent if your into that, they bring it out with your salsa. You can't really go wrong with fajitas and the lemonade and pineapple juice were both tasty.
