I prefer Cafe Rio over Chipotle, Qudoba, etc. I feel like the quality of the food has gone down a little bit from about a year ago. I frequest this location about once a week with my daughter for a little ladies lunch outting. My Daughter loves the Kids quesadilla. I generally order a salad. What sells me the most is they have both Coke Zero and Diet Dr. Pepper. I have a small addiction to soda and they have both types I enjoy, LOL.
