Oh how I love a cheap pitcher of margaritas.  Then they hand you a stuffed animal to mark your table! What an interesting touch :)  Their complimentary "chips and salsa" bar is great as well!

Their mesquite fish salad was actually quite memorable.  Their bean & cheese tostada even more memorable (lard free beans too! - lard is such a disgusting word.)

I could do without waiting in line at the counter for a drink refills, but hey, it's all part of the experience!
