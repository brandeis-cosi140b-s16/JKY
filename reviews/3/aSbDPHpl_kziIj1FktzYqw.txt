A friend of mine was in town from the East Coast and was craving Mexican.  I had never been here, but she suggested it so I was down.  We got there right when they opened (11am) and there were a few tables already seated.  The service was great!  Not sure if it was because we were there early, but they seated us immediately, came by and took our drink orders, and asked if we had any questions on the menu.  Since my friend and I hadn't seen each other in awhile, it took us a bit to even look at the menu, so we asked the waiter for a little more time.  They didn't rush us, but came back after a couple minutes, which was great, since soooo many places just ignore you after you ask for more time.  So thumbs up!

The downside is that this place is a bit pricey--I ordered a combination beef taco and green chile corn tamale with rice and beans ($12 or so).  The taco shell was nice and crispy, but the meat wasn't super flavorful and slighty greasy which I was not much a fan of.  But the tamale was delicious.  The portions are large and I only ate half of my meal.  But the tamale was so good that during my meeting I began thinking about it and I couldn't resist eating the rest of it at my desk.  So now I'm too full and ready to take a nap.
