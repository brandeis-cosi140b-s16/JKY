My girlfriend and I ate breakfast here using an Entertainment coupon. We both had omelettes, which were fine. Our server was prompt, friendly, and cheerful. The ice tea, coffee and toast were all good. And the booths are comfortable and clean.

Unfortunately, my breakfast potatoes were without question were the worst I have ever had or even laid eyes on. They literally looked like they could walk off the plate. I tried them and could not even swallow. Cold and slimy. My girlfriend got hash browns. Imagine a cold mouthful of canola oil. 

A couple of small menu and order discrepancies also happened. The decor is unappealing and the pre-packaged muffins on display at the bar didn't leave a good first impression. The bathrooms were what you'd expect at a bar. Overall, we still had a good time, but I absolutely will not be returning.
