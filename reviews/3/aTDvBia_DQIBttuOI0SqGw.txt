I come here atleat once a week to satisfy my seafood cravings and can honestly say, it's amazing. I always have ceviche on tostadas, shrimp coctail, and at times a sea food stew. Atmosphere is relaxing, employees are friendly and very attentive. Only major problem I had,  was the drinks. You get no free refills on sodas. Other than that,  its a great place.
