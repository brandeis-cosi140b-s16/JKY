Oh Fuzzy's Tacos....Not too bad! It was borderline 4 stars.
I would first like to point out that this is not a traditional taco joint, which in some aspects in not the worst ordering situation in the world. Talk about trying something original, right!
I ordered the Chicken Baja tacos along with the Borracho beans with the Fuzzy Taco signiture plastic cup.

The tacos were original and huge. The chicken was topped with what seemed to be feta cheese with a galic/lime sauce and covered in pico. Pretty tasty. The bad: The chicken was not seansoned well. 
I do have to say one thing I look for in taco joints, is if I can fit the taco in my mouth or not......turns out this taco was huge, not a chance! A+ for that.

The Borracho beans.....pinto beans in alot of beer, were tasty, but the beer/beans ratio was 50/50 so not much to eat. Mostly warm beer to stare at when I was finished.

Buy the Fuzzy's cup, if and only if, you plan to frequent this place! refills anytime in the cup are $1, and it is a pretty large sized cup ( I would guess a little over a pint).

A good lunch joint. As for if this place decided to start bumpin'.....well I imagine your wait time would be horrible.

I would also like to point out Fuzzy's has a very nice outdoor seating area!
