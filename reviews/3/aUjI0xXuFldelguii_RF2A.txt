It's the best Mexican delivery in Scottsdale if you have enough of their hot sauce BUT apparently their hot sauce is so precious you can't get more with deliveries no matter how clear you make it. I order at least once a week and EVERY SINGLE TIME I tell them I need extra hot sauce. They so ok and I say, " PLEASE I need extra hot sauce. You guys always forget so please put 2 in, I will pay for it if I need to". The nice lady on the phone says "okay, okay we have it". I'll say, "are you sure, I need extra. Not one but 2." She says "yes, yes we have that". Guess what happens AT LEAST half of the time.....no extra hot sauce. I mean when I get my order I look around for Ashton Kutcher to see if I am being punked, tonight after asking for extra and clarifying at least 3 times not only was my ONE hot sauce container half full but so was the guac and sour cream. El Molina, I hope you read this.....PLEASE listen to people when they call and place an order. You never have a problem getting the credit card # right but for some reason you hate giving extra hot sauce. I mean, charge more if you need to, tell people you only make a certain amount each day or just tell people I don't give a crap about you and you aren't getting hot sauce....do whatever but just don't always say "ok, ok, yes, yes sure hot sauce" and then not give and extra. COME ON ALREADY, it gets so old!
