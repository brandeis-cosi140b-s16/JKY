This place was recommended by one of my neighbors.  We should have gotten a hint as they mostly talked about the drinks... not the food.

Went there with a party of 4.  It was a Wednesday night so it was not busy by our food took a while.  Ordered a stake.  It was ok, but nothing great.  I would not order it again.  My husband got a carne asada burrito.   Much better than my stake.  My daughter got a soup, which was ok as well.

Overall the place is good and the food is ok.  Give it a try!
