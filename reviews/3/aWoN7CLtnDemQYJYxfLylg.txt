This place is a not a place for large groups and I hate that because I like going with friends. There are booths and maybe 3 tables. The interior is nothing fancy.

::: PROS
Inexpensive food
Good-tasting fried rice
Decent amount of menu options

::: CONS
Spam in the musubi was sooo thin and tiny
No refills on drinks
Basically one server, so service was poor (missing utensils, dirty tables, etc.)
Friend found a hair in their fried rice! : /

They immediately replaced the fried rice (with the hair in it) by making a brand new one for them. And I get it, I know accidents happen. It still does not call for a pleasant experience though, right? Nonetheless, my friends thought the food was very good and mentioned it in the weeks following.

I would go back here, but only with a few people. Hopefully my experience will be better...
