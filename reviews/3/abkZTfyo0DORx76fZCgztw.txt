Driving on Central, hungry, and wanting to try something new. Spotted Loco Lime and decided Mexican food would hit the spot! Colorful, yet warm tones make the atmosphere.

We were seated promptly. However, it took a few minutes too long to be greeted at our table. Salsa and chips were good! The food came out fast, but our server was not too attentive. We ordered a veggie burrito ($9) and a combo patter ($7.50) of a shredded chicken enchilada with green sauce and a cheese chile rellano. The chicken did not come shredded, but in pieces. The chile rellano was high in batter, but too soft on the inside. I wouldn't recommend getting it. The portions were large and we left full.

They share a bathroom and one of the stalls was out of toilet paper. Not fun. Good thing the patrons are friendly and more than willing to help a girl out. Once I told the server about the issue in hopes to spare another woman in distress, but she quickly said something about knowing this already, but waiting on a key or something. Not too concerned. Not sure what that was about, but if you can't find a way to fix the problem, at least get a paper to put on the stall as a warning. 

This is a mixed review. The food was fair, but not crave-worthy. However, the chips and salsa made the meal. The staff were average on the friendly scale, but didn't make the experience worthwhile.
