I am wavering between a 2 and a 3.  Meh.  It was... meh - but nothing really wrong or offensive - just meh.  I like Salsarita's for fast casual Mexican, though I typically go to the Blakeney location.  This location, at Quail Corners, was recently renovated (moved from a standalone that was demolished to make room for a McDonald's to inline with the rest of the shopping center).  Clean, bright space - bring on the cheese dip.

The food:
My typical order of a small steak burrito with chips/queso was called out to the friendly, efficient staff.  My toppings for my burrito were steak, rice, pinto beans, lettuce, sour cream and cheese.  I would have gotten more toppings (ingredients?  additions?), but after seeing the wet scoop of steak go on the burrito (yuck - what is the meat soaking in?) I didn't want a tortilla filled with mush.  Sadly, that is exactly what I got.  The overstuffed burrito was loosely rolled and after about three bites, I had a mess - in between my fingers, under my rings... I hate that.  I ate the rest with a fork.  The meat tasted different to me than the Blakeney location, though since Salsarita's is a chain, I doubt that it was different.  It just tasted not quite right and not the normal yummmm that I experience.  

Some of the chips were a little overdone, though good.  Not overly salted and a good weight to hold up to the queso.  The queso, as usual, was yummy.  And they have a Coke Freestyle machine (YAY!), so I was able to have my cherry ginger ale.  

There was plenty of seating and the drink and napkins/utensil stations were clean.  Though nice and quiet when I arrived, a little after 6:00 it started to fill up with the typical ill-behaved children and the parents who ignore them.  (Your child's ass and feet on the surface where other people would like to eat isn't acceptable behavior and stop the damn screaming!) 

Maybe it was just an off night - but I won't be rushing back.
