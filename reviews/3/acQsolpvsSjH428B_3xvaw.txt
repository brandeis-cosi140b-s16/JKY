I have heard so many good things about Chipotle's, but had never been. I was working in the area and a coworker invited me to lunch there.

I had a steak burrito. Steak, beans, rice, salsa, cheese and sour cream. 

Since this is my first time at the restaurant chain I don't know what is normal there, but I know I'm not used to a burrito being served cold. The rice and beans were room temperature, but the steak was refrigerator cold. This was thirty seconds after it was made. The cold temperature aside, the flavor was good. The steak was tasty, I think it would have been better warm. The burrito, in general, would have been better warm.

Call me a traditionalist, but I like cold foods (ice cream, salads) served cold and warm/hot food served warm/hot. I'm not above having a ham dinner warm and a ham sandwich the next day cold, since I know how long it sat out before the refrigerator.

As I said, the burrito was tasty and if you like your burritos cold, you will probably like it a lot. 

Next time I will just go the Roberto's, I like their product and they serve the burritos warm.
