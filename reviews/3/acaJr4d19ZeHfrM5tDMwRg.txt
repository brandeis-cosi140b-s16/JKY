Eh...3...3.5.  My husband had been here a couple of times for happy hour with coworkers and mentioned that I should give it a try.  I liked it more than I thought I would, but a couple of things kept it from being more stars.  We were there on 6/27 for happy hour.

Our server, Cristianna, was nice and generally efficient at circling back around to check on us.  We each ordered a $3 HH margarita and got those pretty quickly.  I didn't have high expectations for a 3-dollar margarita, and it was just that...a cheap margarita.  I ordered another one I think for only 2 reasons:  it was hot out and they were 3 bucks, but I really didn't enjoy them and they gave me heartburn.  Meh.  

I ordered the 1 and only combo with the jalopy taco and that was a tasty dish.  It comes with a very small cheese enchilada, a delicious tamale, and you can choose a taco.  The jalopy taco is loaded down with ground beef, fried potatoes, lettuce, cheese, olives, etc. and I really enjoyed that as well.  Overall I think it's a little overpriced at $15.95.  It came with a side of clumpy rice and flavorless charro beans.  I ended up doctoring up the leftovers for breakfast the next day.  The tamale was really the best part of that dish.  

Mr. M had the sirnoran dog with onion strings and it was a really good hot dog but the bun was way too big.  That entree was $9.95.  Now that I pay attention to some of the other pictures, we'll definitely have to come back and try those batter-dipped fries.  The onion strings were really greasy and all clumped together.  Not all that appealing.

All in before tax and tip it was $43.13.  I don't regret it, but I do think it was a bit much.  

Another thing that dropped a star was the ladies' room was pretty nasty, and it was 5:30 in the afternoon.  I can't imagine how it is at 9:00 at night.  Yikes!  I would go back, but it's not high on my list.
