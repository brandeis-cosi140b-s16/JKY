It's Hatch Chile season and the employees here are very excited.
 Jalapeno Inferno has a separate menu dedicated to food items that contain Hatch Chiles and if you were to ask for recommendation of what to order they will tell you to order off this menu, which of course, we did. 

To drink, I ordered their Down the Hatch Margarita that contains, guess what....Hatch Chiles! Two different employees passionately suggested this so I was down to try and enjoy this drink. FAIL! So incredibly disgusting that it almost came back up the hatch. Now, I'm not sure if my taste buds haven't matured enough to appreciate Hatch Chile season  (that only lasts about a month or so), but my date wasn't a fan of this drink either and I was jealous of his Corona. Thank god the glass had a salt rim because that was the only way I could get the drink down. For my entree I ordered carne asada fajitas that came with 3 freshly warmed tortillas, guacamole, sour cream, shredded cheese, pico de gallo, and a side of refried beans and rice. Yummy! My date order Hatch Chile enchiladas that were really good and should definitely be tried. The chips and salsa were delicious, but who doesn't love deep fried tortilla chips?

Service was speedy and the staff was very friendly. The restaurant itself, is very clean, neat, and bright. I would give Jalapeno Inferno another go around if I'm up the area.
