3.5 stars for the food (my burrito was very good and HUGE), 4 for the service, 5 for the cleanliness, and 1.5 for the ambiance. As mentioned elsewhere, there are 2 TVs in the very small dining area, and both were blaring obnoxiously loud volume levels, showing a Mexican drama of some sort. Really, really inappropriate, especially in such a small space. Other than that annoyance, I wouldn't hesitate to go back.
