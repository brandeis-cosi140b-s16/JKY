This is Moe's so you know what to expect.  I usually only go on Mondays for the $6 burrito, chips, and drink deal.  I find it to be way overpriced at the regular menu prices.  For example, a fountain drink and a burrito with steak and guacamole is about $10 before tax.  Most of the food is good but the steak is very chewy so go with the beef or chicken.  I am not a fan of the help yourself salsa.  I love salsa and I have not found one here that I like.

The layout of this place is also confusing.  When you open the door, you will be right in the middle of the line.  The parking is also limited and with at least another business or two opening in the same building,that's going to get worse.
