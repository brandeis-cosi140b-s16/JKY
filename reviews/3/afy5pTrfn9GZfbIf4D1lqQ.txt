A solid neighborhood Mexican joint with good food, friendly service, and live entertainment means parents and kids alike walk out with a full stomach and a smile on their face. My chimichanga was delicious, the chips and salsa served fresh from the warmer, and our margaritas definitely had some punch. Cabo's might not be the best Mexican restaurant in Charlotte, but at least on the night we visited, it got the job done.
