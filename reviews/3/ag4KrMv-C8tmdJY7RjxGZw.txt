This was a very average place.  Not good,  not bad just average.  It was clean,  it has a salsa bar, the cashier was pleasant,  parking was easy,  bathrooms were clean.  The food was fine,  hot and as shown on the menu.  The Styrofoam plates are less than desired but whatever.  I have no plans to go back but wouldn't refuse to eat there either.
