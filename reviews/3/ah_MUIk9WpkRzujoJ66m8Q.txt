Salsa bar is second to none.  They must have 20+- Salsa's to choose from.  The food is quite good as well.  That being said, and it just may have been an isolated incident, but our car window was broken out while dining.  We informed the workers and they did not seem surprised.  My guess is this has happened before and will happen again.  If I go back, it will not be in my car.
