This place is hit and miss with quality and quantity. The steak bowl is what I usually get. The bowl is sometimes full and sometimes pretty scarce, leaving me hungry. :(  The steak itself was mostly gristle and fat today, it is good meat about 1 out of 3 visits. 
The staff has been hit and miss as well, one time friendly, the next time not so much or even rude.

I will be switching to chicken, but probably not going here a lot in the future.
