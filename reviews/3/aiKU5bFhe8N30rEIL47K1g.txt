I noticed one review that commented on the gas pumps as an interesting piece of decor.  "Tapacubo" is "hubcap" in Spanish.  The light fixtures are made of old hubcaps, or made to look like they are.  In addition, Tapacubo's sign is like an old gas station sign with a gas pump on it.  The restaurant has old gas station garage doors on either side, advertises that its margaritas come out of the gas pumps (leaded or unleaded), but I never saw anything in the gas pumps.  Not sure what the food has to do with a gas station theme, however.

Menu items are street tacos or tortas.  Street tacos were good.  I had the Papi - short rib meat that was very tasty, with sweet bits of pomegranate seeds.  Guacamole was good, but at $8.50, way too expensive.  For one drink each, two tacos and guacamole, after a reasonable tip we were out $42.  Doesn't seem like street taco prices, you know?

I'm a stickler for ambience.  What the heck do TVs all over the place have to do with a gas station? My husband and I sat in a booth with a TV facing us - no one else on that side of the restaurant with us.  Asked if the TV could be turned off.  Well. . . no.  Well. . . that sucks.  Makes the place seem like just another "sports bar." None of the candles were lit, but our server lit ours - when asked.

Had to try it to say that we'd tried it, but we can get street tacos and a drink far cheaper and easily as good or better at a mom and pop place.  And if we want TV, we'll get it to go and drink at home.
