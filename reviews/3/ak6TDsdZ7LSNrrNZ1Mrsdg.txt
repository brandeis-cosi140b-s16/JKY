It's not the best nor the worst. But it will do in a pinch, since its 24 hours. It tastes better the more inebriated you are, however sober it's ok. Cheap too. I recommend the #1. Chicken. To go, with all the free, fresh garnishes and salsas you can fit in your pockets... Take some carrots for the hamsters, bunnies or tacos.
