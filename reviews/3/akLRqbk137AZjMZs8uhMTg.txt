This was a meal that took place after an extra inning baseball game I was watching at the local watering hole, but that should not affect the review, but it might have affected the ordering process. First off how many drunken people eating here or take-out (like my meal) thought that the giant dollop of white stuff on top of my patch of lettuce was sour cream? I'm guessing 99% and until I actually find the one place in some random corner of Mexico that uses this technique, let's just say this is weird and luckily I had read reviews first. #sourcreamplease
     The quesadilla and asada taco combo was my choice, but I thought I had said I wanted the carne asada taco, but she said "Ok beef? Yes, they are the same, but not in the Mexican world. The meat did not taste like asada or any other meat I have tasted before, including "beef". Either way it had no fat and was double wrapped and decent. The quesadilla was big and standard fare for these things, but better than the chains version. The rice was high quality and fresh radishes are always a nice touch.Whether I slurred my words or we had a translation issue we will never know, but overall the place appears to be better than the chains, but that's about all.
