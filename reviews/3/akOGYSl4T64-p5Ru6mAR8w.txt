Decent tex mex and fun decor - loaded with kids which is why we bring ours. Hostess not great at estimated seat time - 20 min turned into an hour - not the end of the world but annoying to see parties come in after you and get seated ahead of you.  Even worse if you are trying to time dinner for a grumpy little one. Table service was great. Food was fine.
