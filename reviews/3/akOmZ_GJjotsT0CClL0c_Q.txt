Pros
Tasty tacos

Cons
Horrible atmosphere and service

The tacos (I got carne asada and carnitas) were very tasty and they have a nice little selection of a few different beers. A little pricey but it's on the strip. 

Unfortunately, I decided to eat in, which is a huge mistake. I asked if their wifi was for customers, and the person at the cashier just waved me away. Maybe she didn't understand me, maybe she didn't know. Call me old-fashioned, but I think staff should be polite to customers when they ask a simple question and find out the answers if they don't know. As I was eating, the place started to fill up with smoke. It was coming from the grill where they were cooking the meat. A little smoke, I don't mind. But it was literally filling up the place to the point where it was quite thick. Me and another couple that was there left and ate outside. Just odd that they have such poor ventilation and didn't give a crap.

I prefer Tacos El Gordo over this, but they are quite a bit up north on the Strip.
