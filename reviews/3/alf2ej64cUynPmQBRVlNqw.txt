This place is solid. Not out of this world good but very far from being bad.

From the moment you walk into this place, you'll immediately think chipotle. The menu that hangs over the counter is almost identical. You pick your food item of choice (burrito, bowl, tacos etc) then load it up with rice, beans, protein, Etc, etc.  

Each time I've come here, I've gotten a burrito and have loaded the thing up until I need a fork lift to carry it out the door. Which is why I'm probably miserable at work afterwards lol...

I love Chipotle ... I really do. But every time I go there for lunch I somehow end up spending $15 somehow....one of my favorite things about Picant√©, aside from them switching up their protein options is the fact that they offer $5 burritos or bowls on Tuesday, which is a GREAT deal. 

This is def a good spot if your looking to switch up your lunch options every now and then. Between their $5 burrito deals and them being .5 miles from my office -- I'm certain I will be back.
