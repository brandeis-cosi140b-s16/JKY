It's a Taco Bell. There isn't really much to expect beyond being open late and serving tacos. This is far from the nicest TB in town. It's older, it's grungier, the drive-thru takes longer, etc. But they serve the same food as all other TBs. So yeah, it's a perfectly fine TB and will certainly satisfy your late night drunken cravings for some cheap tacos.
