I recently met for drinks and dinner here.  As a previous viewer stated, "mediocre" would be the order of the day.  It was fairly priced, and the food was decent, as was the service.  Beyond that, there was nothing special or extraordinary about it.  That's not to say it was bad, simply not memorable.  If you happen to be in the Sante Fe Station Casino, and are looking for a safe, cookie cutter, Mexican Restaurant... this would be a safe bet.
