Just ok. The ceviche was ok it needed to be doctored up. The fish tacos were good and plenty. They do charge you for everything.  We ordered a rice and beans plate for our little one and asked for cucumbers and tomatoes and was charged for that. The waitress came by 2 times and was ok nothing I'm this restaurant would make me want to come back.
