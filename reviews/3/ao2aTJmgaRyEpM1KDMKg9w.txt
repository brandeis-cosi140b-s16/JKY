I really didn't think their would be much of a difference between the two locations, but the Charleston location trumps the LV BLVD location bad.

Down to the payment station, this shop just doesn't do the El Gordo name justice.

I do like the area of this one more, but the food was just not the same in my opinion.

I ordered the usually Carne Asada fries and the Adobada tacos.

Maybe I came on a bad day, but the steak wasn't cooked how I like and still being a bit pink.

Having carne asada fries means the steak is grilled in my opinion.

I don't mind a little pink in my steak, but this was disappointing. 

Also the sauces or salsas aren't made easily attainable so don't forget to ask.
