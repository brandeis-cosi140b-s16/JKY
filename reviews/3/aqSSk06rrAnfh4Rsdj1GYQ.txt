I think I may have been a little harsh in my previous judgment of Rubio's. Yes, it's not the most authentic Mexican food and yes, it's a chain, but I went there today and tried their veggie burrito with a whole wheat tortilla and it was pretty tasty and not too heavy. I definitely prefer Baja Fresh and Chipotle (coming soon to 24th St and Baseline center) for Mexican chains, but Rubio's has some ok offerings if you choose carefully.
