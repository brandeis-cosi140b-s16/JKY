This place is just alright. I mean, they kinda have a mechanical bull in the middle of the floor, so....

First off my friend and I came in and were seated in section that did not have many people. It took ten minutes before we decided to move to the bar, since no one came at all to help us yet. When we began to move, a number of people surrounded us asking for our order. Yeah, no. Bar time.

I got the Avocado salad which was pretty good considering it only had three small pieces of Avocado on it. It had spicy toasted pumpkin seeds, shredded cactus, and a very tart limey sauce. Not too bad.

Drinks were relatively priced, and having conversations with the bartender while he cut a thousand limes was fun.

Overall this was an ok place to go.
