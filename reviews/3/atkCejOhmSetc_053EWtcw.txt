Nice little restaurant to enjoy a quiet dinner. Complementary chips & salsa are always great! 
The service and food is hit-n-miss. 
Sometimes the food is wonderful, other times it seems old and like it has been sitting under s lamp. 
The service has had a recent improvement. Everyone is on their A game and service is speedy. 
The food is nothing authentic, basic Mexican but It's still one of my "go to" locations.
