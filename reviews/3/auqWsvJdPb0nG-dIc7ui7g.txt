Stopped by for dinner and I agree with the food being blah, however, my husband enjoyed his combo enchilada plate, it was not spicy but the flavor was good. I had a cheese enchilada with red sauce (what do that put in that sauce, it can't be chili) and rice that was over salted. Salsa was just low average but the margaritas were very good! 

Service was fair but the server we had was not friendly he seemed confused.

The new Chimi dessert with caramel, nuts and ice cream was to die for!
