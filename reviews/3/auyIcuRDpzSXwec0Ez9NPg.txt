Okay okay okay..... I went back to this place with a friend... I was reluctant at first but meh I said what the hell.... I will try it again... We actually ate inside of the restaurant we where seated quickly we ordered extra chips and salsa but I think our waiter had forgotten... We asked him like three times... My friend and I chatted it up so we weren't to worried about it... I had flautas the chicken ones yummy next time I think I will ask for the dressings on the side they got really soggy... But they were really good so this place isn't that bad... It's okay
