Ok... My last review really sucked, no real information - shocked it wasn't filtered.  Time for a legit review.

Partook in Garcia's this evening.  The bar is full of "Jones" folk.  These are Edward Jones Investment newbies. Apparently every week they fly a new crew (of about 100) in, the failure rate is 96%, but keep the contacts given during the pre-hire process. Granted, there are a few senior Financial Advisers here... They are not who I am referring to in my post.  

So I walk in and I am surrounded by suits (literally... wall to wall) staring me down. For those of you who don't know me - you have to pay me to get me out of shorts and a t-shirt.  If you pay me or you are a 4-star, I will do Italian threads, but only then! Thankfully, they are all busy doing the Captain pose at the tables so there are a few seats open at the actual bar.  After no less than 6 inquiries of "are you a Jones man?" and 3 job offers (they claim to all make over $200k/yr, according to Glassdoor.com the average salary is $43, 257) I am finally left alone to enjoy my Grey Goose and a la carte taco. 

The Goose... stellar... 9 bucks.  Average for Tempe.  Bartender (Bryan) is a real cool dude.  I felt his pain, he felt mine.

The taco is decent.  If I would have been a grease fan I would have liked it a lot more, possibly 5-stars.  I had pork (known at every other Mexican restaurant I have been to as Carnitas) and it had some flavor.  Positive points there.

The atmosphere was decent, TV's with the MNF game highlights on... I think 3 stars is both fair and generous (I am aware of the contradiction).  If you are sequestered to the hotel without a car, great option.  

The service from Bryan made the experience decent.

I, however, will not be investing with Edward Jones.
