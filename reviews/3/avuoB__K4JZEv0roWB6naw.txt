We went for the first time last Saturday around 1:00PM. I ordered the Chicken Burrito, which was actually quite good. Good flavor and well put together presentation wise. Service on the other hand was absolutely terrible! Our waitress kept forgetting to check on us and it took forever for refills. Very loud club music was also a negative. If you are going for drinks with your buddies and want to stare at inappropriately clothed women (at least for a lunch hour), then this is your place. If you want family friendly go somewhere else.
