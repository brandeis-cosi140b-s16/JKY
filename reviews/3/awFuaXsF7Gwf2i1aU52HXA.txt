Been here several times as its down the street from my house and really wanted to give 4 stars BUT the Salsa is not good at all--wayyy too salty and no distinct flavor other than salt. The red and green are both not good. This should be an easy fix. If they fix this alone I'd give them 4 stars.

Guacamole is great.
Service is decent. 
Fish tacos are outstanding!
The drunk/drowned torta sandwich is really good but the dipping sauce could use some more flavor. It's oddly quite a bit like the way too salty salsa.

My girlfriend recently was here and they screwed up her order, did not make the burrito as ordered then they offered beans that were cold. Strange as we've had good experiences before.
