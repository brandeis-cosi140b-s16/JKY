Is "El Peñasco" Spanish for "delicious, yet uncomfortably awkward"?

I love this place, I really do. When I was running 10+ miles every Sunday, dreams of an enormous plate of asada, rice and beans were pretty much the only thing that kept me going for an hour and a half.

Top it off with a few beers and you have what I like to call "moderation."

But here's the thing: El Peñasco is always eerily empty. Even when there are several other full tables, it's still somehow...dead. Shit, I've been there when a group of 20+ Race for the Cure walkers showed up in matching t-shirts and it STILL felt awkwardly unoccupied. 

Maybe it's the space. The restaurant is big, open and has way too much empty space up front. It used to be a Chinese buffet, after all (check out the plates they serve on). You can totally still imagine mile-long troughs of MSG-laden treats taking up this extra space.

But don't let that stop you from enjoying it.

Eat in and you'll enjoy fresh green salsa with chunks of avocado and queso fresco. Yum. Red salsa is good as well. Chips are warm. Inexplicable tortilla served with the salsa? You better believe I fucking ate that shit up like it was going out of style. 

The lunch specials are cheap and nap-inducingly filling. The carne asada is a delicious skirt steak of heaven. The house burrito is fried and bad, bad, bad for you. But that's why you're here, right?  

They also serve Mexican breakfast on the weekends. And if there's one thing better than eggs, bacon and a mimosa at 11:00 am on a Saturday, it's juevos, chorizo and a margarita.

When I can't face the awkward anti-ambience, I go for takeout. Plus, at home, no one judges me for eating 1500 calories in one sitting.

For the record, yes, I do in fact know what El Peñasco means. And I didn't have to spend a spring break getting banged by a frat guy in Rocky Point to learn it, either.
