Warning, the salsa, spinach queso, guacamole are pretty spicy. This is coming from real Mexicans, well at least 1/2.  My kids usually love guacamole and their mouths were on fire. They kept on asking for more water, LOL. The spinach queso was a little watery, especially for the $6 we paid for it. Overall, the food was good, but not "great." The service was pretty good. I don't know why we had to wait so long upon arrival when there were plenty of empty tables on a Sunday Evening. I have had much better in So. CA.
