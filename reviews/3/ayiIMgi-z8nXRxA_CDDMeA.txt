Chipotle the organization has developed a pretty good business model: Good food, made fresh in front of the customer, Fast-ish service that is usually well managed and friendly, and a website experience that allows you to order ahead of time and cut the line.  Additionally the fair is (seemingly) healthier than standard fast food and the decor is contemporary which is a refreshing change fron the obnoxious appearance of the average jack in the box or Subway.

However, I am giving this chipotle 3 stars, even though I eat here more often than I eat at any other restaurant.  The two reasons for the average rating are:

1. A homeless person has set up shop outside of the front door
2. As I have alluded, I use the online ordering feature, and they seem to meet the promised time only occasionally.
 
So- they need to shoo the bum and pay more attention to their online customers.  Then I will give this chipotle 5 stars
