This place offers consistently good Mexican Food. However, it is kind of hard to compete in Phoenix. The chips, salsa and bean dip was very good. Chips were served hot to our table. Sadly they were out of salsa verde which is totally my favorite part. I ordered the Port Verde which comes with rice and beans. The sides were spot on but the Pork Verde was a bit bland. My friend ordered a combo plate with a tostada, enchilada and crispy taco. Unfortunately, his instructions had been forgotten and the tostada and taco had ingredients on it that he couldn't eat. Portion sizes are good and the server was pretty attentive.
