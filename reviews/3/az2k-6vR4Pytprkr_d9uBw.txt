Al pastor fries, two carne asada tacos, one large horchata. About $12.50. Came here because the lines at a competing taco place were ridiculous. The guys working were really nice and the horchata was super yummy. Food was served up quickly. The boyfriend said the asada was a little dry and while my fries were good (meat, nacho cheese, queso fresco, sour cream) I wouldn't have minded guac and a little more meat. I would come back because of the low price and/our if my original restaurant choice didn't pan out.
