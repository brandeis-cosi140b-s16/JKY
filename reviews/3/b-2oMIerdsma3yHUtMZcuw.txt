I used to live in the area and was here a lot when it was Chuy's.
Tasty simple food and decent prices. Quick, casual and good drink specials. It's good to see some things just don't change.

Last night was my first visit since it's been CC's. 
Went in with my stepfather as we were both quite hungry and he was in the market for a margarita. We both opted for the combo - a skewer of BBQ shrimp, 1/4 grilled chicken and a couple strips of tri tip. Served with a cabbage salad, beans and choice of flour or corn tortillas for $10.

We grabbed some chips and salsa from the self serve bar, took our drinks out to the patio and chatted for a few minutes (maybe 10, tops) and our dinners were brought to our table.

Disposable plates and utensils (not a fan - for eating from or for the sake of the landfills) - a VERY casual Baja-beach-bar type atmosphere (I am a fan - this is a place I am comfortable walking into for dinner, even after working on a move and being covered in move-related-funk) - and a dog friendly patio! (HUGE PLUS!)

I don't get up to this area much anymore - but when I am, chances are I'll be down for a bite and a drink at CC's.
