This used to be our go to Mexican place, and we still eat there once every few weeks, but I have to admit its been a little hit or miss the last few years. The service is still pretty good and I still really enjoy my carnitas tacos a lot! We've had a couple instances where we got the chicken salad carbon and the chicken just wouldn't be marinated one night. Or the salsa would just taste a bit off. But overall, it's a really comfortable place with a pleasant atmosphere to get pretty good food.
