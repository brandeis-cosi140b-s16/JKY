Stayed at the LVH for a couple nights and couldnt beleive there wasnt a 24hr restaurant at all. Plus no room service menu. This restaurant was 50/50. Open till midnight which was a plus bc there wasn't anything open that's wasnt high end and we werent looking to apend a silver dollar. Went down there a bit after 11 for dinner. I liked how the bar seating was seperate from the dining room. Very spacious. There was no host/hostess at the door. We had to get a hold of a waiter to be seated. We chose a booth in the dining area which was cozy and quiet. The waiter was very pleasant but forgot to bring more chips and salsa when we ran out and asked for more, but did hook us up at the end and give us a box to go for later snacking. I ordered a bowl of the vegetarian soup which was delicious I would definitely order it again. My bf ordered the chicken enchiladas he enjoyed his dish as well.  The waiter took a long time to bring us our bill, think he went on break we had to grab someone else and they got him. Pricing was average for a casino. We would go back again for the food but not the service. When a restaurant is pretty empty you're service should be prompt.
