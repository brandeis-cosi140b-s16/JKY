Loving this place!  I am a huge fan of poolside drinking and I feel like I'm on vacation when I step in here.  I had no idea there was food here so that may tell you something about grabbing a bite to eat here....not so much the "dinner-out" kind of place.  The crowd is definitely a Scottsdale mix but I think this is just what Old Town needed to turn things up.
