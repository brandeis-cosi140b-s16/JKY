Same tired d√©cor for at least two and a half decades and the restrooms are to be avoided. Prices are up and overall quality of the food is mediocre. Salsa is overly sweet, I spice it up with the hotter version. The best things I can say are easy access with ample parking and quick friendly table service. The mini San Marcos burro is an OK lunch choice as is the chile relleno plate. I no longer bring out of town visitors here.
