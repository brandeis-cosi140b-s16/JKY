Good for getting fed and gone. Average food and ~good~ drinks. 

Made it here by 6:30 only to find they didn't have Happy Hour deals this week (ever?). Ordered fish tacos with a bonus carnitas taco. Nothing spectacular, but the carnitas was the second best I've had this week in that it didn't appear to be reheated for the fifth time (Yard House was tops believe it or not, Cabo Wabo was worst). Kitchen was lightening fast, cool for a busy week when a huge trade show was in town.   

My advice? Grab a drink and a small app before you hit the road... then hit the road.
