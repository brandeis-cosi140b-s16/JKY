This place is definitely not your typical authentic Mexican food place. However keep in mind that they are only open on Sunday's for brunch and I assume open on the other days for lunch and dinner. This place is super far from the strip and super close by the airport. The environment looked like industrial inside so that was cool but I didn't feel the Mexican vibe. I used a groupon and my deal didn't mention anything about not using it on Sunday so I couldn't use it on dinner so the manager or owner was generous enough to give us a deal anyway, hence the 3 stars. The reason why I rate this place low is bcuz I found a hair in my sausage breakfast sandwich, which by the way their breakfast is over priced. Its something anyone could make at home especially since they give you this small sandwich bread. The waiter was extremely nice to us as well. She also makes up for the 3 stars.
