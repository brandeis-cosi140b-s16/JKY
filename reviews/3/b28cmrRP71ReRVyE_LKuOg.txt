I haven't had Baja in awhile, but after the gym last night I was craving their yummy fish tacos. I've always been a fan of the fish tacos, because there's so few "fast" Mexican places you can grab decent fish items. Plus I do love their taquitos with the tasty cheese dipping sauce as well.

Unfortunately I think Baja has gone down hill in the past few years since its magnificent presence began infesting cities in Nevada and other places. Yes, it may still be "fresh" compared to say, Del Taco, but it is lacking.

I ordered the fish tacos, and was surprised they were so bland. I had to drench them in salsa (supposedly "hot" salsa... which was not... hot.). The fish was dry and unseasoned and it was like a long, stick of fish. It literally almost reminded me of putting a fish stick into a taco shell and calling it a day.

Why is the salsa bland now? Why is the fish not fresh? Is there a new CEO cutting corners, or is it just this particular establishment?

I don't know, but I DO know I am probably going to make the trip to Rubio's in Henderson from now on if I really want some good fish tacos.
