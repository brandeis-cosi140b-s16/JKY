Burrito bowl with rice, carnitas, queso, veggies, guacamole, sour cream, verde salsa. (most were adders) 
Food tasted great. 
With tea was over $12!
Didn't see lettuce as an option like Chipotle. Didn't seem as fresh either. 
Close to work, so I'll probably eat here again, but very pricey for what it is. However, hardly anyone was here, so I doubt it will be around in a year.
