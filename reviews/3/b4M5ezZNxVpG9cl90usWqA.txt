This is a totally acceptable spot for okay Tex-Mex food. The margaritas are not impressive and a large will run you $12. The service is always very friendly and prompt. If you're looking for authentic Mexican, this is not your place. If you're looking for semi-seasoned meat fried in tortillas and smothered in cheese sauce, this is the place for you. You're also able to make substitutions at no additional cost. 

The kids' meals are all $4.25 without a drink and they have a pretty sizable selection to choose from.
