I tried Hippie's with 2 of my coworkers today and thought it was pretty good. First, for $1.50 a taco, you can't beat it as each of them weighs about a pound each! 

I tried a pork and a daily special of green chili shredded beef. The pork was better than the beef and both could have used a little seasoning, but I am stuffed! I liked the cabbage, rice, pinto bean mix in the taco along with the 2 choices of salsa and thank goodness for all the napkins as these are messy! 

It is quite busy at lunch so it can be a bit of a wait to get your food. But compared to other little lunch haunts, this one actually had enough parking and seating to accommodate all the customers. They also serve different flavored lemonades (blood orange, watermelon etc) which I will be trying next time I come here. 

All in all, a solid 3 stars!
