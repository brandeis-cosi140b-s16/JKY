Tried the Indian fried bread. 

It was cool they offer it but it was just OK. I had it topped with green chili and cheese. 

The green chili was good. Nice kick without being too hot. 

The fried bread was just OK. It seemed a little old, perhaps frozen and reheated. 

The swap meet has better. 

The chips and salsa were good. I prefer the hot sauce over the salsa. 

They have nothing over Ponchos in S Phoenix.
