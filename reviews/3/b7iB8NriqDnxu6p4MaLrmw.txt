Came here for free tacos after my last experience with another Rubios store. The cashier was friendly, confirmed everything we said, and pretty much got the entire order wrong. We did complicate things a bit, but I didn't get guac on my Especial tacos, and my hubby didn't get the mango habanero salsa. Otherwise, it was fine.

Unrelated to rubios, we were sitting outside and the mall security guard just came up to our table, maybe a foot or less from me, and started staring through the window looking at the menu. It was a little unnerving, just him standing there with his stuff in my face while I'm eating. Little weird.

Manager came out and cleared our plates, which was nice, and they were out of tea, which I have come to expect from every fast food place ever. Bleh experience.
