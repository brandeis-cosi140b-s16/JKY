My biggest problem with David's is its identity. First is the menu. It's a fusion of 50's style dinner food and Mexican. Then there's the decor. It's neither 50's nor Mexican. Oh sure, oldies, mostly 50's play on the sound system but that's where the correlation between the menu and decor ends. To their credit David's does put out a great burger and the tacos aren't bad either. The chips are served warm and the salsa is actually homemade and quite tasty. I've been here twice and both times there were no more than 3 tables occupied. Even so the service isn't great. If your timing is good you might pass by when the owner is outside handing out 20% coupons. David's is nestled between the high priced trinket shops and restaurants of touristy Old Town Scottsdale. Somehow the place just doesn't fit but the food is good and inexpensive
