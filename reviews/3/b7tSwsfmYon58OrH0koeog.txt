well.. first time I went here.. I got burritos for me and coworkers - and they were all good .. no one complained.. I was very excited I found a good little place close to home and loved the spicy chorizo - So.. I waited all week to have another chorizo potato and egg burrito.. and I was disappointed :( - It had so many onions (which I didn't ask for) that I just gave the other half away. I picked out the onions which some were burnt and some still almost raw?! -- I'm half tempted to post a pick of how much onion i picked out of my half .. I wont give up just yet.. I will give the place another chance before I totally nix it.
