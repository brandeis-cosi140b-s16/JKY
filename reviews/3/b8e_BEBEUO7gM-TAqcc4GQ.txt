This place is a surprise when you walk in the door. I expected it to be similiar to the many fast food mexican places in the valley. It is actually a sit down restaurant with servers.

I read the reviews and decided to try. I probably know just about EVERY mex place in Phx. The food at this place is just "so so" with the exception of the salsa.  The salsa is very good. The hot sauce is....different.  It's a cream base and is hot but not a great flavor. I had a red chili burro enchilada style. The red chili has a lot of meat but very little flavor. The enchilada style was sparse and I had even asked for extra sauce. My daughter ordered a burro with a filling that included shredded beef, rice, beans, lettuce, and pico. I cannot remember the name of it. She asked for it with NO beans and enchilada style. Again, the ench style was sparse AND her burro included beans that she does not like and did not want. The shredded beef had very good flavor.

Had to give it a try. Not sure that I would be back.
