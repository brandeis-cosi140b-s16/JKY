Late afternoon, on Father's day
Riva's is not busy, one other patron infront of us, and one arrived after us. 

We've been here before, the food is tasty, but not spectacular.
The salsa bar is a plus, but you have to search or ask for it, as it is closed to prevent spoilage, or flies.  There is no A/C, so don't plan on eating here, either drive through, or carry out in the summer.... 

And BEWARE, although tasty, foods are not freshly made.  There is a microwave they use to heat food.  One of  my four Styrofoam containers was microwaved to the point of melting inside.
