We stopped by after our Sunday Funday on Mill. My first impression of Chronic Tacos is that it reminds me of So Cal. A hangout for Bro's and Ho's. I couldn't decide what I wanted so I let the guy working the counter choose my meal. He made me a chicken quesadilla. My boyfriend who is perfectly capable of making decisions for himself ordered a chicken burrito. I thought the quesadilla was okay but my boyfriend LOVED his burrito. There was a band singing Sublime songs while we were eating and they were awesome. I wasn't impressed with the food but I think I'd come back to drink a Corona and listen to live music.
