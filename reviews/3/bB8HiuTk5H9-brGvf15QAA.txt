Pretty standard fast Mexican style food.  It's not anything special, but it's not going to make you sick either.  I usually load up on the salsas just to try and give the food a little something extra.  I like that they do put a nutrition/calorie count next to their food selections now a days.  On the whole, if you're just looking for a quick meal this place is fine.  I do however like that they take Rebel Cash, makes it really easy for UNLV students.
