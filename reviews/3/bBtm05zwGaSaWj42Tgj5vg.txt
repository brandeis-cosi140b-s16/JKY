Restaurant review:
There are so many mexican restaurants/fast food places to visit around the UIUC campus. I stopped by here on the weekend for lunch after work and was surprised there was no line. The cashier was quick to take my order after I figured out what I wanted and the food came out as I ordered without any issue. This is what pulls up the rating to 3 stars as the food has sharply declined from taco bell and is now a lot more expensive. Crunchy tacos are no longer 0.79 cents but 1.29 now. A lot of the other items have doritos, fritos, etc which is interesting, but it does not carry over to tasting good. All and all as fast food I think I will pass from eating at Taco bell now with the higher prices and subpar food items. The parking lot is also very small which is another issue. 

Pro: Large selection of fast mexican food, quick service, friendly cashiers

Cons: Subpar food, very small parking lot

Hidden gem:
Happier hour 2 - 5 PM 1 dollar regular freeze or medium drink. Value menu, although a lot of items are no longer one dollar.
