I wish I would have read Andrea's review before coming to Chile Addiction.
We had the chicken nachos and the chile rellenos with both green and red chile. To sum the food up in one word: bland. Seriously, I didn't know a chile stuffed with cheese and covered in chile could be bland, but it was. Calabicitas: bland. Nachos: chips with plain chicken breast on top and a small amount of cheese sauce on the bottom (which somehow also lacked flavor). They don't even offer some table salsa to spice things up on your own. 
Sopapillas come with your meal, which is a nice touch and why they got the 3rd star. However, we had 2 adults and 2 kids, so we split 2 entrees, and were served 2 sopapillas. How much would it cost to provide 4 sopapillas for 4 people???
Service was a little slow, but overall ok.
Mostly, I'm just disappointed that I used up one of my valuable bookmark trips on Chile Addiction.
