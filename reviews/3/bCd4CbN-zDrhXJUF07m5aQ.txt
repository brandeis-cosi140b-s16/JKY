Let me start off by saying how sad I am that I'm not giving this place 5 stars because I really wanted to do so. Been wanting to try it so purchased the Groupon & went there in between classes.

The prices could be comparable to Chipotle & Zabas so I thought portions would be quite the same but I was wrong. Concept was the same but portions, not so much. Ordered a bowl with rice & Pulehu steak with mostly all the fixins (salsa, cheese, sour cream, beans, lettuce). The fixins took over my bowl pretty much. I had to dig through the mountain of toppings to even try the steak. Oh how delicious it was but I only had about 6 or so good pieces in it. And my bowl lacked rice. My palm was bigger. It was yummy though but I felt like I just ordered a big bowl of lettuce and salsa.

My food was not warm either. My bf had the burrito and he said his was room temp. Mine was actually somewhat cold because of the amount of lettuce on it. 

We also ordered chips and salsa. All I know is that my chips were so stale and chewy and it was hard to bite into.. All for $5. Sigh..

Basically, I left my bowl of lettuce, cheese and salsa on the table, a bit disappointed. Really wanted to love this place. I'm from Hawaii & God knows how excited I was to try it. Thank goodness for the Groupon though..

I'll come back soon. Maybe it's just today. They're really friendly & food tasted good. A couple kinks here & there but it has potential so I'm looking forward to trying it again, for sure.
