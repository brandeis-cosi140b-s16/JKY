First off I would like to say that the food was excellent. I ordered the pollo con queso. It was a chimichanga filled with chicken and covered with jalape√±o cream cheese then smothered in cheese. I would highly recommend it! The service was sub par. It was my first visit to Arriba's so my guest and I were very unfamiliar with the menu and the "spice" level. We had a lot of questions and John our server seemed annoyed with our ignorance regarding the menu. He answered our questions with vague replies such as "it looks just like the picture" instead of answering the question directly. Then, mid-meal we got a new server which was really confusing because who do I tip? Besides that, our food came fast and as I've said before the food was great. They are a little pricey compared to other Mexican restaurants everything is 8.99 and up and they charge a lot for sides like sour cream and other fixings. I might go back but I certainly wouldn't bring someone who hasn't been there.
