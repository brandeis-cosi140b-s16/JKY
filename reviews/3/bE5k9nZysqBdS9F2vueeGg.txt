While I am still fairly new to the Mexican food scene I have to say Marias is some of the best I have had. 

I went during a lunch rush on a Friday. I have to disagree with Julia S. in saying it is packing with gringos. My friend and I were the extreme minority in this case. For the first time I felt embarrassed that I didn't speak Spanish, because every other patron in the restaurant did.

That being said, had an enchilada, burrito, some tacos, and everything was incredible. Tasted very fresh, chips were good, but the salsa did leave something to be desired. 

Can't wait to return and try some other things on the menu!
