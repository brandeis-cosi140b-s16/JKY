Garduno's aka Agave (Bar) is not known for the food so much as their Margarita's and drinks. They have a good, cheap happy hour, the chips and salsa are good and if you order a Coconut Margarita you'll love it and not drink a lime one again! Caloric and sweet as hell but oh so good! The happy hour food is COMPLETELY different than the Restaurant Menu food so remember you get what you pay for!
