Wife had fond memories of the food here being delicioso so while in town we stopped by. We were seated immediately well not immediately there was some confusion with the staff as they circled each other searching for purpose. 
Our server was pleasant but there were gaps in delivery. For instance we asked for onions and tomatoes on the side and the tacos were delivered with them right on top. Luckily, the onions were big chunks that could be easily removed. We ordered an avocado, since there guacamole is made in the morning, not fresh to order. The avocado was delivered late and keep in mind this is just avocado in a bowl not a fancy presentation.
The salsa was salty and not that interesting.
With all of the above why am I rating a 4 ... because the tacos were delicious! We ordered a trio: pork, chicken, and beef. Good stuff.
Keep in mind you're in Vegas and everything on the strip is more than off the strip. So don't complain about the prices ;)
