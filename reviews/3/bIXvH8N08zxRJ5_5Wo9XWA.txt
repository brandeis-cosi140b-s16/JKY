I come here when I'm dieting. They have a really nice light and healthy menu with several good selections. I always get the chicken fajita salad its simple but there is something about the fresh hot really good chicken fajitas with the crunch of the cold iceberg. love this salad. I don't use the dressing I just pour a Bowl of there yummy salsa over the top and go to town.
