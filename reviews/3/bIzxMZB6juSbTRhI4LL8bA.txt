I go to El Penasco for lunch during the work week.  It's always good, but for me the service is always better than the food.  Not that the food is awful, but it's not really super great either.  

Their lunch menu is much more limited than their dinner/weekend menu, but it's got the basics and everything is about $6 which makes is a popular spot.  When I go early I can be one of 2 tables in the place, but by 12:30 or so it's ususally getting pretty full - often including 20 folks or so in their seperate room meant for large groups.  

Agreeing with Calamari about the rice and beans though.  I could get better opening a can of Rosarita and heating up some Rice-a-Roni.  Not high benchmarks at all.  I had a different experience with the salsa, which makes me wonder if it's made fresh - and she just got a bad batch.  The red had a fresh taste and pleasant kick while the green tomatillo had a really nice flavor. While the chips were fairly standard, they also included a hot tortilla on top of the chips which was a nice option.  

Not a bad spot for a quick lunch, but it wouldn't be a destination spot for me.
