Food gets 2 stars, service 4. Staff was nice, but definitely not trained wait staff, she read our total to us out loud and stood over us while we signed and filled in the tip... She wasn't rude it was just awkward. I tried the Gorditas and my husband got a GIANT burrito. My Gorditas were bland and had no kind of sauce, meh.  Burritos was okay, best part was the tortilla. I'm not sure what everyone else is talking about on here...
