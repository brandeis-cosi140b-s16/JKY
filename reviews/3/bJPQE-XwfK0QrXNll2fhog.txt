Let me just say I like Baja fresh, mostly for their variety of great tasting salsas @ the salsa bar. I also appreciate the cilantro is available solo - not mixed with onions like @ Rubio's.  I do prefer the food @ rubio's but you get what you pay for calorie wise - so if it tastes better its probably worse for you. If I could combine Rubio's food with Baja Fresh salsa, it would be perfection. 

I recently went to this baja fresh location on Ash Wednesday before going to mass down the road. I was starving and ate like a prisoner about to take my food away, yup it was that serious. I hadnt eaten really all day b/c ur supposed to fast on Ash wed and are only allowed 2 snacks and one meal but the 2 snacks cant equal the one meal - somethin like that. 

I went with the 2 blackened mahi mahi tacos (that I normally order in Hendo by the Galleria) which are normally really good. Unfortunately this was mahi mahi was so dry, blackened ( and not in a spice way but a burned way) maybe they didnt know thats what that meant? 

ah well I ate it b/c i was starving but i probably wouldnt order it again from this location.
