My husband and I stopped by this place after we saw their owner (I think) on Guy's Big Bite show.

I ordered Carne Asada Burrito and he had Carne Asada Torta. We also ordered two tacos since we read they are famous for it.

Their service and food was okay (ehh). If you are not fan of onions ask your order to be without it (they put gang of onions). Their hot sauce was definately kicking.

However, their meat was extremely well marinted (which is a big plus for both of us). Our overall experience was alright. Nothing to dislike but nothing to rave about.

If you love authentic tacos, this just might be a place for you.
