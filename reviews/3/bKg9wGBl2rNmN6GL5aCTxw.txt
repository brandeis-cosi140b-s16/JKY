Taco Tuesday and man they piss me off. Got two chicken tacos 2 beef tacos and an order of fries extra crispy the fries weren't even done enough for regular fries let alone being crispy second of that they forgot to put tacos in the bag and I had to go back. When I point out the fries to the lady she wanted to take them from me and put them back in the fryer of total health code violation WTF!
