I've been to many Chipotles and this one skews more to the average. I prefer the one on State Street, closer to downtown. This University Ave Chipotle is a bit more cramped, though I usually see it not very full. This spot has a fair amount of bar-style seating, and has one of those large wooden cabinets with the banked speakers. Its location is not the easiest to access unless you're headed west on University, especially during rush hour.

This location has run out of sofritas on me before, but when this happened at the other location, they gave out free lunch vouchers. I've seen this location out them out of other items for other customers when I've returned since. Anyway, look, I wish this location the best, especially since it's closest to me, and I hope they work out the kinks soon.
