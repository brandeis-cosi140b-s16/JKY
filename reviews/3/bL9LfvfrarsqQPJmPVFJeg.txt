I heard about his place before and always wondered if the food was good. My verdict is yes.

The decoration of the restaurant is cool and it has that "skateboarders at the beach" southern cali feel to it. They have a wide variety of food there but like any spot  I go to that serve Mexican food I gauge the food by how good the carne asada tacos are and I must say that although they are a little bit pricier than what I am normally used to paying, they were very good! The meat was flavorful and juicy. The setup is similar to Chipotle or Zaba's were you pick what kind of filling you want. I went with the simple "authentic" onions, cilantro and salsa. The guy who was making the tacos was like "is that all??? no lettuce or cheese?". I know that most people who like to eat more Americanized tacos like to have lettuce and cheese and all that but no self respecting authentic Mexican food lover like myself would do that to a taco. I can see how that would justify the $3 each asking price though if you get one of those "super duper supreme look i got all this stuff in my taco" kinda tacos so I'm not knocking them on that. The other thing I got was the chicken flautas which actually were really good although I think they were frozen and not fresh. If I go back, I will have to try the enchiladas cause I love me some enchiladas too.

Oh and the staff is really nice and friendly too. I wasnt able to find a lid for my drink and one of the girls notice me walking back and forth lookin for them. She apologized and ran in the back to get some more and said that next time to tell them right away and they will give me a bigger drink for free! Pretty cool if you ask me!
