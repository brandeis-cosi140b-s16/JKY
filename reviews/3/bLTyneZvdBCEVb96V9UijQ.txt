They'll deliver a burrito - that's cool. The burritos are essentially drunk food, lots of protein and not that exotic, but they fill you up.

More than one of their delivery guys have given me desperate phone calls, asking where my house is cause it's dark (after over an hour of waiting). They pay no attention to "hold the onions" either - again, based on repeated experiences. Ahh Willy street hippies....
