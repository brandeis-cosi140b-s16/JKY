This little shack serves good food.  They are a Filibertos clone, with all of the same food, but I think they they make most of the food better, or at least as good.  The California Burrito is awesome.  So why do I only give them 3 stars?  It is a shack in a dirt lot.  Honestly, that keeps me away.  I realise that most of these type of shops are in rundown or older buildings, but this place is particularly old.  A newer building with a drive through would get my 5 star rating.
