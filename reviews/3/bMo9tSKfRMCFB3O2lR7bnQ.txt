Major upgrade from Cocomo's.  The ambiance is much nicer, cannot wait until they put in their new FAJITA BAR (going to look like hibachi).  Wife ordered the chicken burrito and we shared that and the Mexican pizza.  Nothing special about the burrito but it was large,  Mexican pizza was pretty good, if you like spicy get their hot salsa.  Our friends got the shrimp ceviche and said it was awesome!  All in all will go back!
