Over all I liked everything. 

As for starters... the chips and salsa were excellent. The chips where very good... ne was like your standard nacho chips but the others mixed in where very different.They were flakey and light...  jet really good.

The "black cherry" Sangria (i order it non-frozen) was amazing...   really good and garnished with frozen cherries which was a nice touch.

Main dishes where very good. We ordered a wise array of dishes and everyone was happy with what was served. I ordered fajitas which were very good and had a nice sauce.

Over al everything was fresh and good quality. 

Service was slow... but we were there at lunch and a few larger parties were there so understandable. But a few points of waiting was a bit long of a wait to get drinks and some other things which took the experience down a notch.


If it wasn't for the poor service issue I would give a 4 Star rating.. but unfortunately I took it down to a 3.
