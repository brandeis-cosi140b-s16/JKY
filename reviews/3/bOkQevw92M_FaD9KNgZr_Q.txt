They do have great food, but I have had my order messed up several times or they don't put my full order in the bag. That's always dissapointing when you've already driven away.
I've also come in the evening hours (11pm ish)
and they were closed!!!  (They are supposed to be open until 1am or later) no notice on the doors or drive thru area. Nothing. 
And that has happened more than once.
