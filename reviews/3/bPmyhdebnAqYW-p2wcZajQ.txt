This place has a lot of potential....I paid 30.00 for a carne asada burrito, 3 shrimp tacos and two drinks....I would pay that for a burrito that was to big for me to finish and some killer shrimp tacos but neither met those criteria...the menu could be organized much better..........so to the owner here is my personal opinion of how to better things: Menu - you got to much repetitive stuff on there. You are either a build your own tacos, tortas and burritos or your not.....if you are then I just need to know the types of meats and extras that I can choose from.....if your not build your own then just tell me what is included in the tacos, tortas and burritos beside the meat......beans you either have refried or black beans not frijoles or black beans.......the shrimp tacos needs more substance mainly from the shrimp need a better batter and serve it with shredded cabage, chopped tomatoes with chopped white onion and cilantro, lightly squeezed lime topped with a cream either crema or guacamole cream........my burrito was almost flat. The flavor of the meat was very good but wasnt worth the price...you have something good here just need to up the food in order to require customers to pay 30.00 for a burrito, 3 tacos and 2 drinks....customer service was great.......guys are very friendly and attentive
