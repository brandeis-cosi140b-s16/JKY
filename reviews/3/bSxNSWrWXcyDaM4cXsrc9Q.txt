This place was mediocre. Simply stated. We came here on a Friday night, sat outside, which was a nice environment. There was a live 3 man band, playing frank Sinatra, no complaints there+2. We ordered margaritas, classic lime flavored on the rocks. They were good +2! Definitely would recommend the margaritas, but that's where it stops. The chips and salsa were "fine", but that's because IMO it takes a lot to mess up chips and salsa. Chips were crunchy, salty and tasted fresh +1. However, their salsa was the blandest thing of salsa ever -1. Entrees, hubby got a classic burrito, he said it was good +2. We both got rice and beans and the beans were fine, but the rice had zero flavor. I ordered three flour tacos with chicken, onions, cilantro, and cabbage. Not bad, but it was missing something -2. The meal comes with an avocado type salsa but it didn't compliment the tacos right. Looking more for a verde salsa or something similar. The service was good. We had to ask for a few refills-1, but other than that, he was great to give us space and enjoy our time outside. This place definitely doesn't stand out as good Mexican food to come back, however the location is cool with the live band if your interested in that.
