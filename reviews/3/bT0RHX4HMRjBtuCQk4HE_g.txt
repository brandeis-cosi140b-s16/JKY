Phil got me started on thinking back of all these vegas places, lol. This place is not that bad really, alot of 1 star reviews but I guess you just have to know what to order. I have been here a few times and enjoyed it. Last time, it was weird though, I was meeting a local vegas contact here for dinner but I made her wait forever for me because I was in a strip club for an early evening adventure. I was like you live here, none of this is new to you. Shit happens, the margaritas here were kind of weak though. The beer was enjoyable and the chicken nachos are gigantic in proportion.

***I have some pictures and Video from here but probably should not put them here or on facebook.
-Editor's Foot Note, Why did I initially give it a 4, it was way more of a 2.5 or 3, there..I said it.
