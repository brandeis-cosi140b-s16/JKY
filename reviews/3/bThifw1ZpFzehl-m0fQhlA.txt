We visited Maria Bonita for the first time last night and thought it was pretty good.  We wanted to redeem a restaurant.com coupon that we bought several months ago, but we didn't realize that a recent deal on Living Social/Groupon would make it so busy!  There was a 15 minute wait, but we decided to skip the table and sit at the bar right away.  

We ordered some queso and the brie and walnut quesadillas for appetizers.  I wasn't a fan of either, but I know now that I'm fine with their complimentary chips and salsa...both fresh and yummy!

For dinner, I ordered the chicken and steak fajitas, and my husband ordered their "signature dish".  I think it was some sort of beef with a ring of pineapple from a can on top.  Apparently, the kitchen was backed up with a big party (maybe 10 people) upstairs and a full restaurant, so we waited quite a while between our appetizers and when we finally asked to just have our entrees boxed up.  It ended up not being that big of a deal, because we were pretty full from the appetizers.  

After trying my fajitas at home, I will definitely be back to Maria Bonita to get some.  However, I think I'll call in my order to go next time.  There was plenty of food, and the flavor was so good.  They're not like most fajitas I've had before; there were tomatoes, zucchini, onions, and peppers all cooked in with the chicken and beef.  My husband's beef was pretty good, but not very impressive.  

I would definitely recommend going to Maria Bonita, but don't go when you're in a hurry.  And get the fajitas!!!
