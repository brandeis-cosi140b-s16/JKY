The food was great and what I expected from CT. Fresh tasting, solid seasoning, good portion sizes. 
The only thing that kept this review from being  was the wait time and employee's attitude. 
I've worked in restaurants and I understand that when things get chaotic it's hard to maintain a good flow but from the beginning of our order to when we got our food was 30 minutes. That's 30 minutes of standing in line while the employees were grumbling and angry. One lady was just slamming trays around and kept talking crap about the bearded guy. Like seriously? I don't want to hear that. Bearded guy was actually really nice and was the only employee to make the experience better. 

Fake it til you make it, CT. Put a smile on and it'll help with the wait time.
