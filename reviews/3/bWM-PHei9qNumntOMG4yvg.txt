When someone at work says "Mexican for lunch?" They can always count me in!

My coworkers and I arrived a little after before noon and the parking lot was already packed. I was pleased that even though the lot was full there was no wait and we were seated immediately. 

No sooner than we sat down we had a basket of chips and two different salsas. I really liked their salsa. I wasn't a fan of the chips because they were not served up hot but I ate them anyway because the salsa was just that good. Spicy and delicious...just like I like it. 

The menu had great variety and the prices were excellent! I ordered the Deluxe Taco Salad with chicken - It comes in a tortilla shell with tomatoes, guacamole, sour cream and cheese. 

Our food arrived so freaking fast! My goodness! What a major win for the very hungry lunch crowd! 

My salad was just okay. Don't get me wrong, it was not bad by any means and the portion size was not a problem. It was the tortilla shell. It was not crispy like I'm used too but that's just my personal preference. I still loaded it up with salsa and enjoyed every bite.  

For the prices this place is a great deal for lunch. I'd definitely come back, there's so much more I have to try...See ya soon Azteca!
