I ordered a hurache de alambre . certainly did not meet my expectations. The size is huge , but it felt more I was eating a big taco rather than a hurache. The corn tortilla is handmade. Definitely huraches are not their specialty. The costumer service is decent, but the place itself is not very clean. I do like the fact that you can see the cook prepare your food. I will be going back if I get very hungry and I'm around the area but I will not order anything with alambre, and most definetly not a hurache
