Co - worker sent me on a taco run.   This time just regular tacos for me.  The regular tacos are good.  I don't think you can go wrong with that!  My co worker, said his fish tacos weren't that good this time either.  So I guess there fish tacos are hit and miss.   So I think I will stick with there tacos and hamburgers only!
