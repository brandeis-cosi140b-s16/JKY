Was meeting with a friend who lives nearby and decided to stop by here for a quick lunch before the meeting.

The restaurant is very clean and it looks like it recently opened.  The menu was pretty extensive, so I went for an old standard....the Carne Asada Burrito, which I thought was a bit pricey for $4.99 as I've found some really good places lately much cheaper than that.  

While I was waiting for my food, I noticed a small Salsa Bar in the corner.  It was your typical bar with Green & Red Chile Salsa and the pickled vegetables.

I didn't have to wait long for my Burrito.  The size of the Burrito was large...they definitely didn't hold back.  After the first bite, the flavor tasted familiar.....it took me a few more bites before I placed it.....it tasted exactly like Roberto's Carne Asada Burrito.  From the the flavor of the meat to the Guacamole Salsa to the Flour Tortilla....it was IDENTICAL!

I'm not a huge fan of Roberto's, so I was underwhelmed.

Will I return?  Eh...if I'm hungry and in a pinch....but it's not my first preference when I'm looking for a Taco Shop.
