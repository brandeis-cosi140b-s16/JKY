Absolutely delicious when you're intoxicated. A 50-50 chance being decent or totally gross when you're sober. Los Betos offers a lot of greasy food for cheap, but like any 24-hour drive through Mexican stand in the valley, it's a gamble that you will most likely regret when you wake up in the morning. 

I used to live a stone throw From Los Betos and ate here way too many times during that period of my life. Like a majority of the patrons, I drove through after a night at the bars or after a late night of working when traditional fast food just wouldn't do it for me. I also probably had a BAC that was pretty close to the legal limit. The staff was always pretty cool and friendly. For better or for worse, one guy even consistently remembered that my usual order was 3 rolled tacos with guacamole and a quesadilla.
