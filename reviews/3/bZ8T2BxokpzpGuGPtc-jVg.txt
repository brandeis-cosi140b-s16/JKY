Another classic 3.5 stars. I'm not quite a fan, but it's better than 3 stars. Food is better than average, not great, just better than average.
Service can take a while depending on if it's lunch hour or not. It's not cheap, however, it's not expensive. I just feel like I'd rather spend $10 on something better.
It's a chain, so there is really nothing of substance I can say that hasn't already been said.
