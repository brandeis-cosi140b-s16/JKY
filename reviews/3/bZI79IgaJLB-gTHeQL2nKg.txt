I enjoy eating at this restaurant although I have to admit they can be hit or miss as far as the food. Today I had a #4(shredded beef taco and 2 cheese enchiladas) and it was very tasty but I'm not crazy about the sonoran enchiladas at all. The salsa is good and the service is good but it has kind of a dingy "hole in the wall" type atmosphere inside. I do like how they give you an ice cream cone after your meal. The kiddos like that too.
