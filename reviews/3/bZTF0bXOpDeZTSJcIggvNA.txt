Interesting concept but somehow not cohesive. There are 3 food stations, a bar and a coffee bar. You order from the bar, then pick up your food from a food station when your pager rings. We ordered a Craft Burger with grilled onions and cheese. It came as ordered on a shiny sesame toasted bun that reminded me of Bob's Big Boy from 40+ years ago! Sweet potato tots were yummers. Not sure what the addictive little sprinkles were, but they were good. We also had a Chicken Milanese Torta. Again the bread was really good, but the chicken mediocre and the bean pur√©e made everything slide around. Also needed more sauce on the roll. I'm going to give this place another try based on the good, especially since it's their first day. Staff is nice and exceptionally trained. 
I hope they add table service here.
