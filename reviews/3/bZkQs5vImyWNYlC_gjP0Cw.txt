I agree with several other reviews that the food could use a lot more seasoning but it was A-ok. The server was very friendly and the food was reasonably fast. The portions were good and the prices fair. The place looked clean and since I am stuck in Florence for work, it is a good little mexican food place to have nearby. I had the sredded beef burrito with green enchilada sauce. My two coworkers had the taco salads and said they were good as well. The chips and salsa were good as well!
