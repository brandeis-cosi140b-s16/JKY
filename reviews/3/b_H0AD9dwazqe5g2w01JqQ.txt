I was less than impressed with the chips and salsa. The chips were a little well done and the salsa was hot. I LOVE salsa and I was unable to eat this stuff. 
The service was fantastic! I was impressed with how attentive our servers were. 
My food was just OK. I ordered the "Grandpa Timo's Shrimp." Translate into Spanish to order. It was gulf shrimp, stuffed with cheese and peppers, wrapped in bacon and then deep fried. Three of my favorite things in one dish. The shrimp was fantastic but the bacon was really really crunchy. The cheese and the Timo sauce were good. 
My wife had the Orange Roughy and enjoyed it. Our meal, without drinks, came to about $42. Not too bad and truly worth it if the service is always going to be this great. We left a great tip.
