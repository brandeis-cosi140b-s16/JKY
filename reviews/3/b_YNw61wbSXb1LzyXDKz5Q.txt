Overpriced....

Drinks OVERpriced...Cheapest Margarita was about $9 bucks.

Good salsa, good guacamole...Very salty chips

Lame chicken taco's, did not like them at all. Portion size was not good either....but I did not finish them because I would rather have Taco Bell than these "fancy" taco's.

Not impressed so far but might give them another chance for dinner one time, the lunch was certainly nothing special.
