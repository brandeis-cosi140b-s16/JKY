If cleanliness is next to godliness then The Betos is perched on the rim of the 6th circle of hell.
That doesn't mean it's bad mexican food. In fact, it's decent enough to be a "guilty Pleasure". But you will be guilty (you will also not be constipated the next morning, ahhh, the lubricating effects of copious amounts of animal fat).
I was helping my daughter buy and assemble some IKEA furniture (and I use the word "furniture" loosely in conjunction with IKEA) and she bought me lunch at The Betos (are they a family, or what?). She didn't realize that I had been here before (as I said...it's a guilty pleasure...I don't advertise things like this as a general rule). She had just found it, with her roommate, as a late night drive through dinner spot.
We decided to eat at one of the picnic tables and when I got out of the truck, my first thought was "is there a rendering plant in Scottsdale"? No, but you are in the grease trap nexus that exists between Whataburger and The Betos. This is a vortex of decades old cooking grease molecules that will swirl between these 2 establishments and survive until the next ice age freezes them for our ancestors to study.
My carne asada tacos were pretty decent...greasy and tasty. I got some hot sauce (can it be called "hot sauce" if it's not either thing?...just wondering...I suppose "tomato-ey water" doesn't hit the right marketing buttons). Whit had a couple of cheese enchilada's. We were full to the brim and on our way to recovering from IKEA assembly. Just what I needed to slide (pun intended) into the weekend.
