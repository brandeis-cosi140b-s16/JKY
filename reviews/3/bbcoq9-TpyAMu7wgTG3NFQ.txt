Staff is always friendly and courteous!  However, we've been to this location 4 times now, and each time our table has been dirty with food all over it. On a couple occasions, our food came out room temperature---not even warm. We told the manager and she was very kind and brought out new food which tasted great! She even came by later to check in on us - wonderful service! Just wish the food was hot the first time and the tables were a little cleaner. I wouldn't say the same for other Rubio's restaurants - it just seems to be this particular location.
