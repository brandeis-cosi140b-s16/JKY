So as far as the Mad Mex's go, I've been a little disappointed in this one. Came here on a late Friday night. My friends had arrived around midnight and were told that the kitchen was closed. Closed around midnight on a Friday? No no no, that hasn't happened on separate occasions at this location so why tonight? Bad mojo. The server then strongly suggested they move to the bar as she was trying to close out her section early. What great service!

When I got there, I met them at the bar and tried to order a margarita. The bartender shush'd me because he was running someone else's tab. shush'd me. Really.

Ok, here's the positive and why 3 stars instead of 2.  I did order a frozen margarita but after an 1/8th of it, found I wasn't in the mood to eat my drink (as is often the case with a frozen margarita). So I asked if they could switch me and they did for no charge. Plus well, they do have darn good margaritas.
