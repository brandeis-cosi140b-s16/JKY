I came here on 7/11/12. My family and I were so hungry after hanging out with the kids at Adventure Dome in Circus Circus. 

I ordered the Enchilada supreme. It was good but not enough to fulfill my hunger. The serving was very small. If I ordered 2 enchiladas, it would cost around $12-$15. 

The employees were nice and polite but the food just didn't meet my standards.
