The server was super nice. There's salsa bar which had some amazing guacamole, I totally reccomend it. The tacos are simple which is good in its own way. The breakfast burito ok too. Overall it's an enjoyable experience. Only one thing wrong. When going to take my order I saw a cockroach on the ground. Even upon sitting down I saw 2 baby cockroaches on my table. Maybe it'll be cleaner next time.
