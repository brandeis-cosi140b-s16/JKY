This was the first Chipotle I've been to that the service was subpar. This seems consistent with other reviewers. We phoned in our order for pickup and my wife had to call back twice because no one picked up. When someone did, my wife barely could hear the person on the other line--lots of commotion and shouting. 

When I went to pick up the order, it was definite chaos in the kitchen. Very noisy. Never been to a Chipotle so loud before. I went to the register, gave them my name and told me what was in the bag. Got home, and was missing one of two kids meals.

Called back--still hard to hear--and they offered to replace the meal next time we are in. Not sure we will take them up on the offer, but it was a nice gesture. Food was delcious as always--can't fault them there.
