For a fix of a ridiculously large portion (pretty sure the Carne Asada burrito enchilada style might weigh 3lbs) of Mexican food that is pretty darn tasty, consider these guys. They happen to want to dish it out 24 hours a day, so that provides great opportunity to get the goods whenever you might need them.  Not the biggest fan of the ambiance inside so I have started just going through the drive through,  which is usually pretty fast and accurate...something not seen at a lot of drive through windows these days!
