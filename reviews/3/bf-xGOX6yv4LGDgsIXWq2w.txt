Good food for a really reasonable price... the chips were home made and the burritos are HUGE.. loved the sides as well with the beans and rice!  For a nice change these were good here.   Service could be much better since they were not busy when we were there but they were more interested in talking in the corner.  But the food was worth the wait!   The margarita's are good as well - would have had more if we were asked!  Which was probably a good thing!  LOL
