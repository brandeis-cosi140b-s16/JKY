Never usually hit the Bell, but all those damn breakfast commercials made me curious and I recently gave in and tried the AM Breakfast Crunch Wrap with Bacon. This was a unique concoction and for a fast food breakfast item was pretty tasty. It was crunchy, the eggs were fluffy and the mild jalapeno sauce that was inside might have made the difference. Only $2.50, but worthy of a treat once in awhile. Just wish the drive through woman had given me medium sauce like I asked instead of mild.
