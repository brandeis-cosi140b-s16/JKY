Went to lunch here today at noon.  Entered from Scottsdale Mall (Park) side and it was very confusing.    On a perfect day all of the sliding glass doors were closed and for a moment we thought it, Distrito was closed.  

After prying one of the doors open we were greeting to an empty restaurant with exception of one staff member who greeted us but asked if we were "just passing through"???  (To be fair, the doors were all opened by the time we left and WHAT a difference this makes)

After bellying up to bar, our drinks were taken and we were off to a good start.  Questions were answered on menu, drinks taken etc...  Strangely enough they had an ANT problem where we were sitting and had to kill off several.  The friendly enough waiter helped.  (Strange for a luxurious restaurant/hotel should have this problem).  

Chips were delivered right away and several minutes later, the salsa and guacamole we ordered.  We had to ask to silverware and napkin set up.  Again, strange that such a perceived top notch hotel/restaurant would not be up on this standard, given the place was empty, thought they could/would focus soley on us.  

FOOD however was TOP NOTCH.  Had Pork & Shrimp/chorizo tacos.....  Very good quality ingredients and very flavorful.  You could tell they hand crafted each one, right down to the tortilla.   Would go back for sure but maybe at night.  Felt odd being only two in restaurant.  Attention to some very basic details could put this in the 5 star category.
