Service was great again one of my things that I'm big on is management visibility and touching the customer. Was quite sometime before I saw the manager on duty even though was in the bar area - happy hour going on left not to be seen again for awhile. Saw couple more times, but never seen visiting a table to just check and to say hi and thank you! This is a crucial part of building a customer's value in their visit.
