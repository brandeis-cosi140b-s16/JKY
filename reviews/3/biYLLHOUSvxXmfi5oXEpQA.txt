After running some errands my wife and I needed a place to grab a quick bite and we happened to be next to Tex Tubb's Taco Palace.  A quick taco sounded great!

WARNING:  This is not even close to authentic mexican or Tex-Mex food.  So if that is what you are looking for....go to Mexico or Texas because it is hard to find in Madison.

Walking in, it was decorated nice and a bit over the top but thats is the gimmick.  After sitting down I was a bit taken back that they charged $1.00 for chips and salsa.  OMG...$1.00...we got some and some queso dip as well.  The chips were very good and the salsa was decent.  The queso dip however lacked in flavor.

I had 2 different tacos.  The first was a soft shredded beef taco and the second I decided to go for the Philly Cheese Steak taco.  Both tacos were very good especially the Philly Cheesesteak taco.  It was different and I liked that.

My wife got the cheeseburger quesadilla and she enjoyed it very much (WARNING:  Food is very greasy and will give you gas).  I had some and thought it was...eh...it was ok.

So, I enjoyed Tex Tubb's and would eat there again if in the area but would not go out of my way to get it.  What was cool is they served tall boys of PBR!
