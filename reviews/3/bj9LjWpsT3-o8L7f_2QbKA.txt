I arrived with a coworker at 12:15 which should have been smack dab in the middle of the lunch rush. Most of the tables were filled, but the hostess was able to seat us promptly. A minute or two later, a bowl of chips with two different salsas was dropped off as our drink order was taken.

The chicken fajita burrito was served on a very hot plate with a large amount of rice and no refried beans. Freshly made, it had a lot of flavor and good consistency. The rice was cooked properly - I've been to other restaurants where it was dry and crunchy. Not here.

There were a few large screen TV's set up and tuned in to the sports channels.

The waiter was attentive, but not too much so. We were left to enjoy our meals in peace. Separate checks were offered without our having to ask.

As Mexican restaurants go, this was good. I've had better. And I've had a lot worse. Three stars today.
