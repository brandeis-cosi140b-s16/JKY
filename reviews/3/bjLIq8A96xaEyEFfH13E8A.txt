I only come here because it's the closest mexican stop from my house and the food is so-so good. It satisfies my carne asada cravings. :-) but the cashier girl must hate her job -- or life. She never smiles and if she does, its a smirk or some giggles, sometimes some eye rolling, even though I was just telling her my order.... I was waiting for her to tell me my total (which created an awk moment) until I asked her, so she pointed at screen instead of just telling me.... LOL customer service sucks here. I hope she gets some more training how to treat customers.
