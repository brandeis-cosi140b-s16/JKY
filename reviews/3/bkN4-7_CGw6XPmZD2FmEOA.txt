Several of our friends just LOVE this place. But our experience has been just so-so. In fact, similar to Mike W.s. 

We brought our kids -- who are very well-behaved and restaurant savvy I must add -- and the service was cool-to-just plain rude. You would think they would realize a big tip was possible what with us ordering almost $100 in food! 

But noooo... 

Anyway, the food was good, but since I can get pretty defensive when it comes to my kids, I probably won't go here again.
