A good Mexican joint, but certainly not exceptional.  Being a restaurant consultant I always ask the server what I should eat and mine suggested the burrito (really?!).  So I did and it was good but not distinguishing flavors.  Needs flavor spikes and more texture.  Salsa weren't very hot but were tasty.  Others have said they won't be back but I would go  back just to see how they develop.  I will say it was an odd experience turning in at a strip bar to get to a restaurant that has the slogan, "Faith, food and fun" or something like that.
