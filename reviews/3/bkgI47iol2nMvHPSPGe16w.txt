The customer service here isn't the greatest, but my SO and I have recently discovered that their fish tacos are actually pretttty darn good.

Every taco has a nice, meaty cut of fish. No skimpy filet here! We order it Cajun, as I'm sure the regular grilled fish tastes bland or rather ordinary. The Cajun fish tacos are best with citrus slaw and is worth the few extra cents. Although the fish is inconsistent (sometimes perfectly flaky, other times, dry), I really do enjoy the flavors: the fish is spicy and flavorful, the slaw is crunchy and tangy, and the tortilla it is so delicately wrapped in is slightly sweet.

I honestly don't feel comfortable sitting here or staying too long. It doesn't look very neat. The walls are a cool shade of blue and covered in posters and signs. Coming inside, there's a bar to the right, which I assume is for sports fans who like to chomp on burritos while watching a game. 

Overall, I'd endure having to talk to someone with little to no genuine interest in customer satisfaction just to have a few perfect bites of fish-y goodness... To go, of course.
