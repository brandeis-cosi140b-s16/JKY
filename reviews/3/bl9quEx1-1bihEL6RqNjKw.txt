Tex Tubb's is Madison's latest, but let's face it, not greatest taco establishment.  The decor is classic southwest Texas styling, and enjoyable in itself.  They offer the choice of four different salsas in their "salsa bar," but, unlike most similar restaurants, don't provide bottomless free chips to go with.  Overall, the food was quite good, but the price was not.  I paid over 30 dollars for dinner for two including one beer a piece.  Not what one wants at a taco stand.  The wait was also too long, but that could have been the fact that I went within the first two weeks of it opening.
