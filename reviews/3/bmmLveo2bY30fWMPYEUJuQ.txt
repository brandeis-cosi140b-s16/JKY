I came here for the Tour de Cure pep rally dinner (which was great).  The food: mini chimibagas good, taquitos: ok, and yummy salsa, chips, and guac. Not too big a fan of the beans but I never really am. Kinda greasy but a great help to pack on the calories for 100 mile riders. Good places for an outdoor bar hangout and stage area.  Worse case scenario, get trashed on the happy hour cheap drinks and you won't remember the negatives!
