I really liked the fact that the restaurant carries an extended menu, you could definitely find something you would like to eat. They offered complementary chips, salsa and fried beans, which were pretty good.  I ordered the enchiladas and although they were good, they were not very impressive! I was very disappointed with the margarita, I could not taste any alcohol! ::( the service was decent and the atmosphere is very nice.. Overall, not a bad place but nothing out of the ordinary
