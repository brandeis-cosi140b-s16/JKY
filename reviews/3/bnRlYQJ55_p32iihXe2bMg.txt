Barrio Café is one of my favorite restaurants, so I wanted to like this so much more than I did. The space is cute - we sat on the patio. Enjoyed a spicy margarita that was discounted ($5) for Cinco de Mayo. Our server was not great. She was nice but did not seem very familiar with the menu items. We had a group of six and there was a long delay in bringing the entrée that one of my friends ordered. Basically, his food arrived after everyone else's. When we finally asked, she said they ran out of an ingredient and had to make more to finish the dish. I think she should have explained before we had to inquire, or offered to bring him an appetizer or something while he waited or discounted the bill. I had the tacos al pastor. There are about 5-6 different tacos on the menu but they come in orders of three. There is no option to mix-and-match, which is standard at places like Joyride Taco or Taco Guild. The tacos were fine but not amazing (especially compared to the conchita pibil tacos that I love at Barrio Café). They come with a side of spicy coleslaw with big slices of jalapeno in it. My boyfriend ordered a carne torta that did not look great. It came with fries, which I tried - nothing special. Barrio Urbano is ok, not great, not terrible. But definitely no comparison to Barrio Café and does not stand out among the countless other taco shops in town. I might give it a try for breakfast one day, but will not be rushing back for dinner.
