I was torn between 3 stars or 2. What saved them was the service. Hostess seated us right away, our water glasses were ALWAYS full, and our waitress visited us a few times to make sure everything was going ok.
The reason for the low rating was the food. First of all charging over $3 for salsa "tasters" is ridiculous. When I go to a Mexican restaurant I expect to get chips and salsa. Just like I expect to get bread and olive oil at an Italian place. So we ordered the guacamole and some salsa. Portion was good but the taste was average. 
I ordered the swordfish tacos. All in all they were very good. You get 4 tacos in a serving and it came with a piece of fish and slaw. The slaw was a cabbage and jalepineo mix which was VERY good.
My wife ordered the chicken enchilada. So so... Chicken was ok but the smothered it with a creamy sort of dressing that ruined the dish.
Probably won't go back.
