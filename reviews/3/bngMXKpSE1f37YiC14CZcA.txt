This place hit the spot after a nerve-racking Saturday at work. 

I'm pretty sure the beef tacos are deep-fried whole. I don't care. 

$5.30 got me two huge beef tacos and a bean and cheese soft taco. Now I know where to go when I have those late-night grease cravings...and don't pretend like it never happens to you...
