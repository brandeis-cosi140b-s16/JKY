Stopped by for lunch with a friend and we ended staying for happy hour. We both had the taco lunch special, crispy chicken was fantastic. The owner was attentive and seemed genuinely concerned that everything was good. They were out of their own brewed beer the mex1, which was disappointing however plenty more to choose from. We definitely be back again.
