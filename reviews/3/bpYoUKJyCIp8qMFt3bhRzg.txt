The handles have been removed from the doors.  They say its for remodeling, I say... tell the truth Tia Rosa, because it doesn't make sense to close a 3 month old restaurant for remodeling.  I just don't understand why this location needs to be closed for a patio remodel... and I've driven by this location a handful of times since being closed, and have yet to see any work being done on the patio.

Well, back in the days when they were open, I recall the booth seats we sat in being narrower than the pequeno streets of Laredo, but the interior decor was fabulous.

The complimentary salsas (red & green) were mild and very sweet, but you can request a hotter variety.  I didn't care for any of the three.  The basket of chips was pretty meager and seemed store-bought.  Tia Rosa, go visit Serrano's, Si Senor or Chevy's to find out what a good chip and salsa combo looks like.

The lunch special is a great value, and I find their beans to be above average, as they are flavored with a smokey bacon (or some other pork product)

Your bar area seems a bit cramped, and I'd suggest extending the happy hour past 5:00pm, while including some discounted appetizer fare.

So long Tia Rosa, I barely knew ye
