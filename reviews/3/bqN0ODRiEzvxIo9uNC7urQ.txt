As far as I can see, besides Gordos on the other end, this is the only place that does street style tacos on the Las Vegas strip. But lets not get crazy with the accolades now. These tacos don't come anywhere close to Gordos or even the better places in Los Angeles or San Francisco. Perhaps it satisfies while drunk, but it disappoints while sober.
