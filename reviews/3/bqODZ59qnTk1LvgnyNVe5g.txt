Tried this place over the weekend.  The service was Excellent!  The chips and salsa were good. 

I had a red chile burrito enchilada style.  With all of the rave reviews of this place I was expecting a lot more, but it was just OK.  It was the same as all the other red burrito's I've ever eaten.  Beans and rice that came with the combo was about the same as any other place I've been to.

Beer was nice and cold, and the service was great!  I'd eat here again, but next time I'll try one of thier specialties.
