Went on a Monday mid-afternoon and the place was pretty quiet.  Sat at the bar and shared an Agave Margarita and a pot of salsa and chips with my boyfriend.  (Yes, ladies and gentlemen, you read me right - a POT of chips.)

The diabolic about the Diablo must be the size of their menu offerings.  They offer up 42 ounce margaritas in a cup large enough to drown a puppy and make a plate of nachos larger than my ass.  Of course, if I manage to finish the nachos my ass will be in competition with the nachos for girth.  

The price for the 42-ounce margarita is $28 and the nachos are $17, but given that it'll probably be your last meal, the prices can't be beat.  

Of course, Diablo is there for the fun factor - don't expect culinary fare or genius alcoholic concoctions.  The margarita was made with the typical mix, although I enjoyed the chili salted rim (which made the rita less salty).  The salsa for the chips weren't bad, either.  There were three or four screens showing sports.  To the right of us a senior-aged couple, across from us, a couple in their 20s slogging through their nacho madness.  A mixed crowd and interesting place.
