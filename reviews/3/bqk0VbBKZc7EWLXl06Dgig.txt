I eat at Chapala's about 3 times a month. Not because it's my favorite place, but because it's my parents' favorite place. My dad likes it because he gets 2-for-1 coupons in the RJ. My mom likes it because she thinks one of the waiters is cute.

The food is average. I usually get the enchiladas verde which sometimes are great and sometimes just good. The quality does seem to vary from visit to visit.

The albondigas soup is always very good.

Tonight I tried the taquitos for the first time. I got mine filled with chile verde. They were just okay and not overly flavorful. I probably won't order them again. Though I have to admit that may be in part due to the fact that I have a cold which is hindering my sense of taste.

My dad and my wife both like the Chapala's chicken (basically a roasted half of chicken), though my dad says it can be inconsistent.

My mom is partial to the enchiladas rancheros.

While the food can be inconsistent, I have eaten here many, many times and have never had a bad meal. At best you'll have a delicious meal. At worst you'll have an okay meal.
