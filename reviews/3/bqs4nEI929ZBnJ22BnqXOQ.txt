Okay, so this won't win any awards for curb appeal, atmosphere, or even friendly service....BUT the food is some of the best Mexican cuisine I've had in this state.  It has a very authentic southwestern flavor.  Cheese Chicken Enchaladas, two eggs over easy, with a little  of the home made salsa and you'll be set!  So Keep your eyes off the floor, chin up, fork in hand, and indulge....I won't tell anyone I saw you there ;-)
