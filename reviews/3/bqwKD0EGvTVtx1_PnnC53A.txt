The hubs and I went here last night with a couple of friends. I have been here before years ago and remembered that it never really stuck in my mind as a MUST go to place. 

First off, What restaurant in AZ charges for Chips and Salsa!?!?! SERIOUSLY, Who does that! The regular salsa doesn't have much flavor to, the salsa Verde is good, but has a weird lingering after taste. 

Secondly, their newspaper menus are sooo annoying! They are all floppy and when four people are sitting at a table trying to open them and read them it gets a bit crowded and elbows in your face. 

Thirdly, the service was lacking. I had to ask for a straw a couple times, they give you straws for sodas, but not for waters. We saw our waitress maybe twice. We asked for a side of enchilada sauce and they charges a $1 for it. 

Fourth. The food. Its not terrible, but its nothing spectacular. The flour tortillas taste like they are store bought and not fresh. Their jalapeno mashed potatos are pretty dope, I will give them that much. 

Would I ask to go back here? No. Would I put up a fuss if someone else wanted to go here? Nah. I'd go again....Maybe just bring my own chips and salsa!
