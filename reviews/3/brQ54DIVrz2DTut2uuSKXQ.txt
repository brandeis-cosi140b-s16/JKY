I usually go to Monterrey around lunchtime. Sitting outside in the nice cool breeze, drinking a refreshingly large Margarita out of one of their fishbowl-sized glasses, is usually the setting for my visits to this Mexican eatery. Rarely do I go for the festive "Mexi-Charlotte nightlife". I decided to try out their dinner-time demeanor. Granted it was during Cinco de Mayo (which ponders a question....Do yo think Mexico celebrates Fourth of July with fireworks and Jack & Cokes or Vodka & Redbulls?....Anyways...) so I kept that in mind when formulating my review here.
     I believe the food at Monterrey to be some of the best bang for your buck when it comes to Mexican food. I have eaten similar items prepared IN Mexico and it is quite comparable. They started us out with chips and salsa (probably one of my favorites) and drinks (for Cinco de Drinko, I went with a house Margarita out of a red Solo cup). Atmosphere was enjoyable and festive with a live DJ for this auspicious Mexican occasion, everyone seemed to be having a good time. That is, until the food came.
     Luckily for this Ginger getting his Mexican on, his order was accurate. The same can't be said about other folks in the group. Some getting guacamole when they opted out, others glaring at the ones who got it in envy. Then when asked for refills on chips and salsa, our table watched in horror as they picked up a mini-carafe and bowl of chips from a table that had just cleared. We politely, but sternly, declined the gently used basket of chips and salsa. What was going on?
     I generally rate Monterrey 4-5 stars in my books, albeit Cinco de Mayo, some qualities you just don't sacrifice. It seemed the service and quality was sacrificed that night a bit amidst the festivities. I will go back there, but I believe it will be for my Enchiladas and Fishbowl Margaritas from here on out.
