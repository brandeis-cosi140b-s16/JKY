Stopped here because I finally had to try the Doritos Locos Tacos.  It's been hyped up for so long I just haven't got around to trying it, and today was the day.  I ordered two regular, the guy at the drive through was super nice, seemed like the manager or something, dress shirt and tie and all.  I wasn't expecting restaurant quality food, knowing it is a fast food chain, but the Doritos Locos Tacos weren't that good.  I don't know if the shells were stale, but the Doritos flavor just wasn't there.  I guess I expected them to be exactly like Doritos but they're not.  Not as cheesy and they're thinner.  Maybe it was just stale taco shells, but I'll probably give them another try, maybe at a different location.  Or maybe just make a taco salad of my own with Doritos. YUM!
