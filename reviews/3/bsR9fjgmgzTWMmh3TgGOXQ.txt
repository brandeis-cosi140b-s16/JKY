Wow reading all of these reviews after I ate here would have definitely stopped me from eating here. Sorry yelpers I forgot to check it first...glad I didn't because we went here hungry after a long car trip from OC and wanted something budget friendly to try. Saw the ad for the tacos and margaritas special and we were sold...hey why not?? My hubby got a chicken quesadilla, another one in our group got the burrito special and I ordered the habanero wings...very tasty and spicy. We ended up ordering the extra $1 shot for our margaritas because for 2-bucks they were of course very weak so it was worth it....No this isn't that authentic or classy but it was good for a late bite in a hurry!
