I've heard of this place but had never tried it until now. I had a hankering for some Mexican food and a friend recommended this place, so I bit.

There was a 15 minute wait and I haven't an issue with that. It just means it's a popular spot and I'm in for some good Mexican food! We were sat and informed that there was a self service chips and salsa bar. I found this to be pretty awesome. You can grab your own chips and pick what types of salsa you want to try. This made me an instant fan. What didn't make me a fan was that there weren't any napkins at the station nor at our table. Not certain if they are aware of this, but chips and salsa can get a little messy.

I ordered a taco salad minus the meat due to being vegetarian. It actually wasn't that bad but I will admit that I've had better. Nothing really wowed me about it and nothing really said authentic Mexican food to me. I could have gotten a better taco salad at Roberto's or an equivelant at Qdoba. 

Overall, the waitress was very friendly and always checked on us. And the hostess even hunted us down at the nearby bar when it was time for us to be seated, so kudos on the service. As far as the food is concerned? It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either. Nothing really said come back for more.
