From the variants of burritos, we had the bueno breakfast (the kitchen sink) and green burro.  The bueno is everything -- ham, bacon, cheese, etc etc... well wrap it up in a burro, and its exactly what you would expect it to taste like.  Wasn't wow'd but it was huge, and we cooked the leftovers with eggs and grits the next day (yeah Denny's style).  The green burro was better, chunky pork but I prefer Hatch green sauce for its smokiness which this didn't have.

The comp salsa and chips is tasty, and for fellow cilantro haters, the radar didn't go off!  The wait is looooong, so pickup an empanada to snack on while you do... the to-go area was full by the time we left, just waiting and waiting.  Friendly staff!
