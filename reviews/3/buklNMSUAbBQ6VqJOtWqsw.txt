Meh.  It was okay.  As everyone agrees, the view is fantastic.  Do yourself a favor, go to the parking lot, check out the view, then drive to another Mexican restaurant.  We were seated right away.  Awesome.  It was a Monday night, but still wildly crowded with no parking, so I was impressed to be seated right away by a very friendly hostess.  It was crazy loud.  Couldn't hear what anyone was saying right next to you.  I always order water first and this water tasted pretty bad for tap water.  No filter for sure.  The chips were good but the bean dip and salsa were really bland.  Our food was okay, nothing particularly flavorful or special.  All the entrees were around $18+, which to me pretty pricey for Mexican food.  (especially bland, uneventful food).  My margarita was pretty tasty.  Best part of the meal, for sure.  Then the waiter refused to acknowledge our table.  He was busy, so he willfully did not make eye contact with us, despite the fact we were ready for the check for a very long time.  He did check on his other tables, bus tables, seat guests, take orders and bring others their bill.  Except for once right after our meals were served, he never came back to check on us.  So, to sum it up..... View is great, Margaritas are good, Food is meh, Service is lacking.  If this was a Monday night, i don't want to imagine what a Saturday is. I do not understand why the parking lot is always packed.
