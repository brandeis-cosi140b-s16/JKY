Advice: get yourself some tacos and a margarita, and skip the rest :)
From a service perspective, I'd give it a "good not great"; there was a time or two when we wanted drink refills, and our waitress almost appeared to be avoiding our table, but otherwise she was friendly and attentive enough.

From a food perspective, I didn't really LOVE the Baja Shrimp & Crab dip (although my coworkers were into it, so who knows...maybe I'm crazy), and I've had better queso. They were fine, but I had a little of each and was over them. 

If I were only rating the tacos and the margaritas, this place would have 4 stars. I had the special that day: talapia tacos that were covered in this delicious, spicy, buffalo-ish sauce and done to perfection...they were seriously yummy. And the Pomegranate margaritas were super delish...but then again, I think all of the margaritas are probably pretty good, from what my coworkers have told me. Definitely worth a stop!
