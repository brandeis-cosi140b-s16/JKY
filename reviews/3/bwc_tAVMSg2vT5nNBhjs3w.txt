Spanish-Mexican fusion?! Yes.  Don't have to ask me twice as I have a special interest in Spanish cuisine.  With this fusion, you get fast service, but at a cost of quality.

This brick and mortar business should have gone the food truck route as the menu would easily fit the bill.  Instead, they operate inside a small, narrow building similar to one you see at Dutch Bros. Coffee.  

Let's not judge the book by its cover right? The menu is basically either a la carte or you can do a combo or "flight."  The flight gets you 2 tacos of your choice + 1 tapa + 1 chips/salsa + 1 drink = approx $8.

What I enjoyed the best were their carne asada tacos.  The beef was cooked well, decent charred flavors.  As for tapa, I went with the chicken empanada which was mediocre at best.  In fact, everything was quite mediocre or below average, from the chips and salsa to croqueta, which is deep fried potato with ham.  The salsas were a big disappointment.  Lacked authenticity it seemed.  I assumed when your salsa has habanero in it, it be spicy and hot, yet all it did was cool my tongue! #fail 

One area that needs improvement in is in the food.  Service was nothing extraordinary.  Would I make a return, probably not.  It was worth a first try.  I really wanted it to stand out since I'm big into Spanish but it fell 2-stars short.
