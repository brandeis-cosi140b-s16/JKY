Ordered a machaca burrito at $5.19, but these guys have a different definition of machaca or cashier gave my order wrong which is unlikely since my order was the only one being cooked at the time. There was no egg in the machaca and that is what makes machaca machaca. So the burrito (normal size - I heard alot about giant tortillas) ended up to be a fairly good rendition of plain ole shredded beef with tomatoes, onions and some good charred peppers. The red sauce served on the side was not spicy, but you knew it was there if you added enough of it to the burrito. If they would have just put some egg in there could have been 4 stars, but actually the beef was too wet anyway for machacha and clearly resembled just shredded beef.
