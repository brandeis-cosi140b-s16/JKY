This is about the best of Fountain Hills that we have found.  The beer is cold.  The service is decent-although the turnover seems high.  The chips are good, the salsa ok if you mix the mild and hot together.  The outdoor patio is pleasant.  The Pollo Fondido is OUTSTANDING.  I've tried a couple of other things but I always keep coming back to this.  I think they put crack in the cheese sauce.... addictive.
