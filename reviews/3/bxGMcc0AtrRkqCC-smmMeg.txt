I think proximity to my house is definitely going to make Maria's a go to stop in the future.

After spending waaaaaay to much money at Home Depot a few Saturday's back, we needed a filling and cheap lunch. Saw Marias and decided to give it a try.

The chips and salsa were flowing the entire time. Both of us got the $1.99 beer special. They even brought out cold mugs and limes with it, which was a plus.

The lunch menu is super inexpensive. Everything around $5-6. I got the cheese quesadilla, beans, and rice and my husband got this scrambled egg/bell peppers/onion mixture that came with tortillas, beans, and rice. Everything was pretty good. Not blow your pants off good. But, if you are looking for some typical Mexican restaurant food, this place will do the trick! 

Inexpensive, decent tasting, and great location. Winning combo!
