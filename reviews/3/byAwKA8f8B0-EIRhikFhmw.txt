Pretty good Mexican spot.  Not the best by any means, but pretty good.  I know its hard to mess up Mexican food.  
I only come here on Sundays for early dinner.  Its not very busy and you're assured your food speedy- so In and Out.  
I would not wait for long periods of times to eat here.
Again, not bad, just nothing spectacular.  They do have $2 ritas on Sunday's which is a pretty good deal.  Good Chips n' Salsa, great enchiladas, great tacos and good carne asada
