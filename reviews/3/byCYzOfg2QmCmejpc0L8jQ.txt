We stopped in on a weekday for lunch. There was 5 of us and we were seated promptly. I was skeptical at first, mostly because I was not feeling like I wanted Mexican Seafood, but when I had the first sip of my Limonada (freshly prepared and refreshing) and dipped into the homemade chips and salsa, I knew all would be ok. 

It took me quite a while to choose from several options on the menu. Most of my lunch partners went for the baja fish tacos, another for the Camarones al mojo de ajo...or Garlic Shrimp. Two of us decided on the Camarones Rellenos (stuffed shrimp). Now when I think stuffed shrimp I think of my favorite stuffed shrimp at Papadeaux's, with lots of flavor. I was expecting the same here. When it arrived there were 6 large bacon wrapped shrimp on a small bed of french fries, accompanied by refried beans and rice. The rice and beans were very good, the filling in the bacon wrapped shrimp was very basic unseasoned Ricotta/Requeson, not like the jalapeno, garlic, with monterey jack cheese I have had at other places. It was admittedly bland. I added lime but decided against any of the bottled hot sauces on the table. I should have spooned over some of the salsa but hind sight 20/20.   The other diners with me enjoyed the fish tacos but mentioned they had had better, while the other with the Garlic Shrimp raved about that dish.  
In all I would go back here to try any of their other dishes on their menu.
