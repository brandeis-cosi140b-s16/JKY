More of a 3.5 -- which requires a return visit to try some of the other offerings. This place is clean, has a well-organized menu and speedy service. My veggie burrito was less vegetable, and more your typical rice & bean fare. It could have been less messy with the wet ingredients that on top of the rice & beans included guacamole and sour cream. But overall a good experience. Mild salsas, good rice & beans, non-greasy chips and good service in a clean restaurant.
