I've given them a little time to work out some kinks. They now have a new menu and such, so I decided to order some grub to go for lunch. Needless to say, I still had my reservations about this place though. While they didn't quite perform a complete 180, they are teetering around the 80-100 degree range.

Prices are still a little too high for the quality and taste, but they do give decent portions. The rice, beans and salsa all came in separate containers. A good size bag of chips also accompanies the order. Fish tacos are so so. The batter was a little eggy and I'm still feeling a little indifferent about them. 

They seem to attempt modern twists to some classics. Shreds of coconut in their rice which sounds cool in theory, but it just didn't quite do it for me. Good news though is this is a sign of improvement and I just might come back to try other stuff.
