This is a new restaurant, so I am sure that they will only continue to improve in the next weeks and months.  The atmosphere seemed nice, and the waitstaff were friendly, but I feel like the whole place is more pretentious than it needs to be.  They have a huge tequila selection, but very little in the way of other bar selections, and beer prices seem a little high for standard mexican and domestic favorites.  Their house margarita was good - the flavor seemed pretty standard, and it was heavy on the alcohol (just one got me tipsy), but it's hard to beat 1/2-price during happy hour!  
I tried the combination platter, and overall I thought it was average: the tamal was probably the best I've had in Madison, the enchilada was okay, and the chile relleno was sub-par (the breading was too thick, and there was not enough cheese - probably an effort not to make it too greasy, but it wasn't enough).  The beans and rice were nothing special.  So, I found it to be average Mexican food, but at downtown prices.  They do seem to have some entree specialties that would set them apart, which I haven't tried, but as far as the standard Mexican fare, you would be better off going to one of the more authentic joints in town, which have proliferated in recent years.
