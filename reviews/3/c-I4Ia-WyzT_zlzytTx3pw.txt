I was introduced to this place earlier this year, and then I couldn't stop coming back, until last visit. I ordered the same thing, a breakfast burrito. I got about half way into eating it, and I noticed it started to smell funny, just like fish. My breakfast burrito was not fish, but sausage. I said sausage, not sardines!! It grossed me to the point where I was done eating, I couldn't finish the rest. I haven't been back their since, and I don't plan on going back for a while.
