Food is pretty good, but nothing too special.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas with the chefs spicy red sauce.  Portions were good, lots of food I couldn't eat it all.  I also like the tortilla chips and beans and salsa.  Prices are a bit high when compared to quality.  Not that it wasn't good, but for the prices I expect it to be better than just average.
