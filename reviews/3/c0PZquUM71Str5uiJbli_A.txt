I stopped here for a bite to eat before my flight.  I ordered the Beach Nachos with chicken which were good.  I asked the waitress could I make a meal out of them (since they were listed under appetizers) to which she said 'yes'.  After I was done eating, I could have eaten more.  So if you are really hungry, this may not be the best option.

The nachos did not have a great deal of cheese (melted versus shredded), which for me who loves cheese, was not impressive.  So if you are one who does not like a lot of cheese on your nachos, this would be right up your alley.

They definitely had a unique taste to them.  This could have been largely due to the Chimichurri dressing, guacamole and black bean cream sauces.  Definitely different, but good.

There were quite a few TVs over the bar area which you could here, as well as music being played over the entire restaurant.  The music was just the right volume, not too loud but at a volume that was enjoyable.

There were a lot of tables in the restaurant and it was very crowded.  As the title says, not a great deal of space to move around in, but overall not too bad.
