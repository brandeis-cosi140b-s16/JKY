This is a decent standby taco place, offering pretty authentic corn tortilla/filling/onions/cilantro tacos of the sort I subsisted on in my home town of Chicago (a town known for its awesome variety of Mexican fare).

The service at the counter is quick and friendly, they make good rojo and verde salsas, and everything seems fresh.

This is no destination dining experience, but rather is best treated as a taco stand.  Grab your tacos and go!
