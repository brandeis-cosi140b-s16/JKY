Very good chips and salsa delivered to start the meal.  2 salsas, a bean dip, and a jalapeno ranch dip  -  and the chips are above decent.  The second batch of chips and salsa will cost you $2.95, however.

But the menu prices are a little high.  Spent $26 on 1 Appetizer, 1 Entree', and two drinks.  Nothing we had was outstanding, compared to other local places.

I'd go back just to make a meal from 2 batches of the chips and salsa, drink water, and get out of there for under $5.
