I like this place but it is a little over priced. The food is good and pretty authentic and i had good service but it wasn't anything amazing. I got a margarita and it was STRONG, which I liked. Loved the chips and salsa. It is walking distance from my house which is convenient but i don't know if i will be going back anytime soon.
