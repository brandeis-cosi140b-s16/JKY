As usual the food is awesome..  Service was significantly below par..  I said that my meal was for "here" NOT "to go" three times..  The cashier continued to bag it up and when I told him once again that it was for here he just left it in the bag and didn't even bother to take it out of the bag and serve it to me correctly.. Yes I was polite, I save all my bad mouthing for the reviews.. Too bad the staff is not customer friendly, it kinda ruins the experience for me.. Luckily there are plenty more Chipotles to choose from here in the valley.
