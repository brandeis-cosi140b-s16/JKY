My husband and I were out at the Lake Las Vegas Village for a Wine Walk.  We wanted to have something in our stomachs during the tasting.  We walked in and were sat inside immediately.    Here's a grading scale breakdown:
Service: C
I know they were extra busy because of the wine walk.  However, it felt like pulling teeth to get waited on.  It seemed like everyone wanted to eat on the patio.  Since they were so busy, the wait staff was A) clearly under staffed and B) frazzled by the amount of customers.  We got chips, a drink, our order was taken and our food was brought to us.  We didn't see our waitress again until she dropped the check off.  No refills, no extras.
Food:  A
The chips and salsa were very fresh.  We split the chimchanga with shredded beef and it was delicious.  No complaints in the food department.
Ambiance: B-
OMG!  It was soooooo hot in this restaurant!  I know we are approaching the heat of the summer.  However, it was hotter inside than it was outside.  My husband ended up asking an employee if there was a problem with the air conditioning.  They blamed it on the front doors being open.  Not sure what the real issue was but my goodness it was hot!  (Maybe that's why everyone wanted to sit outside!)  Other than the heat issue, the d√©cor is typical Mexican restaurant.
Price:  Average to inexpensive
I love going to Lake Las Vegas...I'm sure we'll try this place again...on a slow night when either the front doors are closed or when we can sit outside.
