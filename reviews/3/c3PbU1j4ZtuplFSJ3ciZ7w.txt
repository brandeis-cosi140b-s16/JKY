Chipotle in the SouthPark mall? Uh...yes, please. 

Very nice to see Chipotle's stainless steel surfaces from across the food court. Definitely the black sheep amongst the menagerie of lunch/dinner choices. It's the only place in the food court with it's own seating INSIDE! Not very common to see this in a food court. 

All of the regulars found here. Chipotle's common fare and pricing. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just straight up amazing flavors. 

The flow of customers is a little odd, so beware. You kind of have to jam into the place to get in line as it starts always on the left and winds out of the door into the walk way. May be a bit of hustle and bustle while waiting for your burrito fix. 

The only grievance I can report is the staff. Not your typical Chipotle staff. Had qualms with requests and didn't really understand the concept of guac going on a burrito bowl....Also, the woman at the register had a little bit of "back talk" with one person in my group. Maybe just an off day for this crew. 

Still speedy and churning out customers left and right. 

Understandably still new and working out the kinks. Not a frequent mall rat, but if I'm ever at the apple store or picking up something from Urban, I'll be grabbing a burrito. 

Thank you, Chipotle. The SouthPark Mall just landed a spot on my mental/culinary map.
