The absolute best thing about this place and a reason I would go back.... 

The Margaritas.

Best margaritas I have ever had.  Lots of flavors (though the original lime is the best) and STRONG.  They really load these drinks with the tequila, and I like it.  I honestly would go here just to grab a margarita. 

As for the rest of the deal, the restaurant is huge inside, clean, and nicely designed/decorated.  The service was good.  The food though was very bland.  I only went once so maybe it was just a bad night, but my parties and my entrees all looked delicious, but tasted very bland.  Even the salsa, chips, and other dips were all really bland.  I never knew that food that looked so good could be so bland.   I probably would not go back again for the food.

Definitely check this place out though for the margaritas, you won't be disappointed.
