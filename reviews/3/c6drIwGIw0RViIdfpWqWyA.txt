I've ate here many, many times and the food is good but it can be on the greasy side. Obviously, it's not greasy enough to keep me from eating it so don't let it deter you. I don't generally stay in the establishment to eat because it's small and I don't like to sit butt to gut with strangers. I've never seen a problem with sanitation here-ever. Espos Mexican food is not the first place I would go to get some cheap Mexican food but it's not at the bottom of the list either.
