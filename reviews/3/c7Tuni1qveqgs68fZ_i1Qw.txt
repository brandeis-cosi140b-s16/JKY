I've been coming to Sylvia's since I was young. I'm kinda losing any hope for them. I go there a couple times a month because I love their beans and tortillas.... Their red sauce is also really good. I like the hot sauce and used to love the salsa fresca but they have changed it. They need to bring back the old Sylvia's.... Where you would order at the register then seat yourself.... They used to have a chip bar back in the day too..... Every time I go there they change something.... I was just there on Easter Sunday and the whole inside of the restaurant is completely different!!! I'm still giving it 3 stars because I do like the food... They just gotta go back to what they used to be.
