Very clean flavors.  The tuna was seared to perfection.  It was subtly seasoned and had really great flavors.  What I didn't like was the slaw.  It was mediocre at best.  The shortribs with chipotle mash was yummy!!!  Thought it was something I can make at home myself, the tuna, on the otherhand, I couldn't.  

This was a great option when you want something casually nice but don't want to walk too far (if you're in the Central Strip).
