I was in Vegas for work and we stopped by this place as it was right near where we needed to be. It was very similar to Chipotle as far as the ordering and the types of food. It was a relatively small place, however the seating was really conveniently situated around the restaurant to make use of the place. I ordered a variety  of thinks in my bowel and it was all pretty good. I think that it is hard to go wrong when the food is decent and you get to choose what you want in it.
