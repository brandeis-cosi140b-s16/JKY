I would probably pass on going here again. I love margaritas and they have a nice selection of tequilas. Problem is, they add some sort of mixer, maybe lemon lime soda to all their margaritas. There were four of us and no one cared for them. They are all pretty top shelf so $12 and up. Guacamole was pretty good. The queso with chorizo wasn't real great. The outside area was wonderful!
