Rubio's is as good as it needs to be. 

Rubio's is a small-ish baja taco place that is marginally nicer than fast food but definitely not a full sized restaurant. That being said, it's quite nice and clean and the decor is very appropriate. Think Baja Fresh, not Chipotle. 

The fish tacos here, which are the main draw, are good but could be better. The overall mix of cabbage, sauce, fried fish, and corn tortilla is good, but I couldn't help but feel like the fish was a bit lacking. The fried crunch the fish had was excellent, but the underlying meat was a bit missing. The tacos also lacked heat, which I think is critical for a good fish taco. 

I would eat here again, but there are definitely better places on the west coast.
