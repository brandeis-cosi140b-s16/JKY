Food good - I had 3 shrimp enchiladas with green sauce, and a Bud Light.  (our waitress had to run off, to see if they had any beer on tap)  

Hubby had #15, with an iced tea.  He had to ask for a refill.

Chips are good, salsas are good -

Now to the service..slow as molasses.  Maybe slower.  I felt like I was in some Twilight Zone episode.  Come on, La Parilla Suiza; you weren't even busy, but service took forever..and we had brought in a Groupon, so add on about 15 more minutes, dealing with that.

This used to be one of our favorite places to go...
