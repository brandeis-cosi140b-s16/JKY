Like other reviews have noted, expect horrible service.
Located off Fremont street by a couple of blocks, in a seedy area. Expect crack heads and crazy homeless folks around here.
I had a Cuban sandwich that contained chicken instead of beef, but was still good. Hot salsa and chips. Sandwich cane with fries, but why have fries when you can have chips and salsa instead?
Overall, decent food in bad surroundings with bad service.
Bonus points for having Michael Jackson videos on to eat to.
