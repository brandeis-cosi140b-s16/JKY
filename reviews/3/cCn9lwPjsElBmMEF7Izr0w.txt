Been waiting for them to open, finally got to go last night.  They have lots of tacos to choose from and the food is tastey but, I HATE when taco shops use french fries for potatoes!  And the size compared to most other taco shops isn't very big at all.  It is like they use the small size tortillas for everything, even though the prices are still on average with the other places.  will still go back to try other things on the menu.
AND lastly, they don't have jalapenos with carrots
