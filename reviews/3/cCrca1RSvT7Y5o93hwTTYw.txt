Located inside the food court of the Palms Hotel & Casino. Chronic Tacos opened their 2nd location in Las Vegas this past Monday. Never having tried Chronic, I decided to give it a go since it's nearby.
The spot looked nice enough. Prices reasonable. I got the burrito with Al Pastor, and made it a meal. The meal included chips, salsa, rice, beans & a drink. Came out to $10 which isn't too bad. They had no trays available since I was dining in, so I had to carry 4 separate things to a table.
The burrito(pun intended) was a fatty! It was almost as wide as it was long. It's what I would imagine I'd look like if I was a burrito. The meal sides of spanish rice & pinto beans were decent tasting. The burrito alone probably would have sufficed. I only finished about half of the meal and had to take the rest home. I asked the lady at the Chronic register if I could get a plastic bag to carry my stuff home and she said they had none. Odd.
Except for no trays or plastic takeout bags it was good. I will have to go back and give a few of the other options a try. They had a good selection of meats/seafood to choose from. Steak, chicken, fish, shrimp and even veggie, to name a few.
