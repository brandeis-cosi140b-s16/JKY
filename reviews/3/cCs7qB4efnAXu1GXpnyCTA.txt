Food wasn't bad. Definitely better than half baked burrito I got from somehow the only stoner white kid in the entire Roberto's staff the other day. Place was awful. 

When you're at the counter ask the cashier what her name is. If it's Isabelle, she's the only staff member I have ever seen handle food without washing her hands ever. 

All an all an average experience.
