We were absolutely STARVING when we arrived. Thankfully, we got some chips and salsa on the table pretty quickly, along with our drinks. Unfortunately, the service slowed down from there. It took quite a while for us to get our food. When we did get it, I got the impression my tacos had been sitting out for a while. They weren't very hot and were actually soggy. They began falling apart from the minute I picked them up. Since we had an event to go to that night, I honestly did not feel like asking for new ones or complaining about it to anyone. However, it was really unacceptable to be served a taco that I couldn't even pick up!
