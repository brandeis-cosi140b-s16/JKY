La Perla has fairly decent salsa and they got my order of a veggie taco with rice, beans, lettuce and tomato right on the first try. The waitress was kind enough to bring me a carafe of verde salsa upon request. I have only been to this restaurant on one occasion as I find there is better Mexican in the area.
