Came back again and opinion doesn't change. I'd been craving nachos for awhile, so this really hit the spot. My boyfriend and I split the Supreme Tostada Nachos. It was everything we wanted - meat, beans, guacamole, cheese, etc. While it was delicious, I really wouldn't come often to spend $17 on a plate of nachos. It's really not hard to make delicious loaded nachos at home. Even tortilla chips aren't too difficult to make. So while the food hit the spot and killed our craving, it's still not a place I'd go to often. Which explains why I've only been here twice in over 2 years.
