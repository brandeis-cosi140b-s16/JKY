Pretty standard Mexican fare to be found here. Had read about some great Chile Relleno's here, but they were not as good as the hype. The place is pretty ancient and they have a back patio that more closely resembles a small prison yard where the birds will steal your free chips if you venture back inside. That area could be nicer with some sort of makeover, but when is the last time a Mexican joint ever underwent a makeover? The food looked nice on the plate, but I don't need a small pile of lettuce/salad in this ethnic cuisine. The side cup of guac was good and both hot sauces had some kick, but the Relleno was marred by a mushy crust and the use of yellow, not white cheese, in the middle. The rice and beans were probably above normal quality, but the Relleno was just run of the mill for 7 bucks. Still a good crowd at 1:30pm, but most bakery items were sold out by then.
