I decided to try one of the dishes from the picture menu - which btw range $15 to $40!! I have to ask next time if the $30+ dishes are meant to be shared family style.

I ordered a "fiesta de Asumpcion" (I think?), a large plate of shrimp ceviche for $16. When the plate first arrived it looked ... flat. Where's the shrimp? The shrimp was flat and mushy kind of like white anchovies but it tasted terrific. It didn't look like much but there actually was a lot of shrimp, onions, avocado and it was plenty enough for dinner. A little too picante in spots and I eat very picante so consider yourself warned. 

In the future I'd love to share this dish as an appetizer but I'm not so keen in making a dinner out of it. There's definite potential to this restaurant. Service was a bit hectic and rushed , the place was not THAT busy but it's a fairly new restaurant.

The Margarita special ($7,50) is large but a too sweet and syrupy for my taste, I like Pure Taqueria's Margarita better and it's right around the corner. 

So far I'd rate this restaurant 3 1/2 stars but I'm deducting a 1/2 star for the ambitious prices on the more interesting  (picture) menu. I mean $16 for pork chops, refried beans and rice? There's plenty of potential to this place and most of all there are not too many really good venues in Matthews, so they have a bit of a captive audience.
