Chini bandido.....good food in a hidden place in one of the strip malls
...jade chicken was good and the bkack beans were very good...almost cuban style. The carnitas burrito....well it is sorry behind excuse for a burrito and it wasn't that good. Comes in aluminum bowl and plastic utensils.....i guess to save on washing dishes. The place has sort of escuela cafeteria experience to it. However, the staff is friendly and they even give you samples.  I expect more out of this place....they should do dim sum Mexican or something...now that would be interesting.
