There wasn't a long line maybe four people but somehow it took ten mins just to order and another 10 to get it. I wasn't in a rush but if I was on my normal lunch break I'd be upset with how long the wait was. 
Food was decent...I ordered 2 Najaf style tacos one shrimp one beef and a drink. Cost me 10$ and Ii could of eaten more but I'm glad I kept it a light lunch. Might be back, might not. Just meh
