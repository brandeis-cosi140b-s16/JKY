It's not bad. It is also hit and miss. Tonight,  the food was not very warm and the chicken was dry. Last time I was there it was better.  For what it cost, it was filling and not horrible. That said, pancheros on the west side is better. They make fresh tortillas. The tortilla I had tonight was warned up, but still a little stiff.  I think they could do better. Even just rotating the good they have on hand would help. If it's a slow nigh, having a whole line up of ingredients sitting sort of sucks.  Better than subway next door.
