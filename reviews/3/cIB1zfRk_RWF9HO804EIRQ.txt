I dislike reviews that mention partial stars...until I have to write one that hits a gray area, so there I am with Cien Agaves. Guilty with indecision and admission that I have to clarify my selection with a more accurate rating of 2.5 stars. Really, I have had better. And it's also ok. For the price and location in Old Town, it's not too bad.

The food is just ok (that is...rounding up to "just ok"). The chips and salsa are pretty good with the cumin-strong tomatillo standing out over the red. The guac is also nice and a bit too addicting. The tacos are nothing to rave about, and actually I'm not likely to order them ever again, but I've enjoyed a salad or two with grilled fish. While most people rave about the happy hour, the food options are meat-centric so not much to choose from on those deals for a veg/fish eater. But at least the margaritas are cheap.

The atmosphere on a weekend night is pretty energetic and the margaritas have a nice, fresh (aka no mix) quality. Not much by way of beer selection though. For diners that aren't super picky about Mexican food and don't mind the grease, this is a solid option. If you're more akin to the taste of say Gallo Blanco, meet your unpicky friends here and stick with the booze with some chips and salsa to tide you over.
