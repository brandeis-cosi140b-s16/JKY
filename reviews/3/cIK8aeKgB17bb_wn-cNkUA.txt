Went back the next day with some work-friends and we all had machaca, 2 of us had chimis with rice/beans, and 1 had a burro.  Good chimi, lots of fresh guac on top.  The machaca was pretty good, maybe just a little on the salty side.  One of my friends suggested that it seemed it was cooked in chicken broth, but wasn't sure.  We all agreed that we'd put La Canasta into our regular rotation for lunch.  Service was excellent.  And again, the place looks sort of plain and freaky from the outside, but inside it's super clean.
