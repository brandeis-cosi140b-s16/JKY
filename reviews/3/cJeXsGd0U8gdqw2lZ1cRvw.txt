Let me preface by saying that, though I'm generally not picky when it comes to food, I'm very selective when it comes to Mexican food as it is my least favorite.  I don't typically enjoy Mexican food for whatever reason, but Tres Pecos made me forget about that when my coworkers took me there for lunch last week.

We were immediately served hot tortilla chips with an excellent fresh salsa.  I could eat that salsa every day.

I ordered their soft taco lunch special - specifically one beef taco and one chicken taco.  Both were great and were served with rice and refried beans.  I thought the whole meal was great.  I do plan to return soon.
