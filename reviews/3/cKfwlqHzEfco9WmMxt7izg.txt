Pros: Casual, fun ambiance. Good location at Cosmopolitan. Awesome decor--lucha libre meets Las Vegas--red lamps on the ceiling, video screens with pictures flashing of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and Chinese leader Mao, etc.

Cons: The menu was extensive but underwhelming. A bit over-priced for such a casual setting that basically served fried rice and tacos. It's tapas style, so expect to order several dishes for sharing. I don't think it was a fusion, but rather a menu with average Chinese and Mexican dishes.
