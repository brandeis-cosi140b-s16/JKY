So I'm giving three stars. I will say that the restaurant looks clean and the decor is nice. But the place was pretty dead the whole time we were there (8pm til probably 9:20ish)

As me and my group walked inside there was a group of servers hanging out by the bar and we were told to pick a table, which was fine with me. Our server was attentive and helpful with the menu items and beer options. 

The food was okay, not amazing. The portion for the fried Mac and cheese appetizer was reallllly small. 

There was a male worker (or maybe a friend of the employees) with a pony tail who was drinking by the bar and looked pretty drunk by the time we left. And there seemed to be some drama between the servers while we were there.. A couple of them were hanging out by the bar a lot and gossiping in front of us.

As we left, our server and another server were right outside the front doors smoking cigarets, which was kinda tacky. 

Not sure if I will return or not.. Was not impressed, and I am kind of disappointed.
