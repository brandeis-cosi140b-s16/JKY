Our Midwest quest for queso led us here while staying in Madison. The queso was okay, but it isn't really fair to compare to our Texas memories either. Not bad for Tex-Mex at all. The salsa was good and getting a variety is helpful since my wife sweats on sight of it even looks hot. Tabitha rocked keeping the drinks full and checking on us. The hostess made me feel a little like a 5th grader the teacher I was the student she was either angry with or disappointed in. I wasn't even the one who told her we needed the seating for three. everyone has bad days I guess. We will come again.
