I've never reviewed this place despite eating here several times. Prior to today, I could only descibe Viva Zapatas as a 5/5. Today, I'd be hard pressed to to give it a one. The three stars is only for the glorious days of old.

Service was extremely slow whereas normally its lighting fast. It was pretty clear the waiter forgot to put in our order. The chips were burned and we received few drink refills. They were busy (as they always are), but I'm used to tthe service being attentive and speedy. Not today. We were considering leaving when...

FINALLY! Here comes the food! The beans were inedibley salty, and no ones food - even those we have enjoyed many times before - was any good. Cold, bland, oversalted...

The worst of all was the Tacos de camarones (shrimp tacos). I'd never tried them and I was excited to give them a shot. 

Supposedly these are "moms recipe", but I really doubt she chopped shrimp into tiny peices and deep fried until it was no longer recognizable as shrimp (it could have been chicken, hell I dont know). What only can be described as fried matter was overflowing from my tortillas and my only hope was a large cup of sauce they brought with the meal. Nope... a room temp thick, heavily mayo based sauce flavored with chipotle seasoning. C'mon guys. 

My wife had the carne asada con rajas y crema which is usually out of this world. Today it suffed the same bland, oversalted fate. A light but robust sauce was replaced with an overly rich and salty goo that covered what would otherwise be decent carne asada. 

Our two other guests (also long time diners here) were similarly disappointed.

Every place has a bad day now and again, but I really hope its not a sign of things to come.
