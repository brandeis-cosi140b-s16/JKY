This Taco Bell is decent. It is always busy when I go through the drive thru. You normally have to wait in a line that has you in the middle of the parking lot of Costco where cars going straight have to drive around you. That is somewhat annoying. They are pretty slow and always push you to get more when ordering even after saying no. Lucky for them the food is amazing, well at least tastes amazing.
