Walked in for breakfast.  Wasn't greeted; counter service person was on phone (didn't appear to be a business related conversation).  Burrito overpriced.  Originally asked for the "Breakfast" burrito.  The person behind the counter asked if we wanted it regular or grande, so we said, "Grande!"  Only to find out that she was talking about a completely different burrito, called the "Grande Breakfast."  When trying to substitute sour cream for sausage, we were told that it'd be extra.  How is it at different restaurants when substituting one ingredient for another, there's no extra charge?  Not impressed with staff or place.  The booths are dirty and it's only 10:00am, plus the music is less than audible (I think there's music playing...)..  Head elsewhere if looking for better priced breakfast and a nicer atmosphere.
