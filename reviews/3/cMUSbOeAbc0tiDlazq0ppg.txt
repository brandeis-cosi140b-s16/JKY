I love this place. It has good feel good reggae music, great food and great customer service ...usually.

This particular visit though wasn't that great. I came here with my girlfriend to get something to eat an hour or so before they closed. We stood at the counter for about 5 minutes before someone saw us. There was, on the other hand, what looked  like an 11 year old boy just hanging out behind the counter just walking around...he glanced at us and didn't say a word...it was kinda weird... Anyways, so there we were just waiting. Honestly, I didn't really mind waiting but it just sucks that no one greeted us all that  time. They gave us slightly old food from the looks of it and then when we got it we found a hair in my tacos. I brushed it off and ate 2 of my tacos. (mind you, I grabbed the tray from the cashier and I'm bald, so clearly it wasn't my girlfriends' or mine.) 

But this is why I'm writing this review:

I saw the young boy behind the counter again and reach down into the front area (where they prepare the food for you) and grab food with his bare hands a multiple times. No one saw him until the cashier/food handler come up and I thought she would say something. But she didn't and proceeded to let the boy eat. 

I just don't want to feel disgusted at a place I usually enjoy.
