This place gets 3 stars because there were some 5-star aspects and some 1-star aspects. 

1-star: 
*Too pricey
*No chips/bread/pre-meal nosh
*Our appetizers were plain and boring. We got the Enfrijadas (one little corn tortilla stuffed with plain shredded chicken and smothered in black bean sauce) and the quesadilla-like thing that I can't remember the name of that was basically a store-bought flour tortilla stuffed with the aforementioned shredded chicken. No apparent seasoning. Weird.
*The rice that comes with the entrees is strangely reminiscent of the rice with uniformly chopped and bland frozen vegetables you would expect to find in a Hungry Man TV Dinner. 
*Limited menu

5-star
*Very nice service
*very yummy fresh watermelon drink that was refilled automatically
*EXCELLENT entrees. I had a combination of the chicken mole and braised pork in orange sauce, both of which were fabulous (except for the TV Dinner rice...). There was plenty on my plate, no skimping on the food. My husband had the strip steak, which, much to his veggie-hating dismay, comes smothered in a lovely roasted tomato salsa to which I gladly helped myself. He also had the weird frozen-veggie-rice on his plate. He did say, though, that the steak was very good, once he unearthed it from the tomatoes.
*Really tasty smoky chipotle salsa. Which would have tasted quite good on the nonexistent chips.

In all, a very pleasant dining experience, but I don't know if the 5-star details quite outshone the 1-star stuff enough for me to return.
