No spice/heat to the salsa, including the "hot" one that the server said was an Habanero salsa.  This was an enormous disappointment because though I can understand making the standard salsa incredibly mild because of the general public, if they're going to make a designated hot one then it ought to have a decent level of heat.  Both were rather bland.  Also was disappointed that the flour tortillas are made with lard.  

On the whole, I tend to like Mexican-themed restaurants like this one because they can be more modern and creative with Mexican style food, but usually that also goes along with more vegetarian options and decent spice levels for those who like the heat.  I'm already accustomed to having to deal with pork in the beans or chicken stock in the rice, but the lard in tortillas just isn't as common in the more modern focused Mexican places.  I felt like it was a bad mixture of authentic Mexican items with more modern traits.  Margaritas were pricey but in line with higher rent areas in Scottsdale.  Tequila list was surprisingly small for a place with this sort of name.  Service was very polite and prompt.
