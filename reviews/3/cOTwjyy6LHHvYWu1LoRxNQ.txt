I loove Chipotle and this location is definitely convenient for music students as it is right across the street from the school of music at ASU. There is lots of seating and a nice shaded outside seating area. I personally always get my food to go, because it can be a bit loud in there. 

Now for the cons of this particular location: The parking lot is kind of small you might have to wait for a spot or park somewhere else and walk a bit. It does get SUPER crowded during lunch and dinner. I'm talking lines almost out the door. So expect to have to wait a little bit. Like most Chipotle locations they sometimes run out of the ingredients you want when it gets crowded, so you might have to wait a bit longer. 

It's a convenient location, but is also a very busy one so if I'm not at school I'd go to the one in the Tempe Marketplace that's a little bigger.
