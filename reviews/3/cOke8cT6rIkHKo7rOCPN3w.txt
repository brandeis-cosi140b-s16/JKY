I have been here for lunch and dinner. Nothing fantastic, but i always left full and satisfied. I enjoy the chips and salsa and the mexican food is ok. I've had better and worse. I haven't tried the greek food there (yeah wierd..greek and mexican on the same menu) but my buddy tried the gyro and enjoyed it. The service has always been good and the food is relatively inexpensive. Its also walking distance to any event in downtown Phoenix and they have a full bar so if you want drinks before a concert of game they got you covered.
