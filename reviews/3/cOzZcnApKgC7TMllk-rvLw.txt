This place really is A-OK.  Loved the fact that they had a green chili burrito.  My own little slice of New Mexico.

This location oddly doesn't sell fountain drinks and has over-priced bottled drinks.  The people working here were nice, so it's worth a stop -- definitely the best cheap option in this terminal.
