Review for Cinco De Mayo festivities at 1900. 

There were a gaggle of people when I rolled up. Got lucky..and found parking right away. Big ol' tent on the lawn with satellite bar. Beer pong table busy. Two cornhole games set up. Sizeable stage with band in the back. Throngs of people with beers in hand just chilling. Inside, tons of people hanging around the bar, tables filled. Took a while for the bartender to get to us, but she was quick getting my gigantic can of Tecate. 

Festivity-wise, could've been more festive. Band kind of sucked. Still, it was fun to just hang out with peeps on a lawn with large beer in hand. 

Perhaps I will visit this place for a normal meal one of these days.
