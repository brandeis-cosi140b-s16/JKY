We ate here on a Friday night during happy hour.  The happy hour taco basket was ok, but greasy.  The Mexican pizza was better.  We also had two orders of Pollo Fundito and those were horrible.  Very little meat, cheese or cream cheese sauce (see attached picture) Our service was great though and margaritas were decent.  The mini bean burritos were surprisingly the best that night...Brian, our server, was very attentive and helpful- apologizing for the poor quality of food and told us it was normally much better.  Without the good service, I would've given this place only one star- which is disappointing since I have gone here with my family since I was a child and the food quality has gone down hill since then.
