First time sitting down and having lunch there. I have been before for cocktails and apps at the bar. I couldn't believe they do not serve chips and salsa when you sit down, you have to pay for it. I know its "Myers Park" but for the price of the food that they charge they need to give you chips and salsa. I asked for salsa when they served my lunch and I was charged $1.50 for a very small bowl. I dont like to be nickled and dimed and thats what it felt like.

I ordered the chicken quesadilla which was $12.00 and no sides. Expensive for a quesadilla but i will say it was very good. I'm not sure if I will go back. There are several other mexican restaurants that are just as good more food and less expensive.
