I went here last year when I was in AZ, I thought it was God's gift to Mexican food... I was a bit tipsy last year when I went there... I went again last week, it was "ehhhh". Don't get me wrong, still good, but not as wonderful as I remembered... not even close. 

We had to wait an hour for a table, the waiter made us wait about 15 minutes (not kidding) for water and chips/salsa... Seriously, 15 minutes? You dumbass! 

The desserts were super good though, that was the upside...
