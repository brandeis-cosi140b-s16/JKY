We went here one day, just the husband and I. It was okay. Maybe I didn't order the best thing on the menu, but the fish tacos were not impressive. We did get a free cup of soup which was pretty cool. I ate mine with the chips. It's close to my house, so it's easy. We might go here again, but I'm not sure.
