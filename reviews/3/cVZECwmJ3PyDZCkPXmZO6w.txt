I have never been to El Pollo Loco before so I had no idea what to expect. Was it going to be like Taco Bell or Del Taco? Turns out,  it's completely different than the aforementioned fast food joints. When I walked in there was a huge grill behind the counter loaded with, suprise, pollo. It was unexpected because the chicken looked fresh and of supermarket quality. Plus there was just a shit ton of it. I also liked the fact that there was an actual salsa bar. 

I had a coupon for a stuffed quesadilla combo that came with a drink and chips for $5. I ordered the quesadilla enchilada style - it was pretty substantial and tasted better than I expected. The wait time was longer than I would have liked. It took about 10 minutes. And they gave me a buzzer for my order. WTF? A buzzer for a fast food joint? Anyways, since it took a little long for me to get my food,  they gave me a free brownie!

Customer service was great. I think I was greeted 3 seperate times. This is a brand new location, and you can tell the employees are still getting the hang of things. All in all, El Pollo Loco is a bit pricier than say Del Taco, but the food is higher quality.
