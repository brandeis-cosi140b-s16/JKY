Very average, very fast, always consistent, BUT they offer a rewards card that tallies up points decently fast, so that's a +1.  I'm always impressed at how consistent the food is and how fast the line moves.  2 locations right across the street from each other, and both are packed and both are good.

You can't go wrong with either, but don't expect it to blow your face off.
