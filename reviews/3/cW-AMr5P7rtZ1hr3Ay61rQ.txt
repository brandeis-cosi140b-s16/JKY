I go here often for lunch so I figured I would write a little something about it... Love the hot sauce and the food is pretty good! I've been here at night time also to play a little trivia. 

All in all, it's not the most fancy place to go but its a good spot if you want to have some lunch, do a little off track betting or just go for some drinks and food after work. Definitely filled with locals but all are friendly. Quite a few TVs if you want to see a game.
