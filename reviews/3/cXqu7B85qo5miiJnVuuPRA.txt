Nothing special about this place. The food is decent and the atmosphere a crappy to-go spot. If you're dying of hunger and not willing to brave the lines at the neighboring In-N-Out burger, this is a fair option. I don't get the sense they're ever really busy. It's not like the taco place on Sahara a few minutes away....
