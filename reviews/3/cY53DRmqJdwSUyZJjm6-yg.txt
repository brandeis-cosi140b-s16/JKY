Okay, so walk in and like the vibe immediately. Chill laid back restaurant with a nice smaller bar inside. The staff is really friendly and slightly younger than most. They have a nice selection on beer for a "Mexican" restaurant they don't have that many tequila choices. The good was slightly above average. I got the side of chips and salsa. And for the entree I got the Cubano Torta, it was just okay could have been WAY better but they are only like 3 weeks old.
