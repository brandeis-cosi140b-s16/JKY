We picked this place for my friends Birthday.  The decor is nice, very low tables inside and high tables in the Patio. We had around 10 people in our party and were sited in the middle of the restaurant in a kind of 'living room' setting. Very comfortable. The waiter was nice and attentive. 

They offered chips and salsa right away and refilled it when it was gone. Generous portion with 3 types of salsa. But be careful, they will charge every time. ($6 each)

We also ordered
-House Margaritas (Some strong, some watered down... Overall Good taste)
-Hibiscus Margaritas (Make sure you stir the syrup on the bottom) Good
-Pineapple upside down shots YUMMY!!! Excellent!
-Buttery nipple shots (Mehh Ive had better, tasted like straight Kalua)
-House pineapple infused tequila shots (Very Good)

We also got the Assortment Small Bites. $16 NOT WORTH IT!
The chicken, steak and shrimp skewers are tasty, but VERY small (2 of each).  I have never seen quesadillas SO SMALL in my LIFE!  I think they use the tortillas meant for tacos al Carbon LMAO (google it), cut it in 4 pieces.  The onion rings are not good. The batter is cheap and really greasy, and it just does not go with the Mexican food. 

I would come back during happy hour.  It is a nice place to hang out and have a drink, but the food is overpriced and portions are minimal.
