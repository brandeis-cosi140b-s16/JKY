Ok, Mad Mex, you're off the hook from me. I came here for a Saturday afternoon brunch and was quite pleased.

Service was friendly, attentive and fast. Food was good. Prices, same as they ever were.

I had the chicken mole burrito. Not bad, flavor wasn't as strong as I imagine a mole should be but it was still a decent meal. I didn't order the Gobblerito but methinks I'll be coming back to try that one soon!
