I don't know what happened to this place, but it is not what it used to be.  I ordered the carne asada burrito and it literally had just meat and some flavorless guac.  I've been here a few times and each time it has gotten worse.  For the price the burrito was kind of small, although they do give you some chips and a small cup (emphasis on small) of salsa.  

I really wish the food was better.  Perhaps i'll try it again once they are finished with the renovation.
