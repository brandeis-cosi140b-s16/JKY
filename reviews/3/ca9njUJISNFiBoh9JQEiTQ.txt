First time at this Filiberto's and ordered to go. 

Got an Adobado plate, rolled taco plate and five rolled tacos for $21. Not bad. It was pretty full but the line moved fast. The order arrived in 11 minutes. 

The rolled tacos were received well. Lots of yummy sounds coming from those guys. I had the Adobado and it was pretty dry. The tortilla was very dry, so I'm guessing the to go order got the second rate stuff. Too bad because Adobado can be so good. 

These guys need to work on timing.
