At the office, we like to show up every Tuesday to celebrate Taco Tuesday. Lately, it's turned into Burrito Tuesday. If things get busy and we're feeling especially wild, it becomes Burrito Wednesday.

Bea's opens in the mornings when the meat is ready. Sometimes, you'll see the nice folks at the counter hanging out through the window, but the door will be locked. A knock and a wave on our end is then met with a few gestures and words on their end, usually "five minutes!" or sometimes, "whoops, come on in!"

The premise is simple: choose from a long list of meats (chorizo, beef tongue, chicken, etc.), a short list of preparations (taco, burrito, quesadilla, etc.), grab a drink (soft drink or imported bottles), eat some food.

It's cheap, it tastes good, and it keeps me coming back. Sometimes, I even go to Bea's outside office-hours, on Late-Night Alcohol Fridays.
