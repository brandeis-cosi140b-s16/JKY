It's just Taco Bell nothing to get happy about...it's cheap an fast...the only thing I hope for every time I come is that they get my order right. 

It really truly is a hot or miss at this location...I guess it depends on who works late here. For example: Sometimes I'll get the person who doesn't sound like they want to work there but they always get my order right...and other days I'll get the person with an amazing personality but can never seem to get a #6 right to save their life. So yes hit or miss

Don't get me wrong it's not like I'm gonna quit going there...whenever I'm in the mood for something quick fast and in a hurry Taco Bell is always my go to spot...but it's only because I love the Fire taco sauce...

The sauce packages really make me happy
