Was looking for a place similar to pepes tacos, they are more like a robertos and I know pepes is that way too but they have mini tacos with onions and cilantro and that's what I was looking for. Well let me say I did not really find that here I did notice a sign after ordering and sitting that they have mini tacos but that was after. My boyfriend got rolled tacos with shredded beef and cheese and he said they were good but not great it seemed like a lot of tortilla and not a lot of meat in them. I got the carne asada plate that comes with rice, beans, lettuce, pico, and guac. Not to impressed that carne asada seems like it is just seasoned with pepper not a marinade and it was a little dry. The rice didn't have much flavor and the beans were good also the guacamole was good. Once I put it all in the tortilla I had to add the red sauce to give it some flavor and also wetness so it wasn't to dry. The guy at the front was awesome he gave us time to look at the menu and answered all my questions very helpful and pleasant. I wouldn't go out of my way to drive down here just to eat here if I happen to be in the neighborhood and about to pass out from lack of food then I would stop here. Really nice staff, for what the man and I got just not that great of food.
