This location usually has horrible service and it did not start out well this visit as it took us a minute to get sat because the host was chatting with a customer while sitting at the bar. However, once we were sat our server Rosalie was quite pleasant and provided good service. Our food was about average, but worth going back for. Overall, decent experience.
