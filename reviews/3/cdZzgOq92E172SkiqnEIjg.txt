Just tried this place today...the carne asada taco was super tasty. I was able to add beans and rice to it with no extra charge (only guac is extra). The meat was seasoned well, and not really fatty (I hate fatty meat). My fried shrimp taco was not as good - the shrimp batter was not cooked completely, so it was soggy. I like things cooked well done, so next time I will try the grilled shrimp.  The fried shrimp  burrito we got was very hearty and good!  I like how you can add cabbage to your items.  The tacos were about $4 each, and the burrito was over $7.  I didn't like the service that much. The lady adding ingredients on my items asked me what I wanted on them, the started having a conversation with the cashier. Most of the employees seemed like they didn't want to he there, and needed a 101 customer service class.
