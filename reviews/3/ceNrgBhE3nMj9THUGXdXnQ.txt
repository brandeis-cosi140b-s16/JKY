Los Arcos is a solid Mexican restaurant. It is located behind Taco Bell (kind of ironic). The restaurant inside is pretty big. I'm not sure if they built this building specifically for Los Arcos or if it was an existing structure, but if it was already there, they did  a great job renovating. They have a chevron pattern floor - anyone else obsessed with the current chevron craze??? 


We got the cheese dip to start, which was big for $4.50! I got a combination plate of 2 tacos and rice and beans. Everything has that signature Mexican restaurant flavor. My roommate ended up getting deep fried butterfly shrimp (weird for a Mexican restaurant but that's what she wanted when she saw it on the menu). I think they were frozen out of a box. She enjoyed them though. Overall the food was what we were expecting. Nothing bad but nothing special. It is a great place to hit up when that Mexican craving hits. 

While there, I saw that they have a buffet Monday through Saturday for lunch. I will definitely be going back to check it out! I also will have to check out their margaritas and update my review!
