Living in South Carolina means Mexican food does not come by very often. I think the last time I had food like this was in February, so I've been pretty hard pressed for non-Moe's food.

With that in mind, Zapata's has plenty of non-burrito options, but for the fare of enchiladas, tacos, and a pretty extensive specialities menu, I thought it was kind of expensive. I got the enchiladas de mole, and even though the rice and beans were pretty standard, it was just what I wanted for my fix. I liked the mole sauce and the salsas for the table, but I noticed that our food looked like it had been waiting for a little bit when it came out. One of my friends ordered the Street Tacos, and she contests that they are among the best she's ever had. 

I think the aura of the place and the service is what makes Zapata's stand out from the neighborhood Mexican fixture of long combination menus. The place is huge on the inside, and the high ceilings had good decorations and a lot of conversation buzzing around. My favorite item was a line of rusty horse sculptures bursting out of the wall.

It's definitely worth checking out for a birthday as well: lots of surprises and fun that only an energetic and attentive wait-staff can bring.
