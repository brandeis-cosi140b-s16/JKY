I love Mexican so I thought I'd give this one a try.  I had four different soft tacos and rice/beans.  I had a ground beef taco, garlic shrimp, shredded pork, and carne asada.  The shredded pork was by far my favorite and that Is not my favorite style, but it was very tasty.  I enjoyed the garlic shrimp with the exception of the creamy sauce that was poured on top.  Without the sauce it may have had a lot of potential.  The ground beef and carne asada were OK.  The same goes for the rice and beans.  Chips and salsa were slightly above average.  The young lady behind the counter was very courteous.  This is not a must go to place, but not bad if you are in the neighborhood.
