Chipotle is great and we visit this location about twice each week as this is about . The quality of the food is always consistent and what you normally expect from Chipotle. The service is what you normally get, except it seems that we often get what we consider to be smaller than normal portions of meat in our meals, compared to what we get at other Chipotle locations. If it were not for them being stingy with the meat servings, we would give 4 stars. If they added some more friendly staff, they could even get 5 stars. I know that working fast food is a grind, and that finding good workers in that industry is difficult. However, serving coffee is also a grind, yet the lady at Starbucks always brightens my day with here outstanding attitude. All of this being said, we prefer the Chipotle on the corner of Fort Apache and Sahara.
