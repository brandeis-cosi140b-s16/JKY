They have so far always gotten the order right and friendly workers, but it's the only taco bell I have found that it doesn't occur to them to give a fork for nachos bell grande.  They also pnly gave us 1 napkin in the drive-thru. You would think that 2 drinks would maybe clue them in that 2 ppl are eating.
