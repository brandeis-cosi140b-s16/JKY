I finally wound up at Two Hippies for tacos the other day after living within a stone's  throw for a few months. Whenever I go to a place for tacos, I'm expecting one of two things... either mass quantities of grub on the cheap or in-your-face quality and flavor. Two Hippies Beach House takes care of the former. The service was friendly, and the chow is okay, not bad, but not outstanding in the slightest. It's truly perfect as a quick and filling meal that you can mow down with a few friends before going out to the bar or for when you are getting back from the bar. And that, to me, has it's own special place in the restaurant food chain. For $5 flat I can walk away with three giant tacos loaded with plenty of ruffage to extinguish my appetite. Throw in some green salsa with those tacos and I'm content. There's no doubt that I'll be back soon enough.
