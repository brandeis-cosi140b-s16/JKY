This is my buddies go to late night munchie place.  So naturally I am along for the ride.  The drive thru for this location gets busy late night because it is one of the only easy access restaurants when coming home from a night of drinking in the downtown or strip areas, and need to make it safely back home to Summerlin, Westside or Centennial Hills.  

The line moved pretty decent even though they were busy and the most important thing is that they got our order 100% correct.  I am normally a Taco Bell or Jack in the Box  fan for late night munchies, but the great thing about Del Taco is that you can have the best of both world's of FF mex or burgers and fries.  What a great concept.  

I think it will be difficult to convert me to a full fledged fan of Del Taco, but the food quality seems to be decent, hot and fresh compared to others late night staples.  Now if they had some chicken wings this place would be 10 Stars!!!
