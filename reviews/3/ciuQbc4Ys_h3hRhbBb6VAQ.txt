Reasonably priced, well prepared, hardy portions.
The food here is pretty typical Mexican food. Certainly a lot better than Taco Bell or Del Taco, but nothing special. It was good, hot, and generous in size--I couldn't finish mine. The waiter was prompt and efficient and there were several beers to choose from. 
As a value, this is a good choice of place to go. You will get a good meal for a fair price and have good service. For a lot of restaurants, that would be a lot to expect but here is it what I got. This is a good place for lunch and I would certainly return. It's just a good, everyday eatery.
