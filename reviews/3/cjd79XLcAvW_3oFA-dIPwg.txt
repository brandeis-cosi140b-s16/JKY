Not my favorite.

I do not visit Manuels often however, a few friend of mine had a hankering for Mexican food and Manuels was the closest restaurant. When we entered the restaurant we were seated quickly and  our server immediately brought us chips, salsa, and our beverages. 

Maybe I expect too much when I go to a Mexican Restaurant but one thing I do expect is decent salsa, nothing you could buy out of a jar at a grocery 
store.  The chips were fresh however, the salsa was watery and a little spicy, it just wasn't very good. 

The menu at Manuels Mexican Restaurant is comprehensive, and offers a varied selection of entrée's.  On this visit we shared  a chili relleno, chicken enchilada,  cheese enchilada, red beef burrito, and a crispy beef taco.

Even though our entrée's arrived, piping hot, we all agreed the missing ingredient was a lack of flavors or taste. The food was hot and plentiful, but really had no taste. After lunxh we decided to end our meal woth something sweet. For dessert we  had the fried ice cream which  was delicious, the best part of the meal.

I want to end this review on a positive note by saying the service at Manuels is ourstanding.  Our server made sure our chip bowl and glasses were always full before we even asked.  Great service, generous portions, and reasonable pricing is what keeps people coming back.
