Ok...been waiting for awhile for this place to open up..came in tonight( a Friday ) wasn't too busy, but there was several people in line. Staff seemed rushed and hurried, ordered a carnitas taco and potato taco, boyfriend ordered fish and shrimp tacos.  By the time his was done my 2 were stone cold...he said his were really good. So food was  good, girl at cash register didn't know how to pour the beer, thankfully some one else came along and did it, and we had to ask 2 times for our chips and salsa, which the salsa was not really salsa...so the staff..is so so...I hope it was just opening jitters and I will come back in a few months to try again..hopefully this place will work out the little kinks they had tonight.
