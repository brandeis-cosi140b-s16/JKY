Really close to Midwestern University.

I'd recommend getting the kids meal. They will let you swap out the toy and crayons for a large sized drink. I personally enjoy the kids fish taco. Not a lot of food but it will keep your portion sizes under control. :)

I have ordered "adult" meals and they are kinda small as well. Especially when you factor in how much they cost. Maybe I am just ordering all of the Wrong items?

They have a salsa bar which is pretty delicious and a great way to customize your meal.
