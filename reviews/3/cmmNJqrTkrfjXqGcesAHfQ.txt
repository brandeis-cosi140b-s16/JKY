I love Chronic Tacos' food, always fresh and well-prepared! My problem is the restaurant ALWAYS seems to close early. I've shown up several times ten minutes before the advertised 9 pm closing time, and the doors are already locked. So I spend my money nearby at Port of Subs, which also closes at 9 but actually stays OPEN until 9. Verdict: food great, customer convenience not so much...
