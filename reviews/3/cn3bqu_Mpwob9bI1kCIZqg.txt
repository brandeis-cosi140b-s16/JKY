I have been meaning to try this place for a couple of years but for some reason I was worried that because of the signage they would not speak English.  Well I was wrong.  Based on my first visit they make really good sandwiches (Tortas) and they speak English just fine.

Located in a small strip mall their dining room can best be described as spartan.  This is a perfect fit as their pricing fits right between a 'bertos and a more traditional sit down restaurant.  There is full waiter service for those eating in.  There is a full menu and from what I can tell a few options that can be ordered off the menu.  As this is close to my work I plan on coming back more times to sample the large menu.
