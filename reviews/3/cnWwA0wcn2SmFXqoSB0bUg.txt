My husband and I went last night at 4:30pm for an early dinner since we had an appointment at 6pm in Cave Creek. We never thought that the service we be so slow we wouldn't get out of there until 6pm so we weren't able to make our appointment. Even though it was the day before Cinco de Mayo the place was almost empty so I couldn't say why the service was so slow. Despite how long it took the food was amazing. The chicken mole enchiladas was delicious and make sure you save room for desert. They make all the deserts there even the ice cream. The chocolate cake was delicious with a side of their ice cream that the waiter described as a brown sugar molasses flavor; very good. Great Margaritas too! The menu is not your standard Mexican restaurant fare and the prices are a little higher than the usual too. We will return but only when we have ample time to spare.
