I don't have any problem with this place. Good amount of variety. Cheap. Fast. Friendly. Fresh. All the other adjectives used by previous reviewers. Plus, the kids meal "toy" is actually an educational pull-out book which my 4-year-old is now delightly thumbing through on the sofa, as opposed to made-in-China rockem-sockem-robots or dragons that spit out flying plastic bullets like what you get from McDonalds. Oh, and I haven't gotten food poisoning from it (unlike from Chino Bandido, Macayos, Taco del Mar etc). Not exactly healthy food, though, so it's rare that I eat here. Kid loves the "reetos" when we do go.
