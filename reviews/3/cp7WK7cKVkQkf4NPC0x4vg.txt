Great customer service!! Our server was fast and checked on us many times to see how we were doing . We had the Mexican pizza for appetizer which was full of flavor. The chips and salsa were good and free. I enjoyed my food beside the burrito it had cubed beef not a big fan of that. Margaritas were tasty also. Good experience would return.
