I was hoping for more when visting El Yaqui, but it definitely wasn't a bad experience.  

I'd like to start by stating that I love the setup of the Guadalupe Mercado.  I wish they had more businesses inside because it has a really pleasant, town square type atmosphere.  I plan to try San Diego Bay at the next earliest opportunity as well.  El Yaqui restaurant is quaint and understated inside, I have to say I really preferred it to the atmosphere of some of my fav Mexi-Quick-Stops (Los Taquitos and Salazar Bros).  The Flautas (Chicken and Shredded Beef) were decent, but not entirely filling.  I'm used to leaving this kind of restaurant almost uncomfortably full!

The only downside is the modest menu and slightly more expensive prices.  If there weren't any options nearby I may consider bumping it up a star.  I would head back to El Yaqui, and maybe try and grab something else or at least hang out on the patio for a bit.
