IMHO Salsarita's chicken is nothing compared to Chipotle's.  That aside though I do love the fact that I can get fresh cilantro at Salsaritas!  The breakfasts here are my favorite since I hate normal breakfast food.  We do a lot of work breakfasts here and it is the one place everyone can agree on.  They have a breakfast quesadilla with eggs and potatoes and you can get whatever you want on it - great prices and super friendly staff!
