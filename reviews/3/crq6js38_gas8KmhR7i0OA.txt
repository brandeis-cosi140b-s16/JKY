The food is good, but my favorite thing about the place is the art.  I know I'm weird, but they really do have some great pieces to peruse as you nibble those chips and salsa.  

While this isn't my #1 Mexican spot, it's location has a been a great center meeting point with friends.  The food is never disappointing and service has always been good.  Very good actually.  Oh the stories I could tell about our friend doing some super heavy flirting with one of the waiters.  Though at that level it's hardly even flirting anymore.  More like a direct offer.  But anyhow... He handled it smoothly as silk.  This would lead me to guess they have a pretty good bar, which my friend was enjoying of course.
