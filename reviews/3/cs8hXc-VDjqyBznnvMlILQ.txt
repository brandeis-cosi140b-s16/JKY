Had breakfast here with my hubby this morning ( we were going to red eagle but its closed on Sun) the place was big and clean and the service was attentive and friendly. I had the huevos rancheros and they were just OK , I also ordered some chicken rolled tacos with Guac and they were really good, husband had chorizo and eggs and he liked them. we had a bloody Mary with a corona chaser as it was after ten and the Mary was decent and the beer frosty cold and cheep less the three bucks. we live in Arrowhead so it's a bit of a drive but next time were in the area I'm sure we will stop for lunch they have a huge menu that looked really good.
