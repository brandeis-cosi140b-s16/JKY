I used to love the old Mexican franchise that used to occupy this place, but not this one. I ordered a sad little vegetarian burrito, but unfortunately they did not include tomatoes, avocado or lettuce. They charged me extra, but failed to include the ingredients. I could have gone to Taco Bell and ordered a 99 cent bean and cheese burrito, and could have gotten the same one. This taco shop also does not have a salsa bar. Instead they give you a tiny little container and you have to ask if you want extra.  TNT !!! ( Tragic and True)
