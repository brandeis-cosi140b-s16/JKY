Bottom line: a good sports bar with decent bar food.

This place should be heaven for me because nachos are my desert island food, but 
it's . . . well, just decent bar food.  Good enough burgers, edible salads, frozen veggie burgers heated to order and lots of good beer. 

First, the positives: the atmosphere is great for a game night.  We came here for the Super Bowl in 2012 and it's one of better sports spots I've been to.  Loud and raucous with contests for prizes/giveaways throughout the game.  People were watching and into the game without getting obnoxious and ruining the event for others.  As for the beer list, it's pretty well stocked for American beers.  Foreign beer lovers may be a little disappointed, but most others will be satisfied by the options.   

The nachos are a little hit or miss.  It may be the tortilla chips the bar chose.  They're a little too salty.  And that's coming from a guy who will always reach for salty over sweet.  Out of all the choices, the buffalo chicken nachos are my favorite.  The buffalo sauce is great and the blue cheese topping is rich and tasty.  The chili cheese nachos are okay.  The chili just isn't tasty enough to compensate for the over-salty chip pile. 

The quality of the sandwich choices ranges from decent to mediocre.  The chicken sandwich is decent and worth an order if you're in the mood.  The veggie burgers deserve a pass--but in all fairness, it's the rare sports bar that has a good veggie burger.  The regular burgers are . . . well, good enough.

So, stick with the beer, sports, and buffalo nachos and it's a 4 star spot.  Everything else drags the place down to 3 stars.
