Oh Roberto's! I can't even begin to count the number of times you have been there to satisfy my drunk munchies! HAHA this location is conveniently open 24 hours and is clean & fast! The best thing on the menu is the Carne Asada Nachos!!! Mmmm! But if I'm feeling like I should be somewhat "healthier...." i get the Carne Asada Plate LOL Although Roberto's & "healthier" shouldn't even be in the same sentence.. 

I will say though.. One time I came when they were cleaning the whole kitchen and so the flat top grill was turned off.. They cooked our food in a separate frying pan which I've never seen them do and the food came out not so great.. So if you go when they are cleaning I suggest you take a rain check~ 

Muy delicioso~
