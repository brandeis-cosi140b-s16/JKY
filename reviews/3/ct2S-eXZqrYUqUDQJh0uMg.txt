Seems like it's under new ownership. 
They've added Mexican snacks and munchies which is a good idea. 

Their mangoneadas are good, but don't be disappointed when it doesn't look like the picture.  Yes, I know not to expect the picture but when you get less than half the slices of mangos in the picture, I cry a little bit inside.  I still get them though, they're tasty!

Their verduras are enormous and better than the picture. 

As for the food, it seems like they improved the taste for a lot of the items, but have considerably gotten smaller in serving size. 
Their burritos used to be able to fill you up, but now they're less than filling, at least in my and coworkers' opinions.
