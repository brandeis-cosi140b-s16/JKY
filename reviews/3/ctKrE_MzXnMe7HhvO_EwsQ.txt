The food here was very good... probably one of the best chili verde burritos I have ever had. The prices are very reasonable as well. The salsa was very good if you like it spicy, because they don't have a mild version. 

They lose two points for their service. It took almost an hour to make two burritos and when they were "dropped" on the table by the server,  she asked,  "You don't need anything else, right?!" As she was turning to leave...

I shouldn't have to point out to a server that we have no silverware, no napkins, both drinks are empty, there is no salsa left, and you didn't bring the side of sour cream that was ordered. I know... I have high expectations!

The check was prompt, but after 10 minutes of waiting for her to come back to the table and pick my credit card up, I finally left cash on the table so we could leave. 

My advice is to hire new wait staff or make a take out window so the poor servings staff  doesn't impact all of your business.
