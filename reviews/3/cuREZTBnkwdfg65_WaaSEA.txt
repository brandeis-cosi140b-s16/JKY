It's your typical chain restaurant. Nothing flashy, nothing bad. I went with my friend and we ordered a couple margaritas and some beers. Had the guacamole dip and the meat tacos and fish tacos. All were tasty, but I kept thinking about all the calories and fat I was consuming - oh well. 

The main reason I went here is I had a $25 coupon I needed to burn through. Service was standard, nothing bad, came when called (sounds like my dog). I would go back if I was with a group and they had to go here or if I was traveling and did not have another option or if I was at the mall and needed a quick Mexican fix. 

I prefer local joints like Cantina 1511!
