I've dined at The Commissary twice now.  The food has been of high quality and the value is great, with the exception of the gelato milkshake.  There was nothing about it that warranted an $8 price tag.  It didn't even bring the boys to the yard!

On my first visit, I had the Caesar salad.  I enjoyed it, but the dressing was surprisingly spicy.  This may not go over well with your typical Caesar consumer.  On my second visit I had the brisket burrito.  I would say this was far better than Chipotle.  

There are a few things that keep The Commissary from receiving five stars.  The first thing is service.  I found the people taking my order on both occasions didn't seem exceptionally knowledgeable and on the second visit my order was incorrect.  I attribute this to the fact the restaurant is relatively new.

I also was a little unsure about the atmosphere.  I found the music to be a little on the loud side on my first visit, making it hard to converse with my dinner companion.  On my second visit, I contemplated getting coffee from the adjacent coffee bar and popping out the iPad to get a little work done.  I discovered that The Commissary does not offer free WiFi, which kept me from ordering coffee.  In keeping with coffee bar atmosphere, I would think free WiFi would be a must.

Overall, I enjoyed The Commissary, but not enough to go out of my way to visit again.
