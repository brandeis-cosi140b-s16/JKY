I'm giving Monterrey a 3 not for what it was in my dining experience but what I think it could be under the right circumstances. The decor is standard Mexican restaurant look. The service was very fast. I ordered steak fajitas and had the chips and salsa that come with every meal. Overall my meal was very average. Maybe a little below average. I'd probably give it a 2 or 2.5 for what I had. My server was very attentive and the food came out fast though. The main reason I have no reasons giving the place a solid 3 is because I think it could be better than my experience. They have plenty of authentic Mexican dishes which you don't normally see outside of Cali. Normally, I would have gotten one of these but was feeling like Fajitas. Also, they have a nice outdoor patio which I think would be very nice for a cool summer night meal.
