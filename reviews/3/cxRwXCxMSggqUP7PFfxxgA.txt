I hate to write this review in a negative way...However, I will start by saying the best Mexican restaurant around this area by far!  We love going here and I will continue to go during lunch or the day and site on the restaurant side.  We are pretty regular and on a Friday night I had 6 friends join me on the bar side and the blonde bartender behind the bar was the most rudest, snottiest, slowest waitress I have ever come across.  I know she has been there for sometime and MAYBE just maybe she was having a bad day BUT her attitude was off the charts and made our Friday night one to NEVER forget nor return on that side or on a Friday night!  I know how busy the Old Pueblo is every night and this message won't affect the business (not my intentions). I just wanted to point this out to anyone who has received this same behavior (unacceptable).  Enjoy the food!!!
