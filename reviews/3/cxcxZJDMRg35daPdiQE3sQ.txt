The food is above average - maybe four stars. The location is good in the eclectic Melrose district - lots of interesting independent businesses. The ambiance is fun and feels like I'm sitting at a taco shop in Mexico. My only gripe is the price, America's could really be a four star joint but the price brings it down. Spending $20 or more at a taco shop for two people seems excessive. Maybe I'm comparing it a little too much to an authentic Mexican taco stand, but I just don't feel like I get my money's worth after I finish my food. I would definitely recommend it over many other taco shops; just be prepared to spend a little more.
