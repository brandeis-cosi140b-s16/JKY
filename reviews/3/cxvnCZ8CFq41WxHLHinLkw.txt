So this isn't the best Mexican food in town by far, but it isn't the worst either.  My sister works just down the street from here, so we have met for lunch there a handful of times.  The decor is pretty old school and the menu is kinda all over the place with Mexican and American dishes, but they do the stand-bys pretty well.

The lunch specials are really the only reason we go back....Two Enchiladas with rice and beans is like $6 on Thursdays...and the service is so fast that if you are in a rush, you can still go to a sit-down place.  They have been there forever, so they must be doing something right.
