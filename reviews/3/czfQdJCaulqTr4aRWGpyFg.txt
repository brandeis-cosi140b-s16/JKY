Up and down experience. Salsa was very salty. Asked for replacement. Same. Must have been bad batch. Table side guacamole was good. Asked for spicy but no kick. I blame the jalape√±os. Sometimes they are mild. Good flavor however. Asked bartender best tacos. Al Pastor. Very average and bland. Usually very flavorful at other places. Did not finish.
