I haven't eaten here for months, after a few times of dining and being thoroughly disappointed with food and service.  After pestering me, my boyfriend finally convinced me to try again.  We were not disappointed.

Is there new management?  A new chef?  Whatever it is, it is working.  The nachos were ten times better, not as bland as before, and had a more proper cover of cheese.  

Let me tell you the quesadilla was amazing.  I know what you're thinking, "seriously, you're telling me about a quesadilla?" Yes, yes I am.  It was perfectly cooked in a flour tortilla with the perfect amount of cheese, for the perfect amount of time.  Delicious.  I would go back just for this.

You must also try the corn on the cob.  The chili-lime cotija flavor is just awesome.

Service was definitely a lot more attentive and friendly than my previous visits.  Our server was a just a bit awkward in his approach but that isn't a big deal.  The only thing is it seemed as though the ambiance was favoring a more "mature" crowd.  The music was turned down waaaay low.

I will definitely be back to return, and if I continue to be impressed by the changes, I will probably change my rating.  My stars must be earned with consistency, however.
