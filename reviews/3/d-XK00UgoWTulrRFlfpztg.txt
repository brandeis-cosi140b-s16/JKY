Good little Mexican restaurant. I got the #3 combo with chicken which was a great meal. Their rice is the best Mexican rice I have ever had!! The kitchen was a little slow and the restaurant was not that busy. Our server was good and attentive. I would recommend this place, and give 4 stars if the meal was a little quick, especially for lunch.
