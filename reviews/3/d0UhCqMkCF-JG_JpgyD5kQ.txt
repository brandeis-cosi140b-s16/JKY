A Qdoba is a Qdoba is a Qdoba. This is no exception. The food/ ingredients are consistent. I visit this location semi frequently and have always been pleased.

This location is in a convenient place but the parking lot is less than desirable. One way street in one way street out the back. It's very clean inside and the staff is friendly. I usually show up later at night and I am always in and out.

I like this location, and it is consistent for what it is.
