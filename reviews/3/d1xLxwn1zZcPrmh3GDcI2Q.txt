Food was good.  Service was average.  Loved the bean dip they bring with the chips and salsa in the beginning.  The chimichanga with green sauce is my favorite.  The music from the bar is very loud and makes it difficult to enjoy your meal.  If you don't want to feel like your in a live concert then do not go to this restaurant after 6pm.
