Food rating:  3.5 stars

My bf and I were laying over at the Charlotte airport and were hungry.  Thanks to the Yelp mobile application for the Blackberry, we actually found reviews for another Salsarita's location - http://www.yelp.com/biz/salsaritas-fresh-cantina-charlotte-5

Based on that, we decided to head over to the main terminal.  As the reviews described on the link above, it is very similar to Qdoba or Chipotle for those that aren't familiar.  I'm happy to report that unlike Chipotle, Salsarita's doesn't charge extra for Guacamole.  Woot.

My bf ordered a salad bowl and I ordered a burrito.  Both were pretty fresh (considering that we were at the airport).  Another added benefit is that it passed the "eyeball" test.  We saw some pilots lining up... and that's got to be a good thing (considering that they are probably at the airport very often).

Overall, the ingredients were pretty fresh and not loaded with salt.  Woot!
