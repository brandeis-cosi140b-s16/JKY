Is Bigger Always Better?

I guess it depends on who you ask.

Personally, I've always thought of length and girth as being far less important than taste and deliciousness.

Wait...We are talking about the same thing, right?

Anyway, my work-partner and I were in Madison making deliveries the other day and he said that we absolutely had to go to La Bamba for one of their gigantic super-burritos.  It wasn't just his interpretation, they have a gigantic hand-painted mural on the wall when you walk in that says "Burritos As Big As Your Head!!

I gather it's a point of pride.

Service was awesome, if a bit cheesy.  The guy working the grill yells out "HOLA AMIGOS!" to everyone that walks in and was super pleasant.

Decor is pretty spartan, it's strictly some cheap tables and booths, plastic silverware, and ESPN Deportes on a telly.  But as I've said before, I would happily eat in a Stalinist gulag if the borscht was delicious.

Super Burrito?  Definitely huge.  Definitely messy.  Definitely maybe sub-super.  I mean, it was good.  Don't get me wrong.  But it wasn't like, blow-me-away-amazing.

I got the pork and it was more like ground pork than some kind of actual pork texture.  They also put lettuce in the burrito which is a huge turn-off for me.  The salsa, even the secret green stuff that you have to ask for wasn't very hot at all.

I'll eat there again, but I won't have the pork.  Will be sure to update when I've had something else from their menu.
