Tonight I had to choose between Great Wall, nearby, or El Taco Tote. I chose El Taco Tote because Yelp has a check-in special. The menu was very confusing. The decor was updated. The service was below par. The restaurant was very busy, and kids were everywhere and out of control. It is obviously a local favorite.

My biggest complaint is the price.
$2.19 for a fountain drink? $7.99 for four meat-only taco's? With the Yelp freebie, my total came to $11.02, and that was the cheapest thing on the menu. It's $3.79 for a SLICE of cheesecake.

The price is likely going to deter me from future visits, and it deterred me from purchasing that cheesecake; which might be a good thing for me, but bad for them as a business. 

Was it good? Sort of. I wouldn't put it any better in quality than Filibertos though. The salsa bar was good, but sad that I had to hit it up twice to get full.
