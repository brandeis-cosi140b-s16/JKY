A healthy option for Mexican food. I appreciate the fact that the menu lists the calories of each dish. We need more places like this. I just wish that I had enjoyed the food more!!!

It seemed to me to be very lacking in flavor. It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't yummy. Come on people, healthy food doesn't have to be boring!!

I was also disappointed in the sauces, yes sauces, not salsa. I'm a huge fan of freshly made salsas and they only offer a huge selection of hot sauce. :(

The restaurant gets 3 stars even though I didn't really enjoy it and I probably won't go back, I still feel like it deserves credit for providing a healthy option!
