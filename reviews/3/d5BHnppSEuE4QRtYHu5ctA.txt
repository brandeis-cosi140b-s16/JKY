This place has the air of an old landmark. Not from purposeful decor but because its just been there for so darn long. Sure it needs remodeling but that just adds to the charm. Its still colorful and fun. The lighting was a bit too bright for my taste.

The staff was friendly. It would have been nice if they came back to ask how our food was after they served us. But drinks were refilled without asking so I guess its a wash.

Chips were good. Salsa was good but a bit watery and hot.

I ordered the Machaca Chimichanga (9.99) and my wife the shrimp/steak fajitas. (13.00).
My chimi was delish. beans and rice were a bit bland. Sour cream and guac came standard. My wife liked the fajitas. The onions and peppers were grilled to caramelized perfection. It could have used more meat. Portions were large and we ended up taking half home.

Over all it was OK. Not great. I like Macayo's and Chevy's better.
