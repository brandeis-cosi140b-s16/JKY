We stopped in for drinks and snacks to check the newest Pasqual's out before heading to a movie. My miracle margarita was good, though the rim of the glass was devoid of any usual margarita like substances (salt or sugar). So it was a bit basic, and not very cold. We also got an appetizer which was three small tortilla chips, a smear of extremely salty and spicy bean dip, each topped by one small ice cold shrimp. At $4.95, it was lacking in quality and quantity and was nowhere near being something I would ever order again. The chips and salsa and guac were fine. Two bartenders were working, one somewhat surly ponytailed guy and one more pleasant younger guy. I wish we'd had the younger guy as our main bartender because the other guy's 'tude was just a bit off-putting. The interior is nice, but kind of bland, not a lot of variation in seating, just long rows of tables. The blown glass light fixtures are very attractive, though. This place gets a solid third place with me in near east side area Tex-Mex places; Eldorado and Tex Tubb's still win.
