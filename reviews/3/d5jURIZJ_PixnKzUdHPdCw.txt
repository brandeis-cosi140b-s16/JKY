I came here when it was fairly new, and I must compare it to Tacos El Gordo. I ended up getting a pork adobada taco, an asada taco, and pork adobada fries. I found this place rather mediocre compared to El Gordo. Their fries were super soggy and, the adobada seemed like it was sitting out for a bit. I honestly can't remember what the tacos tasted like either... Two super pluses is that their sauce bar contains a lot of variety, and their workers are extremely friendly and helpful (At El Gordo, they don't even acknowledge you).
