we came here for my birthday last year!  it's a really cozy Mexican restaurant thats pretty big inside.. lots of seating! 

we were a party of 7 so we were seated in a large and comfy booth.  our waiter was super friendly, and while he set us up with two baskets of chips and 2 sets of salsa and bean dips, he recommended a few favorites on the menu before getting us our drinks.  [i totally appreciate that it was before he took our drink order because we could think on his recommendations while we read the menu and waited for our drinks.  it just makes sense!]

they have a great fresh salsa and amazing bean dip.  we killed it, and our waiter wasn't hesitant to refill the chips, salsa, or bean dip! dope!!

First and foremost I had a large large margarita and large large shot of tequila!  
and after that .... I had a big big sombrero to wear for the remainder of the night during dinner!  how fun right?  It really was.. I have pictures.   

I had the chicken flautas.  It came with MORE fresh salsa, guacamole, a mini side salad, beans, and rice!  It was sooooo yummy.  It was my birthday so I can't say much for anyone else and what they thought of their food.  Everyone seemed to enjoy the place... but I think after a couple drinks everything starts to taste good.  

I even got some churros with ice cream to share with EVERYONE! 

The drinks are amazing.  LOL.. especially with a sombrero on your head!
Cheers!
