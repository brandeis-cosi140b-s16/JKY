It's definitely not the best Mexican food I have ever eaten, though in retrospect I would probably have to call it Mexicanish, as it does not strike me as particularly authentic. However, the service was fast and friendly, the place itself spacious but still comfortable, and the noise level such that a couple of squeals from my 11 month old were hardly noticeable. I have to agree that the prices are a bit on the high side. Several of the dishes we have tried so far have been quite tasty (the cotija corn appetizer and the carne asada tacos for example), some others (the vegetarian tacos most recently) more bland. Three stars really sums it up for me. It's fine.
