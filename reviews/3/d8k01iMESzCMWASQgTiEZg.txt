Very good breakfast burritos served all day. The younger girl who takes your order both inside as well as the drive thru, however, isn't very pleasant. Also, every time I ask them to add something like jalape√±os to one burrito, they always get confused and either add them to both(if I'm picking up food for my boyfriend and myself) or not at all. 
The drive thru is not very fast because everything is pretty much fresh but it's usually worth the wait.
