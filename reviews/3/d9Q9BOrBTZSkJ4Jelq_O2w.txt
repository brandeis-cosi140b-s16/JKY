Extensive tequila selection, decent sized menu, but the food was not impressive. The tacos were very light on the meat and my friends entree's were not that great.

The service was great and the bartenders had a great pour, but the food was not the best. I think its worth trying once, but unless im looking for some good tequila, i wont be going back.
