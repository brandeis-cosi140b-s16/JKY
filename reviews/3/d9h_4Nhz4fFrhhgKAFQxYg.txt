We came here for Father's Day hoping to taste "authentic" Mexican food because yelpers say it is.. Fail! 
This is not authentic Mexican food! 3 stars- especially for the server (who told us himself that he is Mexican) who compared Mexican food to Chili's- uh hello! Chili's is not Mexican food!!)
The food is NOT bad in any way.  It's their what do you call it.. Fancy, modernized version of authentic Mexican? Mm no thanks! Go to The Mission (now that's fancy, modernized authentic Mexican). The restaurant is very casual (no need to dress up).  I will say they have great service.  We even asked the gentleman clearing our table what he recommends and he says he's never tasted the food. *sigh.. Ok. Dessert menu came we asked server which do you recommend flan or tres leches.  He said bread pudding. Enough said.
