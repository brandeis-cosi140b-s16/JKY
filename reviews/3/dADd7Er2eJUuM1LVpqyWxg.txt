[The food is about a 3 the awkward "path" to order and pick up is a 2.]
So I brought my lunch with me to work today.  Unfortunately someone took it upon themselves to enjoy it for me.  So that left me with 30 min to find a place to get lunch and bring it back to the office.  
This was my first trip to Vitamin T.  Having read the so-so reviews I decided to check it out for myself.  
Walking in I didn't know where to start I had to weave my way through patrons standing and eating at the oak barrels randomly placed and the others in line filling up their little salsa cups at the salsa bar.  I awkwardly made my way to the flat screen menu.  
Torn between the Sonora Dog and the Caramelos I went with the Barbacoa Caramelo and an order of Guacamole (no drink $8.74) .  I preceeded to wait, initially awkwardly close to the kitchen/bar and some folks eating on barrels then decided to get my own salsas.  As my number was called I had to again become rather intimate with the standing diners positioned around the barrels, back up to the front.  They provide sacks to pack up your food for take out.  I threw everything in and again weaved my way through the barrels and people yet again.   

The food....
The caramelos are served in 2s grilled flat with 2 tortillas each then folded in half, the filling of cheese and meat are generous. The barbacoa is lightly seasoned and tasty.  From the salsa bar I choose the salsa verde, roasted serrano peppers and the small batch of red salsa in the back.  Here the red is better than the green.  And the roasted serranos are nicely spicy. 
The guacamole order comes with chips.  Not home made but tasty. The guac itself is quite lemony with garlic, chunks of tomato onion and cilantro and a flavor more akin to black pepper...meh it is ok.
