So I've been here three times now. Each time, the food and drinks are great. I wanted to give them a fair chance on the service to make sure we didn't have just an off server the first two times, but I can officially make my review now. The service is way below average here, not only are some of the servers kind of rude, but their attention to detail is lacking. I'm sure I'll go back because like I said... the food and drinks are great. I just won't be sitting at tables anymore, I'll be enjoying the bar.
