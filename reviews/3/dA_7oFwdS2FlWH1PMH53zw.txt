The thing that saved this place is yes the portions are big. But the taste is not that great. Got the smothered combo burrito with adovada, and all the free toppings. Not much meat inside. Mostly beans and rice. For $9 burrito it should have more meat.

Also tried the $2 slider and the chile verde taco. The meat on all three were very tender but no flavor! Not enough seasonings. Usually if a meat is soft and tender but not enough flavor, a good salsa can save it. Their salsa tastes like Pace. 

Plus side, you get your food fast, even though they were busy. Counter staff not overly friendly or helpful though.
