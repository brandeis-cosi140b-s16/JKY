Took our aunt visiting from Chicago here for lunch on a weekday at about 2pm. Other than the 1 guy sitting at the bar and another single man at a table by himself, we were the only ones there.

We COULD NOT BELIEVE how slow the service was. No staff member was around when we walked in and I was carrying a sleeping 2-year-old so we seated ourselves. We were later told there was a host "running around there somewhere."

It took FOREVER to get our food after ordering too.

However, the food was AMAZING which is why I am still giving them 3 stars.  I would definitely go back ( on a day I am NOT in a hurry) because the food was so good it does outweigh the horrible service.
