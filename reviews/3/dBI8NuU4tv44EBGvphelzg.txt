Hmm.  It was okay, but I didn't think it was great.

We "dined" in and the interior matched the exterior, so I had high hopes this hole would serve some tasty grub.  I went with the flauta dinner, which were really more of a rolled taco.  To me there is a difference, though perhaps that's just my experience.  I expect the rolled taco to be tightly rolled with a filling with more of a "is this beef or chicken?" texture.  The flauta would be fatter with shredded beef or chicken.  No worries, I'm equally happy with both.  And while the flauta was good, I was not overly fond of the somewhat bland avocado green "sauce" atop.  I did think the beans were excellent and would definitely return for those alone.
I also had a bite of my husband's gorditas and thought they were excessively greasy and should have been drained a little more.  

Overall, I was generally pleased and wouldn't mind going back sometime to try something else.  I did wonder, though, how there could be so many slashes in the vinyl seats when there are only plastic knives available.
