Our waiter was very nice and very attentive and there was also a very nice woman who made sure we never ran out of chips, salsa, or bean dip. The food was good, not great but good. My husband had the El Magnifico Sampler, I had the Olivia's Sampler, and our son had the Mini Tacos and Chimis off the Kid's Menu. It was all good and we all had leftovers for the next two days. We also had a couple of margaritas which were very big and good as well. We did have water and luckily I asked for lemon in mine. My husband took one sip and said, "Ugh that is Mesa tap water for sure." I really think they should invest in a water filtration system and their rating would go up by at least one star.
