Great carnitas just wish they weren't so stingy. With the high prices you charge you would think you would be more willing to load up the burritos with something other than rice. The thing I hate the most is when they take the extra step to take meat off the burrito and put it back into the pan. I remember once I actually got a good amount of meat, I think it was raining that day. I hold on tight to that memory.
