Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the work the owners did on the building.  When we went on Wednesday night it was very crowded with a 20 to 30 minute wait.  Once seated it was rather noisy due to the number of people.  The wine glasses were dirty. However the food was good, the price was reasonable, and I think the decor won me over.  It had a lot of style which somehow made up for it faults.  I'll be back hopefully at a less busy time.
