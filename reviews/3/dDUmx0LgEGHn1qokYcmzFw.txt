Came here for a quick lunch on Christmas Eve. After running around doing errands, we were looking for a quick place to eat. We did not want a sit-down-eatery, but we did not want a super-fast-food place (think: golden arches). Perfection: Rubio's. For those East Coasters, Rubio's is chain Mexican Grill, similar in style to Panera. Aka: you order, they cook your food (cook, not microwave fast-food-style), and then you pick it up at the counter. 

I got the popular fish tacos (with guac and cheese). Mine was very tasty, I would definitely order it again. I would give these tacos a 4/5 in terms of "quick" Mexican! We also got the Atlantic salmon tacos. Not good. Very fishy and very little meat. The chips and black beans were good, so it made the whole trip a 3. I would come back for a quick lunch! The service was very friendly. The attendant at this Rubio's actually brought our food to our table! Great service!
