Summary:  Just okay Mexican food. 

The Food: Being from So-Cal and a mass-consumer of burritos, I am somewhat critical  when it comes to Mexican food.  Eva's does have delicious homemade chips, salsa and amazing bean dip, which is promptly brought to your table when you sit down, but that is where the goodness ends.  The dishes are on par with El Torito. My Baja chicken burrito was practically a rice and bean quesadilla. The chicken was minimal and bland, and the guac was just okay.  If you like mild, overtly Americanized Mexican, then check out Eva's.  If you like spicy, bold-flavored Mexican, save yourself over half the cost and visit a taco stand.  

The Atmosphere:  Eva's has a great atmosphere. They featuring a beautiful patio, hand painted walls, and a gorgeous patio.  

The Staff:  The staff is all very friendly and prompt.  

Bottom Line:  If this place could make the rest of their dishes as well as they make their chips, bean dip and tortillas, they would be unstoppable, however serving up bland meats and sauces is NEVER acceptable in my book.
