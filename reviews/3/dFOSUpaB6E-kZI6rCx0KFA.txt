A friend & I went through the drive-thru & ordered the Baja Mountain Dew freeze. Usually they will fill it up all the way, but this employee didn't and when my friend asked about it he got all defensive $ basically said, "Idk what Taco Bell you went to, but they're wrong we don't fill it up like that". & well you see here sir, we've been going to this one & they always filled it up to atleast fill the slurpee lid. Why would you give us slurpee lids if you're not going to fill it up? That's why they're shaped that way for a reason or else he should've just given us a flat lid. Geez. & then he opened our straws & put it in our drinks & mine had a hole in it. I don't know where your hands have been. Oh Taco Bell. I'm just gonna go to the one on Warm Springs.
