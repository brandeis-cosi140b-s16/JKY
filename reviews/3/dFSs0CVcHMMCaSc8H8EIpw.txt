If you've never had pupusas, you're kinda missing out. They're a really simple dish, yet they're so good and so filling! Plus, they're one of the few foods that hasn't gotten big time, like gourmet tacos or burgers. So they're still a relative bargain.

I came to this restaurant with a lady, and we ordered a few pupusas revueltas with some sodas and some strange chocolate-y drink. I've got to admit, the pupusas were good. They were hot, and they seemed like they were made just then. I don't know that they actually were, but still. They were good enough that I will return to this place, despite some of my issues, just for the pupusas. 

The service was slow. Really, really slow. Slow enough that when I wanted to order more food, I had to go out and find someone to help me (the place was empty, btw). Also, they never refilled my water. It took us forever to get more soda (Cola Champan) when the brown mystery drink was put aside.

It sucks that the service here was slow. This place has a lot of potential to step their game up by just upping the service quotient, and it'd definitely be a four-star place... easy.
