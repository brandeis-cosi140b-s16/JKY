They recently completely overhauled their menu and it feels like a very different choice of dishes. The favorite Pollo con Crema is gone, and so are a few other solid dishes. I had tacos lengua - they were alright but not especially flavorful and lengua wasn't very tender. With a smaller menu, there is definitely much more emphasis on drinks/margaritas, which I find on an overpriced side. 
Overall, a cute place to get together with a few friends for appetizers and laughs, but I wouldn't do dinner.
