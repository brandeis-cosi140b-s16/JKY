I only eat at El Patio for lunch. Why? They have good lunch specials. For under $7.00 you can get a full meal with chips, salsa, rice and beans. Today I went for the Cheese Enchilada special. One of the best things about El Patio is the serving time. Literally 5 minutes from when we ordered, we got our food. Granted, there was only one other group in the restaurant. During the school year there is usually more groups at lunch time, but apparently the summer is slower for them. The enchiladas are good. Not great, but they hit the spot when I am craving something more than what Chipotle has to offer. The beans and rice are decent. Better than some other more expensive places in town. The chips are good, and the salsa is runny but has good flavor...a decent medium. This place is obviously more authentic than Chipotle or the Del Taco down the street, and you can get a good lunch without the wait of other places. 
The service is always good as its never outrageously busy, and the staff will not hound you repeatedly if you are just hanging out having a conversation after your meal. 
I had heard vicious rumors that the place had closed, so I was glad to find out that it is still alive and kicking. 
On a side note as I only eat lunch here, they do offer a UNLV Marg at $1.95. I don't know anyone who has had it, so I can't say whether or not it is good.
