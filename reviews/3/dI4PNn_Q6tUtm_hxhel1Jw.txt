Giving this 3 stars for the service. Bartender Derek was fsntastic. Steak skewers were bland and dry, steak tosdadas were all salad with miniscule pieces of the bland dry steak. Margaritas are yummy and the salsa Verde is awesome. Lovely atmosphere, music a bit too loud. I would come back for drinks and salsa. Onion rings and steak fries very good especially the spiked catsup.
