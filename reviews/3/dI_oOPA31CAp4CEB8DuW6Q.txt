Close to the house which is great. But the service there lags big time. And the girl at the counter I've been helped by several times has absolutely ZERO personality.
 I'm not impressed with the way they prepare their chicken. Carne asada is decent, breakfast burritos are great especially the chorizo. 
Nice hours of operation, and the store is always clean.
