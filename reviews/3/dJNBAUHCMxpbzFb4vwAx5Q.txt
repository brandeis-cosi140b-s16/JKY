The food was good the staff was friendly.
I got the fiesta grande you choose 3 items and it comes with rice and beans. I got the shredded beef taco the shredded beef enchilada and the chili relleno. The star of the plate was definitely the enchilada the beef was so flavorful. The other items were good but After one bite I was wishing I had 3 enchiladas. Over all the food was good and thanks to YELP we got to finish our meal with a plate of mini churros just for checking in. We will be back
