This small restaurant specializes in tamales with several varieties available off both the written menu and hand written specials board.  It is primarily a takeout restaurant though there are a few seats available at a counter with less than stable stools and a couple of tables outside on the patio.  We ordered a Mexican Coca Cola and 4 tamales:  (2) green chili with chicken, (1) green chili with cheese and (1) chicken.  These were all pretty good though we felt the masa harina dough was a little heavier than we have experienced on trips to Texas.
