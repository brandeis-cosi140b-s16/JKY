I really like this place as a quick lunch or cheap dinner out.  The portions are generous, the food is tasty (but not really authentic, as a lot of people have pointed out,) and the waitstaff does a good job.  

They have pretty stiff margaritas, judging from the few that I've had, so it's probably not a bad place to catch a buzz in, if you like margaritas!!
