This is the first time I have tried this place.   The menu was full of options and everything looks great.   I ordered the wet burrito with rice and it was delicious.   I only gave it a 3 star because it was missing the salsa bar and without it the food is not authentic to me.  However, after I finished. I noticed that you can ordered that at the window, which would be helpful if it was offered when I ordered.
