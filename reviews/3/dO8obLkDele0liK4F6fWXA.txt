This ain't no place for one looking for gringoized Mexican food.

The menu has mostly torats and tacos, what it does not have are chips or many veggie options.

The inside is surprising nice for the area and type of place.

The salsa bar is great, with pico de gallo, picante and even a guacamole dip and cabbage.

I had a small cheese quseadilla and it was fine, my co worker had a torta with rice and beans he really enjoyed.

I want to say more but with a lack of non meat options and a Spanish only menu I had a bit of a hard time here.

If you want a Mexican food adventure and eat meat give it a try.
