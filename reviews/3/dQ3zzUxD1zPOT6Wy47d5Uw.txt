I eat here regularly because I work in the parking lot. We do have tons of choices nearby but I still eat here more than the other places in our lot. Mainly because I have so many favorites on the menu that it makes it tough to get old. I usually call in my order then walk over. 

This is not my favorite robertoes and definitely not the most consistent location. 

The main reason they get 3 stars is because it is a total gamble that my food comes as ordered, I bet it comes right about 65% of the time. When it comes wrong it is still good though, just not as I ordered it. For example, I like to order a #4 no rice extra beans in it's place... They mess that up a lot. Or chorizo burrito add potato add cheese, also commonly botched. They have never messed up my carne asada burrito tho...

All in all, good food at a good price. Quick and tasty in a valley of terrible Mexican food. Try not to customize your order. And do yourself a favor and grab some of the free jalape√±o soaked carrots at the salsa station!
