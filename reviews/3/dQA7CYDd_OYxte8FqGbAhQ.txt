Fiesta Burrito is pretty close to my office and a few months ago one of my coworkers introduced it to me for a first time. For a quick in and out Mexican place it's definitely worth it. The prices are decent, they have a fairly extensive menu, and the service is fast. 

The downsides?

1) Parking is very limited which caused me issues for the first time today.
2) Seating can sometimes be limited as well. It's a fairly small joint.
3) Being a non tomato fan and sometimes not being in the mood for guac doesn't leave me much of a choice here and my options are pretty plain and limited most of the time.

With that being said, it's definitely worth trying if you are in the area. I suggest the carne asada burrito :)
