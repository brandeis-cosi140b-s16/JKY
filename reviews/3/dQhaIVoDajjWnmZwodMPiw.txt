My husband and I went on a Friday night around 8:30pm. It was a 45 min wait. The atmosphere was good, it was really crowded and the music could have been louder. The staff was all very friendly and pleasant. The food was really good once we finally got it. The wait to get our food once we finally sat was about 40min. They didn't even offer us chips and salsa. I looked at other Yelp reviews and that is how I found out that you have to request chips and salsa, they do not just bring them to you. We finally realized that right before our food came out. You would think the server would have offered it after we were sitting for over 20 min... if we go back, it will be when it is not so crowded.
