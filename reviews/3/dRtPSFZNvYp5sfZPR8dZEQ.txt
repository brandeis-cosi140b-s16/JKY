Stumbled across this place with the boyfriend and we are craving Mexican food so we decided to go in . I had the number 13 which was two cheese enchilada with green chili sauce (has chunks of Mexican beef in the sauce) . It was rich and filling . I enjoyed it but the service was SUPER SLOW! We probably will come back but not unless we are in the area .
