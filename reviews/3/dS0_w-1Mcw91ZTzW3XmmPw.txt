Seriously, I am a Mex-Foodaholic, and I usually don't turn it down. 

Coming from Cali where taquerias are everywhere, that can sometimes set the stage for expectations, but if I know that I really like it, it doesn't really matter to me - authentic or not.

For example, I actually REALLY love Taco Bell. I don't care if it's authentic or not, I just know that I really like it.

Same with La Fonda. I mean, for what it is, and if you set your expectations accordingly, their food is pretty good, kind of like a glorified Taco Bell in a sit-down restaurant!

They got it going with regards to aesthetics and vibe, and it's a good place to take your larger groups of family or friends. 

Chips were good, and warm, and were served with something that was more of like a spicy hot sauce, and another that was more mild.

I ordered the following - 

CHEESE CRISP
Large toasted flour tortilla covered with melted cheese. 5.75 Add green chile strips, tomatoes or green onions for 1.00 per item

ENCHILADA TRIO
One beef enchilada with red sauce, cheese enchilada with green sauce and chicken enchilada with fundido sauce. Served with rice and beans. 12.50

Quite honestly, they were all pretty good, and the price was right. Service wasn't bad, either.

The only thing is that my buddy insisted that I try something with the  Fundido Sauce cuz he thought it was the absolute bomb, and is one of their signature items.  

Apparently it's made out of melted cheese and sour cream, and served/poured over the top of some of their items, though I didn't quite feel the love there ;-)
