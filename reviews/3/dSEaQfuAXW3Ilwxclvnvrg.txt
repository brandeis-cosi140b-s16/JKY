The outdoor patio is a popular place for people watching and to be seen as it's on the corner of Planet Hollywood.  We opted to enter from inside and asked to be seated indoors which only had about 7 tables occupied.  Our server came promptly to get our drink orders.  I had checked in on Yelp which offered a free margarita ($10) value but I also had a coupon for 20% off (it's in the Miracle Mile coupon book).  I opted to get the free drink but after, I should have used the coupon, as the drink was too strong for me and I drank less than half.  My husband happily finished it for me though.

I focused on the tacos and fajitas on the menu.  The fajitas come for 1 or 2.  We shared the grilled sirloin fajitas and for $3 more we got beans and rice.  The food came out quick and the platter had lots of cut up beef and grilled peppers on it.  We each received 3 warm small tortillas wrapped in paper.  We devoured them pretty quick and asked for more.

Service was more attentive at the beginning of our meal and then died off.  It still wasn't very busy inside so it wasn't that the server was so busy.  The food was good, but I'm not sure if it was worth $42 for 2.  The drinks are about $14 each so it can add up.

There was a little stage set up when you first walk in but I don't know when bands play.  It seems more popular to sit outside, listen to music, and enjoy the Strip views.
