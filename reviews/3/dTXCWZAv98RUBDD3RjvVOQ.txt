Ok, so this review might not be 100% fair because generally I'm not much of a seafood gal and this place is pretty seafoodcentric. I went here for lunch today with a couple of girls from work. This place does have a few non seafood items, but it is pretty limited. I got a carne asada taco and I got a scallop tostada (I like scallops alright). Well, the taco was somewhat bland. There was nothing exciting or special about the carne. The scallops were alright, but it was a scallop ceviche and I felt like the scallops hadn't had enough lime or hadn't marinated long enough because they still looked pretty raw to me (I'm not sure if this is normal...). The flavor was good, but very spicy! I liked that, but I didn't like looking at the scallops while I was eating...it made me a little nervous. Also, the tostada was loaded with juice or sauce that fell all over and the tortilla didn't hold up to the topping (both mine and another girl's totally fell apart). Overall, this place was fine and definitely authentic, but I would not go back.
