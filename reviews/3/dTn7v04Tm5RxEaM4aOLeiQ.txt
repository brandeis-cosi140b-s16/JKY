Located in an outdoor mall this Moe's is pretty decent.  The food is made fast and right every time.  Never over done or sloppy the food is pretty good.  I always enjoy a good JC.  

Beer is avaiable.  The bathrooms are clean and the overall appearance and cleanliness is above average.  I dont eat fast food much but this is a decent alternative.
