No, not named for this great country of ours, but for America, the owner. Went there based on a recommendation from a friend at work, and he was right...this place was great. Had the carne asada burrito. The meat was perfectly flavored and the burrito was freshly made. It could not have been better. Opted for the pricey Coca Cola from Mexico. Very good, but at $3 a bottle, a little pricey, especially where I tend to drink a lot of soda when I eat lunch. They now have a liquor license, so they offer a variety of Mexican brand beers. Sodas come in bottles and cans, depending on the brand. One nice option I liked was they accept credit cards, which at first isn't obvious. There are no signs that they take credit. The only way I knew was seeing a tiny magnetic strip reader next to the cash register. The restaurant is inside an old, small house, so there isn't a lot of room, and it's tough to find seating if you're more than a party of two. There is off-street parking behind the restaurant, but again, it's the back yard to an old home, so parking can be tight.
