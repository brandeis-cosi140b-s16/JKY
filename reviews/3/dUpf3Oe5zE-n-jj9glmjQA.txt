Chips and Salsa...Let's just say I am a big fan of them here, The chips are pretty run of the mill in general, always crisp and good not really seasoned at all but perfect for the salsa, it is just plain old delicious, I mean I like it allot. I love the chips and salsa at this place its the main reason for the 3 stars. 

So I have been here a few times now since the remodel. Here is what I can say...It's nice, I mean as far as Mexican restaurants go, this place is probably one of the nicest ones I have been to in quite a while. The food is always consistently good...and can I say if you can't already tell that the chips and salsa are delicious...also no charge for chips and salsa, complimentary as much as you can stuff your face with...if you like free refills for good chips and salsa then this is definitely your place.

It's really clean you can tell everything is brand new and the staff albeit slow is friendly and fairly informative. 

So that's a win. 

The down side...service is a really a bit slow. It seems like both time I have been there since the remodel I have had to chase down staff to order, get refills on everything, and get your check, and both times I have went it has not been busy enough to really allow this to happen.

Seems management needs to get a better grasp on this. I wouldn't mind if a manager came to my table to and introduced himself and asked how everything was...not happening here. Staff seems to be off talking amongst them selves. Yesterday my server walked up and you could tell she was eating some food somewhere else, cause she was still chewing on it as she walked back up to our table to take out order after a lengthy wait. Kind of gross. So they get three stars because of poor service practice.

But back on the plus side they have great chips and salsa. So I would go back...hopefully they will have stepped up the service game next time I come in.
