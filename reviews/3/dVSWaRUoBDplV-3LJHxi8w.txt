So tried this place for the first time and overall it was pretty good. I like the fact that it is cooked over open flame right there so you can actually see it is fresh..@ Certain places the food you eat can be somewhat questionable. ''is it really chicken?"...  got a family order which came with three large sides. The sides are typical of what you would get at like KFC or something similar mac n cheese, rice, beans, veggies etc... Everything comes with fresh tortillas too.. Which i really like and i gotta give it up for their spicy avocado salsa. Chicken was good..Flavorful. it is a chain restaurant so it is a typical fast food place so nothing special inside but i have to admit for being a fast food joint the place was pretty effin' immaculate even all the salt and pepper shakers were all lined up perfectly on every table( don't ask why i notice these things i just do). but hey the way i see it if the environment is kept clean, then the food must be well prepared as well.  your alright in my book crazy chicken.
