Maki was the winner for "where should I spend my Food Truck Friday money" this weekend. I was lucky enough to get there before the massive lines started to form. After I ordered, it was a good 20-deep behind me.

I went with the bang bang shrimp tacos. They were just okay for me. Not bad, but nothing to sing from the rooftops about. My buddy Tom opted for the spicy chicken tacos. He wins. His was much better than mine. Good flavor combination. 

Great price for the amount of food. Three tacos for less than ten bucks. Bonus: Maki takes credit cards. It sends you a text after to show you how much you spent.

The guy taking the orders was extremely friendly. I was most impressed by the fact that he could remember everyone's orders as we stood in a little group waiting for our food. The wait was minimal.

I look forward to trying more of Maki Taco's offerings in the future. I'm hoping they will change their policy to let you mix and match tacos. I would love to be able to try a little bit of everything instead of three of the same thing.
