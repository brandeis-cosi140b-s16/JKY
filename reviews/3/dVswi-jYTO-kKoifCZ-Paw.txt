Leading up to my trip to Vegas, I was very excited to try this restaurant. I, like everyone, had seen the two chefs that own this restaurant on Top Chef Masters, and their food looks so good! I went here on Monday for lunch, sat outside overlooking the pool, which was very nice, but was halfway disappointed. SO I had ordered the Border Grill Classics (I think that's what it was called), but it had little mini portions of chicken tacos, green corn tamales, and a tostada -ish thing with a funky name (can't remember right now), and it was just so boring! I was shocked that something that was supposed to give a taste of multiple menu items was just bland and not exciting AND cost 19$...not cool. Now, on the flip side, the BF got the potato tacos and they were one of the most delicious things I have tasted. They were spicy, creamy AND crunchy (fried shell), and had a ton of flavor. It came with two different types of rice, green and red, which were both good also. All of this for 16$! I really made the wrong choice... Anyway, I might have given this place 4 stars, but our service was not so great. Our server, Erica, seemed like she was in a very bad mood and talked to our table with attitude, especially after we declined drinks or appetizers. 

I would think about going back here for the potato tacos....but I wish it was a bit more consistent.
