Good spot that gets the added nod due to its long standing reputation in the Valley.  The Machaca is worth the trip but the rest of the menu is pretty standard traditional Mexican fare.  The nice granite counters and copies of the Wall Street Journal belie its Mexican heritage. Consider it a Beto's for the Scottsdale crowd...or a more casual TeePee.
