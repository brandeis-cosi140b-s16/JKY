Love the tortillas, freshly made in front of you & they are awesome. That being said, the staff is often rude or not interested. Several times my order has been screwed up. Then there are the patrons. I've honestly never been to a restaurant with such a collection of rude people. Honestly, people nudge you out of the way without saying excuse me. Others look at you like you don't belong (probably because I'm not dressed for church). Didn't realize they had a virtual dress code. I will continue to come back, but I will only come with the place is less crowded. Every time I've come & it's busy, it never goes well.
