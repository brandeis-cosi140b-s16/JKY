Excellent margaritas. One of few places around who actually squeezes limes to make a sours . A huge array of salsa. Food flavored very well 

Wonderful guitar music..

BUT , THE HUGE PARTY OF OVER 20 at 6-7.... Ruined our dinner. They were so loud the place shook.
Other couples left also. Too bad they don't have a separate room for loud drunks
What a disappointment, we left early and were tense
