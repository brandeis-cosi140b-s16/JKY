The service at this location has always been great and the food has been really good in the past but as of late the quality of the food has declined. The steak has been over cooked and it just doesn't have the flavor other locations have. Overall the ingredients just don't have the same great taste that other locations have. The last 4 times I ate at this location have been a little disappointing. But I do need to stress the service is good and it's always clean in the resturant I just hope they can bring up the quality and taste of the food back to what they did in the past.
