I visited Azteca while I was in the Charlotte area on a business trip and I am not sure what the hype is about. I am from Texas and know real Tex-Mex and this is not it!!! 

I am rating the food 1 STAR and customer service/ambience 5 STARS.

Our waiter was very friendly and always had a smile on her face, I really liked her, but the food was very gross! My coworker and I shared the Fiesta Azteca which is a sampler platter and it was not very good. The chicken flautas were so dry drenching them in hot sauce didn't fix them! The potato skins were greasy and soggy, not crispy. And bacon wrapped shrimp were burned to prediction with a black charcoal taste! For a $26 appetizer, I was hoping for something more edible. 

Will I be back? Yes, for the margaritas! NO FOR THE FOOD!
