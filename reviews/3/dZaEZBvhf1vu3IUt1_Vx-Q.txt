This place has been very hit-or-miss with me.  The setting is always nice, especially with shady outdoor seating during the summer.

I have had a couple of the vegetarian combination plates that were pretty sub-par, even compared to Dos Reales or a similar American Mexican place.  Most of the meat dishes I've had, though, (burritos, tacos, nachos) were pretty good.  And they do chiles rellenos well.
