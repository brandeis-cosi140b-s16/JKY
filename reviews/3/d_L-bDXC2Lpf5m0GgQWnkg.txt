A few of my friends and I visited Villa's this morning and had a very negative experience.
- We waited an hour (55 minutes) for our food (for 5 people)
- A two-burrito order was lost and had to be re-ordered
- Many people complained that they have been waiting for over 30 minutes.
- The burritos we had were soggy for some reason
- The carnitas plate had strips of very tough meat

Conclusion:
Either don't go to Villa's during normal peak hours, or go somewhere else.
