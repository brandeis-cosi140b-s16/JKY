I don't really see what the rage is about. I recently moved to South End and had heard a lot of hype about the place so I decided to stop in and pick some food up for dinner. I got chicken tacos and a side of rice and beans. First off, the chicken didn't really have any taste, second the sides were way over priced and also had no flavor. The black beans tasted like they were from a can. I will give kudos for the fresh lettuce and tomato on my tacos (it was actually fresh) and the service was nice. I just wouldn't return.
