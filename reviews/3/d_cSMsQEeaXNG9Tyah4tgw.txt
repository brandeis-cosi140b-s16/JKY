Disclaimer: I loved Mucho Gusto and their menu. 
The new menu is soup, salad and some thoughtful sandwiches. I can't say I was wowed. 

I enjoyed the short rib sandwich and it was delicious as well was the au jus they serve with it. The accompanying slaw was a little watery but had the right ingredients and flavor for my taste. 

My friends salad, their signature, was over dressed and with the crispy items mixed in they were no longer crispy. Good flavor in the dressing and good ingredients just not executed well. Not to mention they were out of the cheese that is a big part of this signature salad. 

I think their menu could be expanded a bit. Compared to the drink list it was pretty small.
