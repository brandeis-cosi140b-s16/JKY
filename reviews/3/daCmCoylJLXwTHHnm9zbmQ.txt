We stopped in for the obligatory Mexican fare on Cinco De Mayo.  They were very busy, but our wait for a table was only about ten minutes.  We sat inside and the interior while being clean looked disorganized, and there was a lack of any wall decorations or d√©cor in general, just bare brick / adobe or paint.  

The chips and salsa were great.  There were two types of salsa, one was very spicy and had a pleasant smoky flavor, and the other was a nice fresh pico that was very mild and flavorful as well.  The menu featured traditional Mexican favorites including soup, wings and an extensive ala carte menu.

Each of us had the folded taco dinner and it was good.  Our waitress was pleasant and attentive, but we didn't see a lot of smiles from the staff, most everyone had a pretty serious look about themselves.  I would probably recommend sitting outside (if it isn't too hot) to escape the "eating in a big box" sort of feel.  The food was good, but I would like to say that something stood out more than the chips and salsa, but nothing did, this time.

Good value for the money for basic Mexican style food, in a nice neighborhood in the downtown section of historic Litchfield Park.
