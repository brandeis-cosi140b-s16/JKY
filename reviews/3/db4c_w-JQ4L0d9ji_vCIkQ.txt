I've been to the location on Tatum many times and always enjoyed the food. I assumed the food would be the same at every location, not true. My husband & I both ordered the diablo pasta with shrimp. We both thought the dish was bland. In the past it had lots of flavor plus a little heat, not this time. 

Also, we went on Cinco de Mayo. They had $2 Coronas, but ran out. How is that possible? We may return then again we may not.
