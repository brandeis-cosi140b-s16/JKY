Not bad for the location.  As with any other Chipotle out there, it always seems to be a busy place to stop and get some food.  Line running along the wall and always seems to be the same length no matter how quickly they get through the people already in line.

The food is standard, which means filling and always more than what you need.  Just don't be like me when you get your food to go and forget to take utensils with you.
