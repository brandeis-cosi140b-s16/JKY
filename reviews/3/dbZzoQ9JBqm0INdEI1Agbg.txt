Just wanted to try a restaurant we haven't tried yet. Place is OK, chips a little greasy, salsa was fine. My steak fajita burrito was actually good. Wife enjoyed her rice and beans. Thought the food overall was to greasy. I think this place is better than some, but your're still able to find better!
