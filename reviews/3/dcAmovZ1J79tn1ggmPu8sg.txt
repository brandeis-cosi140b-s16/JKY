Quick style food joint. The ordering process was not the best. I needed a moment to figure it all out so he skipped me. I basically had to wave him down to come back to me. For this, I have not gone back, but thinking about giving it another shot. Further, when I ordered the vegetarian option it was as if I were breaking some code. I actually thought it was awesome that they have cactus which is a wonderful vegetarian option. It took some time to prepare, but once I got my vegetarian taco, it was delicious. The chips were thick style homemade but extremely greasy. The guacamole was awesome! I'd give it an overall 3.5, mainly for service.
