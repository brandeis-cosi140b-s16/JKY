My fear with mexican restaurants is that at the end, they're just another Chilli's or Pedro's disguised.

And sadly, I have to say, well.. this is yet another one.

I think I just must not be very keen on mexican food, and all I'm interested is in a margarita. 

Although I will say that pretty much everyone else in our party enjoyed the food, so KNOWING my issue with mexican cuisine.... eh

I will give the restaurant 3 stars only because it is LARGE and you feel that you're not elbowing with the next person (or maybe it's because of the high ceilings).

I bet the Middleton peeps are excited about all the progress and development in their area though... Hmmm.
