We went here for the first time over the weekend upon a friends recommendation and just the fact the this has been here for so long and we'd never tried it. The place smelled strongly of cleaning chemicals, which was a little off-putting at first. On the other hand, at least we knew it was clean :) The atmosphere is about the same as when this was Guedo's, so nothing to complain about there. The food was decent, but I wouldn't say I was blown away by it. The Chile Relleno was fine: I've had better and I've had worse. The carne asada tacos were good. The salsa was very good: just the right amount of heat. All in all, I would return and try a few other things on the menu.
