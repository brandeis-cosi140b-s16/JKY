My husband and I ordered a two item combo (taco & chile relleno), guacamole, two margaritas (one mango, one traditional on the rocks). My husband had three margaritas & we split the entree, no other food ordered. We thought it was quite expensive. Our bill with tip was $102. That's without the guacamole which they gave us complimentary due to our wait for drinks, even though we never complained. That was nice. The guacamole portion was very large, but the entree was average size with a small portion of rice & beans. The food was good but nothing "wowed" either of us. The taco was our favorite. The guacamole needed salt. The service was not great, but we tried to give them the benefit of the doubt since the restaurant had just opened the day before. We waited a long time for our initial drinks. We sat in the bar and it was pretty full, two or three empty tables. The restaurant is beautiful inside. Exactly what you'd expect from a Mexican place.
We came to the conclusion that if we are going out for Mexican we'll go to Juan's Flaming Fajitas on West Tropicana. It's cheaper, the service is great, the atmosphere is decent, & the food is outstanding.
Conclusion- been there, checked it out, will go again if a friend wants to meet up there for a drink at their suggestion, but I wouldn't suggest it.
