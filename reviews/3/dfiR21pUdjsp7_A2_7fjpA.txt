Came in on a rainy Saturday prior to going to a movie. Chips and salsa were brought immediately to the table. Chips were warm, salsa had a nice small amount of heat. I ordered the Burrito California with chicken. The green peppers in the burrito were not cooked fully, otherwise it was a tasty burrito. I ordered a small side of guacamole- it had a good lime and cilantro taste, which I love. Reasonably priced, typical "quick" Mexican food. Would I go back, maybe. Would I recommend it, sure, if that's what you are looking for.
