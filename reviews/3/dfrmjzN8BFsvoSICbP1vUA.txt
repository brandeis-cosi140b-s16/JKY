What this place has going for it is the Tequila. It is a great spot for professionals to come and get a drink with their friends. Food is tasty but menu options are limited. Seating is also limited because of the size of the restaurant (which is very small) and when it fills up the place gets pretty loud. Lots of solid daily specials for their tacos and drinks.
