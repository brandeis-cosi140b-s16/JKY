I guess that the Cabo Mexican Bar and Restaurants are a staple found in the Station Casinos around Las Vegas.
I want to put in a good word for their bar at the Palace Station.
They have an excellent happy hour.
Oh yes .... the usual 4 -6 PM happy hour.
But what sets them apart is the quality of the Margarita's you get for $4.00.
They call them Perfecto Margarita's....
and that is just what  I found them to be.
Beautiful glasses holding a generous amount of quality tequila.
They prepared Blackberry for me and they were just supurb.

On another occasion, we went to the bar later in the evening (11ish or so) and we sat at the bar and while waiting for our drinks we played the video poker. 
The drinks arrived and the bartender comped the drinks because we were playing the machines.
A super nice touch .....
I can't speak for all the other Station Casino properties, but if they can match the quality of the Palace Station, then their bars are definitely worth your time.
A totally enjoyable time .....  

( if their bars are not that good, then head over to the Palace Station - It is definitly worth your time )
