Tried this place for the first time today. I was craving Tripas and couldn't find them anywhere else.  Called in order, picked it up and paid $63 for just five tripas burros and one carne asada burro to share w family. The bags were pretty heavy.  Turns out when I got it home the burros were $9.99 each and were smallish.  Smaller than all the 'bertos' (for reference) anyway. .  The styrofoam clamshells we're two thirds burrito and one third veggies (grilled onion and jalape√±o, lettuce tomato and cucumber. Not impressed with prices for what you get. The burros themselves were tasty. Their little plastic cups of salsa were spicy and flavorful. The red anyway, I didn't try the green. This was a pricy craving that's at least been satisfied.
