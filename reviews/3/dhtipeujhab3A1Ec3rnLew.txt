Nice patio and large enough for a crowd.  X-mas lights and the water fountain reminds me of the Friends opening credit - Yes, I'll be there for you!

Came here with my gang and it was buffet style but regardless I must rate the place. We had a nice baby green salad with some balsamic vinaigrette, but things went downhill from here fast. Let's start with the pork; Cough! Cough! (Pound the chest!).  Someone pass me some water cause as much as I chewed it didn't go down - It was so dry it soaked up my saliva! Atop of it were some chili flakes so that didn't help much. The stuffed chicken came with a nice creamy sauce, but I don't recall what it tasted like.  The pork overwhelmed me and to add insult to injury don't serve mashed potatoes to dry out my tongue more!

Regardless, a friend of mine made a great point; we are served what we did not order.  Saved!  Therefore, I shall return on another visit to give my full report so stay tuned!
