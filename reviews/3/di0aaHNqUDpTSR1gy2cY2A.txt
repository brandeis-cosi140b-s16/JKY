e really liked the atmosphere and how they have kept to the character of the church. Four of us went for lunch on Sunday. The service was ok though we were confused about who our waiter was because it seemed it was someone different all through our time there. Can't say it was great because they didn't even keep  my water glass refilled and when they finally did (after being asked) I didn't get any ice. 

We LOVED the salsa that comes with the chips. Just the right blend of flavors and quite unique. It was also nice to have the different sauce bottles of varying heat but really not necessary as we are now addicted to their salsa. We tried five different tacos with mixed reviews. The chicken and the lamb were good, the veggie and the beef were okay and the fish was awful - very fishy tasting. It said it was snapper on the menu but I have never tasted such fishy snapper. My sister had the veggie burro and that was pretty good. The side of rice was so-so but the beans were great. We also had the prickly pear sorbet with berries and liked it.

The owner?/manager was quite friendly as was the staff. This is just a preliminary review as this was our first visit. Since we just bought a house in the neighborhood, I'm sure we'll try them again - if only for the salsa and the beans!
