I ended up at Tequila Taqueria while attending an event in Bally's.  We were meeting up with a couple of friends for dinner and they had a hankering for Tex-Mex.  Tequila Taqueria was conveniently located near the ballroom/convention area.  They're right next to Buca, and seem to share some facilities - one of the glasses we got actually had the Buca logo on it.

Unfortunately, the location was one of the only things going for it.  The food was underwhelming.  Nachos came out in a small mountain and looked pretty cool, but were pretty average.  The chicken tacos were pretty dry and didn't have any accompaniments, though the seasoning on them was nice.

Service wasn't the best.  It wasn't crowded at all, but our waitress seemed to disappear after taking our orders and was missing for long periods of time.  Adequate if you really need some Tex-Mex, but there are probably better options around.
