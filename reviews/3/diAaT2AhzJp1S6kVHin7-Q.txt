I've driven by this Filibertos many many times, considering I live right around the corner.  I finally got around to stopping in.

At first, it looks like a mexican sonic.  seriously.  they have a walk up window, a drive through, and some tables outside to eat at.  I checked out the menu, and decided that I wanted the breakfast burrito...the Macaba or something...I got mine with shredded beef.  Holy crap was this thing big!  HUGE!  It was only $4 after tax, and I was STUFFED.  Plus, they made it while I waited in my car, so it was fresh.

I really liked it here.  I like thier menu and they have lots of options.  Prices are great, and I really feel like you get a lot of food for very reasonable prices.  No, this place is not fancy, and its basically drive through Mexican, but its tasty, and very filling.
