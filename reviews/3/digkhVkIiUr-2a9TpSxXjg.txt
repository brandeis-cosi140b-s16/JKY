I really love Del Taco and will continue to go to them in the future. This review may seem trifle but maybe it will help out. I love their Steak Asada Tacos, and I especially love them because they add a slice of lime! Yum! Every other DT I go to adds the slice of lime.   This location on Serene use to, and now I have to ask for it. But every time I ask, they don't add it. 

Sorry to sound like a such a complainer over something so small, but I've given them every chance. C'mon guys! I know you're awesome and the staff is great. That's why I love to come here :)
