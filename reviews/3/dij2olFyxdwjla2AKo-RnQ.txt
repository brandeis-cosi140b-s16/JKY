I really liked the look and decor of this restaurant with the bar that has garage doors that open onto the big patio and the separate between bar and dining area. Although, our biggest complaint was that there were three little kids running around the bar. I love kids, but kids in the bar is a personal pet peeve of mine. :-)  I had the pork tacos which were okay, but were very small and the pork would be more flavorful if it was shreaded instead of in large pieces. My friend had the steak tacos and she loved them, but also thought they were too small. We loved the chips, salsa, and guacamole! I also had a rasberry, habanero margarita and it was amazing! Perhaps too spicy for some, but not for me.  Our 3 tiny tacos were $7 and that was from the happy hour menu. The only good deals for happy hour here are that they have a $1 beer and a $2 beer, but neither of us drink beer so sadly I doubt we will venture back.
