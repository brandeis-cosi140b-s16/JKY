I had high expectations for Loco Lime after visiting Kickstand, yet found it to be mediocre. We went for a weekday lunch, so I can't comment on the drinks, although did notice that the daily specials looked pretty good. 

The service was fantastic; we never had to ask for our drinks or tortilla chips to be refilled, the food arrived very quickly, and the checks were taken care of in short order. And prices are reasonable for lunch; when you order off of the "rapido" menu you get a drink with your meal. 

I had the chicken fajitas after smelling an order that an adjacent patron received. Very much looking forward to mowing through an order of the sizzling deliciousness, the actual meat/veggies lacked a bit in flavor, as did the rice, refried beans and guacamole. Overall I would say that this was an efficient lunch, but not the best in terms of the actual food consumed. 

I would definitely go back to Loco Lime for appetizers and drinks, but for dinner I'd bop right over to Kickstand for food that never disappoints. Parking was not a problem for lunch, but definitely can be around dinner time with Kickstand sharing the lot.
