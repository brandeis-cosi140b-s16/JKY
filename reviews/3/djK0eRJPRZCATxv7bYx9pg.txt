The food is really good but I am really tired of having the same problems every time I go.  I have allergies and cannot have any tortillas and every time I explain, #1 They cannot hear me because of the very tall glass that is VERY inconvenient, #2. It is like I am ordering the strangest thing, they don't seem to get it when all the similar restaurants have bowls available, #3. They're very inconsistent with the amount of meat they'll give you and #4. They do not know how to price it! I have paid $4.00 and change up to $9.00 and change, it is always different.  This is my issue with Cafe Rio, I dislike the ordering my bowl very very much. Terrible customer service.  Please Cafe Rio create one new menu item called BOWL and train your employees about the portions for the meat.  I really have tried it all and it's always different. I would like to be able to just say can I have a bowl, and get rice, beans, meat, lettuce, pico, and a sauce, and the protein portion to be fair. Please consider this request. Otherwise, I like the food and it has good prices.
