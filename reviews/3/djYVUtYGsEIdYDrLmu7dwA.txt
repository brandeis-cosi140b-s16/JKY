Nice ambiance, great service.  Interesting drink menu with a good variety of flavors.  Guac made at the table and queso - good starters.  Ordered fajitas and chimi steak burrito--well presented and ok/good.  Not an inexpensive place, a little on the pricey side given flavors and quality.  Overall ok, but, prefer the flavors I get at La Unica in Huntersville better at around 50-60% of the price.
