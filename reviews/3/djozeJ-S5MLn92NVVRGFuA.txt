The walk in has enough room for a party of 15 or so to congregate and the wood finish throughout the restaurant makes you feel a little cozy.  Since I was just a party of one, I sat at the bar, and was served by a very friendly bartender.  I was able to watch ESPN and keep up on my football talk.  You get corn chips and 3 different salsa types- I tried the green tomatilo which was very tasty a very mild salsa, and the red salsa which had a little bit of heat but I didn't touch the browner looking salsa. For my meal, I got the Yucatan Shrimp Fajitas, it was as sweet savory BBQ shrimp.  I had the lunch special version so my size was smaller.  I didn't mind that but they kept the amount of green pepper and onions at the same amount as the smaller version.  Instead of a tortilla, I used the lettuce wrap which allowed me to have a fresh taste.  I also substituted the beans(rice?) with their Spinach casserole, which was a creamy fabulous mix!  I enjoyed the meal but it was a little pricy.  It was a good treat for me.
