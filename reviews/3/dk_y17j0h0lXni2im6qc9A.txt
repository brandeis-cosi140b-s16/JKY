Yes , it is better than other Mexican restaurants in Madison. But please don't expect the most authentic stuff. It's good food, but there isn't so much I can rave about.  OK margarita, ok tacos  - the meats on the tacos were little on the dry side, and I wished they had more homemade salsa rather than the bottled hot sauce.  Good volume on plates.
