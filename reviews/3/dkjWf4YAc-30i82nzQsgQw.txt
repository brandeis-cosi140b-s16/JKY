I really like Qdoba Grill. For those who have not been to Qdoba before, the concept is similar to Chipotle. Burritos, Salads, Quesadillas, Tacos, Nachos. Select your item, pick a meat, select from an "assembly line" of ingredients. The ingredients are flavorful and fresh and I've never been disappointed with a meal from here. Great for a quick lunch or dinner. 

My favorites are:

Naked Burrito - just means it comes in a bowl without the tortilla
Queso Burrito - perfect medicine for a hangover
Grilled Chicken Taco Salad - sans the crunchy tortilla bowl

Favorite ingredients are:

Blackbeans - protein rich goodness
Corn Salsa
Pico de Gallo - fat free low cal volume

This particular location is ok. I've been to a few other locations and the staff is more friendly and "giving" on the portions, but overall this is a good location. Typically I come here for lunch so realistically the portions they are providing for LUNCH are sufficient.
