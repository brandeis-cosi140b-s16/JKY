I find coming here risky because I never know if this is the time the food will be good or bad. Tonight it was good. I've been coming to this restaurant for the last 30 years, but it seems this seesaw has been going on for the last 15. I'm promising myself that I will check in here consistently so maybe I can try to figure out what is causing the inconsistency in food quality.
