I have been to this location before and it was much better than this time. We got a trio of dips with tortilla chips.The Guacamole was sub par. The service was slow with getting our drinks and cornbread, especially since we got there at 4:30pm and the restaurant wasn't that full. The rest of the meal was really tasty and the overall dining experience was good.
