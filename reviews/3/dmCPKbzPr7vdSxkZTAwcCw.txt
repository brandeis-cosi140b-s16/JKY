I can't exactly explain why Verde only gets 3 starts, but it's not really a place that you want to come back to.  I've been there twice, and likely won't return.

My ceviche was good, but was somewhat heavily spiced, taking away the freshness which is critical to a good ceviche.  My fish tacos weren't bad, but were almost flavorless.  The guacamole which our table started with was good, but nothing special.

Not sure what's off about this place, but it could be much better.
