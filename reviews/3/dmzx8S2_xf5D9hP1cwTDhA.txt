Stopped in on a Sunday for an early lunch before we went to watch the DBacks get hammered (another story).  The food was good (very consistent anytime we go in).  I was surprised it took so long for our food to get to us with getting there so early in the day (11:15).  But we ordered their Guac Live and that was enough to tide us over until our food arrived.  Our server was very nice and took good care of us!
