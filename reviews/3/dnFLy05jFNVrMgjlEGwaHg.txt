Second time at Cabo in Charlotte.  Food is pretty good; good selection of brews, not such a good selection of wines.  Most disappointing is that they did not have corn tortillas!  Not even the chips with the corn salsa were all corn.  One in our party is gluten sensitive and we were sure that choosing a mexican theme would be a sure bet for corn tortillas.  Guac was over smooth, but fairly tasty.
