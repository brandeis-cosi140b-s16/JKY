If you like carne asada, I mean if you really like carne asada, this place is definitely worth checking out. If you like a variety to choose from, maybe not.

The menu is a little limited with the main dishes being carne asada taco, burrito, tostada (Vampiro) and quesadilla. They do have one vegetarian dish and, of course, chips and salsa.

Now for the good news. The carne asada is pretty good. I tried the Vampiro and the quesadilla. Both were very tasty. Some people have mentioned that the chips and salsa are extra, but most counter service places I've been to charge for chips and salsa. It's worth it. The chips are fresh and the salsa is not particularly hot but has a great flavor.

It's definitely worth a try, especially if you like carne asada.
