Came Friday night about 9pm & was immediately seated.Waiter soon after took our drink order.
Chips, Bean Dip & 2 side salsas arrived shortly thereafter. Chips were warm, crispy & fresh. I know some have complained  about the chips but ours was very fresh & warm. Bean dip was awesome as others have raved. Especially when dipped into the guacamole like salsa, which was very good. The other salsa (red) was somewhat watery & too mild. 
I love breakfast regardless of time of day, so ordered Chorizo con Huevos & wife ordered the special Lobster seafood Enchiladas. Both orders came with rice & beans and Chorizo came with tortillas.
Chorizo was cooked the way I like & tasted ok but lacked that reddish residue oil which would have greatly improved taste & moisture? Wife's Lobster enchiladas was great. She would order same again. 
Beans were ok but better after adding some salsa. Rice was tasteless, bland & watery, like it was re-steamed? but better than dry undercooked rice like some restaurants serve. Again better when sprinkled with salsa. Flour Tortillas were wax paper like & thin similar to those low fat tortillas?

Service was great! Waiter continuously returned to check on us.

Would be 4 stars if not for the negatives listed above.

We would definitely return again. Especially since they are open 24/7 & food is good.

Understood, is that, everyone has their own taste! And everyone's comments, including mine, are therefore subjective.
