This is like 2 3/4 stars..

The food was good. I had a chicken burrito and the place reminded me alot of chipotle which I like.  In fact, I think the idea was kind of lifted from chipotle.  But the burrito was very good.  I of course love burritos so I am not that picky.  

I did not like the fact that they nickel and dimed you for extras.  I dont understand why places do that nowadays. If it matters that much raise the price 75 cents and say put anything you want in it.  If you have a bunch of choices and they are making the burrito in front of you and you are choosing all the options then nickel and diming is a good way to turn away alot of people.  Especially when you have Jersey Mikes the greatest sub chain in history right next door.

would go back but just because Im a sucker for burritos.
