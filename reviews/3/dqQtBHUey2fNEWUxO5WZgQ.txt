I really think this place is A-OK food wise.  I ordered the Chorizo tacos.  Now I love my Mexican food, and these were pretty close to authentic.  I was pleasantly surprised!   Can't beat the outdoor deck upstairs and the open windows on the main level during warmer days.  Overall, a great addition to Walnut Street.
