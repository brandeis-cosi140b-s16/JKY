One of our close family friends loves this restaurant and will celebrate her Birthday and other special family events here throughout the year.

It's a decent place to take your family for dinner or lunch.  Since they know our friends well, we get great service every time.  The Cheese Crisps and Beef Burritos are pretty good....as a matter of fact, this is where I had my first Cheese Crisp ever a few years ago.  The complimentary Chips & Salsa is ok.  The Salsa is very mild, you have to request a spicy one if that's your deal....I ask every time.

If you're in the area, it's not a bad choice for a family night out.
