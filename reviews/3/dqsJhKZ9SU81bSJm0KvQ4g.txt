Definitely a place for take-out rather than dine-in, Chico's is not a chain as at least once recent reviewer has stated.  It is family-owned and non-franchise.  I highly recommend ordering the following:  ranchero-style carne asada burrito fixed enchilada-style.  It's deliciously saucy, not on the menu, and the only thing I'm interested in at Chico's.  It should make your day (or at least your lunch).  One last piece of advice:  Unless your in a pinch, don't bother with the breakfast burritos.
