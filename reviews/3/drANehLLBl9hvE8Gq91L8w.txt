The Oakland Mad Mex is by far my favorite.  It looks different than the others, a little dingy, but in a good way.  I've had their shrimp fajitas, which are solid, but usually I get the buffalo chicken tacos that come with fries.  It's not astonishingly tasty, but sometimes my taste buds just crave it.  Solid beer selection as well.
