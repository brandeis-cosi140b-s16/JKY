Decent lunch and quick bite kind of spot.  It's a chain that's consistent with their food.  Had the chicken and sofritas burrito bowl, quite tasty.  It's nice to be able to customize your meal and change it up from time to time.  This particular one is super busy during lunch time, pretty long lines.  Make sure you account for that if you're going during that time.
