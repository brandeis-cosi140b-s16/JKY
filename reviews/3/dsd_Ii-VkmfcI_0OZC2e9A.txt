This place has come a long way.  When it first opened it was hit or miss for both food and service.  However, for the past 6 months or so it has made a dramatic improvement.  The food is fresh and tasty.   I love the twist to Mexican food in some of their dishes such the vegetarian dishes which I often crave.  Also, they have a variety of good desserts, some of which are unusual and not found in other Mexican restaurants in the area (i.e.: tres leches and churros).
I did have a mishap a few weeks ago where I found a rock in my re-fried beans which almost chipped my tooth!!!  I advised the owner of my incident and he apologized and said that their beans are made fresh from dried beans and their last batch had quite a few stones in them.  Then he went back to the kitchen and came back with the beans and some small rocks among them.  I guess that is understandable but I told him they need to pick those beans better because someone can lose a tooth or worse.  Yikes!  But hey, at least their food is not canned and full of preservatives.  I really do appreciate that!  Overall, good food and good service.
