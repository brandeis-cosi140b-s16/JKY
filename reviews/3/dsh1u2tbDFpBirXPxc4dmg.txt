This Chipotle has not very nice service at all! We've had a now few unpleasant experiences so I thought I'd review after this last one. It makes me want to drive a few miles further to Grayhawk! I know they try to be all fast, but then it just makes you feel rushed and like your inconveniencing them. It's quite uncomfortable. If I ask for corn and then request just a little more she then dumped a whole full spoonful on and just looked at me. I felt like saying no start over but didn't want to be that customer. Anytime I ask for extra lettuce they act like I asked to barrow $100 bucks! And if I'm ordering for 4-5 people which I usually am for my family I get 3 different people what on this!!??? What on that!!?? Beef or chicken!!!??? This 1 or that 1!!?? Gosh 1 at a time please it's just so overwhelming! And please get your portions down! Some are generous with the meat and some put like a tablespoon!!! Come on!!!  The service is not friendly and its a bummer because I love they're food, but gosh they need to train the employees some customer service isn't that what it's about pleasing your customers....
