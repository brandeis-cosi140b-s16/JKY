Ahh, Chipotle, a college kid's dream: cheap, copious amounts of Mexican food that is actually very good for being mass produced. You can get what you want, it's good for gluten intolerant people like me because I can get a few different things, and this Chipotle in particular is in a really convenient location; it's across the parking lot from a super target, and there's a self serve yogurt place nearby, so you can get dessert! YAY! 

Alright, here's my "beef" with Chipotle.. HAHA! See what I did there? (I am so unfunny...) In my honest opinion, it's inconsistent. There have been times I've eaten there and my tacos or salad are perfect and I have a really good experience there. Then there are times where the rice wasn't salted correctly or something, I have no idea what happened, but all I know is when I took a bite of rice I immediately spit it out because it was so over salted. Really, it was crunchy because there was so much salt in it. Same goes for their proteins. I try to switch it up between barbacoa, chicken, and carnitas, and with each there has been at least one occurrence where it was way too salty and I couldn't eat it. Maybe I'm just being a the kind of customer that restaurants hate, but if a place has had multiple occasions where the food is so salty it can't be eaten, then they're going to start having some serious problems.
My only other issue is there's one guy who works there who I think is trying to flirt with me, so he way overfills my tacos or salad with whatever protein I get. It's a tad suggestive, don't you think? 

I'm not saying I hate Chipotle at all, in fact, I really like the concept that you can get whatever you want, at a good price, and you know that they're using quality ingredients. They're just really big fans of salt.
