Been here probably one hundred times over several years; review is a bit tardy. The food is very good. The restaurant is a shameful dump. Money has been invested in the new location and it looks nice. A very small investment to fix the bathrooms, paint and decrepit floor would provide a more enjoyable place to sit down and eat; as such, orders are always to go and it's a three star rating.
**"best mexican food", etc. is a tired, overused cliche in Arizona. More specifically, there are VERY few dishes that one would exert extra effort/distance to enjoy. The chorizo, egg, potato burro is one of those dishes, second only to St. Mary's (Tucson) carne seca, egg, potato burro.
