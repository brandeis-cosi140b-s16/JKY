Qdoba--fresh Mexican fast. Great concept, midding to good execution. Walking in, you notice the almost relaxing colors, good atmosphere, and usually a long line to order. Located right near the fountain in Stonecrest, it's a superb location. I've tried both the salad and nachos here. The salad was okay, but they drenched it in beans. Beans, beans, beans! Too many beans! Ugh, kind of ruined it for me. I really enjoyed it when I had it in New York. The nachos were pretty good, although there needed to be more chips for the amount of food they put on the plate.

Overall, it's A-OK, not great, but not bad. I would definitely make this a monthly stop for lunch.
