The roomie drags me to Hard Rock to check out the new poker room.  Haven't been to HR in several months - a frickin' nightmare trying to figure out where to park ( finally opted for valet )

after a few hours of craps and poker ( wtf is the deal with paying a $1 to change out one of your hole cards ?!?! ), we opt on some din-din at Pink Taco.  I seem to recall eating at a pink taco in Scottsdale, i assume related.

order a hornitos margie on the rocks ( $9.50 ) carnitas platter ( i believe $15 ) guacamole ($7 ).  roomie gets the shrimp taco platter $12.75

the chips with the 2 salsas - decent.  the guac - ehhh, a little strong on onion but ok.  The carnitas were good - i prefer carnitas that is simply the salty  roasted pork  variety with no sauce and then i'll add the salsa when i rolled it up in the tortilla.  this had a sauce and the pork was in chunks as opposed to shredded.  it was still tasty.

the shrimp tacos - very average.  coated shrimp, a little too greasy.

overall, i liked the place.  if i'm in the HR and want a quick bite, this place is worth a visit.

total bill ( incl 2 margies and a virgin strawberry daiquiri for the roomie ) 

$61
