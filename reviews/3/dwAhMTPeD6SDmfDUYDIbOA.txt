The guacamole is not fresh/homemade. The rest if the food was pretty good. My hubby got the prime steak fajitas and said it was alright, pretty good. We loved the margaritas we ordered with a small corona bottle in it! Yum. Our waitress was flighty and slow. The atmosphere was fun. The chairs are. It very comfortable. Overall we might be coming back but won't be broke hearted if we don't. Ole!
