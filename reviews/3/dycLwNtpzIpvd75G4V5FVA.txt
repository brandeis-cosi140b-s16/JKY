It's a great neighborhood hang out spot for Friday or Saturday night if you don't want to drive out to Snottsdale or down to Westgate. It's the west valleys version of Cocomo Joe's, but substitute bad karoake for Cocomo's usually good cover bands. They do serve food, but it's par. But who really goes there to eat. The outdoor patio bar and indoor bar is where you will find all the regulars.
