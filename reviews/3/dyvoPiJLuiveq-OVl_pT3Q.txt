Had the chicken burrito with beans/rice on the side.  Nothing to write home about but it was OK.  A little dry.  What was a little off-putting is that I heard her microwaving food (there wasn't anyone else in there but me so it was for my order) so part, if not all, of my meal was microwaved.

Can't say I would make the stop here again, too many really great Mexican places in the east valley.
