Took a friend from Canada here last night.  When we arrived, there was no line, and no hostess.  There was another woman employee on her cell phone, texting. After waiting for 4 or 5 minutes without being acknowledged, I asked the woman if we could seat ourselves.  She sneered "no" and continued texting.  Another very nice waitress came over and eventually got us situated at a little table on the patio. Service was good from then on, food was fine, drinks were fine.  A-ok.
