The saving grace of my visit to Blanca was my waitress, Charlotte.  She was wonderful and made my layover (after a long us airways delay) more pleasant.  She and the other waitstaff were seemingly the hardest workers at this business.  The kitchen closed early (15 minutes early) despite managers being onsite- lazy!!!  Charlotte brought me chips and salsa as I didn't want a heavy, gluten filled burrito.  She offered to have me to talk with a manager, but she did more than enough to make up for the restaurant not serving over half the menu 15 minutes before closing. Sit in her section if you are stuck sky harbor.
