Went here the other day for a chimi and a marg. One of my friends had recommended it as being a little better than most "border food" places.  I have to say, I was walking in expecting very little. Every bible belt fatty from the midwest was there, acting like white trash, mispronouncing every word on the menu. I'm sure you can picture the type I'm trying to describe. I made my way to the bar and watched the baseball game during lunch, even though it wasn't on when I came in. The bartender was extremely accommodating and the service was great from start to finish. I ordered the green chili chimi and it was actually much, much, better than I had expected. I actually enjoyed the dish. The margarita was weak, and wouldn't recommend that, but the food and service here are actually pretty good. Take it for what it is though, as it is still greasy, heavy, border food.
