We went here for dinner this weekend for something quick and easy before going out of the evening. The food is  over priced and not great Mexican food at all. I got a burrito with steak and it just wasn't good at all... My girlfriend got the fajita and I would recommend that dish over my burrito. I would go back and try the fajitas next time, but wouldn't go out of my way.
