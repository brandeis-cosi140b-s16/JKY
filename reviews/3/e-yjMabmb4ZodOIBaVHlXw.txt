The salad is super tasty. Actually one of the better tasting salads I've gotten here recently -- which is the only reason I gave it a rating as high as I did -- but it's very small and skimpy.

The person behind the counter -- I didn't catch his name, sadly -- only gave my girlfriend a normal amount of rice/beans on her veggie salad (which comes with 2x rice and 2x beans) after she asked three times. When it came to my salad, he refused to give me much rice, even when I said no beans, on my pork salad. And the pork was about a third of the normal amount. He looked very irritated with both of us and apparently just wanted us to leave.

My tortilla is also undercooked and damp, and the hot sauce selection was also pretty bare.  And as always, the water tastes like Ajax.


Overall: not a very good experience.
Still tasty, though, because cafe rio is awesome. That rice-and-beanless goon, though, really ruined my experience.

If I see him working next time I'm in, I'm going to the Chinese place next door.


Edit: I finished my salad, and I'm still hungry.
