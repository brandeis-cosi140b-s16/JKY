My husband and I wanted to stay in Mandalay Bay for dinner before watching Michael Jackson One. We wanted a somewhat quick sit down dinner. Border Grill seemed to have the highest reviews and only $$.

Chips and 3 types of salsa: the chips were too salty for our liking, maybe it was just our batch?
Guacamole: Amazing! Worth the $9
Plantain empanadas: Comes with 4, very delicious, not as sweet as you'd think, which I loved!
Green corn tamales: A must get before your entree!
Chicken poblano enchiladas: Just like the chips, they were so salty. Sips of water between bites were needed.

If you plan to watch Michael Jackson One, Border Grill provides a dinner package with show tickets. $42/person for a first, second, third course and dessert and discounted show tickets. My husband and I weren't too hungry so we decided not to take advantage of the package. But I think it's totally worth it!
