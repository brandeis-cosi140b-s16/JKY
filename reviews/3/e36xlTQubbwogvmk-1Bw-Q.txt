I am a big advocate of Dos Gringos actually but this Dos I cannot get into.  I loved the original Tempe location when it was on University, I used to go there all the time.  I love the Scottsdale location, but ever since they built this location a few years back, it's kind of like a pushover for me.  Yeah they serve the same booze, and food, and the decor is the same, but the vibe of this place isn't right.  Maybe because it's too big and they let too many riff raff's in, I really can't put my hand on it.  The only thing that really saves this place is the .50 cent coronas and well drinks on Thursday nights.  Shit I'm not even sure if they still do that anymore since it has been at least 8 months since I have been there and I don't feel as though I am missing out on anything.  I would never make plans to go here but if I was invited to go out there with a group of friends, I would just have to suck and up and go.
