Great place to go for happy hour specials. Cabo serves up a great happy hour menu from 4-6 pm seven days a week. My favorite item is the 12oz bud draft for 99 cents. They have bud light, lime or wheat as well. I prefer a craft beer most of the time but for the price, it's a good deal and I like beer, period. They have a pretty extensive hh menu, most of which I haven't tried. The shrimp cocktail is decent and has been voted "Best of Las Vegas" in recent years. That doesn't hold much water for me personally, but to each her own. They offer ceviche, cheese quesadilla, beef taco, bean tostada and an 8oz mojito all for 99 cents. They have about six items for $2.99 and $3.99 too. I can't vouch for any of these offerings as I usually drink the bud and then order off the regular menu.

The last two times I've been here, Dena has served me. She is great at her job! Always friendly and quick with a smile. We can be pretty demanding at times and Dena takes it all in stride. She takes notes, which I dig because I almost never order a meal straight from the menu. I usually add or subtract items and I always want something on the side. The food usually comes out to my specifications and when it doesn't, she is quick to please and remedy the situation. 

I don't recommend driving across town to frequent this location but if you find yourself in the vicinity it's a pretty good stop. Standard "Vegas Mexican" food and rock bottom happy hour prices. Ya dig?
