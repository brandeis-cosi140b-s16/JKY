A surprising little find at McCarran International  when I was agonizing over waking up at 4.30 to catch a 7am flight. 

Tofu breakfast Tacos....yes....not on the menu but ask for it. With a greasy ranchero sauce and a flour burrito wrapped around the grilled soft tofu this was uplifting in the morning. I had cheese on mine (oh my) but you could easily veganize this without. 

I thought that was as lucky as I could have gotten...and then I tried their Medium Red Salsa (note: they have a pretty decent salsa bar). Heaven on earth. The combination of the tofu taco and the salsa set the tone for my gastronomical adventure on the trip to come. I also needed a pack of gum right after.

Their menu of tacos/burritos/bowls is extensive and there are many veggie options that include tofu. The people working here were very sweet and helpful. Note that the taco I had was rather greasy and I didn't necessarily like that part of it. 

Considering the airport generally sucks for any meal option for the vegetarian/vegan, 360 definitely helps even out the equilibrium. In relation to other airport establishments I'd give 360 a 5 star review. But in relation to other restaurants, 360 would have to get a 3. 

I have to say that my tofu breakfast taco with a Caramel Macchiato from Starbucks made this flight a lot more bearable. 

(360 is located near the B gates - Southwest)
