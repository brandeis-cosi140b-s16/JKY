So Ive been chatting with MJ K. for a while now.. we both have certain alignments that we instantly could relate with one another.. tacos, eating and yelping! 

So we decided to meet at Susie's Cafe for a bite and some chat action. Well this is one of those places.. decent Mexican food at decent prices. Now the problem with that is that there are loads of other places that taste better and are cheaper.. this leaves Susie's it's location value. I was amazed to see so many people coming and going from this place, seems very popular with the locals. Plus if you order a lunch special, 6.95 and up, you can add a draft beer for $.01! Now that's a real bargain!

The pozole was great! Nice thick pieces of meaty pork, nice sides too, though what's up with the lemons? Also order a red chile burro and a beef taco.. the taco came sitting on lettuce, hot food and lettuce, come on! Took one bite, yeah, not so much, oily and flavorless. Now onto the burrito, acceptable. Now I haven't had any decent red chile in some time so being acceptable is a pretty good thing!

Was the food enough to get me to come back.. not really, this visit was all about the conversations! I hoped this place would be better but it just wasn't. Am I saying I would go back, no, I would since they make a pretty mean bowl of posole.. I'm such a glutton for good soup!
