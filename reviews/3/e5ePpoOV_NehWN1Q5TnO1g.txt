I really like Chipotle and my experience eating at other Chipotle restaurants is usually well. 

This location just opened up near my school which I THOUGHT was very convenient especially since I can order off my phone and select a time to pick it up...

So today a group of classmates and I ordered food for pick up and selected pick up time for 1:30. It was ready as soon as we got there which was good. So we sat down ready to eat. I ordered a burrito bowl with brown rice, no beans, fajitas, chicken, corn salsa, fresh tomato salsa, sour cream, cheese and guac. My classmate ordered a chicken bowl with brown rice, black beans, corn salsa, fresh tomato salsa, sour cream, cheese & lettuce. Whoever made our order got it completely wrote. My bowl not only had beans in it but it had both pinto & black. Ummm.. Wtf?! Also it didn't have the fajitas. My classmates bowl had what seemed to be my missing fajitas but his bowl had no beans. So I'm guessing whoever made our bowls wasn't paying attention to what he or she was doing. Whatever. Easy mistake when it's busy right? Although I've been to busier Chipotles and have never had my order messed up.

Anyways, we realized our bowls were wrong & immediately brought them up to the front. The girl at the cash register was extremely rude. Clearly she was ignoring us as we stood in front of her for a good 2 minutes and she not once acknowledged us until I said EXCUSE ME. When I told her our bowls were messed up she sighed and rolled her eyes. Great customer service! NOT! She told one of her coworkers who came to help us. She was very nice & right away made is new bowls in the correct way. As for that other girl, learn to have some customer service!! 

Aside from the messed up order and rude employee the place is clean. There's plenty of places to sit inside & out. It's a chipotle so it gets busy during lunch. The shopping area in general is always busy.
