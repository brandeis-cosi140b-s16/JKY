The chips are awesome.  That said, the food is ok... but the chips are awesome!  Went for lunch.  The burrito was ok but just ordinary, nothing special.  The taco salad again good, but nothing special.  Did I mention the chips?  The chips and the green salsa were great.  The chips were a bit thicker than normal, so they had a great 'meaty' crunch.  That probably doesn't make much sense, oh well.  The service was also great.  I think the best bet for lunch is on Tuesdays.  They have $2 tacos on Tuesdays.  A couple tacos along with the chips and salsa... yep sounds good!
