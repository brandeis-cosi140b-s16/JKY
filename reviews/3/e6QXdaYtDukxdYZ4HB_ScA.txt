I'd love to give this place a 5 star rating. The food was delicious.  I had chilaquiles with Carne Asada that was amazing. The black beans were maybe the best I ever had.  We had a guacamole appetizer which was fresh and tasty. The store bought chips accompanying them were a bit of a disappointment though. My dining companion had enchiladas which were quite tasty. 

The restaurant itself is in a strip mall.  It's not fancy but if the food is good, who cares. And the food was good. The service was also good.  Our waiter was attentive and professional.  So why three stars? There,was only one other table occupied during out dinner time (not good for them at 7:00 on a Saturday evening).  The patrons appeared to be somehow related to the restaurant. They had an army of children - ok 4 children - young, loud and hyperactive.  They were running around, screaming, crying, yelling, playing, did I mention running.  I like kids, I really do, but not while they're seriously disruptive and loud. This was not Chucky Cheese. The waiter merely shrugged his shoulders when we commented on the kids and their hyperactivity annoyance. 

I'd love to go back to Escobar to try more of the menu.   But I will peek in the window first and the family of kids is there I will go someplace else.  5 stars for the food. 1 Star for ambience.
