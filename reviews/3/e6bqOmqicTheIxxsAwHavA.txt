In the mood for some fast Mexican food, taco shop style then this joint will satisfy your craving.

They have a large menu so be prepared to stand and stare at it for a moment as they have everything from huevos rancheros, nachos, taquitos, tortas, burritos, enchiladas, chimichangas, tacos and everything else in between!

This visit I ordered a chicken chimichanga, which was loaded with thick melted cheese. It was delicious, they give you a side of sour cream and green chile sauce to layer on top. Also on the side was rice and beans to complete the meal.

My friend ordered the carne asada nachos which was good.

Very friendly service is a staple here.

It is good enough to satisfy your fast food Mexican craving.
