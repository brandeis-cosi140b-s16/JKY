This place doesn't open until 11 am and is closed on Sundays. On the door, it states the place is closed on Sundays so the restaurant can be with their family. Guess they don't want business on Sundays. The food is good, but prices are on the high end. The service is nothing special. There are a few lunch specials which are price reasonable. No salsa bar. Salsa is in plastic bottles on each table.
