I got a special of 3 al pastor tacos + drink for $3.99 The tacos aren't the big kind, more the "street taco" size. The meat was okay, but needed more of that pastor seasoning to me. Still, I couldn't beat my $4 lunch and it was walking distance from work. They gave me a coupon for 2 free tacos w/ next purchase. It'll come in handy for my work lunch. 

If you're here already and hungry, it might not be a bad choice, but it's not some place I'd drive out for (I'd say a drive to Sahara to Los Parados is worth it) . I'd have to try more on the menu to spot out if there's any stars in the bunch, but what I've got so far is just A-OK. Cheap, filled me up, convenient. 

Just a note- I couldn't check in...the map is wrong. This is in the Wal-Mart shopping center.
