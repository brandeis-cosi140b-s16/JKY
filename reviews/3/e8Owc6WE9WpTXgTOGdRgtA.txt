El Encanto Dos is A~Ok if your in the area looking for a good place to eat.  This is the little sister restaurant of the El Encanto in Cave Creek.  There are subtle differences in their food between restaurants but this location is pretty good and it's easier for us to get to from the I17.

We love the ambiance of this restaurant especially their patio.  If given the option and weather permitting, I recommend dinning on their patio.  They have a wonderful fire place on their patio and they have heaters for when it gets colder.  On some weekend nights they have the most wonderful guitar player playing while you dine.  It's cool to see some of the local's ride their horses to the restaurant and tie them to the post surrounding the parking lot.

We always have good service but then again I'm not afraid to say something when their service is slow.  They always acknowledge when they are slow and make amends to step up their service to ensure your dinning experience is exceptional. 

Their queso and spinach con queso are some what average, but their salsa and chips are good and a nice start to your dinner. Their taquitos are a bit dry, but then again I've never had a taquitos that wasn't dry, and comes with a wonderful chipotle salsa for dipping. You can't go wrong with their Seafood enchiladas, any of their enchiladas either pollo or steak smothered in their homemade Mole sauce, red or green chili sauces. Their fajitas are also good either steak or pollo. Their Pescado Enpapelado and carnitas poblano relleno are ok but don't plan to order them any time soon.

This is a good place to go with the family and friends if your in the area.
