Came here for dinner on Friday night.  The Yard was packed and very lively with games and live music - great atmosphere.  Culinary Dropout would have seated us in 20 minutes, but Barrio had tables open right away.  We chose Barrio, but I think it was a bad sign that it was only 1/3 full. 

The service was good and timely, but the food was not so great.  The beef in my tacos was tough with lots of gristle, and the tacos were bland.  I could have easily made better at home.  They get 3 stars because the Margarita was quite tasty.
