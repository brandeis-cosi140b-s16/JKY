While certainly not an authentic Mexican eatery, the food is consistent and decent.  The Fish tacos is what they are good at and what I enjoy the most.  They always come with a good portion of grilled or fried fish, cabbage, pico de gallo and avocado slices.  If this chain ever comes to Honolulu they better use fresh fesh!  Wahoos is ok and Tacos del Mar so and so, Maui tacos is hopeless, sorry it is what it is, and I know what I like. 

What sets Baja Fresh apart from the other fast food "kinda Mexican" food places like Wahoo or Tacos del Mar is the salsa bar, it is  well organized/displayed with 3-4 kinds of salsas, mild, hot, dark roasted and the  (pineapple salsa is amazing by the way) and there is also pico de gallo, lime slices, cilantro, onions and sliced jalapeno peppers.  It's always nice to have a few more extras in your meal and try out new flavor combinations.
