This place is right across the street from the Hilton Garden Inn where we stayed during our spring training visit to Scottsdale.  After breakfast at the hotel one morning we decided to try this place out the next morning.  We sat on the patio which was very nice, with a small fountain adding to the ambiance.  I had a basic day starter of poached eggs, toast, bacon, and potatoes (house specialty potatoes cooked w/rosemary) all for $7.50.  My fiance had turkey and avocado eggs Benedict and was very pleased.   The waiter was on top of things but it took quite a while for our food to come even though there were only about 4 other parties there when we sat down (and the restaurant is quite large).  I have only had breakfast here so I can't comment about their lunch, dinner, happy hour service.  our bill ended up about the same amount as having the breakfast buffet at the hotel but the atmosphere and open seating was definitely more appealing than loud hotel patrons on a Saturday morning.
