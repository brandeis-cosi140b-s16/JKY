I've been to Chino a couple times now and there are a couple things I love.  First, the Jade Chicken quesadilla is amazing... for some reason the flavors just work.  Second, this past time I had the pork fried rice, which was great and the snickerdoodle cookies... YUM! 

For what it's worth, this place is good.  If you want a nice fatty meal in a no fuss way, hit up chino bandido, you won't be disapointed.
