My family have been going to Matador since before my parents were born! LOL! it's the truth! It used be the smallest little hole in the wall and is now a great place to eat when downtown.

It can be a bee-yotch in a half to find a parking space on the street so I always head straight for the garage. When you enter the doors, it's a large place from another time.

And this is so because this place hasn't been redecorated since before I was born! I admit it's not the chicist place, but then again, pretentious places suck! But if you go, I insist on a booth near the window! It's a great feeling, so just sit and relax in the indirect light and munch on the free chips and salsa (which is BEST when the two salsas are mixed together with a light dash of salt! I prefer two parts mild to one part hot!)  cuz well... it might be a while before your server will come to take ur order!

The service isn't the greatest and I don't recommend going when in a rush. I particularlly like the combination dinner. You can any three out of several items with rice & beans. My fav is two beef tacos, cheese enchilada w/ rice & beans. :) Sometimes when i'm the mood for something different, I get the Greek Gyro platter! it's AMAZING!! I've only had gyros in two places, so i'm no inficianado, but it's still good!! 

I'd go in the late afternoon and early evening when it's not so busy. Avoid the lunchtime rush. Mix ur salsas and enjoy!!
