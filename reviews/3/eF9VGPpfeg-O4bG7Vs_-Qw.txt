Our food here was pretty good but the service could use some work. Our waitress came around maybe 2 times and we had to ask for refills, chips, lime.. Things like that. My daughter spilled her drink on the table and I was cleaning it up with some napkins and the waitress did not offer a rag or to help clean it up.

Cons: the food could use some salt, more flavor overall.The service could be better, our shrimp cocktail didn't have enough shrimp .

Pros: salsa and chips were great! My San Diego tostada was good  and so was the red snapper! 

I won't be going out of way to eat here but not bad.
