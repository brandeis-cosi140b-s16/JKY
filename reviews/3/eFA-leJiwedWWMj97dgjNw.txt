Redeemed a couple of free fish taco coupons I was given at the Yelp event held here a couple of years ago (?).  Was told they were for the Alaskan pollock- the same ones we were given at the party.  While I waited for these to be prepared, I realized I don't like the atmosphere indoors, as it felt too fast-foodish for me, and yes, I realize that I am writing a review on Rubio's... I guess dining al fresco is the way to go when you're here.  Should I ever go back, I will choose outdoor dining, or just go for takeout and head to a nearby bar with a better selection of beers and wine and better atmosphere, as well.

Oh, and I liked the beer-battered pollock with the greens and signature "white sauce" on flour tortillas.  Just wished each taco came with more than just the one lime wedge-- I need more acid to cut through the grease!

FYI, I was told by a Mexican coworker, who used to work at Rubio's many, many years ago, that the beans' side dish is well-prepared here, for those who are health-conscious.  It isn't refried in lard like in other places.  I can't say I've tried it in recent times, so I can't comment on it any further-- just passing on what she told me.
