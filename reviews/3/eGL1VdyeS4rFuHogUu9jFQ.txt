I like Sandbar. There wasn't a cover for ladies this particular visit, which was good.  My friends claimed a table by the time we showed up, one with a perfect view of the small dance floor.  I highly recommend staking out a spot there--it's quite entertaining to watch inebriated individuals shake it like there's no tomorrow. The music is decent; pretty standard for a bar. 

The service is fast and the bartenders are friendly. The waitress was very attentive and consistently refilled my diet coke.  Our shots arrived in record time. 

Did I mention there's sand by the outside bar?  Just don't take off your shoes; I cringe when I think of the lurking shards of glass from an accidental broken bottle.
