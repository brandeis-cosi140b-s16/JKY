Breakfast burrito for the second day in a row. They are great!!!!!  I have been to Mixteca before this is my first review for it. I hate to beat a dead horse but I need a half star. Burrito was great but no better than the one I had yesterday at big burrito. The only difference was the ambiance is much nicer at Mixteca although the salsa isn't nearly as good. If big burrito was a nicer location I would rate it higher than Mixteca and vice versa if the food were better at Mixteca I would rate it higher. So as far as breakfast burros go it's a tie.
