Only one person waiting tables. Gives our drinks then runs away instead of asking to take our order. Wait 10 more minutes as she keeps walking by us without looking or stopping. It's not just this time it's always like this. Usually don't mind too much but don't have time today to be waiting. Food is ok, prices ok. Just need more help.
