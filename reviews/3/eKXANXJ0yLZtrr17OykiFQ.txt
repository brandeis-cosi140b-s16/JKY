I love avocados, but after eating a ton of this goodness with this restaurant's delicious, made at your table guacamole, seeing a thick slice of fatty avocado on top of every other part of my meal was a bit overmuch. 

But get the guacamole. The spinach enchiladas were also good, if very cheesy. The black beans were a little salty.

The corn fritters were talked up by our server, but they didn't really deliver, and I'm unsure I would serve them as a desert. The peach dessert was much better, probably because we are in Cackalack while they are in season!

The service was outgoing and friendly, helpful and quick to attention. Good service.

This is Mexican that is supposedly fancified, but it seems mostly you're just paying more for stuff that seems to be modestly better than the cheap, gut-busting stuff. Try it for yourself, but I'm going to keep lookin!
