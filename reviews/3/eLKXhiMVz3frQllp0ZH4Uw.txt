If you're drunk and looking for a cheap late night booze soaker, this is the place! In my last Felipito's quest I order a cheese quesadilla and a carne asada burrito. The quesadilla was everything it should have been, crazy huge, greasy and satisfying. Now the carne asada burrito, well, the first bite was good until you realize the meat is laden with gristle, connective tissue and well to make a short story even shorter, after 2 bites I threw it out. 

Props for speedy service and the hot gooey cheese quesadilla!
