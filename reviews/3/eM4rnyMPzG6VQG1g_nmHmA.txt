I dined here for lunch today.  The environment was friendly and there was a nice man who was bussing the tables and greeting people as they came in the restaurant.  It was my first time so the way the line worked was kind of confusing.  I got a steak burrito.  I was surprised that they don't offer to put lettuce and different toppings inside your burrito it was just the beans rice cheese and meat.  They do offer lettuce and pico on the side however I prefer that inside!  For this - I probably will stay loyal to Chipotle but I'm glad I tried it!
