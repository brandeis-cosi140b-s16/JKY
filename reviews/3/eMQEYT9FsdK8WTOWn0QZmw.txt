Where did my burros go? Gone is the grilled fish burrito as is the bean burrito, leaving me with nothing but a grilled veggie burrito option. 

One of the nice things is the  chips given after ordering, giving one something to snack  on before your food is ready.

Also new is a "Seasonal Salsa"  This month it was cranberry salsa, it was different and not bad.

It can get a bit busy here but they seem to have a good handle on the rush. My one issue is you can not see the menu board from where the line is. This must slow down some people as it slowed me down.

If you love salsa and work near by or have a 2 for 1 coupon like we did give it a whirl. 

If a shaking floor bothers you get a to go order, I was surprised how much our seats shook as the train passed by.

** quick update all of that great salsa was only on loan. 4 hrs late it was all gone tanks to some food Bourne illness.***
