It satisfied its purpose. 

We had a reservation for New Years, the place was swamped. There was six of us and we each had different dishes. 


We ordered guacamole, and chips and salsa to start off. The salsa was really good and gave us time to check out the menu. 

We had ordered drinks which took around 15-20 minutes to arrive. They were simple drinks; beer, vodka soda, gin soda, etcetera. 

The server said he'd explain the menu eventually but never really got around to it. 

I ordered chilaquiles and added chicken to them (which is very common in the original dish), the chicken came separate and seemed to have been dipped in oil. I still threw it on the hot pan that contained the chilaquiles and mixed them together (which should've been done in the kitchen, I think), and proceeded to eat. They were okay, nothing remarkable. 

At the end, we got the check all together for the group. I guess the rush did let the server have separate tabs(?).  Surprisingly, they had already added the "gratuity" in the check and the server forgot to mention it. 


Once again, this was during New Years Eve. May be a single occasion but I still would have expected more at a restaurant inside a casino.
