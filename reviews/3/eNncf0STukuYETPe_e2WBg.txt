Yet another restaurant that started with much too high of expectations. I heard from the construction boys that this was the best place in town. I mean, they really hyped it up! But I forgot that it was what it is- fast food. Good fast food? sure. But quick, and greasy! I'm not completely against grease by any means. I love their baby banditos. those little tiny morsels of goodness dipped in that butter... stuff... mm mm mm.. And the horchata.. very tasty. That is a good breakfast for me and I have enjoyed it on numerous occasions. But to tell you the truth, if it weren't for that butter stuff and their clever way of making tiny chimichangas and naming them banditos I wouldn't see much more in this place than I would in your typical albertos, filibertos, juanbertos, carlosbertos.. and all those other berto joints. All good, sure. But don't expect to feel your best after devouring, and also don't expect top of the line ingredients. So I may stop here again, if I find myself wandering in my old hood.. but as long as I'm over here in downtown, I will stick to the selection here.
