I hadn't been to Blue Burrito in years, not since it was the cool place to go before you went to a movie at Shea 14 in high school! I wanted to grab a quick lunch today to take back to the office, and while Chipotle is closer to my office, I just wasn't in the mood. I ordered the beef taquito and chicken soft taco combo, which came with a side of rice and beans. I waited less than 5 minutes until my order was ready, neatly packaged with salsa and chips thrown in as well. 

I really liked the taquitos, they were still hot and were delicious dipped into the cool sour cream and guacamole that they came with. I am not normally a chicken taco kind of gal, but I found this chicken to be wonderful. It was grilled chicken, but it was very moist, not dry like you may find at other places. I just ate the chicken out of the tortilla, but I am sure it would b good wrapped in the blue (get it?) corn tortillas that it was intended for as well. 

I normally am not a rice eater, but for some reason, this rice looked really good, and it was! It was tender and moist, but not greasy a all. I actually didn't even try the beans...I just went for the rice...weird!! 

I sampled 3 of the 4 salsas that were offered, and none of them really had much flavor. They either just tasted like tomatoes or were just hot, so the salsa was definitely a disappointment. I will give them a nod for keeping their chips warm in a chip warmer, you don't see that too often. 

My meal was cheap, coming in at under $8.00. I liked the food that I had, but the menu didn't knock my socks off....I think when it comes to fresh Mex, the number one for me is still Rubio's! (Crispy shrimp season is my weakness!)
