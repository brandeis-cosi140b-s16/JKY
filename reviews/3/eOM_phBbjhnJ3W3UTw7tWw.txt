Decent food, service was OK.  Let me rephrase that, the waitress that waited on us was nice and very attentive. We had a party of 8 for my dads 70th birthday party and I made reservations for 6, my party was late so the hostess informed me that they only hold the table for fifteen minutes... understandable but she was just rude about it. I also brought a birthday cake with me and the actually charge an additional $10 to bring your own, crazy!

The food was alright, I had the beef enchiladas and it was good, the rice and beans were kind if bland. 
Meal was $13
Gratuity for party of 8 %18

The part that makes the whole place worth while is the location, right beside the magical forest and there is balcony seating the is out on the patio. The ambiance is nice.
