Chuy's has multiple locations throughout the valley and their food is consistently good tex/mex cuisine.  On my last visit, I ordered the grilled Mahi plate, which came with 4 good sized chunks of fish, 3 corn tortilla shells and plenty of rice and beans.

They have a help yourself salsa bar, with plenty of salsa options, as well as pickled vegetables, and a huge bucket of warm tortilla chips.  Chuy's is one of those places where you order at the counter, pay, and then some random employee drops the food off at your numbered table when ready.

The beer is always cold and the food and drink inexpensive, making Chuy's a great stop for a budget friendly meal where you don't compromise on taste.
