Was pleasantly surprised at the food here, seeing the place otherwise seems about as authentic as...well, as anything else in Vegas I guess.

Shared the fajitas which came on a sizzle plate with all the sides for us to build ourselves and the meat was nice and tasty, and the sides plentiful. Staff were nice enough, prices reasonable, and all in all not a bad place to stop for a quick bite on the strip.
