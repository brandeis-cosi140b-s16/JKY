Where can you get a cheese enchilada at 10:30pm in Phoenix that won't make you sick? Rolberto's! My teenage son lives on these.

Walk up or drive thru. The staff is friendly - even when I paid in change! and the place is clean enough. (I checked the inspections when it seemed this was becoming a routine.) 

If the drive thru is taking a bit longer than it should, it's because the vehicle in front of you is paying for the #3 in nickels, dimes and quarters (bus fare).
