I enjoy their South of the Border nachos. For 6.99 you get a half order and it is enough for two people! I always need help finishing them, since they are piled high with yummy ingredients such as beef or chicken, guac and sour cream, cheese, pico, and more cheese! I also enjoy their assortment of cerviches! The enchiladas are all delicious, you will have a hard time choosing one. The tacos are good, and the barbacoa is divine!
