I just want to preface this review by pointing out that I'm talking about Canteen at night instead of Canteen during the day. I do have every intention of seeing what it's like when it isn't being another Mill Ave club, but that's a review for another day.

Canteen just really isn't my scene. The music's a touch too loud inside, so it's impossible to hear anyone speak. And the whole $10 card minimum sucks if all you want is a shot. And, to be completely honest, I prefer the patio to the inside of the bar. 

Which isn't to say that Canteen's a bad place. Their margaritas are delicious and while $9 is a little much to pay for a shot of Patron, it also isn't the most I've paid for one.
