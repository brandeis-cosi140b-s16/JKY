I'd been wanting to try this place for a while and I have to say while it was good, it wasnt' what I had envisioned. First, I loved the music selection. All of Vicente's greatest hits. The sign near the ladies room said they have karaoke on sat. nights. I ordered menudo and I don't th ink I'd order it again. It had onion?? who puts onions in menudo? My bf ordered chilaquiles and they were good. gotta say. He also ordered a gordita which fell into last place. The salsa was def. not my favorite. WAAY too much onion and salsa at room temp not the greatest. If it had been a tad bit colder it would have tasted better. I'll definitely go back for a huarache or try their flautas, but definitely ask what has onions and what doesnt.
