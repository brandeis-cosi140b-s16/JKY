Great food, sometimes service is like a beating when they are busy, but that's part of the charm. 

Management- it's been about 4 months since your crappy ice dropper has stopped working consistently. Second visit that I have had no ice in my warm dr pepper. I'm sure your volume is in the neighborhood of 3 million. Cough it up for a new ice dropper for 4k. Part of guest service is the passive service too, ice falls into this category.
