Thought I would give it a try after finding it on yelp.  The first good sign is seeing a big lunch time crowd, nice outside seating area and clean restaurant.  I ordered the #5 chicken taco combo plate, which is my mexican food staple.  Good looking salsa bar and the food was ready quick.  It seemed to be a little pricey for this type of place (8.50) but the combo plate was ample.  One pet peeve I have is no chips to go along with the great salsa bar, a la chipotle.  The food was good, not great.  However, based on the large crowd, maybe I missed something on the menu that is obviously bringing the people in.
