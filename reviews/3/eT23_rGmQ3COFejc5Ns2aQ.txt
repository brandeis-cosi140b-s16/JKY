The service was excellent, the staff was very friendly and the food was fresh. I had a vegetarian burrito and my wife had a chicken enchilada but she hated it. This is authentic mexican food and probably appreciated by those looking for real Mexican spices and herbs and not American Mexican food like taco bell or del taco. Still not the best Mexican food I ever had but it's up there
