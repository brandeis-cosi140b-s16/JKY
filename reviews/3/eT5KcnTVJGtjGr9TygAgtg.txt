We had a big work group get together here for happy hour. It was okay - we went on a Tuesday and got the awesome Taco Tuesday prices (most tacos are $2 each, a few specialty ones are $3, and house margs are $4) but the service was pretty blah. Our actual waitress was very attentive but the hostess was absolutely clueless about our reservation, which I had confirmed, and she seemed annoyed/frazzled about getting our table together. A few of us went early and had a few drinks at the bar, which was not busy, but the bar tender was hard to flag down and painfully slow. 

It wasn't a bad experience but it wasn't good either. It was too hot to go outside so we didn't get to hang out on the sand, which made Sandbar become just another subpar Mexican place.
