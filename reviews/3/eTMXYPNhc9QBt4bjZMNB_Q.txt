Jalapeno Inferno is good for what it is which is a place that sells good but basic Mexican food in a nice setting in the Marketplace in DC Ranch.  The atmosphere, especially, the outdoor seating is very nice.  The food is solid Mexican-American staples - tacos, burritos, etc.  

The service was good and the wait staff was friendly and anticipated our needs.  Nice job on that.

The only down side to this place is the lack of plain iced tea.  I really do not understand the trend of only serving iced tea that has crappy added flavors (is citrus an adult flavor or is it a category of fruit?  honestly, citrus is a kook aid flavor).  Please get some regular iced tea.  Not everyone wants tea that has a flavor sprayed on it at the factory.
