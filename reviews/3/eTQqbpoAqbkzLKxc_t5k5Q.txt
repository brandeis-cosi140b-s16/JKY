Came with with my girlfriend and our dogs, as there is a large dog-friendly patio.  I loved the location & look of this fun, festive, trendy lil spot. The music was great, lots of Dr. Dre, Snoop, & a whole bunch of other 1990's rap that made me feel like it was 1996 all over again.  

Now, the food itself was not super impressive, but there were some items that really stood out.  Personally, I would suggest the chilled ahi-stack,  the cheese y mas, and the Mexican street corn.  As far as drinks, I would go with the frangelico horchata as opposed to a margarita. Pretty good service too.  I'll update review once I try a few more dinner dishes.
