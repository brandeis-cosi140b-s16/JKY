I have been here a number of times and have never had an issue.  But today I said I need to write a review. 

I normally get 2 Del Beefy Burrito's and the are rally good and worth the 2 for $5.  Tonight i ordered just one and it was $3.49 for a single and was lackluster. I felt like I was being ripped off, I have had bean tacos with more beef then this thing. If i wanted a tortilla I would have ordered that.  

Not sure if its just the crew but this guy was disappointed by the food and the 10 min wait for FAST food.
