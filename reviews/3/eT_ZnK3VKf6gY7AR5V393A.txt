We got a craving in the middle of the night only Filiberto's could satisfy.

All I wanted was chips and salsa. Filiberto's chunky salsa is the bomb. My boyfriend went through the drive-thru. Now, I don't think he told them what kind of salsa I wanted, so I can't really complain that I got pico de gallo.. well, okay, wtf, why does Filibertos, at all their locations, make pico de gallo the default salsa? Is there anyone who actually eats chips and pico de gallo??

Whatever though. I like pico de gallo too, just not as much as regular salsa. I decide to eat it anyway. It turns out that the ratio of onions to tomato is something like 10:1. It was basically a cup of raw onions. :(

what are you doing, filly b's?
