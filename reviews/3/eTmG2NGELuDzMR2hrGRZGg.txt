This is authentic and it is pretty decent for Gringos.

They have a great lunch special, four soft tacos with your choice of any meat, pork or chicken, served with rice and beans, and a medium drink for $6.99.

I got one for each of my home remodeling crew, who all happen to be from Mexico, and they all agreed "it was authentic". 

They also feature a full menu of other authentic Mexican foods you won't find at a Taco Bell, Del Taco, or other Gringo places pretending to be Mexican. 

I ate dinner there and ordered the four taco plate combo, with a Chile Relano entree. Filled me up and pleased my taste buds.

My helper had the four taco plate, and he pronounced it "real Mexican". 

It gets 3 stars, and not 4, because it is a simple eatery with a drive through, not a place with atmosphere. Also, the salsa bar lacked raddishes, onions, cilentro, and other delights you find in an authentic Mexican place.

None the less, great place for lunch or quick dinner, and a great value for the quality.
