This place has decent food, nothing to rave about, but good.... okay, okay I have to keep it real, every once in a while I absolutely crave the bean dip and margaritas lol

The service is okay, if you are in the neighborhood and have a taste for Mexican food I would suggest giving them a try (otherwise just go straight to the good stuff at Agave in Summerlin)
