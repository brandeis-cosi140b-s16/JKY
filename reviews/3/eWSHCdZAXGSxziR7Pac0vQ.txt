Went in for lunch with a sales guy around 11:15.  2 for 1 drinks starting at noon supposedly, but our server gave us 2 when we ordered 1. No complaints there. I had been here for the opening, which was pure chaos, but it was free, so I can't complain that much. We got in, sat outside, where they have to scan your ID and make you sign a waiver in case you drunkenly, or due to inner ear malfunction, fall in the pool, they are not liable. We ordered chips and salsa, which were not impressive.  I ordered the number 4 which seemed like it was going to be a lot of food, but was just about the right amount of food for lunch. Service was good until the end of the meal, our server got seated with a table of 7, or so she kept saying, and we sat for 12 minutes waiting to get our check with the credit card on the table. I think this is more of a place for people watching, and I think there were a lot of people filtering in for that same reason. Food is eh, portions are small, and prices are high. Welcome to North Scottsdale.
