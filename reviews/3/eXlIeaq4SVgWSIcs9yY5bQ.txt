Wednesday before Thanksgiving - packed. At first I thought it was going to be difficult as the waiter (server? - I gotta get the PC verbiage right) seemed a little high-strung. However, as the meal progressed he definitely became much more personable.

I like the simplicity of the menu and the simplicity of the preparations. I had the fish tacos - it was a little strange that the two tacos came in separate tin foil packages on the plate....did they steam them that way, or simply prepare them and then put them in there to keep them warm? A tad disconcerting. However, they were good - the fish was flavorful - I just would have liked a little more of whatever was on the fish inside the tacos-was it sauce? Was it avocado? Was it sour cream or crema? No idea, but just a smidge more would have been good. The rice that came with it was so good I actually ate it....which I normally don't do with "regular" mexican rice. Had a smidge of a sweetness to counterbalance the savory.  It also came with black beans. I confess I didn't try them because I was full. The portions are not huge - which I find to be a good thing - they're just right.

The chips are light.....not all that flavorful but fine. They are accompanied by 3 different salsas which are also fine. We ordered guacamole and it could have used a bit more flavor as well.

The desserts are absolutely worth ordering. The fried cinnamon ice cream is the clear winner. Seriously - corn flakes on the outside forming the nice, warm crunch through to the cold cinnamon inside was amazing. The flan was good. The chocolate tamale with mint chocolate chip ice cream was good for a choco-holic but if you're not that, go with the fried ice cream.

I'll come back when I'm in town with the folks again if they want Mexican food....
