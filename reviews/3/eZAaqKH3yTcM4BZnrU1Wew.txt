Review for happy hour....I was surprised I liked this place as much as I did.  Maybe it was the margaritas talking as they were tasty and I think only $3.  

We were in a group of 12 people and of course all of us wanted separate checks.  I always feel awkward when asking for a separate check but when asked, our server did not blink and was really nice the entire 3 hours that we were there. I think the request is common as it is a place that seems to cater to large parties.  

The place is loud, filled with tacky decorations, tables and chairs that wobble, but I would recommend if you are in the mood to meet a group of friends for  drinks and socializing.
