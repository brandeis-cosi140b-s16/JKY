I may be a bit spoiled by my "home" taqueria (Taco Rico in Lafayette, Indiana), but I was a bit disappointed. We weren't offered water to drink, nor chips and salsa. The prices were also higher than I expected for a $ listing. On the plus side, the food was tasty and plentiful, and the service staff quick. Worth stopping by if you're in the neighborhood, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back.
