Monday half off (jalapeno) margaritas - yes please. 
Blackened fish taco - just aiite. 
Table side guac - tasty and plentiful.

Service was fantastic, prices were reasonable, atmosphere looked like it could get pretty lively in the evening (just not on a Monday night), and the menu was large. 

I'm what I'd like to call, a fish taco connoisseur. These Southern California raised taste buds are very discerning when it comes to fish tacos. The fish tacos here, weren't anything to write home about. Not very flavorful, uneven blend of sauce and shredded cabbage on a piece of fish that wasn't optimally cooked. On the plus side, you can get the fish blackened or fried, which gives you the option of healthier or heart attack. It all comes with rice and beans, so the possibility of getting very full is great. Of course, if you finish all your beans, you better be going home alone or with someone who loves you very much. 

I could be back for drinks and apps, maybe even a veggie chimichanga, if the mood strikes.
