Gonzalez y Gonzalez is a reasonable place to get some of the standard Mexican fare that you'd expect from a restaurant in a big hotel on the strip.  In other words, it's convenient but a bit overpriced and underspiced.  I live in a small city in Maine and it's crazy that I can get better Mexican food at home than I can in Las Vegas.

Two stars for the food and prices, four stars for the service and convenience.  Yeah, I guess it's okay but there must be better places to get Mexican food outside of the hotels.
