Had the carne adovada plate which was good but needed a bit of salt. My friend had the veggie enchiladas that he said were very good. Now let's talk about the inside waterfall! We were sat right next to it, which means we were in a spotlight. It's a little sad looking and was foaming. The fake fern plant was backwards and looked a little decrepit. Our night also started with the hostess sitting us and then five minutes later coming up and saying she made a mistake and asked us to get up. She did buy us our first round of drinks though. We then got placed next to the waterfall in the spotlight. It took the waitress about 7 minutes to come greet us at the table after we were sat at the correct one. All in all though, we did have a great night. The food was decent, but the company was better.
