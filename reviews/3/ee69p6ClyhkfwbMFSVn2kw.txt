Mi Patio is a solid 3 star restaurant. Some days the food tastes better than others. And some days the entertainment value is better than others. But it's not a chain, it's within walking distance and has very affordable margaritas.

There's no bike rack (ugh) and the taquitos are basically a carne asada taco with no toppings (which I happen to like).
