This is a tough one for me...my husband loves this place, I hate this place.

He raves about the fish and shrimp tacos, especially the blackened fish - those are his favorites.

I tried the beef taco and chile relleno.  Completely flavorless beef that I am convinced had been a hamburger right up until I ordered the taco - it was in big gray chunks.  Relleno was so loaded with seeds I couldn't eat it and it ended up in the garbage.

I will give it another try at some point because he likes the tacos so much.  Pretty cheap too.
