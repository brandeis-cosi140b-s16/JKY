I have to admit that I was a little confused coming out of the Blue Adobe. I may have set my expectations too high but delicious, authentic Mexican this was not. Their building reminds me of an old fast food seafood chain, and the servers seemed to be in their own worlds. I couldn't get an answer to "what would you recommend?" so I went with, "What are the most popular dishes?". First the positive - great fresh brewed iced tea, complimentary fire roasted salsa was delicious, the portions are HUGE, daily specials, and a fully stocked bar. The not so great...the oil. I ordered Shrimp Rellenos which was recommended as the best on the menu. What I got was two partially deep fried peppers dripping with oil and cheese with sporadic chunks of shrimp. Unfortunately, my husband wasn't anymore pleased with his meal. He had the Carne Adovada. The red chili adobo was super moist full of slow cooker awesomess but the green chili was very dry.  Wouldn't go back but, based on the ratings, I could have hit them on a bad day.
