Thanks to Groupon I found this place.  It's relatively new to Old Town, just opening around a year ago (guess)?  Anyway, I've been meaning to try it, but until the Groupon deal came out, I just didn't seem to find time to do so.  

I like Q'doba restaurant...very familiar.  We ordered:

Chicken Burrito

Chips

When you come here, you have to have their Queso in your Burrito....so I ordered mine with the Queso.  It's soooo good and addicting.  The Chips are ok...what more could you ask from Chips, right?

The employees who work here are friendly and got our order right.  Since they're in Old Town, they have a lot of competition for food joints.  I hope they make it.
