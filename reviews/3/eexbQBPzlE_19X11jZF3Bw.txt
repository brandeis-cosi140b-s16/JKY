I LOVE the CRAZY CHICKEN, this location is my fav because its on my own from the gym.  Fast and "HEALTHY", it is healthy depending on what your order consist of.  New remodeled (restaurant and employees), service is fast, employees are nice. 

This location gets 4stars for cleanliness (that includes the outside of the restaurant as well as the bathrooms) it's rare to go to a place 2hrs before closing and the bathrooms are clean.  I appreciate that, what more can I say? Its El POLLO LOCO

I order the same every time I go: 3 wings and a Loco Salad w/ flour tortillas (don't judge me I need the carbs) nothing out of the ordinary but I like it better than the fried chicken places
