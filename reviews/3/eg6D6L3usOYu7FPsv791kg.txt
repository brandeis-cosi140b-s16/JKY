Tried Roberto's for breakfast this weekend and wasn't let down. Had a bacon egg and cheese burrito which also included some breakfast potatoes. The tortilla was excellent, and it was freshly made. I wish the potatoes would be cooked a little more but it was a solid breakfast burrito and i'll be back to try more from the menu.
