Salty is "fine."  It's a good happy hour standby that my co-workers and I keep in rotation, due to the location, atmosphere, and great outdoor patio.  I rarely (if ever) order food there, but it's pretty hard to screw up a Corona and lime.  Service can be spotty but the laid-back vibe and good crowds make up for it.  It's just easy.
