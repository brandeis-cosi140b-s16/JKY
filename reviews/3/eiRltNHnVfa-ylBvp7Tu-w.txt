Definitely not traditional Mexican food but more a Twisty fashion of Mexican dishes. The drinks and margaritas are very delicious and the atmosphere especially sitting outside on the terrace is very nice and relaxing. 

The food is just okay to me. There really isn't anything spicy which is what I look forward to when it comes to Mexican food. If you eat outside during the spring the weather feels great but your food will be cold by the second bite.  The staff is very friendly but a little spacey when it comes to you asking for things or serving your food.  I would prefer to come for drinks and maybe chips and salsa. Not necessarily a big fan of the menu.
