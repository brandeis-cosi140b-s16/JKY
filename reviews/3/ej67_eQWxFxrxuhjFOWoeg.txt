Just aye okay in my proverbial book. And honestly just barely that. 

My book that already tried the adobada, asada, camarón*, carnitas, pollo and the horchata at Taco Y Taco. 

*Dollar up-charge means it will be 50% than a regular taco

Maybe I am getting too old, and less hip, and more intolerant for tomfuckery. 

Ordering model is fucking ridiculous. All restaurants I have experienced in Mejico were sit-down, so I am uncertain if doing it in such a chaotic way is keeping it authentic. If it is, they should stop. If it is not, they should definitely abandon it. (Make it historical.)

To add an anecdotal regarding ordering:
I asked this female employee for a camarón taco. It was in her section. Then, the dude that was preparing some of my other tacos in another section asked her. When I reached her a second time (Note: no one else was ordering from her at the time), she had not made it, or thought about making it, and imagined she would be making it in the near-future. I had to practically plead with her a third/fourth fucking time to prepare me a goddamn taco. Seriously?

How one orders is not the only absurdity at Taco Y Taco. The music is blaring so goddamn loud -- not to mention their choice of what to play is obnoxious -- one would think that one was at the food village of a fucking major music festival and not a restaurant in Henderson. Nevada. (Turn that shit down.)

And the food: it is merely "A.OK." Vastly overrated by the looks of the average rating for this place. 

Rating: "A-OK[,]" although barely that.
