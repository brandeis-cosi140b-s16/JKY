2nd Time here, first was great food and drinks, 2nd time I wasn't as impressed, although my parents swear by the camerones Mexicano, which in my opinion was bland and an eye sore. The staff seemed unorganized and a bit lazy. The dishes aren't as well put together as they should be. The steak on the fajitas was a little tough.
