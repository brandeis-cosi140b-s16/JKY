This place is hit or miss. I've had good service, mediocre service, and just bad service. Tonight was pretty bad. I ordered 3 things, a bowl, a burrito, and a cheese quesadilla. I asked for just a little rice in the burrito, they put in a ton, when I said it was too much I got a crazy look from the person making my food. Whatever, I can get over that. What put me over the edge, was they got my daughter's order wrong, and this after waiting too long for it, (this was a to go order, couldn't just bring it back) . I ordered her a cheese quesadilla. I got chicken, ya I know seems silly right, but my daughter is 5, she is like every 5 year old.... Picky! She was a good sport and tried to eat it, but evidently ended up picking out the chicken. The 3 stars are for the food,  taste is consistent as usual.... If it were just based on the service tonight , this would be a 1 star review.
