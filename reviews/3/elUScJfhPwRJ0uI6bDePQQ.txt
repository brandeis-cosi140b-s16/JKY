Sabor's been on my list for awhile, and a coworker and I popped in for lunch on a Taco Tuesday. It's a good thing we got there early (11:35ish) because by noon, there was a line out the door. We stood in line for longer than I wanted considering there were only 3 parties ahead of us, but the staff was really nice.

I got two tacos auntenticos (one al pastor pork and one grilled chicken) with a side of chips and guac and a water for less than $10. Score! The al pastor was definitely the better of the two, but both taco shells were a little chewy. Eh. The chips and guac were good, and I really loved the salsa bar - how fun!

My coworker got the quinoa avocado bowl, which she said was good, but something in the air made her eyes water the entire time we were there! Maybe we were too close to the spicy salsa bar?

Anyway, I loved the atmosphere - so colorful and casual and the music made me feel like I was on a beach vacation. I just wish the food had lived up to my expectations. But at least it was cheap!
