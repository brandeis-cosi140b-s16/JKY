Needing a place to eat inside New York, New York this seemed like an appropriate choice that could satisfy the tastes and budgets of the group. It did turn out to be a very expensive meal anyhow but I will admit that is mostly due to our need to buy many delicious margaritas and someone else's need to get souvenir cups. Be forewarned though my most delicious margarita was 16$ and so tasty I had to have two. It did come with a very unique lemon lime salt on the rim that kept me perplexed the entire time. My server was also kind enough to bring us to go cups when we were finished eating and not quite finished our drinks which is something I truly love about Vegas. Everyone seemed pretty happy with their meals, but disappointed that this place charged extra for chips and salsa causing us to go without. I had the tableside guacamole as an appetizer which was pretty big and I was unable to finish it. It was reasonable at 9$ and made the same as at other similar places which offer this, consisted of 1 and a half avocados, cilantro, jalepenos, lime, etc. and a huge basket of chips. Others seemed happy sharing a meal of fajitas and were delighted to be given extra tortillas. Service was okay, but did seem like we ended up spending a lot of time here. My favorite part is being able to look through the "windows" and see the New York decor on the "buildings" nearby.
