Fonda Mexicana El Paraiso: A tiny, order and go taqueria with some definitely delicious and affordable options that extend beyond tacos...tortas, salads, fajitas, etc. 

Seating: None, unless you count the five chairs facing the cash register, awaiting food. 

Service: Smiley and helpful. Speaking a bit of espanol helps but probably isn't necessary. 

Food: Al pastor tacos son deliciosos. Perfect amount of onion, cilantro and tender pork. Plus, the tortillas are well-made and surely crafted in house. The barbacoa taco was well flavored, spicy but strangely super duper orange...I ate it anyway. The green salsa is perfection. Get some. 

Beverages: There's a case of everything from juice boxes to bottled water to Jarritos. 

Price: Affordable but not dirt cheap. Surely it depends on what you order...my dining partner ordered up shrimp fajitas which came out in a giant box filled with everything under the sun. That, my friends, is a good value.

Gracias, Fonda Mexicana El Paraiso.
