For a corporate, mall type restaurant, this was surprisingly good. Nothing authentic about it, but the food was good, especially the amazing tortilla soup. 

I especially liked that even though this is a corporate restaurant, it was not a Mexican themed restaurant.  No Mexican music, no waiters in silly costumes, etc.  

Recommended, although any authentic place would definitely have better food at more reasonable prices.
