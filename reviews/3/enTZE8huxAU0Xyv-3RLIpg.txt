Trendy new place in downtown Gilbert, adjacent to the equallty trendy Postino.  Joyride has a good menu, and fresh ingredients.  The carne asada taco is excellent, as well as the fish taco.  

There area couple of reasons why I'm only giving three stars.  First, the atmosphere is trying to be very hip and trendy, which I found a bit of a turnoff.  The servers were friendly enough, but I just personally prefer a cozier ambiance, rather than feeling like I'm in downtown Scottsdale.

Also, I thought the prices were a little high.  They offer an excellent in-house salsa, but offer additional "premium" salsas for an additional charge.  I like trying different salsas, but found my choices to be fairly bland, and not as good as their house salsa.  The tacos are priced ok, though.

Joyride is a decent restaurant, and I'd definitely try it again - but it didn't make me put it on my "must-return" list.
