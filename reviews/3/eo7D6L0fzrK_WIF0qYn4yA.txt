Stopped in to try their tamales. 20 min wait on a Friday night. The ambiance is confusing for a Mexican restaurant. They were playing music from the 50s and they have African safari decor... zebras, elephant, etc. We got seated right around 20 min and I ordered the Mex & Match with the green corn tamale (in husk) with rice & black beans. My friend got the beef tamale so we could try both. The chips & salsa were on point! Didn't take too long to get our food. The green corn tamale had a really good flavor, but I didn't like how big the green chile pieces were and the consistency was more wet than I expected. The beef tamale was very good. Lots of meat inside and the masa wasn't dry at all. Their black beans are seasoned very well. We also got the fried ice cream for dessert. It wasn't a huge portion, which was good. Just a small scoop of ice cream with a yummy fried coating, honey, and tons of whipped cream. There was a lot of whipped cream leftover when we got done with it. Not a bad dinner overall.
