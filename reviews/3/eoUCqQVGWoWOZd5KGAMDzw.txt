There is potential here however there are certainly a number of kinks to work out.
A couple of quick notes:
Great seating options (chef's table, six-tops, patio, booths etc.)
Cool wood work/beam type ceilings.
Nice size portions (I split a chick salad and it was plenty for 2 girls), reasonably priced food and varied menu selections.  Also has a late-night menu (10-1am)
Service staff could use a little more knowledge/urgency.
No Cuervo gold tequila available for margs and were out of ale on tap.
They need to rethink the music.
Need a focal point out on the patio (it's a little dull out there)
Overall, happy to have another option in the neighborhood.
Will give it another try soon!
