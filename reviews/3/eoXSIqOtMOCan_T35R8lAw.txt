If you are looking for authentic, affordable Mexican food El Gran Taco #2 is worth a try. I went in just to check it out since it was hot out and I noticed they had raspadas (snow cones) and ended up getting carne asada tacos too. Tacos were okay. My next trip I ordered a chicharones burrito which is HUGE and only $5.00. Burrito was okay. I have a feeling they have something on the menu that's special, just haven't found it yet. I'll probably get an elote (roasted corn) next time and ask what their best item is. They also have burgers.
