Love the margaritas.

The food is very inconsistent.  Several times when I ordered the chicken fajita burrito, there was barely any chicken.  Very disappointing.  The Monroe Street location used to have a huge problem with consistency of the food at the old location, but cleaned up their act at some point.  It seems that the same problem is back now.

The prices have gone up a lot in recent years. Not much of a value for the food that is served.  A dinner for two with margaritas will top out around $50.  Seems a bit high for average tex-mex.

I hope Pasqual's can step it up a bit.  It's a nice tradition for the Monroe St. neighborhood.  Would hate to see it disappear!
