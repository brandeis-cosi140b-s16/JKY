Good Food At A Reasonable Price.

I haven't visited La Canasta in some time, so I thought today would be a great day ro revisit.  

The food at La Canasta  is consistently good and reasonably priced, especially the lunch specials. Today, I was motivated to write about my dining expeirence because of the great red beef tamale I had for lunch today.  I really enjoy tamales  and I think La Canasta makes great tamales. 

The service at La Canasta is amazing.  Not once did I have to ask for a refill on my soft drink or chips.  The wait staff and servers are very accommodating without being intrusive.

Great food, reasonable prices, and great service.  I need to make La Canasta one of my regular stops.
