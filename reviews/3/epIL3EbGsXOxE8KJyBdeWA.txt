Had some friends in from San Diego in this past weekend and decided it would be a great time to check this place out. We had a party of 11 so it took about 40 minutes to get seated which wasn't bad considering it was a Friday night.. The hostess was as sweet as can be and totally kept us informed about when we would get seated. 

First of all this place is downright gorgeous.. The whole church architecture makes for a great space.  I heard others saying how loud it was but honestly I didn't find it bad.. It was louder than most places but gives it a hip vibe. 

We had a great server.. He was working hard to get all our drinks and food out and kept all our drinks refilled. Took him a while to sort out all the separate checks but considering it was busy and all I totally didn't mind the wait to get the check. 

The menu consisted of pretty much only burritos and gourmet tacos.. Everyone seemed to enjoy them..I had the grilled steak burrito with this really good cajun aioli sauce.. But the side of onion straws it comes with was a definite fail.. No seasoning and mostly crumbs..seems like they could do better than this.. A few complaints about the sides but overall everyone enjoyed it. Price wise it's not cheap for what you get and food wasn't anything mind blowing. 

I don't see myself visiting this place much but if others wanted to go I would go back..maybe they will improve some as they go along.
