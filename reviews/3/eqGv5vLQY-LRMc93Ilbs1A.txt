This is a classic Vegas place, it's been around forever.  This was the first authentic Mexican restaurants I'd ever been to since it was close to my high school.  I remember being freaked out by the appearance of it at first, but really it's pretty good.

As the other reviewer noted, you can get all kinds of traditional Mexican meats that Americans generally don't eat, but don't let that worry you.  Get the carne asada like you had planned, you'll still get carne asada.  It's so yummy.

They ain't the cleanest places, but they sure is tasty.
