Ate here today and I finally decided to write a review.  We eat here quite often and I would love to give this place more stars.  Their salsa and chips are always very good.  However the entrees are hit and miss.  Our favorite is the Pollo Fundido.  Some days the food is cooked perfectly, others not so good.  Today the food was way over cooked, with hard dry tortillas.  There was very little chicken in the filling.  The beans were over cooked as well as the rice. So overall today was a bad day.  Just wish they could be more consistent.
