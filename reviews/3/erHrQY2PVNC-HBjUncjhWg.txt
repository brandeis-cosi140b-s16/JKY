I dont know...if youre just looking for a cheap Mexican inspired meal and a casual patio, its fine. I only give it 3 stars because the warm (thin but not too thin and litely salted) tortilla chips and green & red salsas were EXCELLENT!! Everything else was just ok. The quesadilla was ok, the coconut shrimp were ok, the grilled fish tacos were almost ok, the prickly pear margs were really sweet but ok. The service was ok. An excellent choice for ulyra casual watching sports or after playing sports (some of patio is actually covered in sand) - not great for a business hh with clients in high heels :-/
