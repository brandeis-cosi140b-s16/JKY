Why 3 stars, SERVICE....

The food here is nothing short of AMAZING.  This last visit almost got a 2 star.  We have NEVER been here and had a flawless visit and it all stems to service.

We walked in, there were several open tables but we were told it would be a 15 minute wait after the hostess asked a female server is she would be willing to take our table until another server comes in, she said NO.

So we sat and waited for another server to come in and were taken to the table.  It turned out this booth was right next to a booth this girl who refused to take care of us was taking care of???

ANYONE NEED A JOB, this place needs motivated people to work here because I know of one server who is not motivated.  Every time service has been really slow and the serving staff very lack luster about even working here.  I am not sure why, the food is great, the place is never empty at least when we have been there yet the attitudes are very poor.  

Our server, he was very good and did act like he was concerned about making sure we had a good experience and he did a good job.,

The food is Organic, they have Vegan/vegetarian options and they are open 24/7.  You cannot beat that, fresh, organic, quality food at a really reasonable price, at a sit down place open 24/7.  The only issue is service which the management needs to address.
