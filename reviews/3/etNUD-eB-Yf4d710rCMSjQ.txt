First time here. I had the carne asada fries. The meat had really good flavor but majority of the meat was the fatty chewy pieces. And by that I mean the pierces that you can't even break down because they are so tough. Not trying to sound unreasonable, I know to expect a piece or two to be like that but in my case I had to stop eating, I almost threw up because there was one in almost every bite. I wasted half of my meal. 

 I might try one more time and cross my fingers not too many fatty chewy pieces!! 
On a good note I liked the flavor of the meat and the green chil√© sauce. The place was clean and people were nice.
