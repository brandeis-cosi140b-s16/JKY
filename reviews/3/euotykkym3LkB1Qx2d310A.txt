Dependable, tasty tacos. 

I've only eaten the carne asada and el pastor tacos. But I've had them both a number of times.

The carne asada is served with cilantro, onions, and refried beans. The addition of beans is different for me, but I enjoy them. Those tacos are solid. They are consistently enjoyable. Not earth shattering, but good. 

The al pastor, on the other hand, is a different story. Sometimes it is "good". Tasty and pleasant. But there are times that their al pastor is AMAZING. I don't know what they are doing different on those days, but I plan to find out. I am not a fan of pork, but the taco filled with semi-sweet, perfectly charred tender meat served with pineapple is the best I've had in town. Again, they are not consistently outstanding, but they are always tasty. I would add an extra star if their pastor tacos were more consistent. 

I am a fan of this local joint. Did I mention they have a self-serve bar with grilled onions and jalepenos? Delish.

EDITED TO ADD 
IMPORTANT DISCOVERY: After eating here more than 20 times, I stumbled in a few times before the lunch rush. And guess what? The carne asada was amazing. Like award winning. Come in later (as I often have) and who knows what you'll get  (Ok to delicious fare). But come in around 11:00 AM,  and get ready to be moved. Possibly to tears. If they keep this up i may have to add a star.....
