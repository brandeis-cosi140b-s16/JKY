This is an old stand-by. If I could give 3.5 stars, I'd do that, but it's not quite a 4 in my book. They are solid, consistent, and have friendly service. 

I think the food is good, and there is a lot of it. Tostadas are consistently soggy on the combination plates, which frustrates me a bit, and when guacamole comes as part of a dish, I find the portion to be too small. 

I do appreciate the chips and salsa (although there's never enough salsa and I'm constantly asking for more) without a ridiculous uncharge found at other Mexican restaurants.

I will continue to visit occasionally because it's a quick and uncomplicated in-and-out for lunch at reasonable prices. 

The best thing, though, is taking leftovers home and turning into a scramble or frittata the following morning. SO GOOD!
