Next time I should ask them if they can tone down the chili pepper heat a bit, at least for my order. The White Sands Chimichanga dinner I ordered was tasty, but the heat level was a lot more than I was comfortable with, and I usually enjoy spicy food. It would probably have been a much more enjoyable meal if it weren't partly like torture trying to finish the fiery food. The service was very friendly and attentive, and the place has a nice and informal, if kitschy, look.
