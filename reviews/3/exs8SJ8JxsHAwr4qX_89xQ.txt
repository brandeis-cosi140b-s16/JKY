I have been to this location three times. The first time, I was standing at the counter for a good 10 minutes before anyone came to the register. During a lunch rush or something, I could totally see 10 minutes being reasonable, but there were exactly 2 other people in the dining area besides myself (my fiance, and a young man studying in the corner). When the employee DID finally come to take my order, she seemed annoyed. I put it off as her having a bad day and didn't think anything of it. The second time I was there, I was there with my fiance and daughter. There were only a handful of people sitting in the dining area, an employee with a broom being one of them. The last time I was there, it was near dead... it was about 9:30PM-10:00PM, my fiance and I stood at the counter for only about 5 mins, but the man who took our order was rude, and there were 2 other employees that were too busy flirting to do their job. When I got my burrito, it wasn't wrapped properly resulting in it leaking out all over the wraper it was in. I took a spoon and put the contents of my burrito back in the tortilla and ate it. On top of that, with a near empty dining area, there is no reason for the lids, straws and napkins not to be stocked up. There were only a couple (broken) lids and NO straws. The ONLY reason I didn't go to the employees and give them a piece of my mind was because my daughter was starting to get cranky and wanted to get home and go to sleep. 

I understand that the employees just so happen to be real people, but as an employee you're supposed to keep your personal stuff, and your attitude AT HOME. The employees at this location are very unprofessional and I am thinking very seriously of not choosing Del Taco for a while because of it.

On the bright side, the dining area was very clean and neat.
