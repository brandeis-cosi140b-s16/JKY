Fish Tacos go against everything mi abuelita from East L.A. would have stood for. "Who puts fish in a taco, mi hijo?" she would have said. But sometimes I'm just jonesin' for some I can't help but jump in my car to pick some up (with flour tortillas)
They're just so tasty. 

Other times I'm in the mood for a carne asada quesadilla. The steak is a little dry but it goes well with the sour cream guacamole and pico de gallo that it's served with. I love me some of their roasted chipotle sauce too.

The service here is always friendly and efficient. The parking in the strip mall they're at can be hit or miss but it's worth it.
