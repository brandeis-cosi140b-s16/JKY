Occasionally I have a craving for greasy Mexican food from one of those cheap joints all over town. Even though Filiberto's is less than a mile from me, I go the 3.5 miles to Greenway and the 51 and get two or three ground beef tacos and an order of chips with cheese and salsa, which is HUGE.

Fortunately I don't do this very often or I'd be as big as a house. It's certainly not gourmet Mexican but it's good and cheap and beats the shit out of Taco Hell, and sometimes that's all you need.
