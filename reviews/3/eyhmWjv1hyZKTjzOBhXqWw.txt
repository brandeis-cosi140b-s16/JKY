Service is horrible. Waited over 5 minutes just for our drink order...then had 3 different servers and all of them took forever. Barley got checked on... watch Mexican restaurant doesn't give you free chips and salsa?? Although the guacamole and chips were delicious, they're an extra charge. Food is just ehhh. Got the Carne asada  tacos. They don't even come with Pico de Gallo.... rice was mediocre and beans were delicious. Food is overpriced and service sucks!
