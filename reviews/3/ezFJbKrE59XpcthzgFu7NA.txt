2.5/5 solid stars
I wished I did more research on where to eat before settle down here. 

eh, the food was just OK. I was not very impressed. 

Ordered: 
Grilled Steak Nacho- 3/5 Wow, it looks tasty, but overall it was just OK. The chips were very thin. 
Grilled Chicken Quesadilla-3/5 eh, it was just okay--nothing special.
