This is a busy place with an inexperienced waitstaff. The restaurant is located a pretty good hike from mainstream Scottsdale, so the advantage is little, to no tourists. 

The servers are covering a lot of tables and the menu is extremely broad, maybe too broad for the kitchen. It seems they are Southwest, but there's no rhyme or reason behind the pizza's and other items on the menu. I tried a combo plate and thought this was ok. The tamale was a bit dry but the tenderloin relleno was really good. 

Reasonable prices, good food, ok Ambiance and fair service.
