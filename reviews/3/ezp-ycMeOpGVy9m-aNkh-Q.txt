I love Garduno's in New Mexico, but this location seems to have lost a little something in the process since it's not as good.

The menu is very similar, but the execution of the dishes aren't as good.  I was recently at Garduno's and their carne adovada chimichanga should have been spectacular (as it usually is), but this time it was just good.  The beans and rice were a bit mediocre and the corn cake was pretty disgusting (grainy consistency and way too sweet).  The sopapillas were good as were the chips and salsa (there's a salsa bar too so you can have the chips with a salsa to your liking).

If you are used to amazing New Mexican cuisine, this place may not be the best location to have it.  The food is pretty good, but not great.  I will say that their Sunday brunch is incredible - you get good food AND all-you-can-drink margaritas - pretty awesome!  

The staff and service we received was friendly and very attentive.  I'd definitely go back, but more so for the Sunday brunch rather than the regular menu.
