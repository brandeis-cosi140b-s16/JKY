Honestly, pretty run of the mill Mexican Restaurant.  The veggie fajitas were warm, fresh, tasty, but nothing to really write home about.  Portion sizes were beyond adequate.  Seemed like a nice, casual, fun environment.  The chips were nice and warm, which was a plus.  The salsa was the standard watery roja concoction that is typical of many Mexican restaurants.  Not my personal favorite, but still enjoyable.  Service was good.  

Honestly, I would have liked my food to have had a bit more of a "kick."  Perhaps more garclic, perhaps more spice in general.
