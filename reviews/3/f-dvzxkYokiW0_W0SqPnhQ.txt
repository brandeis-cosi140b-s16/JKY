Have eaten from here twice so far, and enjoyed it both times.  I work at one of the local medical clinics and can't leave the building during my shift, so one of my coworkers was nice enough to go pick it up for me.  Both times I had some combination of tacos and beef burritos, and had the fries once.  Both times, the food was hot and fresh and the taco shells nice and crunchy.  Del Taco is my favorite non-authentic place to get Mexican (Tex Mex / Americanized Mexican) food, and I've been to many of them on several occasions.  For all but one location (not mentioned here), the food is consistently good, and the service is usually faster than their competitors that serve a similar menu.  In all, I expect to eat here many more times in the future given its consistent quality and proximity to my work location.
