This is a favorite restaurant of my daughter who lives nearby.
There were four in our party - the first three were served by a gentleman who was very generous with everything put on their salad including the mahi mahi.
Because they ran out of mahi mahi, I was served by the woman who was cooking it, and she was just as cheap with her servings as her coworker was generous.
I wondered if anyone would notice my small salad when I got to our table, but they were too "into" their delicious meals.
