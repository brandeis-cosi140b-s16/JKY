For mall food, its not bad.

They do have a few different  proteins to choose from... i chose the shredded beef or barbacoa for tacos. The gal gave me about 5 or 6 chips, and let me chose which salsa I would like for them. .. went for the salsa verde. 

I added cilantro, onions, and sour cream to my tacos. Looking back, i wish i would have added more things... like cheese. Because  when i sat down, they were definitely  missing something. The meat was tender...but flavor wise..... it was lacking. 

3 mini tacos and some chips will set you back around $8.
