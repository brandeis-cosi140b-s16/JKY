I went to taco Tueday last night and started off with a house margarita for half price during happy hour. ($4)  It was very fresh and tart you could tell they didnt use sweet and sour, which is a good thing.  I ordered 2 shredded beef tacos and the Guacamole. The apps are half off also during happy hr which is till 6 pm.  The tortilla chips are A-Maz-Ing, delish.. the red salsa is pretty fab too. The guac is a NO WAY JOSE'. Doesn't taste like fresh avocados, tastes like processed green mush. the tacos were decent they come with shredded cabbage, cheese, sour cream and shredded beef for 1.50 each on Tues all night. I prob wont return didnt really make that great of an impression.
