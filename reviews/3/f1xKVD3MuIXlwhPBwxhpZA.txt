This is a Happy Hour with Florentine Nacho Review.

I've been in here a few times in the past & went in today for a quick happy hour snack.  I asked for a menu & the "bartendress" gave me the normal menu.  I had to put in a special request for the happy hour menu.  It wasn't a biggie, but she acted like she was clueless that it was happy hour.

I've tried several "flavors" of their nachos before & most are pretty fucking nasty.  Meats & cheeses turn into pools of grease on your plate.  The only selection I can half way recommend is the Florentine Nachos (grilled chicken, sundried tomato, prosciutto & spinach in a asiago/romano/parmesan sauce over spinach chips.)  Warning...they will turn your #2 an odd green.  So green that you think you may be dying of something.  So far they haven't made me sick...just anticipate a color change in the pot after eating.

It can sometimes be a challenge eating your nachos depending on how they are assembled.  Think of that 80s game Jenga...move the wrong nacho from the pile & you are fucked with bits & pieces of food landing all over the bar counter.

Pretty limited selection of beers on tap, but the Union Jack Pale Ale is served ice cold at $5 a glass.  Much appreciated on a 110+ degree day in the desert.  I may need to be a bit more adventurous & try their other nachos, but every time that I do...I am disappointed.  Have I had better nachos elsewhere?  Hell yes...home for instance, but every now & then, I get a craving for the green ones that make me colorful on the inside.  3 stars for the Florentine nachos & ice cold beer..1-2 stars for their other nacho choices.
