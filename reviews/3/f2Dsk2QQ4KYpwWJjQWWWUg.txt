Went to Gallo Blanco for the first time.  I really love the atmosphere.  The look of the place is great and it is a bonus that it is in a really great hotel.  We went on a Sunday and it was early enough that it was not busy.  We got seated right away and given our menus.  Our waitress was very friendly (it took awhile before we actually got service).  We ordered drinks from the happy hour specials. The margarita was good and the fresco was not unfortunately.  The waitress described it as a "moscow mule" but it was really bland and didn't have the flavor of a moscow mule.  The drinks took over 15 minutes to get the the table.  For an appetizer we got chips and salsa.  I really liked that the chips are served for with 4 different types of salsa.  They all tasted very fresh and were very good.  For dinner I ordered the Naco torta.  It was ok.   The flavor was good but the meat was stringy and a little fatty.  My friend ordered the tacos and they were very good.  So to sum up the food, it was good but nothing blew me away.  The service leaves quite a bit to be desired.  From the long wait for our drinks, to a long wait for our food.  Like I said earlier, our waitress was very nice but our waters ran out and were not filled for quite awhile.  When a person came over at the end and started clearing plates she took part of my food away, I wasn't finished and I was going to take the rest home.  I didn't realize she had taken that plate until we asked for boxes for the  rest of our food.  I am not sure if I will be back.  I think there are so many options out there that  good service is a big thing.  I could understand if they were busy, but there just were not very many people in the restaurant.
