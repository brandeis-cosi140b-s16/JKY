Did I mention I'm a HUGE fan when it comes to chips and salsa.  Chips were ok and salsa was more like hot green/ red sauce. No chunks, no tomatoes, no cilantro. No Bueno. Cheese crisp aka quesadilla, was pretty tasty full of cheesy goodness. Steak picado was good too. Not sure if if I would come back for seconds. Or thirds! Waitress was  nice. Service was fast.
