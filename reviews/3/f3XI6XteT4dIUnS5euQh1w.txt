Went here with a friend to meet up with another Yelper...Valerie. She had invited me cuz she received VIP which included 50% off drinks from 8-10. Who wouldn't take the offer...right? The bartenders were friendly.

Since we went there early, the place was lively. Full of lights and many people. Part of their outside area has sand which I thought was cute. I gives you a relaxing atmosphere and I wish I could have snugged my feet in it, but I had boots and socks and I thought it was too much effort. LoL!

I wish I could have stayed longer to see the place turn around when they started dancing, but by 10:30 I was ready to get my groove on and had to go else.
