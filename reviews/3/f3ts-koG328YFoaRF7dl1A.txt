I was excited to try a new Pasquals location however, it did not live up to my expectations.  
The renovation of the old Fyfe's building was nice but they did in the main dining area, it was extremely loud.  So loud I couldn't hear the people at my table and the restaurant wasn't even full.  
I had a basil lemon margarita which was good and we started with their chips and salsa which is always good.  My dinner, the burrito bowl was excellent, however there were a few glitches with the meals that the people I was with had ordered.  
Our server really rushed us through out the whole night which was rather irritating.  
This Pasquals location ha potential but they've got some work to do to catch up with other locations.
