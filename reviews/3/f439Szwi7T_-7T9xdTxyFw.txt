I thought this place was really good! I loved the decor and atmosphere. My girlfriend and I split a margarita pitcher and I thought the margaritas were a bit too sweet. Initially I questioned the alcohol content but after a few glasses I could be sure that they were strong enough. I had the relleno dinner and loved it!! The food here is pretty spicy, but so good that you don't mind torturing yourself a bit. The only thing lacking was the service. There only seemed to be one server but they also weren't busy at all. Also I wish they were open later.
