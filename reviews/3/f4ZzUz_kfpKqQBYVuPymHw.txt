Perfect drunken midnight snack! Five stars for the night crawlers, but I cannot say as much for the place when I am sober.

The interior is very much so a low end fast food restaurant. After all, it is a very casual Mexican fast food restaurant. The staff is nice, the homemade drinks are okay at best, and the good isn't half bad.

I would highly recommend the deluxe quesadilla as a late night snack. If you are dinning in during the day I would be more adventurous and see what else is good on the menu. They have a lot of options.  The other dishes I have tried were all pretty good and very filling.

They also have dessert in the for of frozen ice cream. Most of the treats are pretty typical but I am a big fan of the Mexico Ice Cream Bars. A must try if you have any room after you meal.
