Can get very crowded and smokey most nights, show up early and get a good seat in a booth or grab a beer at the bar, park in the back of the building if the front is crowded.  

Nice selection of beers on tap, not just your usually domestics.  Good selection of wine....and the food is pretty good too.  Very spicy so expect it, don't go here and ask for mild food, just won't happen.  And prepare to laugh at the $27 fish tacos that's always on the special board...haha, most expensive fish tacos in the universe by far.  Very consistent eats, always spicey yet flavorful and good.
