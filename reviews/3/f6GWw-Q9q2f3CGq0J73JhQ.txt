I love the chips and salsa and bean dip but the food just never seems to be that great!  Usually the waitress is great but for some reason she has been MIA for the past few visits and the other wait staff is just not as nice as Alison.  If I could just go in for the chips and salsa I would love love love this place, but the past few times I am just really disapointed not only in the food but service as well.  3 times bad, buh-bye!!!
