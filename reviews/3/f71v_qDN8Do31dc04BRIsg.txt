After visiting the skating rink at Lake Las Vegas on a sunny Saturday the gals and I were craving margaritas.  So, we figured a joint with the name "Sonrisa Grill" would fit the bill.  They definitely came through there!  We split a pitcher of margaritas flavored with blood oranges, and it was yummy.  We also tried out the guacamole (standard and tasty), and the ceviche (good, middle of the road as well).  We were all creeped out by the neon red and green chips that came in the basket, we could definitely do without that, but it fits the bill for a quick stop for the standards.
