Fox concept restaurants are always if nothing else classy and the outdoor environment at the Biltmore is fabulous. The aesthetic of the restaurant and the our waiter was fantastic. Great service, friendly and accommodating. The Margaritas were on point. My son, husband and I all tried the tacos and got the nachos as a appetizer. I would say they were ok. Good but not amazing. The main reason for my 3 star review is the price. I felt like it was just too high. Sunday lunch ran us over $100. I wouldn't say I was disappointed but I could definitely find better for cheaper in the central Phoenix area.  Parking is easy here and they validate for the first hour.
