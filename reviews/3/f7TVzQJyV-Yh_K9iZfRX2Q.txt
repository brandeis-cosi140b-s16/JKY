This was just ok for me and probably my least favorite meal during my week at the MGM. I'm sad about that because our group had set such high expectations for Hecho. That might be because they are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, so we felt like we had really waited to give them a try and let the anticipation build a bit. The chips were not warm and did not taste freshly made. I ordered chicken tacos and the chicken was very dry and did not taste fresh. I feel like my order sat for a while and maybe I should've sent it back. I'm giving them 3 stars because while my hubby agreed with me on the chips, he enjoyed his fish tacos and margarita.  All in all, we are in no hurry to go back but would definitely give it another chance.
