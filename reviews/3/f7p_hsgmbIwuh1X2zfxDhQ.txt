Molly had a stand at the Westgate farmers' market, and I tried one of her (full-size!) samples of red pork. It was very tasty and moist, if not as spicy as I would like. She did say that you can request that your dozen be made spicier. 

It was also really full of meat. She also said that she only uses really good cuts of meat, and no lard.

However, I passed on buying a dozen, as I thought $26 was a little high, and I wanted to try some more elsewhere.
