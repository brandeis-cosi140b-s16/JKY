Reasonably Priced Food and Generous Portions.

Señor Taco is a favorite of a friend of mine who has two children ages 9 and 12.  Señor Taco might not be one of my favorite eating establishments but the food at Señor Taco is reasonably priced and the serving sizes are very generous.
 
Señor Taco has a  small condiment bar. I really enjoy the salsa bar with all the different types of salsa's and hot carrots.  The  burrito  I ordered was good and as I mentioned, a very generous  serving size, large enough to take some home. 

Señor Taco offers a variety of entrées to order from and the customer service is second to none.  No pretense just come in, order, sit down and enjoy.
