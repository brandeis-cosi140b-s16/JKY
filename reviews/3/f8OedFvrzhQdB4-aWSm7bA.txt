I absolutely love the one downtown. I think this one still needs a little work. We went in here for my mother's 60th birthday party. I know we had a fairly large party  so we had two waiters. These two waiters did not seem to communicate with each other. They would be constantly in the room, asking the same questions. There were several times that the drinks for certain people were not brought. When I asked for them to celebrate my mothers birthday, they asked me if she drank alcohol. I told them that she does not, but they still brought a shot of Tequila to her anyway. The buffalo location is average, but downtown I would give 5 stars.
