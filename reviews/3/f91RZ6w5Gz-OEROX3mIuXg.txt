This site says its Mexican but they clearly advertise themselves as New Mexican - just to clear that up.

My husband and I decided to try Secreto last night since we loved Richardson's and have heard good things about the newer Ahwatukee spot. The service was great and the cozy atmosphere was great for a date night. (thats where the 3 stars came from)

We ordered the Garlic Plate as an appetizer which tasted wonderful.  Everything was off to a great start..... then the entrees arrived.  We are both big salt lovers (and usually like everything) but this was very heavy handed with the salt! I had the Soccoro Chicken and he the Special Scallop dish.  Everything on the plate was over salted.  I could not even get through one third of my chicken (where they lost the stars), and his dish was just as salty.

I want to give it another shot but my husband says he will never go back.

Hope this helps.
