Not my first choice, but went there to be with friends.  No complaints. Bright, clean, well organized, and well maintained.  I had the burrito bowl, which is an unwrapped burrito, and my wife had a salad.  The meat is tasty, tender, and nicely done, with adequate char.  The rice is done properly, as are the beans.  The lettuce is good quality.  Good quality food and service.  Solid.
