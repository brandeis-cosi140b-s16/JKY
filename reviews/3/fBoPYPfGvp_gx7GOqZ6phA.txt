This was my first time coming to Frank and Lupe's.  We were a part of a big birthday party about 15 of us.  We sat on the patio, it was a beautiful night to do so.  The menu was huge. I had the chicken chimi (ever known me to turn down a chimi?) which was huge had to take the leftovers home.  I wish I had room left to get my favorite dessert, sopapillas!  Someone at our table ordered it, it looked great. 
I thought the food was good, reasonably priced and thought the margaritas were great.  The parking is horrible for going on a Friday or Saturday, wish the parking lot was for F & L customers only. I had to drive around and found one parking space over by Herb Box, that's too far away. Fortunately, a friend called me and said there was one space open.  I would not recommend going to this place with a big party.  About 4 of the people in our party didn't get their food.  They got their drinks and I thought the server should have given them something to eat to soak up all the drinks they had.  Not sure if they had drinks before but they seemed like they had been over served. 
I would go back but not with a big group.
