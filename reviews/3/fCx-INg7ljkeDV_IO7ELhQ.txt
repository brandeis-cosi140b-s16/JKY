Similar to Chipotle or Pancheros. I'm sure devotees of those two places can tell the difference if they ate here, but I can't. Overall, it was good food that filled me up at a reasonable price. Definitely good for a quick lunch or dinner. A good substitute for Chipotle or similar if you're in Sun Prairie.
