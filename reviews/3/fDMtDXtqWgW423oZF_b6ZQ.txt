A Phoenix Staple that is still around. Yes its dark, old, and a bit dingy, but the food is decent.

It has great old-world charm and its been retrofitted over the years. 

Dishes are standard Mexican, nothing special to report, they are good and up to par with most other Mexican food establishments around town.
