My boyfriend and I were trying to think of a place to eat and I suggested Casa Reynoso as I have driven past it many times. We waited quite a while to be seated (but it was a Friday night so no big deal). The chips and salsa were delicious and dangerous and the supply never was allowed to get low by any passing employee. 
We ordered two margaritas - which were huge and okay in flavor. I got a taco (OK), enchilada (good), and a burro (terrible). My boyfriend got a tamale instead of the burro and said it was delicious. 
The guacamole was terrible. I've made better ones out of a bag and an avocado. 
You have to take your check up to the counter as well. 
Basically, not the worst Mexican food, but certainly not the best. We might go back as a matter of convienece.
