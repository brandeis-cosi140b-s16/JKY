Cantina is a great place to go drink during the day.  You know when you are trying to decide where can you go and sit outside on a beautiful day, this is that place, however, sometimes service and margaritas can be spotty.

Their chips tonight were better than usual they were lighter than my last visit, big improvment, very crispalicious. 

Our server was slack.  Anybody that says they don't like a snooty waiter, I always say, I would rather have an efficient surly waiter anyday than a nice slack ass.  It was the typical horror story of slow on giving the menus, slow on taking the orders, not giving us flatware, having to ask the food runner for flatware. I gave her cash as soon as she came around because I knew getting the check was going to take some time. 

About the margaritas, one day, there was fresh squeezed juice on the bar and the bartender made a margarita with it, I have been back a couple of times to get that same margarita, but what I get is a simple syrup almost clear margarita.  Not the same juice mixture of that day.  

I am not completly going to write off Cantina, I like their food, I am going to restrict my hours of going there from 11a-5p.  I will find that margarita again.  

About the food, I always get the same thing, one Al Pastor taco with rice and beans.
