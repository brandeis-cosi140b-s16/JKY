Mediocre in a number of ways:

While the place was NOT full by any means I felt rushed from beginning to end

The prices are high (of course - it's Vegas) and the portions are small

Asked how large the large margarita was - waiter indicates bucket size so ordered a standard Patron which was small and little if any booze in it - $14

Was dining alone (my wife in the room with broken bones and a nurse) so indicated I would want a to go meal at the end, didn't actually specify what it would be, let alone order it until I ordered my flan - specified TWICE that I wanted the warm to go order 10 minutes after I got my flan. You guessed it!! Rush, rush get the bastard out the door as quick as possible and on to the next - my to go order comes with no sign of the flan. Thanks guys - you pretty much suck when it comes to service

The chile relleno ($19) was so so, the side of guacamole ($9.50) pretty tasteless, Carne asada quesadilla ($19 I believe) passable.
