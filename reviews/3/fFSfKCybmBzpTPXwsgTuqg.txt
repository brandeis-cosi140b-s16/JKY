Went to this restaurant because of the decent reviews. I was displeased. There was about 12 booths open and we still had to wait for 15 minutes (there was two of us). Then we saw our server around 3 times. Their red sauce is probably the worst red sauce I have ever had in my life. Their beans were good but that was about it...
