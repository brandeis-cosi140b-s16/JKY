This place used to be so cool. They used to have a fish tank as you came in the door but sadly now it's gone. Food is good but someone really needs to scrub this place clean. This visit the ammonia smell was present as soon as you walked in the door. The bathroom was a mess and the floors needed a good mopping. It's in a generally good location but other locations are much cleaner.
