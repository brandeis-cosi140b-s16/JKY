It turns out that El Toro II is the favorite restaurant of one of my best friends, so I started to go there alot recently, and it has grown on me exponentially.  The service is always amazing:  the food comes out in like 5 minutes piping hot and exactly as ordered whether the party has 2 people in it or 15.  

I think I have also gotten a handle on what I like to order here too:  mango margarita (frozen) and three cheese enchiladas.
