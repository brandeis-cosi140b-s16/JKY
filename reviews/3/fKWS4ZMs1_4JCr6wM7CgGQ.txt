Ate here for lunch on Saturday, during the mariachi brunch.   The 3 mariachi singers were entertaining as they roamed around the restaurant.  We started with chips and Salsa and Guacamole, one spicy, one not.  Both of the guacamole tasted the same.  The spicy one had no heat to it.  The green salsa with the chips was excellent.  3 in our group ordered the  Alambre Tacos.  They had good flavor and tender,  but $17 for 3 small tacos.  I didn't eat the rice and beans, so it would have been nice to have an option just for the tacos.  The other guy in our party got the #1 combo, he said it was alright.  Being from Arizona, we should have known not to choose a Mexican food restaurant on the strip, but we were hungry and it was convenient.
