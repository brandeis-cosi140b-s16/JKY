I'm surprised by how many extremely negative reviews there are of this place. I've been there twice. The first time, I got tamales that were a little dry and fairly unimpressive. I went back recently and got tacos (I ordered the al pastor tacos, and asked for one of them to be switched out so I could try a huitlacoche taco as well). The tacos were quite good; I was surprised by how much I liked the huitlacoche one (it had zucchini and lots of garlic besides the corn-fungus). My complaint would be that the tacos did not have tons of food in them, but I have to say that I was full when I finished, so maybe that's not so bad. My boyfriend was very happy with his veggie fajitas. 

The best thing about this place is that they make their own refried beans, which might not sound like a big deal, but in a town of Sysco-fied Mexican fare, that's pretty special, and you can really taste the difference.
