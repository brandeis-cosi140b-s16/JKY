This was my first time at Cafe Rio. I've heard so many good things about this place my husband and I had to see what all the fuss was about! 

The atmosphere is very family friendly. If your looking for a quite place to have a romantic date I would not choose here. They do have seating outside at this location which would be nice on a not so hot night.  We went during dinner and decided to take it home.

Cafe Rio has a large selection of Mexican food items. They also have a large selection of proteins to choose from, including salmon and a veggie option. We both had a very hard time deciding what to choose! I was torn between the burrito, nachos and salad. In the end I got a chicken salad with the house dressing and my husband got the sweet pork barbacoa. We decided to get the queso dip with salsa and chips as well. It's an assembly style restaurant much like Chipotle.

I really enjoyed my shredded chicken salad.  They fill a large house made tortilla with rice, beans, chicken, lettuce, pico, cheese, guacamole, and their house made salad dressing. All the ingredients were very fresh and they gave a very large portion. I ate the rest for lunch the next day. My husband after much debate ordered the sweet pork barbacoa burrito. The pork was to sweet for his liking. He told me that he wished you could combine the beef barbacoa from Chipotle into the burrito from Cafe Rio. The queso dip was spicier then I expected, but the salsa was surprisingly tasty. The spice of the queso was not to much just not what I was thinking it would be. They gave a good portion of dip and chips that it was worth the $5.

For fast Mexican food that is a little healthier then Roberto's i'd choose here again. But I really wouldn't go out of my way to go again.
