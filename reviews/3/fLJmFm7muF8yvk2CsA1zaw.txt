I used to live on this side of town, and was over there, so decided to go to my favorote drive thru mexican joint.  I just love their chili rellano burritos, but this time there were so many seeds in the green chili that even after an extra strength heartburn pill, I'm still having issues.  That part is really hot, Polibertos, and easy to remove!  Take it out!  It would also help if the drive thru person spoke English.   West Phoenix is not Mexico.
