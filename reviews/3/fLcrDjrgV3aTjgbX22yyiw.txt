Delicious food, it's truly hard to go wrong with their menu. Would be great if they expanded their breakfast hours (like, expand to 24 hours!), but that's not an issue specific to this location. 

This location is notorious FOR SCREWING UP YOUR ORDER. It's a running joke at work and with friends. Check your bag, check your bag. If you use coupons, prepare for a fight if you go into the store. Assistant managers seem incapable of making even the most basic of decisions so if the coupon doesn't spell things out step by step, they will become confused and refuse a simple accommodation like "Green sauce instead of red".

There was a Taco Bell right in the same parking lot, it was heaven to have them both side by side. I'd go into Taco Bell and get a buffalo chicken griller and eat it right in front of the employees while I waited for my spicy chicken burrito. I was the envy of the day. If I had to pick, I'd rather have Del Taco so I don't miss Taco Bell much.
