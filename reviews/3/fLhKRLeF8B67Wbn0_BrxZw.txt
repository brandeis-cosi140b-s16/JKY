Salsas, melted cheese and service, 4 stars.
Chips... 3

Food was good, but only 3 stars because... I went there with a vegetarian friend and they have some vegetarian options... but... the veggie fajitas he ordered come with beans that we were told are made with bacon!!

That does not make any sense at all...

Also, beans are a good source of protein and I believe any Mexican restaurant should have vegetarian bean burrito option.
