Bubonic chronic tacos!

The LA area based taco shop has berthed a brand new face on the scene with their rock-n-roll persona with a twist of eats from south of the border! A few friends and I went to their grand opening week and sank my teeth into their carnitas (pork) burrito. Places like Chipotle, Zaba's, and Qdoba have similar recipes, but the there are some difference that make Chronic Tacos stand out:

Spanish red rice-- Chipotle doesn't have different choices for rice, Zaba's has brown rice, and Qdoba doesn't have a variance in their rices. But Chronic has Spanish rice! :)

Carnitas-- marinated pulled pork! It has a sweet taste to it that I haven't tasted before!

Flautas-- deep fried taquitos! Ask for Baja sauce and enjoy!

If you're looking for a taco joint with style, personality, and character Chronic Tacos packs it all into their joint! Last I heard of from one of the managers is that they're opening up the bar side of the restaurant soon so look out for that. And if you call an order in, ask for Tony. He's got good customer service!
