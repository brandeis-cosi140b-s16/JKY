This place is like Chipotle, but more like a bar version of Chipotle. The people behind the counter are friendly, and you can get mostly the same options as Chipotle that taste the same and seem like the same if not a little downgraded quality. 

It's inexpensive and a great place to go after you've been running around drinking in downtown Tempe all night. They offer happy hour beer specials, but they are 12 oz. beers not pints so it's not as good a deal as you'd think, but still a discount.
