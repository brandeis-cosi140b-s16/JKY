The Revival has massive potential, but lunch needs a little reworking.

Everything about the ambiance and service at The Revival is "correct" by hip, urban restaurant standards (see: St. Francis, Phoenix Public Market.) 

The menu is evocative and drool-inducing (sorry for drooling on your paper menu.) "Macerated figs" appear enough times to garner applause, and flavor combinations come across as creative, yet comforting. 

We ordered the braised short rib and seared halloumi sandwiches. The blackberry preserves, arugula and crispy shallots on the short rib were kind of lost in the gruyere & meat flavor. The halloumi received similar feedback: much bread, little filling. Where did you go, deep fried tomato, spinach, mustard, caramelized onion and aioli? With such thoughtful, complex flavor additions, there should be more substance... *sideways glance* especially for the price.

As far as sides, both the apple cider slaw and chorizo spiced fries were excellent, but the fries were on a whole different level from everything else we tasted. Like, somebody needs to make it rain chorizo spiced fries on me at some point in my life. 

Not to be the fat kid here, but... 4x as much braised meat/fried cheese in my sandwich next time. Plus, all the fries, please.
