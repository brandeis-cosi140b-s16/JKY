This place was my favorite a couple of years ago and after moving back, it was one of the first places I went to eat at but the food is just not the same. I ordered some enchiladas and the chicken was super dry. I'm pretty sure the popped the enchiladas in the microwave before serving them, as an enchilada enthusiasts that made me so sad. My friend got some carne asada tacos and I stole a bite- they were okay, not the best I've had. You can tell how good a place is by tasting their basics- the rice and beans were not good. Pretty disappointing.
