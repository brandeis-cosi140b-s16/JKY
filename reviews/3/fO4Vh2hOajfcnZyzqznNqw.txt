Went with co-workers last week and overall it was a positive experience (3.5).

It was a co-workers birthday and they gave us a little dessert (enough for all but one of us...but hey, it's free), and they put a big sombrero on him while singing, a nice touch! 

I ordered the shrimp fajitas. There was only really 5-6 shrimp on a huge bed of onions (and some red bell pepper sprinkled in). On the plus side the shrimp tasted great and were cooked nicely. I also really liked the rice it was served with. 

 I  thought it was weird that my co-worker and I ordered the same thing but they only brought one container of tortillas. I would rather have had my own as it's kind of gross to put your hands on something someone else is eating. 

The atmosphere is nice, it is clean (smelled-strongly of cleaner)..but I am okay with that. 

I would return if I were in the area.
