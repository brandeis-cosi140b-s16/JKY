Stopped by to grab a quick bite before an art class at Cajun canvas. The vegetarian options were few but delicious. I got the enchiladas de Popeye - spinach and cheese enchiladas. They were delicious! Perfect cheese to spinach ratio. The salsa was good but the chips had a greasy taste to them. I guess that was a good thing because I didn't stuff myself with chips first. Overall decent friendly service although when it came to getting the check and paying our server seemed to disappear.
