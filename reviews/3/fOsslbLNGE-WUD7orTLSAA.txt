A place with a decent torta, finally!

Another exciting feature: burrito vegetarian. And the quesadilla de hongos was muy tasty. Have yet to try the Rancheros or the Chilaquiles, as I keep coming here for sammiches. The squirt-bottle salsa thing is more funny than it is cool... but I was down, and dug on both the verde and the enjocoque (orange stuff, creamy-ish with a toasted nut aftertaste.... you know what I'm sprayin). 

I guess since they emphasize their torta selection, I was expecting that they would be more awesome. Mine (huevos con queso et all) was squishy and messy, and a little bland, but had quite a pile of jalapenos on it and is, thus far, the best torta I've had in Charlotte.

Safe vegetarian bet with a somewhat authentic flavor. Will be back for more tortas (especially at the uber-reasonable price of $5!!)!!!
