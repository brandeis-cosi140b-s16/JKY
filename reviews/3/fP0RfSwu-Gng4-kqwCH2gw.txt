My wife and I were here early on a Tuesday evening.  They were mostly empty and we had our choice of their outdoor seating.  They had a large patio area kept comfortably cool despite the 105 temp outside.  Their happy hour specials were pretty amazing with $5 appetizers from a long list of options including their "Any alcoholic beverage for $5 in July" special.  The food was a little lacking in flavor consisting mostly of overly spicey-hot concoctions which was overwhelming.  This was true of the short-rack ribs (admittedly advertised as habanero rips) and the veggie tacos ordered by my wife.  Overall an unimpressive visit but I would definitely give it another try with some more selective ordering from their menu.
