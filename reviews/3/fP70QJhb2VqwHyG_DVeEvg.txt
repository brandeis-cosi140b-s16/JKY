We don't live around here, but we're in the area so decided to try it out. First - the food was amazing!!! The shrimp soft taco had the yummiest sauce! And the carne asada soft taco was also delish. One problem was that I asked for double beans instead of rice and when I drove away and opened my container, there was rice. Bummer. Also the wait time was a little long. But I was happy there was a drive through! Overall decent experience, just annoyed about the rice.
