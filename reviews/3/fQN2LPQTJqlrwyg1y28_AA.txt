Food was very good!! We came in on a rainy Friday night. The only customers there, we were a little concerned ,but the food was very good! I asked for a side salad instead of the usual beans and rice,and it was the most colorful salad ever, I LOVED IT! They even came out and gave us free guacamole to try and it was very yummy too! Great service, very polite, we will be back!
