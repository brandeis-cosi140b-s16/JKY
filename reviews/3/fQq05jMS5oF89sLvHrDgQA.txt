There's not much in the way of Mexican food in Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, Cabo is hit or miss. When it's "hit" the food is actually pretty decent (although recently I've noticed they've cut down on their portions). When it's "miss" you'd think Montezuma himself was in the kitchen. Try your luck. But don't say I didn't warn you.
