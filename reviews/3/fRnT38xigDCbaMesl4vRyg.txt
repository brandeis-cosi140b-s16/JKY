If it wasn't so dirty and smelly and if the service didn't suck so bad this place would rate so much better. 

Anything on the menu is good but the longer you wait in the day the less fresh everything seems. I have worked in many restaurants and at some who didn't prepare everything fresh for the day and this place is one of them.

I recommend take out just because of the smell, but check your order to make sure it's right!
