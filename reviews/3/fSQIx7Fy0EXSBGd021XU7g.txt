Ok, let me tee this up.  I was in the area with my Wife and she wanted to check out the antique shops nearby.  Well, I wanted to watch the football games.  So, while she shopped, I popped in here for a Beer & some food.

I tried the Abondigas Soup and Chips & Salsa.  Both were ok.

There aren't too many TV's in the restaurant, so I got luck that there were only  few tables and I was able to find one with a good view of one of the TV's.

The staff was super friendly and attentive.  They were probably wondering what I was doing since I spent 4+ hrs in there watching football while Wifey was shopping.  LOL

Would like to come back for dinner sometime.  The rest of the menu looked pretty tempting.
