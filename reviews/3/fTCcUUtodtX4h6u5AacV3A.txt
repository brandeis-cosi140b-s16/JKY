I stopped in for lunch with a few co-workers. The place was pretty packed when we arrived which is always a good sign for a newbie! 

While we waited we checked out the menu and lunch specials. The prices for their lunch combos was pretty reasonable! Once we were finally seated we got the chips and salsa. I wasn't a fan of either, the chips were fine (I guess) but just not my personal favorite...and the salsa was way to watery for me! 

For lunch I ordered the Ranchera quesadilla. It comes along side rice and beans, with your choice of chicken or ground beef and then gets topped with sour cream, guacamole, tomato and cheese.

My plate arrived to the table hot so that was a huge plus! The portion size was just right! But the chicken could have used a bit more seasoning, I wasn't a fan of the beans (covered in cheese) and the rice was a bit crunchy. 

Blah. 

So for now this place is just okay! It's certainly not the best Mexican I've ever had but I'm at least willing to try another dish and a margarita and see if they can't win me over!
