Used to go here all the time when it was Tradiciones, we loved it. Decided to try the new place, so took my staff to lunch there. There were only 4 other tables seated, so you would expect GREAT service.  Unfortunately, that was not the case AT ALL. Had to ask the waitress for more salsa 3 different times, she kept forgetting. Had to ask for more chips. Asked for refills on our drinks twice, didn't get the refills until we were done with our meals. With barely any other patrons, you'd think we wouldn't have to ask for ANYTHING at all...but to have to ask repeatedly? Not good.  Mind you, she wasnt busy, she was sitting down with another staff member (the manager I think) in a booth throughout our meal. As for the food, it was great. Chips were great.The iced tea tasted like it was a day or two old, very bitter, but was forced to drink it because the salsa was hot and like I said, she kept forgetting to get our refills (and my new drink). I have to say the courtyard looks great, I love what they did with it. I will give the place anohter shot becuase the food was good and I know that sometimes people only work as hard as they have to. So when its slow, waitresses seem to slack off. BUT I am hoping the owners read this so they can train their staff better. EVERY CUSTOMER COUNTS, not just when you're busy. BTW I am a GREAT tipper....this girl could have made a nice penny from my table alone had she cared enough to pay attention.
