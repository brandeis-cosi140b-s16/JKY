We tried KoMex--a Korean Mexican fusion joint--when we lived in Vegas because being from Hawaii, that's not weird at all. 

Korean good. Mexican good. Fusion good. Sounded like a win!? Besides Bulgogi is gold if done right. Couldn't resist. 

We got the bulgogi fries and bulgogi kimchi fried rice to share, my husband and I both ordered a bulgogi burrito, my girlfriend got the bulgogi chicken burrito and her guy got the bulgogi chimichanga. 

The bulgogi fries: delicious and what you'd expect from marrying decent bulgogi with fries and bold fusion sauces. Can't say I've had anything like it. Bars should take notice because I'd describe this dish as the drunk person's best friend at 2 in the morning. & on that note, unfortunately the fries are too soggy to be sober. So it's like yummy bulgogi fusion-ness on....mashed fries? 

Kimchi fried rice: does the job but hmm. Eh. Meh. I say this as a true half Asian and kimchi fan. 

The bulgogi burrito was pretty great because we weren't expecting a Mexican burrito. We expected a KoMex bulgogi burrito. Whatever that is. I approved and my hubby--he's a man/disposal, liked it a lot. On the same note our friend "loved" the bulgogi chimichanga. And the chicken bulgogi was rated 4 stars but come on, do a beef bulgogi for the full experience. 

All in all 3.7 (my rating) to 4 (everyone else's) Stars

The place was clean, but nothing special. Oh, they serve free chips and salsa. Yippee.
