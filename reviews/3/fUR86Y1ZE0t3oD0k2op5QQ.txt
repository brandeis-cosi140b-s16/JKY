Came in late on a Sunday night with mf girlfriend. The service was friendly and timely. However, the tacos were underwhelming. I trie the carnitas, carne asada, and pollo. They were each ok but somehwat bland for my taste, leaning on the less authentic, more americanized side of the taco spectrum. The salsas were adequate but nothing truly stood out flavor-wise. Overall, an ok option if its late at night and nothing else is available.
