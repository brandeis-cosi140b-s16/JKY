I can never really decide if I like Guy Fieri.  On the one hand, he seems like a bit of a douche, with the sunglasses on the back of his head and the sweatbands all over the place.  On the other hand, anyone has to be better than Melissa d'Arabian, right?

So one of the places that Guy has visited on "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives" is Cabo Fish Taco, a funky little place in NoDa, famous for - what else - fish tacos.  The big problem with fish tacos in NoDa should be obvious to just about anyone: Charlotte is nowhere near the ocean.  Any ocean.  Now if they are pulling fish fresh from a nearby lake, cooking it up and plopping it on a taco, then maybe.  Just maybe.  But somehow I do not think that is what we have here.

Instead, it is a generally average joint nestled amongst the buildings in NoDa, and it has a reasonable reputation, surely bolstered by their appearance on Triple D.  The service is not bad, but the food?  Really middle-of-the-road.  As has been mentioned, they start you off with this funky corn salsa that is different than what you usually get in this sort of place, but really is not that great.  If the chips are stale, it is worse.

Then you pick some tacos.  Most of them are decent, but just not that memorable.  None seem to be outstanding.  When you factor in the need to wait for a table and be jostled about with a crowd, it just may not be worth all the hassle, you know?
