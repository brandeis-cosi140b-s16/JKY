We only come here when it is way past our bedtime and bad habits start creeping in...hey, I'm a grad student, cut me a break! In all seriousness though, this is a decent, 24 hour, Mexican fast food joint thats definitely better than taco bell or jack in the crack (as my undergrad classmates lovingly liked to call it). They actually take the time to cook your food to order which is much appreciated for a late night meal... but it also means you may have to wait about 15-20 minutes to get your food. Worth it IMO. You can always order ahead.  

What we've ordered:

*Carne asada quesadilla- delish! tender meat!
*Fish tacos- not bad, combo comes with rice and beans
*Chicken Enchiladas- good for fast food
*Carne Asada fries- decent but nothing like what we have back home (CA)
*Chips and guacamole- its okay but I always forget they top it off with a ton of shredded cheese which I hate. Gotta remind myself to tell them next time. Also they put a lot of tomatoes in it so if you don't like tomatoes, this is not for you. 
*Pina (pineapple juice)- Don't like it, totally watered down with a hint of bubblegum flavor? Maybe that was just my batch. 

Their salsas are good too. The red one is super spicy with the taste of toasted red chilli pepper flakes. The green one, less spicy and more flavorful. I need to try their picked stuff next time. 

Will we be back? Yes probably and definitely for as long as I'm in school haha.
