Matt's Big Breakfast was super busy this weekend before Christmas so I turned to yelp trying to find something good that I haven't had before and this place popped up and decided to give it a try for breakfast.

It's located right next to the Bimbo bread factory when I got out of the car it smelt like fresh baked goodness.

Going inside the decor was what I expected for a Chinese American Mexican restaurant. Service was rather friendly, but that's where all things good end. We ordered a waffle combo and biscuits and gravy. I should have thought twice about ordering food after constantly hearing the microwave alarm sound. The food was lame, not bad, but really disappointing. Maybe something you'd expect at a truck stop diner. Throughout our meal I probably heard the microwave alarm go off about 20 times even though there were only 6 people in the restaurant. I was baffled.

On the way out I got what they called a pineapple fruit water, which really is a Mexican agua de pi√±a. It was well done, fresh made and quite delicious. If I'm going to go back I would give the Mexican food a try, although I wouldn't be surprised if it is just microwave cuisine.
