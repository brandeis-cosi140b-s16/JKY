We had dinner here with some friends.  It was our first time trying out this place and since I'm on my No Meat diet, I went for the Bean & Cheese Chimichanga.  My friends ordered an appetizer for the table that was a Tortilla with melted Cheese on it.....they insisted that I give it a try.  I did and was instantly a fan....wow, it tasted sooo good.  The Cheese was gooey and had a nice, rich flavor.  We added some Guacamole to it and it was great.

By the time my Bean & Cheese Chimichanga came out, I was almost full from the complimentary Chips & Salsa plus the Cheesy Appetizer.  However, once I took one bite from the Chimichanga, my stomach kicked into 2nd gear.....it was good!

Overall, it was a nice place to have dinner with friends.  It's very casual.....it was busy when we arrived around 7:30, but was empty by 9:00.....I can never get use to cities outside of Vegas where places empty really fast!
