Honestly, I wanted chinese food but ended up here. I heard this place is great when you're drunk but when I walked in, I was fully sober. I walked up to the counter and tried to decide what I wanted. After long decision, I ordered the chicken roll ups and a burrito for 6.65. I ate the roll ups and they were beyond dry. I could of dipped them in water and could of been still thirsty. They had a little sauce station which I grabbed some sauces but that didn't help. The burrito was at least juicy but it was over packed with chicken. Apparently it had bell peppers and onions but all it was dryish chicken. The plus was it was authentic food. The walls were all painted different colors and none had an outlet so that was a negative. With it being 24/7, it would probably be better if I was drunk.
