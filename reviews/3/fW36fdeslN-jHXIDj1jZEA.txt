We decided to try it after driving by...several cars in parking lot. Margarita was OK....my partners drink was empty a fee times. I enjoyed the chips and salsa. I like the way the taco shell was cooked...slightly crispy. The beans were very tasty. The price is reasonable as well. Only problem were the few pesky flies and its a little noisy
