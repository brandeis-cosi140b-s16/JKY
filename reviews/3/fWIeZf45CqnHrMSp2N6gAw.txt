I last visited Pedro's in the mid 1990s, so it's been a while since I've swung-in. A large group of us arrived after a show on Friday, April 18. There were 15 of us, and it was 10:45pm.

Despite us wandering-in so late, and despite the fact that the crew had mostly cleaned-up for the night (we were the only people there), the staff was *extremely* friendly, accommodating, prompt, and helpful. 

+ It looks exactly the same as I remember it from back in the day
+ Decent tap selection
+ INCREDIBLE tap prices - I got a 32oz mug of Lake Louie for $6

- Cadillac margarita was served warm (despite being on rocks) - not sure how that happened, but it happened twice. 
- Cadillac margarita delivered a nice headache the next day. That's unusual, as we normally don't experience one when we have "good" tequila. I'm uncertain what type of tequila they use in the cadillac version, but I suspect it was still closer to "rail"

+ Good chips and salsa, and they were complimentary, even though we didn't order any other food

+ Tons of seating options
- Tables/chairs - looking a little dated and some were quite wobbly

All-in-all, this was a great option for our group, and I couldn't have been any happier than I was with the service. It was really, really outstanding. I'd return for drinks and appetizers again.
