Had the $3.95 breakfast and was very happy with it.  The special runs til noon every day, including weekends.  It's 2 eggs, breakfast potatoes, 2 warm tortillas and your choice of breakfast meat. Kind of hard to beat.  They also have $1 small bloody mary's before noon.  Our server was slow but he did have a lot of tables.  Our food took longer than the table beside us, even though we'd ordered a good 5-10 minutes before them...but I can't complain about the food portion size, which was generous, and the very cheap price.  It was a tasty, standard breakfast, and I'd recommend it for those traveling through. 

 I can't speak to the lunch or dinner items though...
