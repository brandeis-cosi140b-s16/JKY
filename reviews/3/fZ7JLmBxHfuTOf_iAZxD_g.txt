This Chipotle is located across from the UNLV campus on Maryland Pkwy and is convenient for my friends and I whenever we're craving mexican food. It's smaller than most Chipotle's I've been too which is why it's A-OK for me. Whenever I go, the dining area is usually packed so I come to this location just to take out. They're clean and friendly so I'm about it!

And you know the gist of everything:
1. Pick your bowl, burrito, salad, or tacos
2. Pick your rich (brown or white)
3. Pick your beans (black or pinto)
4. Pick your meat (chicken, steak, sofritas, barbacoa, carnitas, or veggies)
5. Pick your spice level (mild, medium, hot)
5. Add toppings (corn, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, guacamole: which is extra $)

And add chips and salsa, or a drink if you like!

They also have lemon on the side by the utensil area as well as your different kinds of tobasco, YUM!

If you're a student at UNLV and are a fan of Chipotle, I recommend this location for a study break or on-the-go meal!
