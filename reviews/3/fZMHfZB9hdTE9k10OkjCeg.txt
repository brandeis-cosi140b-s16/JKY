Solid and cheap/tacos start at $1.09, 24 hours, 3-4 fresh salsas at the condiment stand with fresh radish and lime. Everything I've ever had has been good, not killer, but pretty darn good. I usually get burritos, tacos, or the pozole. I love it when an ethnic restaurant attracts a lot of people from the country they represent...this place does just that. For about the same price point as Taco Bell or Del Taco, this is a winner.
