Meh! 
So, so.
Dos, Tres.

Had never been to a Rubio's before and wasn't impressed. 

The staff was very  friendly and nice. The restaurant was a bit dirty, with food crumbs on tables. Tables and chairs were disorganized and the floor was filthy. Not a good sign...

Had the Coastal Trio that came with three different fish tacos. Blackened Shrimp and Tilapia were both pretty decent. The third taco was a giant deep fried fish tilapia piece of lard on a tortilla. I wasn't sure how to approach it because is was so big and greasy, so I ended up passing on that. 

Don't see myself visiting another Rubio's and not because it was terrible but because my expectations for Mexican food is pretty high and this place is very far from Mexican Generic Food. Not very tasty and nothing about my visit stood out or left me with the "come back soon bug." 

Maybe in the future I will give them another shot but for now, they remain as one of my least favorite for Mexican.
