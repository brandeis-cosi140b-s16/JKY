First off, be prepared to wait.  If you go on a weekend night, you will definitely wait, most likely at least an hour depending on what time you get there.  But even though some previous reviewers might disagree with me, I thought that service was reasonably fast once we were inside.  

Food was average.  As a vegetarian, I can't have their signature item, so no tacos pour moi, but I still judge places on their veg items.  And what I had wasn't bad at all, it was sort of a grilled California burrito with queso (Burrito Verde).  It was big and I took home a good bit of it.  Had a side of Jalapeno and Cheese Mashers, which was fairly bland.  But prices were fine.  Small but decent selection of beers on tap (Dogfish, etc. when I was there).

Overall, I would probably give this place a 2.5.  Though the food isn't great, they don't forget about the vegetarian.  And the wait should be expected.  But its just so LOUD!!!  Have to deduct some points for that.  If I wait, and deal with noise, and then the food is amazing, then its worth the trouble.  But though good, the food here just doesn't justify dealing with waiting/atmosphere.
