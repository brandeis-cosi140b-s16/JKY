I used to live in this area and back then there wasn't a stand. 

I got 2 tacos : 

Cabeza - it was ok... mine was greasier than others I think because I somehow got the bottom of the pile or something as others complained it was dry that day. I thought it needed salt though.

Pastor - I wasn't a fan of how small the meat was diced as it lost some of the flavor. 

I got a horchata to wash it down. It was creamy and had a lot of spice, but a bit sweet for my taste, though I can see others liking it as is.

I came with a group of Yelpers and their service is fast and the tacos were cheap at $1.50 but overall this was just alright. I wouldn't go out of my way for these tacos...and I'm never in this hood either.
