Average tacos. 

Coming from Milwaukee I can't say prices are good for the quality. 

Any alterations cost an arm and a leg. I saw a couple come in and order ten tacos, they added sour cream and avocado to all of them which doubles the cost. They weren't aware and it ended up making a scene. 

The manager pointed to the menu board, where the additional cost is not too obvious. 

Made a big scene and all of the diners were uncomfortable.
