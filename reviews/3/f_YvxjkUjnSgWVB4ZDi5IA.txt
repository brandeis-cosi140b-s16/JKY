I had came here once when it was closed because yelp gave me the wrong hours of operations. Second time was a success and was able to order my tacos.  I had ordered carne asada and al pastor because the man behind the counter said that the chicken took awhile to make. So you have been warned.

The carne asada was mediocre, reminds me of ground beef, huge let down. I hate when carne asada is like a ground beef rather than diced.
The al pastor was good. Only thing different about this place that I will remember to change next time is they add some kind of a orangey red sauce on top of the tacos so if you like crazy spicy food don't ask to have it removed. But i personally like to add the heat as I go. Not in every bite. So until next time this place is just  a C for me. I'm a huge Carne asada Freak and this place didn't cut it.
