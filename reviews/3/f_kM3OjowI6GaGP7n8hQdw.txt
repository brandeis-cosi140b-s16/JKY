Ok already! It's not "authentic" Mexican! Are you really expecting a Rick Bayliss quality restaurant in an airport? I sure am not. This place provided me with a DECENT breakfast/lunch and friendly service. Not cheap like any other airport establishment but it did the job. I left full and satisfied. Ok so it's not even Mexican. Just call it EL DECENTO AEROPORTO foodo.
