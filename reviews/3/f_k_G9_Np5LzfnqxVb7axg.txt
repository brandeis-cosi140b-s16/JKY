We came here for Valentine's day because my husband's sprint phone was not working.   We drop off the phone and walked over for a quick bite.  We were lucky we got there before the crowd.  We waited for a few mins, before we were greeted and sat.  Within 15 mins, the place was packed with people.  

We sat down and received a basket of warm chips and two salsa.  Then we got two cups and a pitcher of water.  The lady did not say anything to us and left.  I was not sure if she is coming back or not.  ???  

Then our server came to greet us.  She was very nice and told us the special.  She took our drink order and swoosh she was gone.  She had a ton of tables.  She came back quick with drinks and to take our food order.  

I ordered the Comb #11 Chimi with chicken served with beans and rice.  The red sauce had good flavor, the chicken itself was bland, the rice was good, and normally I am not a fan of refried beans but theirs was pretty good.  

To sum up everything, it was ok.
