The service was great. The food was not impressive. For the price I paid for a sirnoran hot dog I was expecting better taste. The bun was cold, I personally like the bun to be warm. We also order a taco salad, the taste was much better than the hot dog but the ground beef was cold. I think for a bar it looks pretty cool and the service is awesome, our server and manager were great, but for food I will not be coming back.
