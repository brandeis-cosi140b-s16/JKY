Some of my family really loves Serrano's, so I have been here at least a few times since I have been in Arizona.

I personally don't think it is the greatest Mexican food, but I can see how it is a great value. Their prices are pretty good and they do give you a lot of food. The chips and dip are excellent, but I haven't been able to find an entree that I thought was too impressive. Every time I have gone I have ordered something different and I will keep trying to find that awesome platter!

I think its an alright Mexican restaurant overall, but it doesn't excite me too much.
