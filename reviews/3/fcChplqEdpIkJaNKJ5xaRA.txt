I found this place on Google as I was looking for a Mexican restaurant close by since I was new to the area. I've been there at least five times. The last two times I've was a little unsatisfied w the food.
The good :
Salsa and chips 
The staff 
Chicken tostadas
Chicken enchiladas
The sopes 

The bad: 
The soups 
I've had the chicken and the beef soup . Both times I didn't like it. 

The rest of the food has been great. I'll be going back but no more soups for me .
