Let me start by saying Mexican food is not my most favorite of cuisines. I came in here out of convenience and I wanted something fairly quick. They deliver on both counts. 

The food is acceptable. One person complained in another review the portions are too small for the money. I think Americans are brainwashed to believe we need to have super-sized portions in everything. Hence the obesity problem, but I digress...

I ordered one grilled salmon taco. It was 4 bucks. It's salmon so it's bound to be a little more pricey, but I was ok with it. I also ordered a side of refried beans (1.49) and a 2 Oz side of guacamole (.99). 

I probably waited between 5 and 10 minutes.. The food came out pretty fast and it was a 6" double flour tortilla overflowing with salmon, mango and others bits. I put on some salsa and the guacamole, and it was hard to eat because there was so much stuff. The beans were tasty and an ample amount. Chipotle hands down has the best guacamole. The guac was ok. The only complaint I have is they stuck a bunch of wilted lettuce on the plate. It neither looked good or tasted good. Note to chef: If it looks bad, leave it off the plate. Thank you. 

I didn't feel like the portions were too small at all. I felt my hunger was satisfied. For what I got (taco, beans and guac) in spent 6.99. Not bad at all. 

Overall, I would come back. It's not a bad little joint. Cheers!
