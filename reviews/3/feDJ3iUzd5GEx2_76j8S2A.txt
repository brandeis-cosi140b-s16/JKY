Sometimes, I drive here for takeout chips 'n salsa then walk next door and grab soup from the Chinese place. Does that make me a fattie? Oh well.

A-OK nails this place. It's not bad... it's not the absolute best. 

When you sit down, there is a big empty bowl in the middle of your table. This is something I like to call guacamole entrapment. You may not have wanted to order it before, but you will now. 1900 will make it right there in front of you.

I pretty much order something different every time. What's my current food mood? Tacos? Fajitas? Something I can't pronounce that is covered in cheese? (yeah, that was my most recent order on Sunday). No complaints about any of it.

Although I have moved away from the Montford area, I relocated to a 'hood where there is another location. So don't consider this a break up 1900... just an it's complicated.
