Stopped here for lunch and had a steak burrito with queso. The queso was awesome, but the burrito was good - not great. I prefer building my own burrito at a Chipotle, but the queso and the salsa bar make this place a legitimate alternative. 

Not bad, but also not enough for me to crown them king of the burrito places.
