The pursuit of the guacamole burrito continues...

And now that I have moved to Tempe, I have an entirely new set of hispanic hot spots to try...especially since Poliberto's is right across the street from my new digs.

I am not seeing the shabby outside or inside that some of the reviews tout.  The building, the parking lot, the interior are all clean and well maintained.  The salsa bar is spic and span, the tables are clean and the trash is certainly not overflowing.  Even the restrooms are well maintained.

In the week I have been in Tempe, I have enjoyed Poliberto's twice.  Both times, it's with the same order:Guacamole, bacon, cheese, sour cream and onion in a tortilla...a guacamole burrito.  The price has varied both times I have ordered it...the first time $3.25, the second time $2.75.  The thickness (size) of the burrito also varied...the $3,25 version was smaller than the $2.75 version. 

Maybe the day version (smaller and more expensive) is different because the temperature is higher?  We can all make adjustments because of the sun! hehehe
