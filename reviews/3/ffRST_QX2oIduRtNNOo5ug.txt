Last night at 11:58 i had the biggest pregnancy craving for taco bell, so we went through the drive through not realizing how long they open till...
The drive through was still open and a young man took our order. 
Everything was fine until we were given our food with a side of attitude. 

The young man handed the food to us and said "Thank you SO MUCH for visiting us SO LATE" and shuts the light off in the drive through...
Honestly, if I knew that they were closing in like 2 mins, I would not have ordered. I don't want any chance of people spitting in my food... 

Im still giving this place a 3 star for letting me order and still giving us a decent togo.  But next time, please do not serve people with a side of attitude.
