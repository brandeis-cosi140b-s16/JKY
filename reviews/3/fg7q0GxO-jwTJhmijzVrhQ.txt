So I went here twice and I hated it the first time.  I don't know if I got a bad cut of meat or what, but my burrito was a bit too fatty.  I think it was the red chile burrito, or something.

Having said that, I recently gave it another shot and and went for the carne asada burrito.  Very, very good.  The cut of the beef is a little thicker than the usual Salazar's or Filiberto's burrito, but it was really good regardless.  Oh, and the beans in there were awesome, too.  It didn't have guacamole and I didn't notice till it was too late, but I'll be sure to get some in there next time.

Overall, I give it 3 stars because i really hated my first visit, but their carne asada is completely legit.
