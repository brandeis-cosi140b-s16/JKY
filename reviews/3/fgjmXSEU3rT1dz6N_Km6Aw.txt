Overall I would say it was okay, but I was not Wow'd or even inspired to come back "real soon".
Growing up eating Mexican food,  and living more than half my life in the Southwest, I prefer a little more character in the food.  
The Mexican Fried Rice had the most character because it's green.  I asked the waitress and was told Poblano and Cilantro, but I couldn't really tell. The rice was overcooked, but the flavor was alright.  The beans I would rate the lowest because they tasted like they were canned that were enhanced with just the sprinkle of cheese that's melted on top.
We we pleasantly surprised by a dessert "on the house" that was simple and satisfying. A tiny flour tortilla filled with apple pie filling and a touch of cream/cheese, grilled like a quesadilla and then tossed in cinnamon sugar.  Mmm.
I missed the fact they had a full bar.  Lots of temptation there.  Guess I may need to check out their happy hour deals.
One last thing.  Our server was pleasant but so quiet and wasn't familiar with the specials.  She left without dropping the bill or telling us she was leaving -- so we waited for our check.  It was then I learned they had a full bar cuz I figured I needed to go to a register to pay.
Gimme a server that is confident, brings some of that personality to her service and makes you glad you stopped in regardless of the food.
