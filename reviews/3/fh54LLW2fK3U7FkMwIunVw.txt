Clearly not paying attention to the details. Has a special board right by the register advertising a queso dip. Took my order, took my money. A few minutes later I was informed they're out of queso dip. You know, the one advertised right by the register. Anyways, I had a few tacos. Very tasty but in the twenty minutes I was there they never bothered to remove the queso special sign. Tables were sticky too. Delicious tacos though.
