Nice hot fresh chips when you sit down. Good happy hour drink prices. The chicken salad I ordered was pretty skimpy, and didn't come near the picture in the menu as far as quantity. It did taste good, though. My friends, who ordered fajitas and tacos, were happy.  You can get food that tastes as good across the street, for better prices, but it isn't as nice an establishment.
