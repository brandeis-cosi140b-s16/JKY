This is by far one of the smallest Chipotle that I've ever been too, but granted, space is most likely at a high premium. 

Seating:

The are a few tables, as well seats that line the store window. There is additional seating outside in the walkway of the mall that provides a less cramped environment

Food:

Standard Chipotle Menu

Price: 

One of the cheaper and filling options in Vegas for a meal, especially for Gluten Free

Wait:

Expect a line out the door, but it can move quickly, as long as the person in front of you is paying attention or knows what is going on
