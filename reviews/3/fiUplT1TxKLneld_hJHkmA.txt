This place is good, dont get me wrong.  I did enjoy my burger.  

However if I had to stack this up with all of the other choices in the area, I would put the stand right in the middle.  Hence the 3 stars.  I feel like $12 for a drink, fries and a burger is quite a bit.  We are bordering on a full service restaurant at this point.

It's hard to say this place stands (pun intended) above choices like The Grind, Two hippies, Zinburger, Rehab, and Chicago Hamburger Company.  These are all locations less than 10 minutes away.

I will come back and try the tacos.  I will update my review once I do this.
