I stopped in here with my boyfriend early in the day before we took off to head back home to California. I can eat Mexican food for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It wasn't too crowded in here since it was before noon and the service was quite friendly. 

They have crunchy chips and flavorful salsa - good way to start a Mexican meal. The food was not top-notch nor was it poor. It was just...good. Being from So-Cal, I didn't expect anything out would this world. It was fatty, greasy, delicious, and it hit the spot for a long drive home.

A-okay by me.
