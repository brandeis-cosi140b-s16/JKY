Good local spot. Margaritas are too sweet. Poor waitress had the whole floor all to herself. I witnessed some people waiting behind me that left cause they were waiting so long for someone to take their order. They have a salsa bar in the back with some descent salsa. In would def come back for the tortilla soup. We ordered enchiladas. The chicken was tasty. Decor is cute with overhead hanging lights. This is not a crazy party spot or anything. Prob wouldn't come with a group cause of slow service.
