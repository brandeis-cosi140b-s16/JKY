Not my first time at Cabo Mexican Restaurant, but my first time at this one.  This Cabo is located inside Sante Fe Station Casino, where you will find mostly locals.  The great thing about any restaurant at the Sante Fe Station Casino, there's almost no wait to be seated.  Yes, our locals at casinos located off the strip aren't here to eat.  Most are here to gamble.  We arrived with a group of 12 and our orders were taken almost immediately.  I ended up getting their chicken fajitas with double meat. I also asked that all the fun stuff (i.e. sour creams, guacamole, beans, rices, cheese, etc) be put on another plate. One last request was to have my chicken clean meaning no seasoning added.  After what seems like an eternity to get our food, I got half my request right.  Some, not all, items were put on another plate.  But I got my chicken clean, which is the most important.  Taste wise, I was satisfied and know it would have been better if I had the fun stuff added.  Our waitress was great and our server pleasant.  Overall, I have no complaints about Cabo. 

TIPS:
-Chips:  I didn't try at this location, but have tried it at other Cabo's.  I don't know what it is about their chips, but they are addicting.
