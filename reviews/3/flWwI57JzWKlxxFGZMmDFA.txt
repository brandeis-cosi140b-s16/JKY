This was stop 3 on the taco tour last night with Jon and Amy H. This place is certainly the best deal for tacos in town at 1$ per taco ... the ambience... well, not so much. It's a semi permanent truck sort of situation with some picnic tables outside of a bar. The husband and I shared the pollo mini quesadilla (2$) and the carne taco. The taco was just ok... nothing terribly special, but good for 1$. The quesadilla was really good... very flavorful, and I usually don't love chicken at taco shops, but this was good. I would come back for that. We also had the horchata.... this was not so good... too watery and too much cinnamon.... I couldn't even really drink it. Anyway, I think this place is good for the price, but I wouldn't be rushing back here for a taco.
