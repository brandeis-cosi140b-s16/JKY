Was looking forward to a mexican restaurant to open up at the Biltmore (I too miss Sam's cafe and those yummy chips) - something in walking distance from the esplanade.  

We went on a Friday afternoon for lunch - we arrived a bit before noon and were seated immediately.   Was shocked to see that we had to pay $2 for chips and salsa, but ordered them anyway.  The chips were ok - maybe a bit too salty, but the salsa was horrible.  When asked if they had hot sauce we brought Chula bottle sauce...oh well plain chips it was.

we were told to steer clear of the tacos by the waitress - she didn't elaborate and we didn't ask....of course she suggested all the high priced entree's, but this was lunch and we didn't want to get stuffed.

I did opt for the Veggie tacos and I was happy with my order - how could you mess that up?   Sweet potato, squash, corn - very fresh tasting.  the sticky rice was interesting, but couldn't really eat it all - very sweet.  

the other two meals ordered was the chimichanga (told it was ok) and a salad with carne asada added ($5 additional charge - not listed on menu and not told during order). 

We were told the fried ice cream was one of the best around (again by our waitress), so we gave it a try - it was one TINY scoop of fried ice cream that was in a deep bowl and COVERED in whip cream, so you couldn't even see the ice cream - the whip cream wasn't even any good.  when we finally were able to get a bite of the ice cream it was just ok....save your money and go get a fro-yo at mojo's in the mall. 

although, I enjoyed my tacos - we probably won't be back - too many other mexican restaurants around that are better - just will have to get into the car....
