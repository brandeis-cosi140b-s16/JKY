Hmmm.  This was just okay.  I was craving mexican food so I sent my hubby here, I told him to get me the mini chimichangas with the queso sauce on the side.  Well, they DID put the queso sauce on the side but it was ice cold. Blech. I tried a bit & it tasted like a mayonnaise sauce. DEF not my cup of tea.  Luckily I ordered a side (errr, extremely tiny) of guacamole which helped save the chimis.  They were pretty flavorful but so unbelievably greasy.  The bottom of the carton was just covered in grease. I started to feel sick to my stomach after the fist mini chimi due to the amount of grease.  The beans & rice were very tasty & I loved the guacamole.  We will come back but next time I won't be getting anything fried.
