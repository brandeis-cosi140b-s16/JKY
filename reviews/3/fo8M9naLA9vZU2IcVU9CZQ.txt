This is not gourmet dining but standard average ameri-mexi food served with really great drinks. I had an Italian margarita (made with Amaretto Disaronno) and much better than tequila and small and sweet enough to really enjoy. Food was fresh and tasty but nothing really special; portions large. For instance, I had chipotle shrimp salad which had lots of fresh lettuce, corn and tomatoes and plenty of nicely spiced shrimp but the shrimp were frozen and then cooked (but not done too badly). Atmosphere is lively and the location is handy (near MGM etc.). We had to demand service as the wait staff seem overly occupied in something else but once they realized we wanted drinks and food, they moved. Probably won't go here again as it's just not good enough for the price charged (except maybe go in for a drink and the music which I understand happens later).
