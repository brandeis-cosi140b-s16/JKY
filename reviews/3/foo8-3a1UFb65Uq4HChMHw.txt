OK, this isn't stellar mexican food, but pretty darn good drinking snacks, and they're cheap.

this place used to be a dumpy little mostly outside bar right across the street from ASU (i spent many a lunch break doing homework in the sunshine, corona in hand...that was financial aid well spent). anyway, the bathrooms were always flooded, trashed and had crooked saloon doors in one stall a shower curtain for privacy -you can imagine how many drunk girls ended up seeing your goods on a friday at 130 a.m.

but that's neither here nor there, because NOW they have this huge, brand new building on 8th street, just off of university and rural. i mean HUGE. it's again, mostly outside, and the two-story open air building is centered around a courtyard that for years has this fountain in the middle with no water. i think the idea was to have a shallow swimming/soaking area for drunk girls to be talked into skinny dipping in but it just never came to fruition, alas, they threw some bar stool around it and a counter and made an extra pit stop for $3 coronas (used to be $2 coronas at the old locaion, boo).

it's a pretty rowdy college crowd here, you've been warned!

update:
just went there last night for happy hour... coronas are $2 for HH. really, really, really cheesy crowd for a HH friday. and you can bring your dog here during the day, after the sun goes down, pups gotta go, though. their motto is "a great place to day drink." i'll say i agree.
