So I went here...and ya know...it looks like a typical chain midwestern wanna be legit mexican place...but if you can embrace the kitchiness of the decor and the fact that all these indie restaurants in cenpho really want that honky tonk mix to take away from their pretentious regular 'im a starving-emo-distraught-artist that can afford to drop ten bucks on a bowl of oatmeal' crowd...this place just naturally has it...

and the food wasn't quite authentic...but it was pretty good nonetheless...and i was in the mood for white wine (thankfully im not picky) but they skip the classy i'm only filling your glass 1/3 of the way deal...they give you the college pour...and i like it that way

so if you're in the neighborhood and avoiding other chainy options...this is at least middle of the road...
