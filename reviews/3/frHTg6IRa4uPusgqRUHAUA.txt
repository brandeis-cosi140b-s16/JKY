Booked an 8:30 reservation for 9 people not knowing the restaurant closed at 9. At 9:30 we were told last call for food and alcohol. They were not willing to stay open to accommodate us knowing weeks ahead with a pre ordered menu we were here for a bachelorette party. Service was rushed and unorganized. Drinks were brought out one at a time and plates were cleared slowly albeit being finished for a long time. Had to ask multiple times for water refill. Food was decent but, disappointing experience overall.
