This was a pretty good mexican food place, I gotta say. The chips and salsa was good but the chile could have used more heat. I ordered the cheese enchiladas w/ hot (comes in either hot or mild) enchilada sauce. It was a bit too hot, if i ordered this again i'd get mild. My bf ordered the shredded beef red chile -which was good, very good, came out just as we pictured it. The rice was good but pretty spicy, gotta say i've never had spicy rice before. The beans were good - and covered in cheese. just like everything else. I would definitely recommend trying this place. I cannot give this place more than 3 stars b/c what kind of mexican restaurant doesn't serve menudo?? and like i said the chile needed more heat.  :)
please note: this place was packed at 11:30 on a saturday afternoon and its all by itself - out pretty far past downtown henderson.
