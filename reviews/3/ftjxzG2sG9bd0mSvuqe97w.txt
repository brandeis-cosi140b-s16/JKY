I'm not a huge Nacho Daddy fan.  We stopped in to grab a bloody mary (from the all you can drink bloody mary bar), and a quick snack before heading out on a house hunting journey.  

We ordered spinach dip with green chili's and pico de gallo on top...it came out flaming hot and it was great.  The triple colored chips on the side were less than desirable, they were overly soaked in oil which left most of them like chewing on a rubber tire.  We ordered a serving of nachos (I can't remember which one, but I don't think that's important) because they were actually really good, however the portion size was OUT OF CONTROL!  I felt like it could have fed a small country, and it was completely unnecessary.  I'm pretty sure the portion size was so large it deserved to be on an episode of Man vs Food.  I felt guilty leaving the amount of food that I left, but let's be honest you can't take nachos to go.  

My daughter's mac and cheese was great...no Kraft mac and cheese.

I will be back because I love mexican food, but I will alter what I order so I don't leave feeling like I wasted enough food to save a starving country.
