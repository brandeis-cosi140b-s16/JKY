One of the best places to grab a bite in the hard rock! It definitely fits the vibe that Hard Rock Hotel tries to put out.

The best thing here are the Pink Taco's... their specialty.  Definitely give them a try if you are only going to come here once.  

They also have a nice happy hour special... with 1 dollar tacos and margaritas (the frozen kind).  The tacos are a lot smaller than the usual... but at 1 buck each... buy a whole butt load of them!

All meals come with free chips and 3 different salsa/sauces.. chipotle is definitely the best... save some of that for your taco's too.

If you are looking for some good mexican food on the strip, give it a shot! The food tastes authentic and the price won't hurt your wallet.
