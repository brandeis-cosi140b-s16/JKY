My first time coming to Chronic Tacos was during my lunch break. The line was to the door. It was about a 40min wait for me. I was getting a little frustrated cause I was taking a step every 10mins. I finally place an order and my burrito was alright. My carnitas that I had were dry. Was not a good experience for my first time here.
