Although this is really a 3 star place, I am tempted to give them 4 stars because in the wasteland of overpriced mediocre food that is the Las Vegas food scene, this place is actually not bad! Fresh handmade tortillas and really GOOD salsas. Grilled chicken tacos were tasty and reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend them if you're looking for a place to have lunch or casual dinner.
