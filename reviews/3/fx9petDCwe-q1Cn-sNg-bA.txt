Not sure about this place. The menu was lackluster, the cocktails were minimal. Had to pay for chips and salsa and didn't even get real salsa. Got a green and a red sauce in ketchup bottles. My boyfriend and I ordered the carne asada tacos which he absolutely loved while I was busy trying to get rid of all the grizzle from the meat.  I don't recommend.
