Except for Salsa, which is very good....food is just average.   Chicken and steak fajitas were mostly green peppers and onions with very small pieces of chicken and steak...flavor was ok.  Other folks had beef taco plate and chicken burritos...also all very average.

My server was great...friendly...attentive.    If you're in a pinch or coming out of the Harris Teeter it is a "functional" Mexican restaurant
