I can think of a lot of things for Pink Taco and they sure aren't Mexican.  Well actually, it can be.  But ... nevermind.

I still can't figure out why this place is called Pink Taco.  Is it a ploy by the Hard Rock?  The people behind Rehab in the pool?  Is it a cruel joke for the local cuisine in Tijuana?  Nonetheless, people love getting their picture taken here for laughs and future giggles for dirty minds everywhere.  What most people didn't know is that it actually serves decent and expensive Mexican food.

Modeled closely after the neon lights beyond the border towns (.i.e La Frontera!) like Tijuana, this hip joint is bright, busy, and can get intensely crowded.  Like every place here at the Hard Rock, its super trendy and that may be a turn off for some die hard Mexican food lovers.  But environment only has so much to do with the food, as the tacos themselves take the top priority.

Don't expect taco stand prices here, as an appetizer may run you for a cool $16.  The tacos themselves are expertly prepared and look like they're out of a cooking magazine as they're so pretty.  I would even go as far as to say I had one of the best fish tacos here outside of Mexico and San Diego, all right here at this glamorized Mexican restaurant.
