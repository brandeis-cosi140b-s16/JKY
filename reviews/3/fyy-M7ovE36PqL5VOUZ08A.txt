Aye, Pancho's!   
When you're good, you're very, very good, but when you're bad, you're horrid!

Okay, so here's the secret to a potentially enjoyable, or at least tolerable, dining experience in a cheap ass dive of a restaurant:
Go knowing it'll suck.  Go because it is a consistent suck, and the suck you know is better than the suck you don't.
You may end up pleasantly surprised.  Happens to me all the time.

(If you don't expect it to taste like a PIZZA at all, a Totino's frozen cracker with sauce and toppings can actaully be a little tasty.)

Pancho's has all that I love in a cheapo boofay.  There's a lot of variety to choose from, and of course, as much as you can stuff in your gullet.  They even have the added benefit of a server to bring you your seconds and beyond.  I just wish the food was more consistent.
If you go on a day that the cooks know what they're doing with the fryer, it makes all the difference in the world.  There are a lot of items that are cooked that way - chicken taquitos, turkey flautas, tortilla chips, sopaipillas, etc - that are so good when they achieve the proper consistency on the delicate "Crispy~Greasy Spectrum", but so nasty when they are not.
The salsas are actually pretty good.  They have a few from which to choose, from mild and tomatoey to a chunky&HOT roasted number.  They used to have one of the better tomatillo salsa verdes I've had, but I don't think they make it anymore.

Your best bet seems to be to avoid the busiest times with the most children.  Lunch or late weeknights should be okay.  Unless you're bringing a group of kids, who should LOVE IT here.

On bad days, it's easily a 1, but on good days it can be a 3.5, so I'm going with a rating of 3, as long as you go knowing what to expect.

To a realist, the glass is always full - half with water, half with air.  
I eat at crappy places and enjoy it.
Stone me.
