Food is good. I like the skirt steak taco bowl (although it said it was supposed to come with guacamole and mine had none) and the sweet corn avocado caesar salad. However I would say the service is below average. And last time I went with my boyfriend I was so excited to order the Toasted Coconut Margarita and it was literally a coconut full of tequila. Instead of remaking it they brought me over a small glass of coconut water to add to it. Not impressed. 

Overall it's okay. I will probably stick to getting take out lunch from now on.
