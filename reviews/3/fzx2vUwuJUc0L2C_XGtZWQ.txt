They have a confusing system of ordering first at one of the two cooking stations then paying at one of the two cashier stations you hope have an employee at them so you know where to pay. I was so confused for the first 10 minutes I was there. That, and my arm got burned by a fleck of something that came off the grill across the way while I was just waiting for my food. I asked for a cup for water and was given one, but they didn't have a dispenser for water at either of their two drink fountains! I tried pulling the little tab under the Sprite that is normally water, but all I got was super flat and disgusting tasting Sprite. I  was super irritated!

Apart from that, the spicy pork tacos are epically amazing and deserve 5 stars alone. I wasn't a fan of any of the other tacos.

I soooo had wished my experience would've been better so I could justify going back here for more tacos. Make sure to ask for everything on them, cause the extra additions and sauces make the tacos taste so much better.
