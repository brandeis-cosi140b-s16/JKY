After waiting an hour and calling three cab companies we were fianlly able to get to the bar. 

Flicka's is pretty spacious. They have inside seating and an outdoor patio with heat lamps. I went on A Saturday around 6p. so not too many people were there.
The services was scare and it was very slow to get our food.
The prices are NICE! I got a dozen wings, two beers, and a side of french fries for seventeen dollars.

The wings were good: hot spicy, and saucy with just the right amount of meat.

If I ever wind up back in Scottsdale, I'll head back here.
