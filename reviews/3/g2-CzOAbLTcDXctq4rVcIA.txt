The place has amazing food. Tacos. Burritos. Chips. All of it tastes great. The only thing holding me back from a 4 star review is that this place is a zoo at lunch time.  Yes every place is busy at lunch...as expected. But often this location has a line out the door. The food is good....but not that good. Try a pick up order if you are in a hurry.
