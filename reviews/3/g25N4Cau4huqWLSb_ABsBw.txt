This isn't authentic Mexican food, but it is very fresh and pretty good. The beans are excellent and their sauces are great. The food is made right in front of you, which is awesome, but the lines can get very long and when they do, if you have a plate going through the oven to warm, it might come out half warmed up. A few times this has happened with my cheese enchiladas, with the cheese inside being only half melted and the rest still cold shreds. It's pretty pricey for what you get, but they do have a punch card for every ten meals you buy you get one free thing.
