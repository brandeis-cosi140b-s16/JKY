I split a burrito bowl with the S.O.  We get the brown rice, black beans, double chicken, fajita veggies, several salsas, and guac.  It was more than enough for both of us, and for fast food, it doesn't get much more healthy than that.  This specific location would benefit from more umbrellas outside: there are plenty of tables and ONE umbrella. It's not brain surgery, folks.
