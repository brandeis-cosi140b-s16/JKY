Popped in for lunch during a family weekend afternoon out and about.  Lunch menu was very affordable and had lots of choices of the usual american-mexican fare.  Eveyone enjoyed their food ... nothing mind-blowing, but it was good for what it was.  Service was very good (though the place was very quiet that day, so there was no excuse for it to be otherwise).
