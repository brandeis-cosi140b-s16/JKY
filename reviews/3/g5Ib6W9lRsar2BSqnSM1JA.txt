When Mar Y Tierra closed, a small piece of my heart broke.  Lucky for me, Mar Y Tierra has been reincarnated in Anita's Mexican Grill.  

Anita's serves almost the same food that Mar Y Tierra had - but adds some chicken and burgers as well - covering the grill part.

This is mainly a takeout place, with only a few tables inside.  To order, you walk up to the counter and they'll call out your name or bring out your order when its done.
