Stopped here for lunch. We were seated immediately and the place seems very clean. The people that waited on us were efficient and friendly. There is a sign in the window for $2 Margaritas, but we did not try them. Food came out fast, and it was nice and hot. I had the 3 tacos with carnitas and my dining companion had a molé burrito. The carnitas were really tasty and the tacos had a lot of filling. I am not a fan of molé but my lunch partner said the burrito was good. Both came with traditional rice and beans. One disappointing thing was chips and salsa are not complimentary, and we did not pay the additional charge to order any. I think that should be automatic at a Mexican restaurant. Would definitely return, solid food, reasonable prices. Throw in chips and salsa and that would even raise it up a star!
