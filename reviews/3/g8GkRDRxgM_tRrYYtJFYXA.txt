Chipotle is hit or miss. At times they give you a ton of meat and the burrito can be a mixture of deliciousness. Other times i feel like they pour on the rice and sprinkle the meat. My go-to move is always the carnitas burrito. Overall you can't go wrong if you're craving an americanized version of fast mexican food. I also hate it how they get mad when you ask them to mix up the fillings, as if it's that big of a deal.
