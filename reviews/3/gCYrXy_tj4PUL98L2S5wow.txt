It's been awhile since I tried dining at El Burrito Mexican Restaurant, and my memory of the place was pretty accurate.  It was good food, but not the most amazing service.  I can't remember what happened last time, but this time we had a bunch of weird occurrences.  The wait staff kept changing on us, and they were somewhat awkward.   We got the incorrect amount of change.  Nothing major, so I'll give this place 3 stars.  If their service improved, it'd be a solid 4 star.
