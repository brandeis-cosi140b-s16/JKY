Great food, but my order gets messed almost every time up.
Today, Arizona burrito was missing and 2 sides of guacamole MIA....
Last visit my French fries were MIA......
I wouldn't mind but it gets expensive ordering food you never get!!!
Going to trying some other Mexican restaurants in the area because this is getting old!!!!!!!
