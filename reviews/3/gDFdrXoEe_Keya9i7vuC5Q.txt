We came for lunch on a Saturday. Menu is limited but a few lunch items. 

Chips and salsa were good. I had 2 tacos with chicken an soft corn tortillas. The chicken was good.

The rice was dry and crunchy and the beans were okay. Kids got a cheeseburger and chicken tenders, not the average choice at Mexican and they did not like. 

Overall, for the price, it was just okay and we will keep searching for 'the' Mexican spot.
