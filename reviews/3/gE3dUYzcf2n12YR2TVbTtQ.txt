I gotta say I like Eri's brother Fili much better. Or is it a sister. I'm not sure. While I devoured the carnitas tacos in my car at Filibertos, happily, with a smile and even a sense of danger...the goods I've had at Eribertos have left my mouth dry, unfulfilled and on one occasion, injured. Yes. I said injured. Keep reading. Rickie likes the Americana Burrito for breakfast...had it twice...both times too dry for me. No beans? I've eaten the carne asada and carnitas tacos...both just OK...I like my carnitas to be both succulent and crispy. Did I just say succulent? So I'm not always fulfilled...as I am with a carnitas tacos from Fiiberto's. AND then there was the time when I bit into some strange foreign object...and by foreign object I do not mean Aziz Ansari. Though biting into him might be mighty tasty. The drive thru guys are uber friendly. I wonder sometimes though, does anyone ever go inside? Fili. Eri. Whatev. Just glad when I need a fix I don't have to get outta my car! Buenos Nachos My Yelpitas!
