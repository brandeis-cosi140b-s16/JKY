Large helpings of somewhat bland Mexican food.  The staff is friendly, though.  Being vegetarian I am always looking for something BESIDES a combo of bean burrito, cheese enchilada, rice and beans.  This place (and all the other related locations like El Toro and El Toro Bravo) did not give me a whole lot of exciting options.  It all seems to come covered in overly salty red sauce.
