Ok, so I grew up with Carlos O'Brien (the one in N Scottsdale), So I am certainly biased about the food here. I like it, it's nothing special, it's nothing amazing, it definitely isn't authentic, but it reminds me of my childhood. This was my first visit to this location and it was as good or better than the other location. I had a cheese crisp, and it came out waaay underdone...I sent it back (which I rarely do), but they threw it back in the oven and it came out crispy and tasty. The service was good and this location is HUGE. Anyway, I would go back for 'Arizona' Mexican food.
