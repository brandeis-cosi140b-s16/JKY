Food was great.  Service was fantastic.   Chips and salsa were delish.  

However, I will not be going back.  Why, you ask?  The place is filthy.  If the front of the house is that dirty, just imagine what the kitchen looks like.  The walls were covered in soda, salsa, dust, and who knows what else. 

I am bummed to have found such yummy food in such a dirty place.
