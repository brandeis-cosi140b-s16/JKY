I got 2 Grande Chicken Avocados Tacos.  They were just ok.  I was expecting a lot more for the "Grande" title - I was left pretty hungry and they were not so flavorful that I was willing to spend another $3 for another one.  As far as fast food is concerned service was fine and the food was ok, price is a bit high I think - there are other Mexican fast food places I'd go based on taste, cost and quantity.  Thanks.
