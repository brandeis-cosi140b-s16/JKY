I'd have to say this was average for most divey little Mexican places.  Being so close to the freeway you are likely to pass right by without a second thought.  You can't judge a book by its cover because while the outside says Ugh, the inside of the place is done up very well with thick lacquered wood chairs straight out of a Mexican church.

I was super excited because everyone raved on the salsa, which I have to say was quite a disappointment.  The green was definitely spicy but had absolutely no flavor to it whatsoever, I think I could have accomplished the same thing by mixing cayenne with a corn starch slurry.  The red had a little heat but the overpowering flavor was oregano, not my favorite herb for salsa, where's the cilantro?!?

The cheese enchilada with rice and beans I ordered is what saved the place.  It was a decent portion of food and tasted great.  A co-worker had the carne asada and I don't think the steak was even marinated and was griddle grilled so it didn't have any char flavor either, it was saved by the guacamole whihc wasn't anything to rave about either.

If you work downtown and are looking for somewhere new, close, and inexpensive for Mexican food, it's definitely a place to try at least once to gauge against others.
