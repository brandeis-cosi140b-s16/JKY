I've had Los Antojos bookmarked for quite some time and I had a show not too far away so I took the opportunity to remove a bookmark.

Based on recommendations from Yelp friends I read, the consommé was a no brain order.  I added two tacos to the order also, one pollo con mole and one al pastor.

Two things keep this from being a four star review.  The consommé was only lukewarm and should have been hotter.  The flavors were excellent, however.  The tacos were good but it was my mistake to order them at the same time I ordered the soup.  They sat there as I finished my soup.  This was my error.

When I return, I'll order like I would at a tapas place and enjoy each part while it's hot, hopefully, and then order the next dish.

The room is small and very pleasant.  I was surprised by the lack of customers because the parking lot was filled.  Someone pulling out gave me a spot.  There are so many places in this small plaza that I can see where parking would be an issue.
