My wife and I really enjoyed the food and the salsa. We also had very good service and did not experience any of the negative things that I had seen on Yelp. That being said, I have to mark them down because their prices are absurd! It's Mexican food- tortillas, chicken, beans, and cheese... You can't charge me $13 for that! That is more than my steak, salad, and side at Outback... Twice the price of a meal at Costa Vida (which is a Mexican grill in the same strip mall)!
