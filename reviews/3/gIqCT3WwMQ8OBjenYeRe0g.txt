Tried the burritos hoping it was better than the last one I went to. It was a little better but not authentic enough. The steak was not cooked fresh. It seemed as if it was cooked earlier today and was reheated. This is probably why they served it so quick. They poured too much cheese over the burrito. We asked for guacamole and we got slices of avocado. They do not have unsweetened tea. The waitress was new and was friendly. According to the pictures I see here in yelp looks pretty good like the tacos. I'll probably give a second chance and try a different order. Coming from California it's just I've had great Mexican food and I've been to a lot of them.
