This place is just average, 

It is a fast fix for me. 
Service is usually always excellent and food is always the same. 

One thing that I do absolutely love is the fast that they introduced tofu into their menu. I have tried it and it is super good. 

It is also really convenient for me as it is close by my house. So it is super good in and out when you want quick fix.

Thanks chipottle again for bringing tofu in!
