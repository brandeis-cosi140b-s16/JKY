Was hungry for quick Mexican food, so I stopped by this place.  I've passed by it a hundred times and finally decided to try it.

This place reminds me of Qdoba & Chipotle.

I ordered the Nachos & a Quesadilla.  The Nachos were tasty, but I thought that they drenched it in the ingredients and the bottom half of the dish was soggy....I hate that.  The Quesadilla was good...not great, just good.

The service was ok....they didn't offer me all of the fixings...I had to ask for guacamole & green salsa, it wasn't offered....this is unusual for a place like this.  Normally, they try to upsell the hell out of you with the extras.

Will I return?  Maybe.  I still like Qdoba & Chipotle better.
