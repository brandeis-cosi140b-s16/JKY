3 stars = average.  Nino's service was excellent but the food was nothing special.  As others say, order the HOT salsa and mix it with the red salsa and it's delicious.  I ordered a la carte a chile relleno and beef tostada.  Both were good but I prefer the beef tostada from Federico's (Lk Pleasant) where they add saut√©ed bell peppers and onions.  Husband had a combo platter and said it was ok but the taco was lame with hard taco shells, like from a box. He was disappointed they don't have jalapenos so won't come back!   Even though it's a fast food place, we prefer Federico's soft shell tacos.  Nino's also smothers on the melted cheese if you like that.
