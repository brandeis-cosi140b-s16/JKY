Love the chips and queso, tempura fish taco is kind of gross, mushy and really "fishy" smelling and tasting.  The chicken fajita taco is good, shredded beef taco and grilled shrimp taco are my favorites.  For some reason the wait for food is a tad longer than you would expect, that doesn't bother me though, I usually am not in a rush, it's all good.  $1.75 tacos on Tuesday and they also serve alcohol :)
