Let me start off by stating THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS.

RESTAURANT: Very spacious. There are lots of tables that a person can sit with and they are very good for groups.

DRINKS: This was quite the ordeal! I asked for a strawberry mango FROZEN daiquiri. It came out as mango and I asked where the strawberry mango one was and the waitress said it was coming and this was the regular mango. However, my friend and I both ordered the strawberry mango. The drink comes out again....watery, with NO alcohol. Really?? So I told them the drink was wrong again and it needed alcohol. They brought the drink out again with the rum on top [my friend didnt want the drink at this point] and still watery. I then had to ask them whether the drink was frozen. FINALLY THE FOURTH TIME MY DRINK CAME OUT OK. $6.75 and the manager did not apologize nor make any accommodations on the menu. Which is fine, but you should have apologized. The waitress only understood what was wrong with the drink once I said it in Spanish. 

FOOD: The chips and salsa are pretty good. You get them upon sitting down, and the salsa is a little spicy. They are not that cheap, but not too expensive. I had the beef baja empanadas and they were $9. You get three normal [big] empanadas. The value is pretty good however even in the city these are $2 maximum so its a bit pricey. Now they are a Mexican restaurant and I personally do not eat Mexican food especially if it is spicy. Luckily they have other latin dishes. I had rope vieja with yellow rice and maduros. It was sooooo good!!! I ordered an extra side of maduros [fried sweet plantains] and for $4 you get at least 8 of them.

They don't give bags for the food you bring home. Unfortunately because of this I left my food on the table. $35 for just myself. An entree, appetizer, and drink. It was good but all that hassle, SMH!
