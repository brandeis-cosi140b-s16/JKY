Very friendly service and decent Mexican food.

My friend and I were not looking for a complete lunch. She had already eaten and I was on the road. She ordered ice cream and was surprised to see how big the portions were. I ordered the chile relleno off the a la carte menu and was surprised to get a plate of that along with rice and beans. The waiter explained that it was a mistake from the kitchen and I wasn't going to get charged for it.

The chile had a thinner coating than I expected, but it was tasty.

One big minus: I think the tortilla was store bought.
