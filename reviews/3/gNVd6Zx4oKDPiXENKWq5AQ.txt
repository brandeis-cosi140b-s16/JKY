El Burro was basically my last stop in Pittsburgh and I had an awesome time laughing with some friends and eating a mediocre burrito. I got a plain bean and cheese burrito. The cheese was good but the beans were sort of off. I think they had a spice in them that I'm not used to being in refried beans. It reminded me of the beans at Tito's Tacos in LA. Not bad just sort of funky. I was super excited that they had Jarritos. yum.

My friend accidentally ordered a burrito with pico in it and when she realized she asked them, politely, if they could keep it off. Well it was already made and she was very apologetic but still asked if they could make another one. Obviously this sucks for them and they weren't rude about it but they did keep trying to get her to take the one with pico. I know it's a pain to have to remake something, I do get that, but it just started to get kind of weird. The kept saying, "Are you sure you don't like pico? when was the last time you had it? Don't want to try it again?" Yeah, she made a mistake and it's inconvenient and again, they weren't rude, but by the time he finally acquiesced he could have finished the burrito already. 

It's an okay burrito but there's room for improvement.
