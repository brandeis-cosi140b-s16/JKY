Tried this place for the first time a couple of days ago.  I had the chicken tacos and they were pretty good.  My only complaint is the wait time in the drive through line.  I waited about 15 mins for 4 tacos!  There was someone behind me so I couldn't back out and leave.  Next time, if there is a next time, I will go inside.
