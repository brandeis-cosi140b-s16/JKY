It's filibertos. Don't come here expecting top notch food. I've been here countless times and I really like the carne Asada fries and burrito, fish tacos, and there 99c rolled tacos on Mondays. They are never stingy with their meat as someone mentioned before and as far as filibertos in general go, this one is pretty great and the staff is very polite. I've never dined in but the facility looks clean. My favorite thing is the 99c tacos with cheese. Get them with some free green sauce and you've got a decent meal!
