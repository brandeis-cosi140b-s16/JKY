To be honest, I'v only been here after a long day of..uhm... having a good time in Las Vegas..so my review may not be that accurate. The service does seem a bit slow, other than that, I got no issues with the place. The do have an outdoor patio that is quite nice at night. Looking at other reviews, don't come here sober... you will not have a good time. I mean.... some people don't seem to like this place very much.
