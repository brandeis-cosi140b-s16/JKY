This isn't the kind of Mexican food that will change your life. It's the kind that is decent and will fill you up but you won't remember eating it a few hours later. The portions are very small, even by non-American standards. 

My chicken fajitas looked more like an appetizer than a full dinner portion, but at least the chicken was all white meat and the vegetables were high quality. The fixins' side plate was pathetic -- some canned looking refried beans, a messy scoop of bland guacamole and sour cream, one olive (??), a sprinkling of tomatoes (no pico de gallo?), and cheese that had melted atop my beans (I hate this, give me fresh shredded cheese please). Minus a star for the store bought, non-homemade tortillas. I think all Mexican restaurants should care enough to make their corn and flour tortillas fresh on premises. On a positive note, I loved that my fajitas came with a nice, fresh, juicy lime on the side -- a must for me, and I didn't even have to ask!

The queso dip was nothing to write home about, but I've never met a bowl of melty cheese or velveeta that I didn't like. The corn chips are as bad as they look. Since chips are such a crucial element to any Mexican meal, this is where Carlos O'Briens really failed me. 

The atmosphere is very old school and looks sort of like an old Chi-Chi's from the 1980s. Remember those, kids? I had always been curious about this place and finally decided to try it while visiting Arizona. I wouldn't go out of my way to return here, but I wouldn't hate the idea of eating here again either.
