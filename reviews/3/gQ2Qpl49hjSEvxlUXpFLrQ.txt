Uggh!  It's so hard to only give Los Olivos three stars.  I want to give them four really bad but as many other reviews indicate, their food is completely, utterly average and the margaritas that I've had are more like a freez-e-pop on the rocks than a strong, south of the border cocktail.  I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the guy to go to when you're curious if a drink is strong - it takes a lot for me to make a face and ask for more mixer.

That being said, on our dangerous and exciting skateboard margarita tour, Chris R and I asked the camarero to pour some more tequila in there.  He begrudgingly obliged, but that just brought it to a normal margo level.

I've had the fajitas which were good, and the chicken enchiladas which were amazingly average - at least for the prices which are dangerously similar to a certain competing restaurant 1.5 miles south on Scottsdale Road.

Los Olivos could win me over.  The staff is so warm and accommodating and I really like the old school, 'break from Fox Restaurant Concepts' atmosphere.  I'd say give it a shot - this is one of the most bitterly divided set of reviews I've seen!
