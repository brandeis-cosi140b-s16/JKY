Average for an inexpensive Mexican food. Kind of like Filibertos. Service was decent, nothing note worthy. Food - ditto (rolled tacos). As a hater of onions I'm thankful for "traditional" guac at these types if spots that don't have onions I it. Woot woot!

Give them a whirl. It's fast, cheap and not bad
