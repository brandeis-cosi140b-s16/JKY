I had a nice lunch sitting out on the extended patio of Jalapeno's this week.  The sun was shining and it felt warm, the perfect excuse to order a margarita.  The drink was just so-so.  Nothing special.  

The lunch specials are very nicely priced at around $7 for two items.  The plate came hot and the shredded beef taco with the hard shell was quite nice.  The other dish was not memorable....in fact, I cannot even remember what I ordered right now!  

The waitress was nice; I think she has worked here for a long time.  I'll go back and this time I'll start with a beer and then maybe this place will move up to a 4-star rating!
