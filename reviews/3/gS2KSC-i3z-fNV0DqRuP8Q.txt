It pains me to give Chipotle 3 stars, b/c I really love Chipotle - just not in downtown Pittsburgh. Have you read the disclaimer that due to how they source their food (local, fresh, natural, etc.) tastes can differ from geographic region?! Well let me tell you - this is true! 

A Chipotle in NYC is what got me initially hooked to this chain and then living in Chicago with a Chipotle around the block from where I worked solidified its status as a top 5 eating place preference for me. So you can imagine my enthusiasm when I had heard Chipotle was coming downtown (I work downtown). My coworkers didn't have to imagine my enthusiasm they heard about it until I finally got myself down to Chips and had a go. 

I came back sorta like Charlie Brown on a rainy day - head hung low, sad music in the background. I struggled to tell my coworkers that something was just off and the Chips in downtown wasn't all I had hoped. 

I still encouraged them to go, but with a caveat that there are better Chipotles out there and if they go to another city to check them out. While I've gone to this Chipotle a handful of times, I can't help but feel nostalgic about the memories of a 5 star Chipotle.
