I went during a slow time so ordering wasn't terrible, but I can see how it would be annoying if it was packed. I ordered a shrimp taco and a chicken taco. In my opinion they were okay. Not great, not bad. I've had much better authentic tacos out here. I doubt I'll be back... I was just a little underwhelmed with all the hype. :(
