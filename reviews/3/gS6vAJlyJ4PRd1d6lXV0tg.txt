Every time I try this place I'm disappointed. Food is bland and never has enough seasoning.  Come on its Mexican food. The pricing is a joke and overpriced. I tried to order 3 burritos so first the pricing says $5.99 for a burrito.  I think that's normal but it comes with meat, cheese, and cabbage and any options are an additional $1.00 each or more.  Whatever happened to a supreme burrito?  They don't offer it. They want me to build it for $9.  I let Mi Familia know that I was taking my business elsewhere. Too bad they're right around the corner from me.
