I travel to Las Vegas a lot for work and it is nice to eat off the strip with the locals.  This place was recommended to me by a lady I met while out shopping the last time I was here - I asked where her number one pick off the strip would be.  It was a good choice.
  Being from the Los Angeles area I can't say it was the best Mexican fare I have ever tasted but it was tasty and the portion was very large.  I realized half way through my dinner that my steak fajitas tasted more like they were seasoned for tacos... they should have been more flavorful.  Enjoyable nonetheless.  Wrapped it all up with the Platanos 43 (bananas fostered), cinnamon-y and delightful.
  The service was great and the staff was friendly.  Nice atmosphere too.  I would certainly go back.
