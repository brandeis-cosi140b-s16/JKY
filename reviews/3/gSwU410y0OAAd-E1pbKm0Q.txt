I'd give this 3.5 stars. 

It's everything you would expect in your run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant. Free chips n salsa and a HUGE menu with all your classic combinations of the dame handful of ingredients. Reasonably priced for the large portions you get and the quality is good. 

Mostly, If you are craving solid Mexican food this is a great, clean, comfortable option. Nothing too fancy or high end. Just solid Mexican!
