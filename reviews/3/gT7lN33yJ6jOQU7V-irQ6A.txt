Pretty good New Mexican restaurant. The reason for 3 stars is the amount of spice on most if the food. I love spivey food as long as it adds to the taste of the dish. The salsa was a little too spicy for the general public who might not be used to it. The quality of food was really good and the ambiance was casual and inviting.
