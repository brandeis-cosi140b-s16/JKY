Aye chihuahua!

So I'm mucho hambre and it's Christmas at 10pm on a Sunday. Bad combination for finding food out there. 

But lo, I see a shining beacon. Is it the North Star leading me to the new born Baby Jesus? 

NO! It's Eriberto's! Praise the Lord God Almighty!

Arriba, arriba!

I had the California burrito which is potato, cheese, pico de gallo and meat. I ate half of it and somehow it changed from burrito to brick somewhere between my mouth and my poor stomach. 

Would I return? Um... No.
