Chronic Tacos isn't a horrible food court option, but it's not exactly good either. I stopped by for a quick bite before a movie at the theater right next door. It was Taco Tuesday so the food was pretty cheap. 

I'd give the food about 1.5 stars but I bumped up the star rating a bit because of three things: 1. the pico de gallo was super fresh and super good with big, red ripe tomatoes and crunchy onions; 2. it was super cheap since it was taco Tuesday; and 3. it was easy to communicate with the employees: they understand what a low carb bowl means. It was easy to get my taco served in a bowl with no tortilla. Easy! 

I do have to agree with other Yelpers that the food is WAY too salty. If you are sensitive to salt, I don't see how you could ever eat here. I had the carne asada and it literally tasted like the meat had been boiled in salt water and then salted several times after it was cooked. The only flavor profile I really tasted was "salt."
