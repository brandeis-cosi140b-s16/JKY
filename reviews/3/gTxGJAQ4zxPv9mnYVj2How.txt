I hate it when I don't love a place that everyone else loves, but after seeing the reviews and ratings for La Santisima, I expected a lot. I wish my expectations had been met!

This is definitely hard to find, but we were able to park in one of the few spots up front. The parking lot is small, and you might have to park a few blocks away in the nearby neighborhood. If you have a big car, you should probably skip looking for a spot right in front and just park in the neighborhood to save yourself some grief.

The restaurant is small and cramped. Seating is very close, and even during early times, there is a wait. If you don't mind high impact, you'll probably be fine with La Santisima. Service is very slow - there's only a couple people working in the restaurant serving as host/hostess, server, and from what I could tell, bartender. I have to give credit because obviously the two servers were running around like crazy, busting their butts and doing the best they could, but I really think it would be good to hire another person so that you don't have to wait to be seated, wait to receive a menu, wait to receive water, wait to order a drink, wait to order food, wait to receive food, etc. In short - things might be sped up (quite a bit?) if another person worked there.

Salsa bar is nice, but I think bigger cups should be available in addition to the small ones because it's annoying to get up 93874 times for refills. I did love the peanut salsa - spicy and delish. House margaritas are nice, and strong! Quesadillas are delicious and wonderful as an appetizer. I would get them again as a meal.

Tacos... hm. El gaucho tacos had very chewy meat, with little seasoning... bland. Pork tacos are pretty good, but but not wow. Just... hm. Much to be desired. Beans are too salty, but the rice is very good. I don't know. I just expected more flavor and better quality meat.

In sum! Not bad, just OK.
