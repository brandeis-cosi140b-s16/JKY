I went here, ordered a Mexican Coke, an al pastor taco, a carne asada taco and a shrimp ceviche.

My biggest complaint is the so-called guacamole. I read the story of America's mom on the menu. I'm convinced that she would be ashamed of the frozen "guacamole" chubs. ( a chub is a frozen pouch used in prepackaged food).

Yes, I saw the delivery guy bringing them in the front door. ( this us after I scraped it off my tacos)

The meat on the tacos was tasty, but not plentiful. It reminds of the 1990s and Tacos de Mexico - "Home of the fifty cent taco."

For $2.39, it is very small. 

The shrimp ceviche was good. No complaints there.

The place is very clean and no complaints about the service.

I initially thought the name was in reference to over Americanization of the place. For a smaller chain it feels overly commercialized.

I don't know of any of these stores in the land I call home. 

I guess it's ok for fast food, but definitely do yourself a favor and skip the so-called guacamole if you order anything here.

BTW: I'm not a big eater, I'm a small guy. I spent $16.00 and left hungry. If you like a large meal, bring a big wallet.
