Please stop trying to roll my burrito into the size of a baseball, it doesn't make it any bigger and you've already ripped 3 burritos before me.  For $1.95 dallop of guacamole, make sure the avocados are at least ripe.  Guac from unripe avocados is not OK no matter how much you puree it. This is an incredibly busy location and usually the line is backed beyond the entrance. If this location could adapt its resources to handle the traffic better, it would definitely improve the client experience and rating. The shout "WELCOME TO CHIPOTLE" from the service line to the front door...No.
