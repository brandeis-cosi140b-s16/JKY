It was March 17th, St. Patrick's Day. And like every good Irish guy, I decided to wear my pride and do what comes naturally: eat. Only, rather than walk the 3 blocks to Seamus, I instead called in an enchilada order to Los Dos Molinos. And this was after I read some of these reviews. I'm quite daring. You'd think I worked for the IRS.

After hearing horror stories about the crazy hot and spicy red chile, I settled on ordering that for my lunch. Apparently, LDM has either tamed down the flame, because I was able to eat the entire meal without incident. Even the following day I wasn't getting afterburners ignited. So much for heat. But, the flavors were good, the price was great, and the adventure of jaywalking across Washington tied the whole experience nicely together. I'm looking forward to actually getting to eat inside this location, and not just rail it to a fro.

A solid three stars.
