When you walk in it's like taking a step back in time, but considering it's in a historic neighborhood were shabby is chic, it's not bad, lol. 

Service was very friendly, booths are small, food was decent. I heard the people in the booth behind me saying their food was great & I was tempted to turn around & ask what they had but my daughter stopped me short & begged me not to embarrass her, threatening to die if I asked. I decided to be nice & keep her alive, so no idea what they had, but I trust that they liked it :) I had a veggie burger with curly fries & my daughter had a BLT sandwich with regular fries. Both were good, no complaints. 

Oh, & they are open on Sundays, which is not true of many restaurants in that area. Another plus!
