Clean restaurant but some of the light fixtures were missing their covers. Both background music and the TV we're on at the same time which made for a very noisy environment. We had burritos and tacos. I thought the burrito was heavy on the onion. Tacos were good. Flan was fair, and I like a little more syrup.
