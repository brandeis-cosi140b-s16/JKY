The Fundido sauce is the best!  It is sort of like Mexican fast food but the food is good for a quick meal and the price is right.  I would come back because I love the fundido sauce and the quesadilla was very good as well.  The best thing I ate here was the mini chimis.  They were fantastic, better than many high end Mexican restaurants I have been to.
