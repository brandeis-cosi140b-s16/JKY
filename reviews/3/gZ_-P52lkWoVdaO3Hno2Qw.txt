I like this place. I'll probably be back. 
I admire their desire to be different, to be adventurous.

BUT Jaburrito has the same problem that sushi restaurants have. The food has no flavor; you have to add flavor....with sauces and add-ons.

Let's be honest here: rice has no flavor. It's like little pieces of styrofoam. 
Most raw fish has no flavor, other than slightly fishy. 
Now combine all that into a flour tortilla (or soy paper etc) which also has no flavor, and guess what: MORE no flavor. 
Oh sure, lots of TEXTURE, but flavor has left the building.
So slather on the wasabi, the hot sauce etc.

Hmmmm. I wonder about this food strategy.

SO to test my thesis: after I ordered my Jaburrito, I drove a few blocks down the street to Mariana's and ordered a typical carnitas burrito. Then I went home, and ate half of each.

Guess which one had more flavor....and therefore more satisfaction?
At half the price.
