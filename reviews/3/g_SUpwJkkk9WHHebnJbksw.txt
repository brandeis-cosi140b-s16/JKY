A friend took me to Julio G's a few years ago when he and I started talking about  cornbread and green chile tamales.  It was he who recommended Bandera's for the best skillet cornbread!  And so he offered to buy me dinner.

I've passed JG's many times, but never stopped in, bec. I didn't particularly care for the front (or whatever side it is that faces the street) area.  Very colorful, yes, but too much disarray for my brain to process.  However, once inside, I found a clean, still vibrant atmosphere, but less cluttered.

I recall thinking that the green chile tamale was just mediocre in flavor.  I do remember thinking that Jalapeno's (on N. Scottsdale Rd. and Pinnacle Peak?) complimentary appetizer version was so much better. 

That's 1-1 for my friend.  I can't wait to give another reco of his a try soon!
