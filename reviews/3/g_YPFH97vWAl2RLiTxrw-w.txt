I was pretty hyped to go to T&T after seeing they had a wicked happy hour. We were seated immediately and got our drinks within reasonable time. My flautas were rather small and not as flavorful as I had hoped, but good nonetheless. My boyfriends carne asada tacos had some good taste to it but it was still a little dry. Had I not gotten a strong, cheap marg and my bf two beers for 7$, this place wouldn't have had much to offer for us. Maybe we were tired from the drive or we didn't go at the right time, but the Luxor definitely has better eats to offer.
