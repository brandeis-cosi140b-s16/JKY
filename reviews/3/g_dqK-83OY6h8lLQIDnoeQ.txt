Great place of you want to have a lot of Mexican food. Portions were generous for the dinners. Some of the components were in the bland side but overall everything tasted like any other Mexican place. Margaritas were disappointing as they were mostly ice. Service was kind of slow too. I would go back if I am craving Mexican food and don't want to drive very far to get it.
