So, this was our second visit to this location. This was completely unplanned due to a disaster at Betty's Nosh that left us mad and hungry. See that review for more. This time, we kept it simple and ordered the tacos. The beef was seasoned. but could use more umph, and the crispness was just about perfect. Another 10 seconds in the fryer and they may have earned 3.5 stars. The table salsa is one of the more unique among many. The decor is still a miss. Half fast food, half sit down place. Service was good. We will go back if it is convenient, but won't go out of our way.
