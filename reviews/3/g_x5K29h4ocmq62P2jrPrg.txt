We enjoy the experience of eating at Joy Ride; the vibe and decorations are amazing! However, it's a little pricey and the food always seemed rushed even though the wait for a seat and your food is quite long. When we go we always set aside all night because we know we'll be waiting a long time, but it's to be expected in such a trendy area! We LOVE downtown Gilbert!
