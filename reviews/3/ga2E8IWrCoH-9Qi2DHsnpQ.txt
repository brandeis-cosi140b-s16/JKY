We moved from the Glendale area 11 years ago.  Whenever we come back into town, we try and make it here. 
We visited Sunday, August 30th around 3pm
We were seated promptly 
It took a bit to get someone to take our drink orders .  After that, the service was fine. 
If you go, get the Tortilla Soup. This is the best we have ever had and we have been to a LOT of places.
They no longer serve just a carne asada plate, but have a plate with Carne asada. So I had orders that, was disappointed it didn't include beans, but I'm sure it said that on the menu and I just didn't notice it.
Carne Asada was still good
Food was great.
Ambiance, not so much. It just seemed there were a lot of people running around for the 4 tables that were occupied. Dishes dropping, clattering
