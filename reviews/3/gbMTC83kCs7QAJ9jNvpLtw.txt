This is one if the best Taco Bells. They have great customer service! Food has always been fresh. Today my order was messed up when I went through the drive thru and I didn't realize it until I was on the 15 and Sahara where I came to meet my lady for her break. I called I explained the situation to her manager and she immediately offered to fix the order. When I explained that I was on the other side of town she called the Taco Bell nearest me and asked them to place fix the order for me, in addition to she took my info and asked me to come back to her location and she would take additional care. By far the best customer service I have received from a fast food location!
