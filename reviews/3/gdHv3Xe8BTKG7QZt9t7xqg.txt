I got a carne asada burrito here a while back.  I don't remember much about it.  It couldn't have been too bad or too good then I guess.

This time around I got carne asada chips and a cheese quesadilla.  The prices were average.

The carne asada chips had nacho cheese instead of shredded cheese.  I'm not sure if I like that or not.  I was mostly just surprised by it.  The meat was fine.  There wasn't too much beans, which is a good thing.

The quesadilla was a big disappointment.  For paying nearly $3, I expected it to be about twice as big as it was.  The cheese they used wasn't cheddar, I think it was Monterrey jack.  I like Monterrey Jack, but once again it wasn't what I was expecting.  In any case there wasn't enough cheese anyways.

They really need to be telling their customers if they are going to do weird things like use nacho cheese or Monterrey jack.  Nobody should have to be surprised.
