So I went with a friend and right off the bat our waiter seemed preoccupied with something else. Not sure what it was, but it wasn't us, the place wasn't even busy...ANYWAYS besides the service the food was great and the atmosphere was very... southwest?  haha... Spanish? Haha, if you go to a Mexican food place you know what I'm talking about.
