Good food, good prices!

I had a chicken burrito. The meat was was marinated in a piquant, flavorful sauce, and came with lots of fresh cilantro (they asked first).

The tortas looked great, and they are, indeed "gigantes".

The place can only seat 16 or so, and you order at the window.
Definitely my new go-to place for a quick and tasty lunch on the East side of town.

BTW: the old name of the place  - Ay! Jose Takos - is still on the door, but the new name is Las Famosas de Jose.  
Ask Jose - he'll tell ya why.
