Be prepared to be transported back to 1954 in this wood-paneled greasy spoon. The food is decent and the service has always been prompt. They have both traditional American diner fare as well as Mexican options. I've only ever been for breakfast and breakfast burro is indeed tasty. I do wish the Mexican side of the food had a bit more of a kick and freshness, but hey, some bacon and eggs on a lazy weekend morning is fine by me.
