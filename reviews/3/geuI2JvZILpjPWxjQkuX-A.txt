While waiting to be seated at this neat Old Town location, I was reading the notes left by patrons. There were several that stated things like the best Mexican food in Phoenix, Best Mexican food ever. The food is good, not the best I ever had, I would rate it in the top ten Mexican places I have eaten at. I had the pork steak and it was done very good, moist juicy, with a really nice spice rub on it. Lots of food for the price. Salsa Fresca, Beans, Rice and tortilla. House Margarita was just so so. I would go back and I would recommend if you are in the Phoenix Metro area. They don't do separate checks, which sucks if you need an individual receipt for expense accounts.
