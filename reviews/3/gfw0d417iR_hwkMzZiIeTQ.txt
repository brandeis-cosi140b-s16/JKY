Wasn't really impressed by the food, sad to say. I was really looking forward to this place being good but nothing had flavor for me. I order the grilled shrimp, very bland and still had the shell in! I'm mean that's cool and all for the look but when ur fighting with the shell to take out the good part that's a big negative for me. The beans and rice were okay, I tried some of my girlfirends tacos.. I couldn't even tell you what it was cuz the flavor was just nothing exciting for me. Would I come back probably not, would i recommend this place to people i know, most likely not.. Not to post this to steer you away but like I said I wasn't impressed much. The best tasting thing was the fountain drink COKE.
