Went with a few friends here. Crowded. Loved the interior, the ceilings, the attention to detail, the bar, the open kitchen.

Hated the food.

Hated, hated the food.

I'm a bit of a tex-mex snob. Having opened my own tex-mex catering company overseas, I got excited about hearing this new hip place open in Matthews, PURE Taqueria.

We ordered:

    Burritos Americana (w/ Chicken) -$12.99
    3 Pescado Tacos (Fish & Steak) - $10.99

The main problem with their food is that it's tasteless and dry, then there's an overabundance of it on the plate.

The burritos were like an uninteresting mound slapped together. The fish was extremely dry - and with white fish, you need a lot of flavors. A wild guess - reheat from frozen. I repeatedly asked for more lime. The chipotle mayo was a disappointment (more like fatty orange mayo). The guac and tomatillo salsa were good, but I only got a smidge -- nor did I see where the "poblanos" fit in the "poblano" coleslaw. Chips & salsa was probably the best thing of the whole night.

In fact, I hated seeing so much tasteless green on my taco. Travesty.

Boring Mexican rice, and alright black beans.

Too many places like PURE lure you in at first by the attractive, hipster vibe and over rambunctious menu wordings-- but prove there's absolutely no oomf or spark to back those words up.

Would probably go there again for nibbles and drinks, but never again, dinner.
