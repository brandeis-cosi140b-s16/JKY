Must echo Brian O. about the lack of circulation in the booth area. Not good when the temp is 113 degrees, no matter how many times the server refills your water. By the way, our service was good and efficient, and we liked the guacamole prepared tableside. Also, we liked the many vegetarian options and the way the shrimp tacos were prepared. I hardly ever venture out to Glendale, but at least now I know of a decent Mexican restaurant there.
