My first visit to Cilantro was a success- by BFF and I both ordered vegetarian enchiladas, which were stuffed with zucchini, carrots, mushrooms and onions.  They were delicious, as was the accompanying rice, garnished with, guess what? -wait for it-Cilantro! BFF ordered some sort of signature drink made with lemonade, vodka and cilantro- it was a little on the tart side, but overall very good. For dessert- crepes with plantains and goat's milk-YUM!!  Of course, I love plantains, so go figure.

Lunch for two- 2 beverages, 2 enchilada plates, dessert- $39.  Not bad, but I subtracted a star for the $2 charge for chips and salsa.  The salsa was served in ketchup-sized ramekins, so it felt like a bit of a rip-off.  Yes, it's petty, but so is charging for what amounts to a bread basket.
