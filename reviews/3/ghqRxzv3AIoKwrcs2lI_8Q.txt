Went for lunch and based on some hype my group was excited to try the guacamole and margarita's. The group I was with all agreed that the drinks were not good, the bartender needs to revisit the drink list. The guacamole was just okay, the chips were pretty greasy. We really enjoyed the $2 quesadillas and the carne asada tacos, homemade corn tortillas! which were excellent. Will give a second chance.
