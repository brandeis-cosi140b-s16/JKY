I'm kind of disappointed by this place. My friends always hit up the one in Old Town so I figured it had to be good if they were frequently going back. 

Everything was just meh. Nothing was special about the tacos. I ordered the trio with hot salsa and I think my favorite was the carne asada. For the price, you can probably find some better options. This just was just whatever and I had heard so many good things about America's Taco Shop...but if you read the reviews here I guess I wasn't the only person not loving it. Maybe I'll give the original location shot bc this was no better than the many chains circling around.
