This place is hit or miss for me. The prices are good and the food is okay. I would prefer this over Taco Bell any day. I did order the chicken tacos once to go. Once I got them home they were all soggy and looked like a mess and the taste was pretty bad. I only live 5 min's away. Their burritos are good and will  fill you up. Plus you have got love that their open 24 hours a day.
