First of all I quite enjoy the decor of this place. Fun and colorful, many  depicting the harvest of the agave (for mezcal perhaps?).

Second, I open up the menu to find mojarra frita, an authentic traditional dish I've had a few times in the homes of friends. For those who don't know that is a whole fish (tilapia most likely), head included, fried whole and served with tortillas. The dish was moist and with a squeeze of lime and some Valentina it was a pleasent afternoon lunch.

The carne asada my wife had was moist and had pretty good flavor as well. Not amazing but respectable.

On the downside, I wish the fish was served with a bit more avocado than the small sliver I got and perhaps some homemade salsa that would go with it. Also the rice and beans were just ok which is too bad as it gives those two staples of mexican cuisine a poor name (numerous restaurants are guilty of downplaying these two dishes). If done right just give me a place of beans and rice and some flour tortillas and salsa and let me go to town.

Final verdict though is that the people are very friendly and the food is respectable. I will most likely swing by again soon and grab myself a torta.
