This place was decent. It was my fianc√©s and I first experience and Del Taco, and while some things were, some things were also very Meh. We did the drive through, and sat in our car eating it. One thing that all items had in common were that they just felt heavy with grease. we didn't want to put anything down in the car because it would get grease on it. 

The staff was very nice that we interacted with, and I'm sure if you pick better things, maybe you would enjoy things better. We went because of a coupon we received, but honestly...when I saw it pop up in my places I checked into list on Yelp, I could not remember going here. I jogged my memory, and then remembered we actually did. That's what I think of this place.

I personally will most likely not go back, I just love Taco Bell too much!
