I was on a business trip to Madison, WI...and the group there invited me to lunch.  Laredo's is a solid Tex-Mex restaurant...they even had one of my all time favorites, Huevos con Chorizo.  I ordered my fav...and it had a bit of an off flavor, probably just the Chorizo that they used.  It did not have a lot of heat to the sausage, but, overall, was enjoyable.

Service, at lunch, was pretty good...although the check took a few extra minutes.
