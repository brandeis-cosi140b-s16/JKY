This is a little hole in the wall place that's a bit hidden. I only noticed it one day because I saw it driving from the opposite direction. Looks to be family owned and operated, which I appreciate and like. 

My sis and I ordered a torta of carne asada and I got two tacos to go. They had a nice salsa bar selection. I definitely liked the red salsa. The horchata was delicious. 

It's a small little restaurant but there is plenty of indoor seating. 

The food itself was okay, nothing too impressive. I felt like my torta was missing a lot of key ingredients like sour cream and guac. But the staff was very friendly and because of that I would give them another try in the future.
