This place definitely qualifies as a hole in the wall.  The food is cheap and delish.  I've never been inside and I'm just fine with that.  The less I know the better, hence the 3 stars.  I don't eat here often, but when I do it's yummy and fills my tummy.  I don't choose this place for the ambiance.  It's about the food.  My husband has tried a few of their burritos and is always pleased.  I always get the carne asada french fries and they are so good!  Don't let what it looks like on the outside drive you away; give Vaqueros a try!
