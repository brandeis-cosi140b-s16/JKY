It's really great to see Midtown getting some more love. While much of it is filled with chains, it's still progress. And I like progress. 

Situated next to Vitamin World is this new Chipotle. The resto is chock full of clean and shiny tables, smiley employees and swift service. The offerings are typical of other Chipotles - burritos, tacos, burrito bowls, quesadillas, fountain beverages, etc. Yes, they charge for guacamole like all the other Chipotles. But hey, they do say that their focus is on "food with integrity," and that's pretty cool for a fast-ish food chain. 

The side patio is nice to grab a seat and take in some fresh area while you mow down your burrito of choice. There aren't any sweet views from the patio, but hey, outside is outside in CLT.
