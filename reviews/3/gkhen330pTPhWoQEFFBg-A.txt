Saddle-up at the bar.  :)
No, seriously... hop up into a saddle and sit at the bar.
(Note... there is a small dining area that you can sit in as well as an outdoor patio area which I recommend when it's nice outside.)

Hubby and I were out roaming around on a Saturday.... so we had a brew and a snack (shared the beef hot dog) before we continued roaming around.  The folks here are a little rough around  the edges but nice. 
The beef hot dog was excellent... and the pretzel bun that it was served on was Spot On!  I gotta find me some pretzel hot dog buns.  :)

For the females... check out the bathroom... super cute.  :)
Guys... I have no idea what they have in your bathroom so I can't say.  LOL!
