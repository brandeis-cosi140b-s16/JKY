I always say it's so hard to review chains.  This Taco Bell is located close to my home.  This is where I am torn.  It's also next to Roberto's Taco Shop.  I actually enjoy some taco bell every once and while.  I really think the only reason I go is because of the drive thru.  When you have 2 kids in the back of the car, it's kind of hard to unload the kids and get down sometimes.  

When I go to taco I usually order the same 'ol things.  I get a bean burrito and some nachos.  The food is ok. I have left this taco bell missing some items, so that gets annoying.  Overall it's a taco bell.  Chains are consistent.  What ever you get here in Las Vegas will be the same in Texas and other place in the country.  The restaurant stays pretty clean when I do go inside and the workers usually look pretty happy.  If you want something specific from Taco Bell then check it out.  Otherwise, there are plenty of other fast Mexican food joints close by.  Cheers!
