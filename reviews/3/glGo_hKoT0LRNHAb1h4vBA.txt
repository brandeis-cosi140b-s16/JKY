Where do I begin? I think I had so high hopes for Los Reyes that set the bar too high. I was craving the El Rey and ordered it as soon as I say down. To be honest te torta was just alright. I mean I actually finished it, but I felt like I had to keep eating it to like it more. It was just alright...I wouldn't order it again. I think it just too much going on in the sandwich I couldn't really like it. 

Now my wife had the carna asalda tacos and they were very good! I found myself wishing I would have ordered the tacos. 3 giant sized tacos good deal for the price. 

I will actually return to Los Reyes. I want to try the chicken torta next time and some tacos too. I wouldn't rate my experience bad here...just average. Hopefully I'll like it better next time not ordering the El Rey!!
