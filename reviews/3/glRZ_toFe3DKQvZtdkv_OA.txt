Pleasantly surprised.  After some bad experiences at a North Phoenix Manuel's, I hadn't tried another one in years.  But today it was close and well... I'm glad I went.  

I was able to get a table at 1pm - and there was only other one couple in eye shot. Part of that is because there are lots of little alcoves for eating, and part of it is because they serve the food so quickly that if you got there at noon you're out the door by 1pm easily.  I'm willing to give it that excuse because both the service and the food were quite good.  Their rice and beans aren't anything to write home about, but they weren't so bad that it took away from the meal.  

My only negative, and this could be why there were fewer folks, is that not only do they have a pretty limited lunch menu, with much smaller portions, but they aren't really "lunch special" prices.  Their lunch menu ran from $7-10 with most things $8-9.  Considering the full sized meals with more options were available for just $1-$2 more, why not get the larger size and a doggie bag for dinner?  

Not a bad spot, but didn't exactly rock my world either.  Ideally - 3 1/2 stars.
