Cute little family owned place. Stopped by around 9pm and they were about to close, but still very accommodating to us. Started with the soup and salad, pretty good soup. I've never really had super authentic Mexican food, so I didn't know what to expect.

We got nachos to share as an appetizer... you can get half or full size, but since there was 3 of us, we got the full size and added beef. It was HUGE! And delicious. Barely had room for the main course afterwards, but it's okay. I enjoyed it quite a bit.

For the main course we had the guac burrito. Also very big, couldn't finish it. But it was pretty good I guess? Don't have much to compare to. Flavor is definitely better than at the chain mexican places, more "real" taste, but very rich and filling.

For dessert, which we were too full to have but I needed to try it, was the fried ice cream. Never had fried ice cream before.. so I was excited to try. It was good, but I definitely prefer tempura ice cream from japanese restaurants.

Great little place though. Nice friendly service. Food comes out relatively quickly. I would give it 3.5 stars, but sinec i can't I round down since I didn't feel super impressed.
