Not in the best neighborhood, but the food is pretty good here. They serve a small complimentary ceviche de camarón plus chips and salsa. Had the fajitas mixto, which comes with shrimp, steak, and chicken. I also ordered a modelo especial michelada. My girlfriend ordered a carne asada taco and fried shrimp taco, lots of meat on both. It was all very tasty. They have live music in the evenings. I went on a Wednesday and they had a norteño band that started at 6pm. If you plan to have a conversation during your meal, get there before 6pm because the music is loud.
