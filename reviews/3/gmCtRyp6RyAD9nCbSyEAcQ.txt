Average food at a fair price. Very basic decor. Staff seems a bit overwhelmed but all are very nice. 

I had carne assada and wifey had soft tacos. I ordered a patron marguerita which was good! Our waitress was running from table to table so we didn't see her at all until we were finished eating. She dropped out check and left. We weren't asked for drink refills or desserts. 

Overall, This is not bad fast food with a liquor license. We'd come back in a pinch but this won't be on the go to list.
