Now THIS is a Fish Taco :D 

Fried fresh when you order it, the fish taco is crispy, golden, flakey and all around just plain delicious! It's also HUGE....like, literally-cannot-fit-in-my mouth huge! I probably haven't had such a good fish taco since The Best Fish Taco in Ensanada.  It comes in a double corn tortilla and topped generously with pico de gallo (which is very jalapeno heavy), shredded cabbage and sauce. 

I also ordered Carne Asada Fries, because...well, I'm a fatty.  Sadly, these fries were not nearly as great as the fish tacos. In fact, they were pretty bad - salty and with not much on it, just meat and cheese. No guac in sight! No onions. Meat was overly salty and kinda reminiscent of ground beef....bleh

The salsa bar is super fresh, but not for the faint of heart! Stay away from the pale green sauce unless you want to die a fiery spicy death....my mouth still hurts so bad....

Service is friendly, but like previously mentioned by Stephany V, it's a one man show, so this is definitely not fast food.  Mexican telenovellas playing on the TV give the place an authentic feel :)
