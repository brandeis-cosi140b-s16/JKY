I like the Matador. The food is not Gourmet, but everyone in our group enjoyed it. The prices are reasonable ($10-12 entree and sides). Some of the wait staff is a but slow, but the place is enjoyable and if you are not in a hurry, just sit back and enjoy. It is actually Greek owned and the Shrimp a-la-Mike is an amazing dish that I have cravings for. I usually order the Combination Mexican plate. The bar is rather eclectic. The patio is great when the weather is nice. Park in the Garage (enter on 2nd. Street off Adams) and get them to validate and it is only a couple bucks. I hope my review helps you see there are issues, but also it is a place that I look forward to going to just know what to expect and you will enjoy it.
