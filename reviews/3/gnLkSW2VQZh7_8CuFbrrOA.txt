I am struggling to find the positives in Cafe Rio.  Since I have no issues listing the negatives, I'll start there.

First, the interior of the restaurant.  I appreciate what it wants to be looking kind of beach shack meets TexMex but seating is an issue.  There is plenty of it but the restaurant is not big enough.  People are squeezing between chairs and walls just to get to one of the few available tables.  Not too comfortable.  I have a problem with the menu too.  It lists the options and gives a price but not much else.  It gives a starting price and shows you meat options but most options are an extra charge.  What I really wanted would have brought my burrito and fountain drink to well over $10.  For a fast food place? Get real.  So I got the pulled chicken because it was cheaper.  I was disappointed with it.  The chicken was too salty.  The beans in my burrito were good but the rice reminded me of cheap instant rice.  It was not as good as the rice at Chipotle.  The burrito on the whole was alright.  It was big and filling though I've tasted better.  Furthermore, I like to be able to pick up  my burritos and eat with my hands.  I cannot do that at Cafe Rio.  The burritos are rolled loose and are rather saucey.  Too hard to eat with the hands, that is for sure.

On to the positives.  I like the ice at the soda fountain.  And the iced tea was good.  As I mentioned before, the burrito was filling.  That is a mark in the win column.  I like that the tortillas and most everything else is made fresh.  I like that you can see it being made fresh.

Overall, this is not my favorite place for a burrito.  I would rather go to Chipotle or Q'Doba.  In my opinion, they are better and even a little more affordable.
