It's your regular Mexican Fast Food.  Really only good to order and take it back to work or home.  I really like their salads here and it's all I'll order.  But, after my friend found a hair in her food, I kinda freaked out.  Because of that, I don't have the appetite to order from them anymore.  Just the thought of it makes me want to gag.
