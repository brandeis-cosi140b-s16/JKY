I thought this place was pretty cool. Food is good too. It's very similiar to Pink Taco in Scottsdale which is a little bogus, but still, the Chandler mall really needed a casual yet trendy spot like this. The service is good. Both times I went were in the day though. I can say I seemed to get a little more attention when I sat inside versus the patio. They only had a couple TVS that you can only see from the bar. The menu is a little pricey. I think their items are mostly a la carte. But again, good place for lunch after a day of shopping and they have a very creative drink menu. Bueno!
