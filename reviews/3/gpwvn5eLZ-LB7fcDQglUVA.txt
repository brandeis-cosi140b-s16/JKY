I like Chevy's.  It's "good" Mexican food.  Not great, but good.  It's more Tex-Mex than Mexican.  We like to get the mixed grill.  It has a little shrimp, chicken, steak and pork...something for everyone.  My favorite part of Chevys is the freshly made chips. Yum. The food is a little greasy and the price is a little high, but every once in a while, that's okay.  My trip today was a little disappointing since they messed up my order. Oh well...I'll give them another chance.
