Dined tonight for the first time. Waited 30 minutes. Ordered horchata and mole enchiladas. My daughter ordered lobster and steak. The view was great. The waiters attentive and friendly. However the lobster tasted too fishy and the manager came over and we explained. He proceeded to argue that he hasn't had a complaint before. I told him we know what lobster is supposed to taste like. We've had lobster at Del Frisco's and Benihana's it never tasted like that! He took it off our bill though. Won't dine there again, food is not authentic or tasty. Do not recommend it. Also the horchata was too sweet and the waiter failed to tell me that the chicken mole enchilada where actually cheese enchiladas with a dry large chicken breast on top. The chips tasted burnt and the salsa was too spicy to enjoy. The music too loud. The only reason why I rated it three stars is because the waiters were friendly. And the plate taken off the bill.
