Cute place, very clean. The menu is easy to read that's above the counter, but the menus I'm the table weren't as easy. 
I got an El Pastor and fish street taco. Nicely presented, but the El Pastor too spicy for me and I didn't care for the smoky flavor of the sauce. I barely had any pineapple and the ones that were there were so small I couldn't taste them. The meat was more like a pulled pork, it was moist and had a good flavor. I wouldn't prefer it again as I don't like good that spicy. The fish was crispy and had good flavor, but again, too spicy for me.
Overall was good, but was a bit expensive. Probably wouldn't come back.
We didn't get refills on our waters until we were pretty much done with lunch. Disappointing service.
