Its Roberto's.  
I wasn't expecting anything special or spectacular...I wanted something different from what I always get when I'm in a hurry...Del Taco, Jack in the Box...I was bored!

Stopped in about 6:45pm last night, got an order of nachos with no meat and no guac, and a burrito (don't remember what kind, it was for my fella.)

Service was polite, but not overly nice, and the food was prepared quickly.

We went home and ate, and it was exactly what I'd been craving.  Something tasty, and easy.  

Could I make better nachos at home? Of course.  But for convenience, I'll eat at this location again.
