Food was good. Service and hospitality was also good. Price of bottled beer was a little high. I did not expect to pay $25 (including $2 tip) for two combination plates and two Modelo beers. The funniest thing about this place was that they serve the food on glass plates but give you plastic ware to eat it with. I will go back for more but will probably stick to soda or water.
