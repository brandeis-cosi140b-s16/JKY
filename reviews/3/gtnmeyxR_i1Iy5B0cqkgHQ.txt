After my first visit to Nacho Daddy I didn't think I'd ever come back (see the reason here: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nacho-daddy-henderson?userid=UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw#vvSCsR6z5ae2NEu_XkqxWQ). Nearly two years later, we returned for trivia night and it was a much better experience. Bordering on 4 stars, but not quite. 

We arrived around 6:30 for trivia that starts at 7. One of the great things about this place, unlike other places in town that host trivia is that they allow you reserve tables. That's awesome. Service was incredibly slow as trivia got underway. Understandable since they were pretty busy, but honestly, if the restaurant knows they get busier on these days they need to staff accordingly. We decided to share some Nachos Florentine and they were so much better than our previous visit to Nacho Daddy. I was pleasantly surprised. The flavors were nice, but I still wish they would spread out the toppings better so that you're not left with tons of plain chips on the bottom of the stack. I appreciate all the different nacho offerings. They are quite creative. 

Service was slow throughout, albeit friendly. We won trivia that evening, which was a blast, so we'll be back next week to spend out $50 in winnings. Hopefully I can try some of their other offerings.
