My husband and I tried this place out because it was close and had a coupon deal. My husband for the Ava pollo fundido and was pretty good. The beans have ZERO taste!! I had the enchiladas... They were made with corn tortillas and had a weird taste. So disappointing. Glad I didn't pay full price! Don't think I will be back sadly.
