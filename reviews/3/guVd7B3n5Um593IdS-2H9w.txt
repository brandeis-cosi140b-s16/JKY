The tacos are good.  Not great.  Definitely not worth waiting in an insane line for.  Luckily we went off peak hours.  But they were still so busy that my large order for the group couldn't be filled completely.  They were in such a rush that they handed me over to another cook and the order wasn't transferred fully.  

The meat was tender but the tortilla was bland and didn't hold the tacos together at all.  The sauce wasn't special.  Really disappointed about that.  Have eaten at many great taco places in and around Los Angeles.  This place doesn't stand out.  Would eat it again if someone had brought take out but will not stand in line for it.
