I was lured here by the Groupon deal $30 for $60 worth of food and drinks. 

Came here for breakfast, and once seated we went through the same thing as other yelpers, we we're informed that we needed to be a party of 4 to get the $60 worth of food and drink. At this point I didn't even care anymore I was starving and had already ordered anyway. Manager was going to give us the $30 off (what we paid).

Hubby had a "michelada" and I had a mimosa. The michelada was warm, the spices and salt on the rim of the glass tasted awful. My mimosa was nasty, the orange juice tasted like sunny d and lacked champange.

I ordered their "huevos rancheros" and hubby got the Nachos version of the Huevos rancheros. Both came with breakfast potatoes. The food was surprisingly yummy. The orange sauce on the huevos and nachos had a great flavor.

By this time we had some friends join us at the table and we were able to use the $60 voucher. Overall I would only return here for the breakfast.
