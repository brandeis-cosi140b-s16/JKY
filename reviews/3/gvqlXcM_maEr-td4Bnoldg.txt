My husband and I were just leaving a different night club but heard someone doing karaoke to Biggy....Yep you read right. This was not sappy slow country songs kinda karaoke but old school hip hop karaoke.  Of course they did have the "traditional" karaoke songs available (I sang one myself) everyone there was just singing to have a good time.  The place was pretty empty till about 1pm, but before then to encourage patrons to participate they offered drink specials to all the singers, great idea for those on a budget.  I had no idea they served food though and I had hard time getting the attention of the bartender, which I found odd because I was the only person at the bar at the time.  Although I am not on Mill often next time I might stop and check it out again.
