Food is pretty good I had the Kung Pow Chicken bowl my girl had the Baja Fish Tacos. We went there on a Friday Night when the bar was the only thing open. The bartenders had to be waiters and make drinks so we didn't get that great of service since we decided to sit at a table. I had to go to the bar to get my bill after sitting there for a while thinking that they were going to come to me to give me my bill. Almost thought I was getting the meal comp'd I mean hey its Vegas. I  did like the food and the Margarita so I may go again just will make sure to go when they are open full service.
