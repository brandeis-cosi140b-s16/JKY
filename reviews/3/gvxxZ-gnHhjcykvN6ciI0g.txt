Typical of all Chipotle restaurants.  

Parking is adequate, staff are friendly, restaurant surroundings not so clean - tables were dirty and the floor/rug around the soda machine was soaked without any accompanying sign indicating there was a wet floor (-1).  

Bathroom facilities was clean.  

Restaurant was a bit on the small side but I've noticed that with most of them.  Lines were long and to give you perspective of how small the place was, while you stood in line, you can literally be standing over people who're eating at their tables which was the case when we visited (-1).

Seeing as it's the only one that I know of in town, I don't have much of a choice if I'm in the mood for Chipotle.
