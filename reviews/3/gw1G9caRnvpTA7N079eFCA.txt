I don't know if I went to the wrong Taqueria Durango, but the map on this Yelp posting is different than the address and I went to the address...

TD is not a bad place to grab a few $1 tacos - the pollo was incredibly seasoned and the steak (asada) wasn't bad either.  I was a bit confused as the menu was as Gringo as I've ever seen in a strip mall taco shop, but was surprised by the quality.  The salsa bar off to the side is a plus as well.

There aren't a ton of options in the area, so if you're stuck in the Hardy and Broadway district, give it a shot and support some local business action!
