I'm a regular at Los Favs but this location is not as good as the Chandler/Gilbert/Ahwatukee locations. If the address was any of those locations I'd easily get 5 Stars. I feel like this place is a bit dirtier and smellier than the other locations and the overall quality just isn't as good. Don't get me wrong though, I still love me some Los Favs!
