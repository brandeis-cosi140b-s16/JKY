Yes a large party of 11 is difficult so I made a reservation and we had no trouble getting a table Sat @6. But they messed up our orders a couple of times until the ladies said forget it and they I brought them anyway. The manager came over and nicely said they wouldn't charge but they were on the bill. So thats confusing to get the bill straightened out.  Otherwise the food is ok our friends really like Macayo's.
