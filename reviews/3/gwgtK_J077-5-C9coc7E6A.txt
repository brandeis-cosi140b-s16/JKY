I'm giving this location 3 stars because it has the excellent Chipotle food I love, but they make the chicken too spicy for my kids to eat. I've ordered the kids meal taco kit several times here and every time the chicken is a little on the spicy side (which I actually love), but it's way too spicy for my 2 year old so we always have to go to a farther, less convenient location
