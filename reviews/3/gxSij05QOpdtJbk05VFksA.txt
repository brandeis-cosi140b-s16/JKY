I love their California Burritos.  Reason for the 3 stars?  Something funny, I think the cheese they use at this Roberto's taste different than the other's I've been to.  Also the the french fries they put in the burrito is consistently undercooked.  Other Roberto's restaurants seem to cook them better.  

Tip:  If you want to try a similar taco shop, try Faustos.  There's one up on College and Horizon next to Panda Expres.  Their CA burrito has carne asada, rice, guac, sour cream, and cheese... pretty good!  And their carnes asada fries are awesome!
