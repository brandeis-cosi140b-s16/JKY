Went tonight for business.  It rained so the patio was closed therefore it was very crowded inside.  It was dark, they had to pass around flashlights to see the menu.  The waiter was very nice and informative about the menu since it was our first time.  He said that their specialty was pork and did an outstanding job selling the homemade guacamole which was AWESOME, it was creamy and had the proper amounts of lime and accompaniments.  The tortilla chips were very good as well.  The waiter took about 4 minutes describing how great the porchetta and chorizo roll were.  It was "OK" nothing to write home about, the pork was way to charred on the outside and the chorizo was nicely seasoned but dry.

All in all, it was a nice evening and experience.  If I was to go back, I would definitely get the guacamole and try a different entree.
