I struggle a bit with the stars and rating, and following is why.  Terminal 3 "dining" is abysmal.  (Terminal 4 = amazing).  Your choice is basically this place, Wendy's, Starbucks, or whatever you can dig out of your purse.  So if you need a pre-flight adult beverage, you're saddling up here.  (First star).  Our service was great - in sharp contrast to other reviews.  Quick, friendly, attentive.  (Second star.)  We didn't eat, so I can't speak to the food (Out of fairness, third star because I looked at the menu, and was enticed, despite the seeming airport high prices.)  Other thoughts/comments - the place was clean, and seemed overstaffed because many servers were hanging around chatting.  The bartender kept a clean bar, and promptly cleaned spots and arranged chairs to be inviting.  I had ONE Bloody Mary, and was offered a choice of Absolut, Kettle One, Tito's, Sky, etc., no house Vodka mentioned.  Choice was mild, medium or spicy - and I opted for medium, which was quite spicy.  Lemon, lime and celery (you always get bonus points from me if you serve it with celery).  Booooooooooo - served a double and wasn't told or asked, so blissfully and stupidly enjoyed a $14.00 drink.  Nope, not a typo.  Nope, not pleased.  Nope, not worth it.  Nope, not going back.  (Small fib - next time, I'll just order a beer.)  This place has an accidental and exclusive captive audience if you want a drink in Terminal 3.  Sadly, the $8 Spicy Chicken Caesar Salad from Wendy's, across the hall, sucked worse.
