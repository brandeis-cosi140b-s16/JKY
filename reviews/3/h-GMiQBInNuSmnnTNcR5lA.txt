We decided to try out this place because I drive by it everyday on my way to pick up my husband from work and we were curious about it. We walk in and were greeted by a hostess who asked us if we wanted a table or booth. We opted for booth and she said it would be just a short five minute wait. Five minutes into our wait another couple walks in with a second hostess now beside ours who informed them there was immediate seating for a table and a 5-10 minute wait for the booth. First impressions are everything and it was rather irritating to hear these options when we were not made aware of them. Another five minutes later and we were finally seated. It was a long five minute wait I guess. We seriously walked by 8 booths that were empty but not bussed (remember, first impressions are everything!). Gross. We sat down and my husbands glass had lipstick rings on it. Ewww. A non-server (busser??) came and set chips and pico looking salsa and bean dip on our table without a word and left. Neither were really anything to write home about. About 5 minutes of wondering if we had a server, she arrived and got our drinks. Those came right away, but then she said she would be"right back" to take our orders. TEN minutes later....she shows up. The place was NOT busy as we were one of the 10 tables occupied out of about 35 or more (guessing), but they clearly seemed to be understaffed. It took over twenty minutes for our food to arrive. Honestly, the food trumped the slow, unstable service from start to finish. The food was amazing! I got their monthly special, something like a chimi fried with creamy sauce and ranchero sauce both on inside and out! Would we go back? Sure, but after we call ahead and get our order to go! We arrived about 630 and left around 815....
Seriously cannot stress the first impressions thing enough with this place.
