I went here awhile ago and have been meaning to write a review ever since. I went with my family when they were in town. 

I'm a sucker for a strong margarita and good guacamole and I was fairly unimpressed by both at the Matador. The ambiance was kinda nice. It had a weird feel for a Mexican restaurant, but I'm into variety so that was ok.

Basically, it was average. Not spectacular. The fact that (I hear) it's a family place that's been around forever does definitely lend some cred to it (for me at least). But I would say it didn't wow me by any means.
