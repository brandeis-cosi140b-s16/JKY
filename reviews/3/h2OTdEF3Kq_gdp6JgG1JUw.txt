Super.  Nachos.

That's all you need to know.  Sure, the burritos are (almost) as big as your head, but who wants a cabeza-sized burrito?  Super nachos loaded with steak, white cheese, lettuce, tomato, sour cream...mmmm, that's all you need.  I have fond college memories of coming here drunk at 2 A.M.  Everyone else is drunk too, which can be either hilarious or obnoxious.  One time, two of my girlfriends and I were accosted inside by three VERY sketchy guys, one of whom was MISSING AN EYE.  That should probably tell you something about the late night environment.
