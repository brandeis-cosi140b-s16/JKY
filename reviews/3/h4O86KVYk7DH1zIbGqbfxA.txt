I ordered the taco trio so I could try one of each. The carne asada and chicken taco were very good as well as both salsas. I did not care for al Pastor. I've never had it before so have nothing to compare it to, but the meat was dried out. I was really looking forward to that one because it sounded good. I will give the place one more try before writing it off. I'd like to try the quesadilla and the horchata that another reviewer recommended. The inside looked clean and the chairs were comfortable. Most places don't have cushioned seats, this one does.
