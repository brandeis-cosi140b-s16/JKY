Have been enjoying the pork street tacos for a couple years now and was seriously disappointed today when I found they had changed the toppings. I was very unsatisfied today. They used to be very unique and delicious. Now they bland and uninspired. I do understand that they are like the beef and chicken and might make service easier.  It is just a shame that  they went from am item that I recommended everyone go try to something there is a good chance I will never have again. They also seemed much smaller, but that might be to do with the lack of tomatillo sauce and queso fresco. The managers Whitney and Amy were great in listening to my concerns.
