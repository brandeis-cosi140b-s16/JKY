The food was very good as was our server. The problem was when asked if we were a quest at the hotel and we said no, they seemed to give us the worst table location. The table was located among a corporate party. They did have dividers up to block the large parties but they were quickly knocked over by the drinking crew. The whole place was empty other then where they stuck us. They did offer a free desert because of how loud the group was but I was with my sons and could not talk at all so it didn't make up for it.  What a shame. Meal was $150 for  45 minutes to get  out of there.
