This place has decent rustic Mexican food at an affordable price but the main attraction for me is the bean dip. I love it when a restaurant serves bean dip and unfortunately, not enough of them do! Although its not as good as Serranos bean dip, its still tasty and so are the chips and salsa that accompany it. The actual meals are a bit mediocre though... think McCayos where its not terrific but hits the spot when you want a nice greasy Mexican chain food meal.
