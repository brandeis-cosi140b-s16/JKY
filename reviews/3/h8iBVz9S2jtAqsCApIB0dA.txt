The margarita tasted like lime juice and sugar. It was terrible. Our server was very nice but seemed to get flustered very quickly when asked any questions. We kept trying to get someone's attention to get our check and when we finally did we had our money out to pay she just dropped the check and didn't come back for ten minutes.  It was about 8:30 on a Tuesday and it didn't seem like they were very busy so I'm not sure why it took so long. The food was pretty good. Aside from the fact one menu item was described as 'spicy' and wasn't even mildly spicy. I know that they are still in their early stages of opening so I may give them another chance in a few months but I won't be returning any time soon.
