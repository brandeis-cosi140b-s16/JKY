It was okay. I had high hopes since the other restaurants there from the same owner are well established. 

I also prefer authentic mexican food, this is more new gourmet mexican, wasn't bad just not my preference. I did only get a burrito which was mighty fine in its own right.

Would i come back? Yes. Do i crave it? No
