I love their fish tacos.  However, has a steady lunch and after work customer recently I have been very disappointed.  I was in Wahoos with some of my coworkers and was sitting at the bar eating lunch. One of my coworkers said to Gus the bartender you know you like us.. Gus retorted. .. I hate you people from body spa Salon. We have always had good service from other bartenders that were there before I don't know if I will ever come back to this bar because of the rudeness of this bartender. I'm not a gambler but I did. eat there often.
