Awww, yeah son.  You in the mood for a burrito?

--Qdoba got your back.

Hey?  Feel like a quesadilla?  

--Guess what?  Qdoba is just waiting for you to roll in and order one.

Got a hankerin' for a taco?

--Qdoba be right there, man. Just hit the turn signal and stop on in.

Need to feel like you're eating Americanized Mexican food in the Antarctic?  

--Qdoba keeps their dining room at subzero temperatures and has metal tables! You will freeze your cajones off, m'man!

Feel like overpaying for your food?  

--Qdoba knew you would!  

Want a soggy burrito because they didn't bother to drain the liquid from the pork?  

--Qdoba does that already, bro!  You're hooked up!



I do like Qdoba, but let's be honest: It's Qdoba.  I'm not there for a miracle. I'm not there for a life-changing experience.  I'm there to get affordable chow to shovel in my gob, and then move on with the rest of my day.  To that end, Qdoba delivers.  They aren't exactly cheap, but they're not going to break you, either.  If you're lucky enough to get a decent server, the food can be downright great, but on the other end of the spectrum, I've had burritos that looked like crime scenes.
