One of the "newer" locations of Taco Bell in the University Area at the intersection of WT Harris and Davis Lake.

I may have hit this taco bell on a bad day.  It was a Friday during the lunch rush so there was an incredibly strange, long wait for food.  Waiting for my food, I was able to observe a couple of other things, the dining room was well kept, except the sauce station was out of fire sauce and I had to ask the guy to grab some for me.

Even though they were behind, the food came out nice and hot.  I ate it in my usually 5 seconds and balling up every wrapper technique.

Overall not too bad.  I've usually had a good track record with the "newer" taco bells around the area.
