Being a fan of 'berto's, I was delighted to see this place under construction just 2 miles from my home. Now that it's been open for several months, I've given them time to sort out their growing pains.

Initially, service was unbelievably slow, especially in the drive-thru. More than once I sat for 15 minutes (and sitting in an open car in the middle of Buckeye is no treat for the olfactorily sensitive, let me tell you), even when I was the only customer and just ordering an Arizona burrito and horchata. It's gotten somewhat better since then, but still tends to be slower than other drive-thrus. Counter service is a bit less slow.

The food quality itself is, unsurprisingly, on par with other 'berto's. Dinner combos are freakin' huge and the Mexican drinks (horchata, tamarindo, and jamaica) are delicious.

This location has locally-made chocolate and caramel flan. I absolutely do NOT recommend it; the chocolate texture is just weird and has a strange, almost pine-ish undertaste.

I stop in once a week or so, usually on my way home after a very long day at work when I'm too tired to think about cooking dinner. Otherwise, I generally don't bother.
