One of the main reasons why I like the Saz, is because it is NEVER overwhelmingly busy. There is always a place for you and three or five other friends to sit.  When Mediterranean Cafe has customers out the door, and the generic State Street food court crap won't do... this is when the Saz is the place to go.  (Motto:  The Saz, always the bridesmaid never the bride.)
Their selection of salads is reasonably priced and usually quite good.  The staff can sometimes be impatient if you don't know what you want right away  I have thoroughly enjoyed both their "Greek" fare and their "Mexican" themed items. There is lots of vegetarian options, and they definitely have more than enough choices for the meat eaters.
The biggest problem I have with the Saz is they don't take credit cards. I understand the food is quite cheap, but sometimes I'm a hungry girl with no cash and no ATM balance.
