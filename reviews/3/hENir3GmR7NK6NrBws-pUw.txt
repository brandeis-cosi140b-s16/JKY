I risk my life at least three times a week to eat lunch here. No joke. 

The Grilled Chicken Salad is my favorite fast food salad out there and is reasonably priced at $4.99. Almost guiltless diet wise, too. Sounds great, huh? Read on. 

This spot is in walking distance from where I was born and raised. Now the area resembles a needle exchange program in East LA or on location of the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie. I say this because on average there are a minimum of five homeless people there panhandling, drinking or napping on the property. They do not always keep to themselves either. On two separate occasions I have been approached and felt uneasy. No I don't want a side of homeless breath and germs with my freakin salad!!!! 

Now, I will bust a Kill Bill on yo' ass if it's written in my contract and Tarantino can afford me, but for now TWO STAR deduction because I should not have anxiety at noon on a weekday just trying to grab lunch.
