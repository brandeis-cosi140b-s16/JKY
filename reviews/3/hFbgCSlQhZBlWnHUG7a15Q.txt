I am not a big fan of beans, so I enjoy the Fajita Ranchero Burrito which is just rice, chicken or steak, peppers and onions, your choice of salsa, and cheese.  Tonight's version was tasty for $7.  

The restaurant was a little chilly and nothing special about the service.  

Overall, it always seems worth the extra $2 to spend vs. Taco Bell crap for a decent burrito but it's not the best one in town.
