Really hip place in a hip location (NC Music Factory), this restaurant doubled as our Salsa Dance Floor during the night I went. So they knew they'd be getting a large group, yet, like others have stated on Yelp, they seemed unprepared (i.e., understaffed) for what was to come! My friends and I had to fight for a drink....not necessarily the bartenders fault but there just wasn't enough staff to accomodate the large crowd. Took forever to get a drink. Food came out relatively quickly though.....

Speaking of food. Overall it was pretty good! The salsa was fresh, chunky and spicy the way I like it. Got the pork & BBQ sliders dish with 2 tacos. we got the brisket and carne asada tacos.....all were VERY good! A friend got the chip plate and their queso dip was excellent. I was SO hoping that the bacon guacamole that I ordered would be great....well, it was just A-OK. It had bacon, ancho chiles, fresh guac, cilantro, onions, etc....everything that should make this a stellar dish....but the flavors just didn't integrate well....at least the way THEY did it. Pretty hot dish, which I really liked, but it was missing something and not well balanced. So I just went back to the regular guac on the table and life was good.

So I'd say 4 stars for food and 2 stars for service...split the difference for a 3 star experience. They could easily overcome the service issue with having more staff available for specialized events or when popular concerts are being held around the corner.
