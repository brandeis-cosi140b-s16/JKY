Tried the Cantina Chicken Burrito and it was pretty delicious, tasted really fresh which surprised me. I also ordered a softy taco and when I got home (I used the drive thru) I opened it and the tortilla was really dry and hard and I took a bite and immediately spit it out DID NOT taste like a normal Taco Bell soft taco. Really gross and tasted old but I ordered about 11 am so I wouldn't think they'd have tacos sitting out very long. 

This was my first visit to this location so not sure if I'll be back but the drive thru service was quick.
