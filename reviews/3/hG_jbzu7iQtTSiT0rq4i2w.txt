I hate to say it but obviously not as good as Gallo. The Guac was missing the orange that it used to have, but still good. I think the veggie tacos are even better, but I missed the corn in the old ones. The drinks were a little lackluster. The waitress was a sweetheart. The main thing that bothered me was that their menu online was different in person. They listed nopales and potato tacos online which was the main reason I came here. Also a daily Mac and cheese which they didn't have.
