Normally very good Mexican food in the valley.

Tonight, I ordered a medium house margarita.  They make a pitcher at a time. My drink came from the bottom of the pitcher and was very watered down. I mean it was watered down lime water. Could barely taste, no, I could not taste any tequila.

Wife said her drink was a short pour.  She could not taste the rum. She ordered a pina colada.

Food was good.  Watered down cocktails, at $15 for two drinks, ouch. 
Normally there is a manager floating around the place asking how things are. Tonight there was no one to say anything to.
