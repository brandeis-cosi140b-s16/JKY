I've been to a lot of Mexican restaurants and I would say this place is mediocre.  I've had better seasoned Carne Asada. The beans weren't very flavorful, but was okay. The Bloody Mary was aweful. I could have made better. It didn't have the ingredients in it to make it the Bloody Mary. I won't return. The waiter was good, but could have been more personable.
