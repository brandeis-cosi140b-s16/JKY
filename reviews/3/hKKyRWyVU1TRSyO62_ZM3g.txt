This is the Chipotle closest to my house. Sometimes they are amazing and other times they are just average. Customer service is always good, its the food that is a little inconsistent by Chipotle's standard. Sometimes there is no salt on the chips and others days they refuse to put any meat in the tacos... but when they get it right its all good.
