Unique Mexican food. The outdoor seating is nice. The table side guacamole was delicious. I like that they bring all the ingredients to your table and assemble it right there. The barbacoa tacos didn't really appeal to my tastebuds. They weren't bad but they weren't yummy either. They're just kind of a weird combination. I'm not in a big hurry to go back.
