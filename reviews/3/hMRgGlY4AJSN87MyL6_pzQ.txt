This place is ok, not great and missed the wow-factor for me.  I'm a native, born and raised on carne asada, I'll probably die with a burrito in hand. 

As you will see, there are a lot of gringos in this place at lunch time.  Here's a clue for the white folks, good Mexican foods can be found where the Mexicans eat.  

Again, don't get me wrong, this place is ok... just didn't deserve all the hype.
