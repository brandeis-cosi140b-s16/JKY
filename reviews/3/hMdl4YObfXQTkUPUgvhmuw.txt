We did the Brunch Unlimited Tapas. Everything was good but only the Oysters Rockefeller was very good and memorable. As a matter of fact, everything including the Oysters was way to sweet. Service was good but I was expecting better food. I think eight or nine of us dined and everyone that was drinking Mimosas complained about how sweet they all were. I think they had something like four different kinds.
