What can I say?  I'm an Elmer's Tacos fan.  I tried Moreno's asada and adovada tacos, and... if you put a big piece of gristle and fat up in my taco, I cant help but notice it as it slows my molar's roll.  You really jack up a taco by doing that... seeing as the tacos aint that big to begin with.

I did like the sonoran dog, but it was a little clumsy to eat, with the toppings spilling all over my baboso shorts.  Also... weren't a fan of the oversized pepper that its served with.  But the avocado sauce at the salsa bar is pretty good
