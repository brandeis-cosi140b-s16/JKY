I've only been to this location once, but to be honest, once was enough. Not because of the food. I mean, it's Chipotle. I love me some Chipotle. Chipotle tastes amazing. And hey, I'll give credit where credit is due, and this is not an easy location to work at. This Chipotle is smack in the middle of a hubspot of downtown activity. It always has a line, and they have to do their best with the space, hands and time they're given. So seriously, good on them - they at least seemed to have a handle on keeping their line of patrons moving when I stopped in.

What they clearly don't have a handle on, though, are online orders. I had ordered my dinner via the Chipotle app specifically because I knew I would have about 20 minutes to get where I needed to go that night downtown after parking. So I put in a pickup time for 7:45 so I could eat as I strolled on over to my next appointment. Unfortunately, even though Chipotle promises that ordering through an app will guarantee your food is ready to go when you arrive, the staff ruined my plan, and didn't even start to make my order until I arrived. As a result I basically ended up in the back of the line, and I had to eat as I half jogged on down to my next stop that night; it was either that or not get dinner until 11pm.

After that, I'm definitely going to avoid this location if I can. Their food may be worth a 5 star rating but that type of failure to meet company standards is a definitive 1 in my book - my 3 star rating is basically a balance of this. I certainly appreciate why they're always busy. That's not the problem. My problem was that they completely ignored my order until I arrived, the exact opposite of what app users are promised. If they're too busy to make app orders on time, they should look into being removed from the online ordering system. In the meantime, I'd rather spend the time and money necessary to avoid that kind of service during a rushed lunch or dinner.
