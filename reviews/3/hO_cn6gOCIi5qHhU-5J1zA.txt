This is a pretty decent little spot. Intimate, great interior decor and a patio for those not-too-hot happy hours we can enjoy before June. Kinda pricey if you're gonna be drinking but a good selection of alcohol and food is tasty. Yes, Malibu Rum is included in their drink selection :) 

I happened to meet friends here during National Margarita Day and the bar staff brought plenty of samples over for us to try including some top-shelf brands. I was pretty impressed with that :)
