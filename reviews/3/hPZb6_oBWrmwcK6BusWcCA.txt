Unless I have a stellar experience, 3 stars is about all I can give any airport eatery. So using that logic, Salsarita's Express is about as good as it can get. I had a breakfast burrito that tasted fine and did the job between flights. I don't know that I'd recommend anyone to have it but I doubt I'd recommend anyone to an airport eatery anyway.  The service was friendly and fast though, which is a plus.
