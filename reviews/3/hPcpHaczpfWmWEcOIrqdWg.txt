If your looking for authentic mexican food this is NOT the place.  First off...they could not bring me a salsa that was spicy to go with my chips.  My 8 yr thats hates anything remotely spicy was jus fine though and loved it.  I ordered a "burrito asado".  Im sorry, but if I pay 12 dollars for a carne asada burrito I expect way better.  20% meat, 70% beans, 10% cheese is a failure all around.  Nobody in my family of 4 finished their food.  

The food is the problem!

The service was excellent and absolutely no complaints, very attentive, happy and upbeat!! 

Negro Modelo on tap!!!  Awesome!

The beer and service is the only reason Im giving this 3 stars.
