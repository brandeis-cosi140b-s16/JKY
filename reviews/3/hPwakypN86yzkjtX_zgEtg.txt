Waiting for a ridiculous SW layover --- don't get me started on THAT! ... Bloody Maria's and an omelet Mexicana.  Not the best I've had but for airport food, definitely an A-OK.  Service was good, not overly attentive but that's just perfect for an airport restaurant --- fun with the staff, took good care of us - very social atmosphere!
