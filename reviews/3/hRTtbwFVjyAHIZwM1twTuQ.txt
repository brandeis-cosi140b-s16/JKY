We stopped here a while back while visiting local businesses.  I'm always up for a good taco, and it did not disappoint.  My only complaint would be the salsa - not very flavorful, almost seemed like it might have been bottled.  The green sauce was a redeemer, but I need my spice to make the meal complete.
