Let me start off by saying the food here is absolutely delicious and the prices are fantastic! That portion gets 5-stars from me. 

The reason for the 3-star review is because of the restaurant experience. The temperature was very uncomfortable in the restaurant. The fans were on but it didn't feel like there was any air movement. In addition to this the tables, while aesthetically pleasing, are not very functional. The plates slip and slide on the surface which makes cutting your food a challenge. 

TL;DR The food is great, but get it to go.
