I will give this place three stars only because of the food.  We came here twice.  My mom raved about their tortilla soup (I think that's what it was).  They also had a really good salsa (they bring three kinds to your table).  we got the stuffed quesadillas both times, both times yummy.  I also loved the theme, skulls and devil women.

I wanted to give less stars because of the staff.  It was almost 11 on a saturday night.  we went to the entrance inside the monte carlo casino.  the girl wouldn't seat us cause the kitchen was closed.  On a Saturday nite in Vegas?  So we went to the front to try there.  We got in, but were totally rushed and our server did not offer us any drinks!  He kept saying crap about the kitchen closing and they might be out of stuff and we need to hurry.  Even if the kitchen does close at 11, they should not rush their customers!  

For whatever reason they want their kitchen closed, but come on, it's Vegas!  I guess they want it to be a club or something at night, but drunkards have got to eat, too!  at least have a limited menu, or cut it off later than 11pm!
