I've been here several times and tried the chimichanga, street tacos, and the pollo fun dido. The chimi and tacos are just ok. A little flat in flavor. The fun dido is real tasty with a good kick and a lot of cheese. Their complimentary chips n salsa are delicious and they give you a variety with flour and corn chips!  The margarita is very good but a little light In the tequila zone. I'd like to give them a 4 star if it wasn't for the rather inflated prices, but I suppose they're in the right area for it in n. Scottsdale. I will be back but will most likely get a beer instead of the cocktail.
