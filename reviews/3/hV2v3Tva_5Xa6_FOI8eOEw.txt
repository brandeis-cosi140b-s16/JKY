2 words ORANGE SAUCE!  My girlfriend and I love to eat the Jr. Burrito with this semi sweet/spicy hot sauce.  I can say we go here weekly.  I am a pretty health conscious person and love Mexican food.  However, most places are about quantity and not quality.  Los Burritos = Quality. They have fresh food and you can tell that the hot sauces are home made.  I asked the owner several times what is in that orange sauce and she finally sold me a bottle for only $4.  We usually get the 3 pack for $6.95 enough for 2 people.  Now, we are starting to branch off and try some of the other things there.  I would definitely suggest this place.  Food made with love, family oriented staff, and clean environment.  5 stars.
