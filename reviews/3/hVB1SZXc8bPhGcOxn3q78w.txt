This place is pretty good, I think.  I come here a few times every few months.  The food is decent; the service less so.  I usually stick with the fajitas here and most of the time they are good.  The portions are decent and the flavors standard.  I have however veered away from the fajitas a few times, I ordered the guacamole chicken, and I was less pleased with the dish.  I will not be ordering that dish again.  I will continue to order their fajitas though.  They have decent seasoning and come with nice warm tortillas.  One thing that I do love here is are the complimentary chips and salsa.  They are nice and salty and have a pepper seasoning on it.  This place is worth a visit just for those.  

This place is decent.  I am rarely disappointed but never blown away.  I will however continue to patronize the joint because it's close to my house; oh and the chips and salsa of course.
