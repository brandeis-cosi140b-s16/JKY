A couple of months ago,  I would completely agree that this location of Qdoba was subpar, but I think they are hopefully listening and starting to turn things around.  I was satisfied with my most recent visit.  My favorite entree is the chicken quesadilla, and it was made well. The chicken tasted fresh and tender.  There was no skimping on ingredients,  in fact they almost put too much cheese on it, but I like a generous helping of cheese anyway.  The staff was courteous and friendly.  They happened to be out of brown rice, so my wife had to settle for white rice on her burrito, but overall we were satisfied. I hope the improvement continues and I can raise my opinion to 5 stars.
