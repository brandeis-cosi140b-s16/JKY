Yes this place is a little expensive but it's quality food but with that being said the food does take a little more time to get to you even if you do decide to go through the drive thru.  I ordered a cheese enchilada meal and a veggie burrito, which was a lot of food, but I knew that(; I really didn't like the cheese enchiladas or rice and beans that it came with it, the only thing I liked was that it came with sour cream mmmm. Filibertos doesn't add sour cream unless you ask for it haha but I do like their cheese enchiladas better. The veggie burrito I practically inhaled it was soooooo good, I will come back only for that burrito. The guacamole in it was delicious, everything about that burrito was delicious. Definitely will be returning.
