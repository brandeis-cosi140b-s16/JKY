My family and i have been going to Espos for many years. 

To be completely honest this place has its good days and bad days, sometimes the food is top notch and some days it is really bad. 

I know they had hired alot of different people and you could tell in the service as well as the food. Though on the weekends it seems they are on there game most of the time.  I too have had bad experiences with calling in a order and the order not being complete.  But i learned my lesson and tear it apart before i leave checking to make sure its correct.

Fast forward to yesterday, My coworkers and I were wanting a Espos fix.  I ordered a Carne Asada Chimichanga and a soda,  not my usual Chicken Enchilada Combination Plate. 

I also noticed that they now charge you 45 cents to run your card, I hate when businesses do that.  So all in all i spent about 9.31 for a soda and chimichanga. Which for me seems a little steep. I understand with the economy changes have to be made but hey thats alot of money!

Also the soda was out of CO2 so it took about 10 minutes for the girl to come out and change the tanks. Which for me was to long, as it wasn't overly busy. 

Now to the review of the food the chimichanga was covered in lettuce, cheese and sour cream.  I hate sour cream so i scraped it off, my fault entirely since i didn't ask them to leave it off.  The chimichanga was good but not the best. 

Things i liked 
super hot. 
spicy throughout
filling

things i disliked
seemed a little dry, but not overly dry. 
to much sour cream.  But as i said my fault entirely. 

And the final take on the whole experience. I will probably be back but i will probably stick to my Enchilada Combination Plate.
