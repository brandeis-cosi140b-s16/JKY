Great hamburgers!!!! I was very skeptical about even eating there because it looks a little sketchy on the outside. My friend's father told me that they had good burgers so I gave them a try since the food selection in Maricopa is so scarce. And the burgers are good!!! It smells a little stale inside so I have never ate inside I always do Togo and I have only had the burger and fries.
