Some of the food is good. I wouldn't call it Mexican though. Maybe mexican inspired. Their drinks are awesome. Clearly the best margarita in town. Their tequila tasting night happy hour special is a smoking deal. As far as a place to eat though, I think the food is over-priced and sometimes deeply un-mexican (bbq sauce on a tamale?)

I'm not thrilled that chips and salsa are a la carte but understand that their goal is to be more on the classy side so am willing to let it slide. Where my blood starts to boil is when I get tacos with flour tortillas. This is clearly a personal preference but it really spoils any "mexican" meal for me.

Also, a note about the service: It was slow in the beginning but has gotten much better. The staff is really friendly and helpful. 

Overall, I would say a great place to grab a drink during happy hour but not somewhere I would recommend for dinner.
