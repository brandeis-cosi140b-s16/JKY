Hungry and craving Mexican food in the Venetian? This is a pretty good place to go. The portions are big and the restaurant itself is nice. It is right next to the canal so you can wave at the gondolas going by. 

I agree with the other guy. The food was solid.  We ordered the carne asada tacos which came with 3 tacos and a side of rice and beans. It was good, but we weren't raving over it. THE POSOLE THOUGH. It was my first time having Posole (I was surprised it was green) and it was really tasty. My friend knows her food and she loved it as well. We kept wanting to go back for more Posole, but didn't have the chance to.
