The food was on par with anything I could order in Miami. Being Las Vegas, that is an achievement. The staff were polite, but unremarkable. 

The bread reminded me of crappy Texas toast. I'm glad it was complementary, because it wasn't worth paying for.

The appetizer platter offered an assorted selection of tasty treats. The Cuban food was not hot-spicy, but very flavorful, as good Cuban food is. The Cuban sandwich was all right, but nothing to write home about.

I ordered the Bistec de Pallomilla. It was expensive for a cheap fried steak, but tasty.

Skip the flan. It is utterly unremarkable.

The restaurant was dead, and the service adequate. I still can't understand why you tip a staff to make you're own suggestions and box up you're own leftovers. 

In short, get the appetizer plate and some drinks and call it a day. It's worth a taste if you're in the area.
