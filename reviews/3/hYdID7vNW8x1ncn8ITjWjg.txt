Decent but typical Phoenix area Mexican food.  Very comparable to Garcia's and Macayo's type of food.  We went on Sunday for kids eat free.  After sticker shock, yes I thought it was pretty over priced we  ordered.  My taco salad was $11, and my wife's lunch was similarly priced for 2 enchiladas.  The kid's cheese crisp was humongous.  Portions in general were pretty large.  Taco salad was good and fresh, but you could taste the oil in the shell.  Cheese on the cheese crisp, and daughter's enchilada was excessively oily.  Excluding the oily cheese and the prices it wasn't that bad.  We would go back again.  They seem to have some decent specials.
