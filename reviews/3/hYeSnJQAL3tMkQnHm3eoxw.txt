2 words Taco Tuesday!  This isn't advertised that well and who could blame them when I walked in and ordered 7 different soft tacos with chips, salsa and guacamole for $13. Every Tuesday, all day long , Qdoba offers $1.39 tacos. You can get hard or soft sell and any kind of meat except steak.  I recommend the chicken.  Their salsas are always fresh and the guacamole is delicious. The staff was friendly and they are quick with your order.  If you want a quick, cheap and tasty take-out place this is the place to go.
