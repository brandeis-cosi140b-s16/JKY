Driving by I never would have stopped here. However the reviews were good so I tried not to judge this book by its cover.

The bean small soup they give was very good. Tacos were soso I've had way better. 

Although service was good, I'd have to pass on a return trip because it wasn't very clean. The outside of the building is a pretty good indicator of what you'll find inside.
