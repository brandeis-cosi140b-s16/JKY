The quality of their dishes varies with what you order. I have had dishes that were just Ok. But then I ordered their chicken Tacos and they were some of the best I ever had. And they didn't skimp at all on the amount of chicked stuffed into the shells. Their rice is good too. There isn't a whole lot of good mexican in Glendale. This is among the top in this area. If you want grade A mexican, you are going to have to go to Scottsdale.
