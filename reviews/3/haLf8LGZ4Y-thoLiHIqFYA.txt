Meh. There's a lot of great Mexican restaurants in Arizona. This one falls into the Mexi-American category which isn't a bad thing unless you love authentic Mexican food. Even the guacamole here left something to be desired. Still, the servers are always friendly and it's a fun environment. I love the interior booths and the wall decorations.
