The food is good.  Nice sized portions on everything. Salsa is very good. 
-1 star for the small dining room.  This is Phoenix, people need AC to eat in during July. 
-1 star for the employee and the register screen asking for a tip.  I walk to your counter.  I order from you.  This is not full service.  What's next, the cashier at kmart expecting a tip for ringing out out?
