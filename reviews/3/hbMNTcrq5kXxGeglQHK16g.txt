There are a few great things about this restaurant, and a few bad things about it. Let's start with the bad:

- service is slow...I kept finding myself thinking "any day now" a lot during my visit: for our waitress to come back, to get our food, to get refills and to get our check processed, so beware of the slow service.
- too windy...yes I know we live in a desert and nice, cool air circulation is great n'all; but Rosa's had their A/C a little too cold for how many people were in the restaurant and their fans were spinning at high speeds which was annoying because I always had to wipe that flyaway hair out of my face and I was freezing cold!
- Bean dip...you have to order it...but at other restaurants they give it to you for free, and personally it wasn't worth the money we spent.

Now the good:

- Bathrooms...can I just say: amazing!! It's small, but oh so cute!!! Beautifully decorated, well ventilated and I just LOVE the faucet! Very impressed.
- Food...food was good, I'd say a 5 on a scale of 1 - 10. The food came out at the perfect temperature to just start eating right away - which was good, because I was STARVING. 
- Decorations...this place has the perfect environment for an authentic Mexican meal. Nothing is over done: music, but not too loud; art, and you don't need sun glasses; Lighting, not to dark, not to bright; Bathrooms, again, fabulous...
- Friendly Service...they are slow but when you get the chance to see your waiter, they are nice :)

I recommend this restaurant, it's A-OK!
