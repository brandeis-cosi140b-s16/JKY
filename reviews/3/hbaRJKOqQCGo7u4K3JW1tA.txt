Because I have frequent late-night food cravings (especially after several hours of heavy drinking, which is not an uncommon occurrence for me) and love a good burrito, I have now visited Burrito Drive four times since moving to Madison less than a month ago. The major pro of this place is that it's open until 3 a.m., making it the perfect place to go after last call when you need some protein in your stomach to soak up all the excess alcohol. The major con, unfortunately, is the food. Although the unique, off-the-wall combinations of ingredients were an initial source of enticement, every burrito I've ordered has been extremely bland--just no flavor whatsoever. And considering that one Google reviewer actually described his meal as "a spiritual experience," I was more than a little let down to find burrito after burrito underseasoned and underwhelming (especially considering the prices). That being said, I do appreciate that they are open so late, and I've never experienced anything but excellent service. And this place must have something going for it if I keep coming back (albeit in an intoxicated state most of the time). A solid three stars.
