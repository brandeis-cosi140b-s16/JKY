McDowell 16th Street, great place its not far from my work at Bp Printing.  I love to go there for dinner.  Great atmosphere and they opened up a patio.

The guac is famous and made right at your table.  What a presentation.  I'm not going to back up the authenticity but the food here has a lot of heart.
