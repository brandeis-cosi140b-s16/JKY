Was delayed for an hour in the dinnertime, and Eric R. and I wanted a snack.  He sent me off to find something that would please both of us.  Well, he loves Mex food.

I see the Blue Burrito, and Peter A's burring (I mean purring) about its yumminess.

I ordered the big blue no sour cream with steak.  The prices are Chipotle-esque and the portions are slightly smaller, but it is tasty and INCLUDED GUACAMOLE!!! yesss!!

The menu had a new addition, the chicken torta - it had all the goods and jalepenos on it, so next time I am delayed in Terminal C I might get that (Eric R. does not like hot peppers besides moi).
