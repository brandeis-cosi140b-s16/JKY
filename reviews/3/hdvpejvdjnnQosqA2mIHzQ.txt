Verde means green in Latin, Italian and Spanish and I thought there would be more greens at this restaurant. Unfortunately, the only green item is the Verde Salad Bowl.
They have a very limited menu, so I ended up getting  the Chilaquiles and Watermelon Fresca. 
I can't say too much since this was my first time, but aside from beans; my dish was pretty good.
The guy behind the counter was very nice and the portions are huge. 

You'll never leave hungry that's for sure.


Tip: This place is situated between the Phoenix Library and the Papago Freeway, so if you are coming from somewhere else you'll hit a bunch of dead end streets. The best way is just to follow Roosevelt St. and then turn on 1st St. 
Look for an industrial looking building painted white and green.
