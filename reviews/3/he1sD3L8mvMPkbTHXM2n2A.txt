Usually this Chipotle is spot on with great service and great food, however my last visit yielded different results.

You know what you get at chipotle, and you see it made. How can you go wrong?

With the service, that's how. When you have 6, mostly chatty teenage girls by the way, standing in a line waiting to help someone, and NO ONE is in line ordering, things can go very, very wrong. 

For instance, when I step up to get my burrito I expect complete attention from the tortilla warmer. I shouldn't have to wait 30 seconds for you to finish your conversation about the latest gossip. When I move down the line, I expect my burrito to be artfully and deliciously crafted in front of me, not to be flung aside while you talk about another important aspect of your Saturday-night binge drinking session. 

Continuing down the line, you would think this was getting a little ridiculous, but NO! My burrito waits yet again, lustfully awaiting its slathering of sour cream, salsa and cheese, to the tune of who is going out tonight as well. I thought you all went out last night? Surely you can't go out again... with hangovers! To be young again...

Finally my burrito is in the home-stretch, and what happens?! It rips. All that hard work by hungover teenage girls ruined! RUINED! I can't possibly imagine my burrito nirvana going away any quicker. It's just not the same when they rip. And it was completely avoidable BY NOT MAKING ME WAIT FOR EACH STAGE FOR YOU TO TALK ABOUT YOUR PERSONAL CRAP THAT I DONT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT!

I will go back, because I do lust after the chicken and carnita goodness that awaits, but maybe I should go when it's actually busy and someone in charge is actually in the line...
