Have passed by this place for years but was finally taken by a friend who claimed this as her favourite. Dingy with a CASH ONLY! sign seems kind of dodgy but it's kept up to standards and passes all the food inspections, so don't let the oldness of it scare you away. I ordered a quesadilla, 1/2 pint of rice, and three rolled tacos and all were fresh, hot, and delicious. The quesadilla was also bigger than your average tortilla so that's a bonus. Everything totaled to around $6 which is a bit more than your average Taco Bell but a lot better tasting - you get what you pay for!
