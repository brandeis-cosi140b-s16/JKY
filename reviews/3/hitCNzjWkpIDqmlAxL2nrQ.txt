Mamita's is a place that offers pleasant neglect. Our waitress was obviously new and that played a part in our spotty service. When she had time she refilled our chips frequently. No drinks were refilled throughout our dinner and the table was only set after we got our food. 

The food is ok. Nothing spectacular. The combos are cheap at under $10 a plate and the food is plentiful. Most of the Cuban plates came with rice, black beans, and plantains. The rice was under cooked and not fluffy. The beans were good. The copious amount of plantains were a godsend. I was not super hungry so I just shared a bit of my friends' plates and an order of the Yucca Con Mojo. I was probably the happiest with the side items. 

The best part about Mamita's is their video dj. They play a mix of 80's-90's music and it is stuff you have not heard in ages. The atmosphere is a mixture of club and restaurant. People will get up in the middle of the meal and start dancing. There is no hate, because when your jam comes on, it is hard to contain it.
