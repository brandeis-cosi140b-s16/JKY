Solid fare for an airport eating establishment.  Tacos were tasty, service was solid.  Reason for the 3 star rating was the use of canned beans and parboiled ready rice.  If those two things had been in-house prepared then this would be a 4 star rating.  The bar staff was responsive and friendly.  I would come back.
