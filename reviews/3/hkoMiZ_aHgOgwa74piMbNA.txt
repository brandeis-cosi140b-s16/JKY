I'm rating this place because I see the promise but this place really has some kinks to work out. First off, love the bar. Plenty of beers on tap, decent happy hour for drinks, and there's plenty of seating in a relaxed but chic type of presentation. Love that part.

Hated the part that as I'm going to the different stations I'm told I'll have to order from the bar. That's fine because it's slow but if the bar were to get packed and you only have two bartenders, doing things like...tending bar. People with food orders are going to start getting backed up. Weird concept if you expect it to be busy.

I order the cubano, my friend orders a burrito, and the jerk off that wanted us to come in here to try the food just orders a coffee (wtf!). Anyway, I had a bite of the burrito with rotisserie chicken and the meat is actually pretty good. That coupled with the rice is actually pretty damn good. I'll be back for this.

The dry cubano on the other hand, I feel as though it's a little overpriced for $12 that came with no fries, maybe they forgot it, maybe it just doesn't come with it, I don't know. But $12 for basically just a sandwich and it's not sit down service? That's not crazy expensive but damn give me some fries, chips, f*ck I'll even take a deli pickle!

All in all a nice change of pace if you're gambling at Downtown Grand or you're leaving Gold Spike and want something quick instead of pizza. But it needs to work on some things.
