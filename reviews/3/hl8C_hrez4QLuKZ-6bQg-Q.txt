Disappointed. When we got there, we were told that they changed their happy hour time from 7 to 6:30pm, though their website clearly states it's until 7. The manager gave us the discounted price after i showed him the website, hence the only reason for the 3 star review. Drinks weren't good but the food was yummy.
