I would give more stars but the drive through line wait time is horrendous 

I love coming in Taco Tuesday for the chicken tacos. It's hard bringing the kids though because everything else is so expensive for a fast food place. I like getting Cherry coke too but costs more than my tacos. 

Either way I like it. Get the drive through times down and it's a 5 star from me.
