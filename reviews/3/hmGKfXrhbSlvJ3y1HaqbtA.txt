$2.99 bacon breakfast burritos on Tuesday!!

Although I think I prefer the Don Tor Taco on Craig to this Roberto's location, I've never driven the extra couple miles to go to that one so I guess that says something. When it comes to Roberto's, we don't deviate from our usuals very often: carne asada nachos, breakfast burritos, or the beef chimichangas. 

One thing that I feel I should note; the salsas are consistent, but only to that particular location. Don't expect to get the thick salsas that are served here at a location across town. 

I knock off a star for the $.50 charge to use to charge card.
