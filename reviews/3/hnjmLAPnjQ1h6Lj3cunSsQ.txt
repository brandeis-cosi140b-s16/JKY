My wife and daughter like America's Taco Shop and always order the bean and cheese burrito. My daughter says "yummy and perfect"! My wife branched out a little and ordered two chicken tacos. She says "tasty but tiny...soggy shell that falls apart...too much guacamole. It's a chicken taco not a guacamole taco." I ordered a carne asada burrito and I say "awesome! Spicy and good but not too spicy. Cooked onions in it so good!" They need to change their name to America's Carne Asada Shop. 
The good: Service and burritos. Also liked the salsa.
The bad. Tiny soggy tacos. And pricey. Plus 4 of the drink buttons on the soda machine said "empty".
3 stars is my review and I'll be back for burritos but nothing else.
