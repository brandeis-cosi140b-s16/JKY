What a great place to get some food when you are hungover and need some greasy tacos to ease that headache. Some things are great about this place and others that I could pass on.

The place was packed with people so there is a little of a wait for the tacos. There are multiple lines that you order from and only make a specific taco (ie: one line for carne asada tacos, one line for lengua and cabeza tacos, another line for adobado tacos, another for chorizo, etc). So if you want to try different types of tacos you pretty much have to stand in 3-4 different lines. The best way to get a variety of tacos to try here at an efficient rate is to come in a group of 5 and divide and conquer. I spent most of the time standing in line and trying to figure out a more efficient way of running the place instead of standing in multiple lines. You pay afterwards at the two different cash registers when you've picked up all of your food.

The best taco was the Adobado (sp?) - spicy pork. Loved it. So tasty and the sauce goes really well with it. The adobado quesadilla was great too. 

Carne asada was okay but a little tough. I had it with some fries which made it pretty good.

The lengua was okay and it was all right with the fries we ordered. 

The pork shoulder was dry and tough. I would pass on it the next time.

So all in all, the spicy pork is the one meat that I would come back here to eat. Props to the place for  having orange bang and all of the other fresca flavors. Free refills too! Great to have on a hot day in Vegas.

Seating is limited because there are only so many tables. If you're willing to sit outside in the heat, there is a tented area that has some additional seating.
