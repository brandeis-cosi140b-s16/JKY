The service was great but the sushi was at best AVERAGE! The crab was nasty! The ahi tuna tostadas were very yummy though! Their wine list is very limited when it comes to Merlots by the glass (they only have 1) They have good bottle selections! The restraunt is very modern and posh. There are definitely better sushi restraunts in Scottsdale then here.
