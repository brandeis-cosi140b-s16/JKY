I have heard about this place a few times, the last being a member of the local fire dept. who happened to come in for lunch just before I was finished.  It is well out of the way and I am not sure I would like the neighborhood at night.  It seats more than you would think from the outside in 3 rooms.

The round corn chips I am sure come from a bag.  Both salsas were pretty good, although after a sample of the hot one I stuck with the mild.  I had the lunch special 2 chicken and spinach enchiladas that came with rice and beans ($8.95) and a horchata ($1.75).  The enchiladas were different and good and the beans and rice were well prepared.  As Alexander noted the food is good but not special.  

The service was very good even though it was Friday lunch and the place was over 1/2 full.  It is a definite add to my lunch rotation.
