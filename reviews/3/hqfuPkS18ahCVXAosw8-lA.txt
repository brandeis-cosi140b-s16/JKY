Stopped by Ajo Al's with family while visiting them in Scottsdale.  Convenient location right off the 101 freeway.  Small parking lot.  Seating was prompt at dinner time and we had a great server who really stayed on top of things.  Atmosphere was casual, but a little dated and the main room was a bit noisy.  We did enjoy the various masks and southwestern appointments around the room.  Food was "par for the course"...  very average and essentially what you get from most other Mexican food restaurants throughout the valley.  Margaritas tasted nice and fresh.  Jalapeno Bean Dip was like a bowl of melted cheese with beans thrown in for color, but still tasted "ok".  Only complaint would be that my "Chimichanga", which is essentially a deep-fried burrito, came out way undercooked and the tortilla was exceptionally doughy.  Apart from that, the rest of the food was spot-on, the portions were big and Ajo Al's proved to be a good, although very average Mexican food joint.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but I wouldn't avoid it either.  If you're in the area, give it a try!
