What to say about GSB? 

Their food is really quite good. I imagine it's even better after a night out on the town. I happened to stop by for lunch one day. I work in the area and wanted to try something new. There are about a dozen bar stools and some counters you can sit at to dine in, but that's it.

My coworkers and I got an assortment of items, which were all bigger in portion size than we expected. The food is heavy-- the kind that makes you want to take a siesta-- but flavorful, made to order, and made with real ingredients. 

The flauta is huge, and filling (I recommend beef)! The chicken quesadilla is delicious and also rather large. All the meat is flavorful and it seems to be shredded on site. The homemade chips are awesome! Truly delicious, if unhealthy, food. 

One thing I've got to say that irks me though, is the decor. I know, I know, we're in a college town. The inside of this small restaurant is painted cardinal red and covered in UW memorabilia. Fine. The bathroom however... Yes, your name is "Get Some Burritos", but do you really have to put suggestive quotes and euphemisms all over your walls? Aren't "that's what she said" jokes a little pass√© at this point? Step up your game GSB. Class it up just a touch, and maybe someday I'll dine in instead of always getting food to go.
