This sounded like a much more interesting restaurant than it turned out to be.  The portions are huge however our server offered to make me a small plate. The sangria was good and we did not try margaritas but they were also huge. My cheese enchilada was fine but nothing to write home about. I was going to order a chili relleno but they make them with bell pepper instead of chilis and you can only get them with meat so I passed. The server was nice but they were understaffed and service was very slow.  If you want a lot of food for a decent price this may be for you but I will be in search of something more interesting.
