Jeff and I were excited to give this place a try after hearing it had re-opened. We loved their beef tacos and menudo prior to the temporry closing. We had just finished hiking at Piestwea and were both very hungry. Jeff and I both loved the lengua tacos. They were juicy and with plenty of meat. The cabeza tacos had good flavor but were a little dry and bit too greasy. I didn't like the pastor tacos and neither did Jeff. They were unusually sweet for my liking and I didn't care for the texture of the meat. Finally, I ordered a large menudo and loved everything about this delicious red stew, except for the fact that it was a bit too greasy this time. I've had plenty of menudo and I know there are ways to take some of the fat out so it's not so heavy. The tortillas served on the side were very good. The service was good and speedy but they weren't busy either. We def don't think it's as good as before, but, considering how hard it is to find good authentic Mexican food in Az, I give the new Atoyac a slightly above average rating.
