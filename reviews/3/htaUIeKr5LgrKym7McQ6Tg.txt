Decent mexi-style food. The burritos or burrito bowls are probably your best bet. I've tried the Mexican pizzas a couple of times and they're impossible to eat pizza style....more like a soggy tostada. The meats are good and the salsa is fresh. Good thin chips. Clean dining are and Spartan but nice ambience. In my opinion Chipotle has the edge in taste but this is a nice alternative.
