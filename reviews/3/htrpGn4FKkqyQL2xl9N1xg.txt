God love Macayo Vegas

. It's been here since I can remember (and that's a mighty long time). The neighborhood around it has gone almost completely Mexican, but Macayo has not! It's still the same old quasi-mexican-style bastion of cuisine that may not be entirely autentico, but suits the cravings of gringos just fine.

 The endless bowls of hot, fresh chips and two kinds of salsa (the chunky is newer and seems to be more popular, but the smooth, more garlicky one still tastes like the 60's and makes me happy), and, of course, the crispy, cheesy, and just a little greasy TCT, are the draws that bring us back again. Never did care much for their regular tacos - too fast-food/ kind of dog-foody tasting but their deep fried shredded beef ones are sooo tasty, as are the wonderful cheesy, sour creamy enchiladas suizas.

 Now bringing the third generation here to color the exact same sombrero boy on the kid's menu.

 If you want authentic, trot across the street to Tacos El Gordo. If you want a cool, dark place to escape the noon sun, and indulge in a big plate of god-knows-what drenched in melted cheddar cheese and shredded lettuce, this is it! Viva Macayo!
