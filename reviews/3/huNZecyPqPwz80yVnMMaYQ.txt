I ordered the Gourmet Steak taco plate with two taco's and it came with chips and pintos beans The tacos were very good as were the chips. The pinto beans left much to be desired and lowered the rating remember to ask for rice instead of the beans. The mango and the regular Iced teas were also good with both lemon and lime added.
