This place will fix your fish taco craving in no time. Come in on Tuesdays for half off their classic fish taco after 2:30 PM... but you may have to remind the cashier, because their registers don't automatically give the discount. Wish I'd noticed this before I paid $8.

The shrimp verde taco is also good, but I'd personally request it on corn tortillas. They're currently promoting a langostino burrito that sounds tasty, but the fish tacos are reliably large and tasty. Service is surprisingly friendly and this location is a bit more formal than their usual grab-and-go set up.
