Im writing this one for the unhappy reviewer who stopped while on a road trip, just to clarify the La Bamba experience for any other Yelpers. La Bamba is a college town restaurant, famous for serving burritos to drunk college students when the drunk parade starts after the bars close.  La Bamba burritos as big as your head are well loved and well remembered by many Big 10 students.  

The Madison location used to be just off State Street, but moved out to the burbs some years ago.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very cold and cafeteria style; get your food, eat and get on your way.  I would not go here for a sit down Mexican meal.  Most folks go for one thing - the burritos.

My personal fave is the mini combo con todo!  Including that famous hot sauce.  It's been sixteen years since I graduated college, but every time we drive by East Wash we have to jump off 94 to get a La Bamba.  You crave them, wolf them down, and then think, meh.  It's alright.  (Not as good as at 3:00 a.m. after many many cheap tap beers).  The tacos are good as well, and they do have pastor.

I even pack a cooler and haul some up to my old college roomie in Mnpls.

Hint:  they taste even better the next day, after refrigeration for a day, and they do freeze well.

So if you want to try this wonderful burrito as big as your head experience, have at it.  If you want a nice Mex-American meal with frozen margaritas, this is not your place.
