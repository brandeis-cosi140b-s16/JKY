Fairly small place with limited parking in South Scottsdale.  Even though it is South Scottsdale you pay old town or north Scottsdale prices.  The chips and salsas that you get are substandard by comparison to places a lot cheaper. The food does taste excellent, however my wife's chicken came out very raw. They gladly took it back and gave us a free dessert for the problem.  If they had lower prices I would rate it higher but the prices dont justify a higher star rating.
