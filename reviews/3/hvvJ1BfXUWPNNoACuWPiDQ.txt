The location of this place is great.  Downtown Chandler is one of my favorites in the phoenix metro area and this is probably one of the most frequented mexican food places in the area.  

The mexican food here is good, dont get me wrong.  Yet, its not a home run (very few places ive been to in Phoenix are).  The chips came with salsa and bean dip which were good and pretty filling.  

The chicken I ordered was well cooked and adequately flavored.  However, upon ordering a side of guacamole, I was underwhelmed by the size of the serving they gave.  

Serranos is definitely a good joint.  Lookin for quality food with a great location, this is a good place to start.
