Came here with a bachelorette party of 9.  The atmosphere leaves much to be desired, but it did fit with the utilitarian feel of the Luxor.  We were hoping for a lively vibe, but it was pretty quiet and dull.  The food was decent.  I had the chicken enchiladas.  They were good.  The chips and salsa were pretty good.  I won't be rushing back here.
