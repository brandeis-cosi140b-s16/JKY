Great atmosphere,  great patio, loved the mist from the ceiling,  good service, but guacamole was too hard for dipping chips and it had chunks of pineapple which I didn't expect or liked,  their side dish of rice was so tasteless that I had to send it back, I'll keep going back hoping that they'll improve their food. No problems with parking around 2pm lunch.
