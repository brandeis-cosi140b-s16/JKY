I've been here a couple of times now (once for Sunday brunch and once for dinner at the bar) and I have yet to be impressed. The food is ok, some of it even tasty, but I wouldn't come back without some sort of reason (i.e. free drinks, restaurant.com gift certificate, etc.).

The best thing here is the margaritas. They do some really great margaritas with some really interesting flavors (ex. pineapple chipolte).

The salsas are good, but they're no different from some of the other Strip Mexican restaurants. And the chips are too greasy for me to enjoy.

The meat in the various offerings (tacos, enchiladas, etc.) has good flavor, but always seems too tough. And the tortillas are definitely not handmade or fresh.

The best thing I've had here (other than the margaritas) is the pork tacos with pineapple, onions, and cilantro. It was a delicious and interesting flavor combination.

The service, both times I was here, was slow, spotty, and not exactly friendly.

Bottom line: it's alright, but not worth a special trip.
