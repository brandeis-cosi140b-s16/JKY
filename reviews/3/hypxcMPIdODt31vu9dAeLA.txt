El Burro is a nice lunch option in the North Side.  The menu reminded me of some of my favorite Tucson-based, super authentic taco shops.  Nothing fancy, just the real deal on a menu board.  I went with the shredded beef burrito and some medium salsa on the side.  

The burritos are huge! It was a brick of Mexican goodness, ready to destroy my hopes and dreams of making through an afternoon of training in Allegheny Center.  The medium salsa had just the right amount of kick to it.  The burrito itself was tasty, but something about it just didn't knock it out of the park for me.  It was definitely a more authentic flavor, but still missing something.

I'd like to go back and give the tacos a try.  Corn tortillas always amp up the authenticity and flavor, and I want to see what this guac is all about.
