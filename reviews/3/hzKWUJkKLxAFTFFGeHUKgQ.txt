Food was good, portions were huge. This place was actually a lot better than I expected it to be! For being a big touristy restaurant on the strip, the food was pretty tasty. After reading other yelp reviews, I expected bad service but with our group of 7, we had some of the best service I've ever received at a restaurant. Our server, Mika was AWESOME!

Overall, if you are on the strip and looking for some cantina food, this is a good option. It is certainly overpriced, but considering the location most places are going to be. It is also a good place to watch some games because there are plenty of TVs all around the restaurant.
