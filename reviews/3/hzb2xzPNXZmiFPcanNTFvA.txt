Simple, fast, affordable Mexican.  Clean, but nothing fancy--not the type of restaurant for hanging out or meeting friends (no waiters or atmosphere). 

Similar in quality to Frank & Lupe's and Los Olivos. Not as good as, but cheaper than Los Sombreros.

Some things are decent, like the enchiladas.  Some are mediocre, like the carne asada. Some are awful, like the chicken salad.  So place your order and keep your fingers crossed.

Great for take-out if you live in Old Town.
