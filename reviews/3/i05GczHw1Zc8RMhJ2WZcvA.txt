i tried the  Pollo Fundido based on the comments below & so did my girlfriend.  she'd had it b4 and loved it which i didn't know at the time.  it was REALLY dry.  i thought it was me but i looked up at her and said "itsn't this kinda dry"?  it tasted good and the sauce was excellent and so was the rice. 

we complained, the manager came out, placated us with getting us more sauce (which was lukewarm) and that was it.  We still weren't happy and the bill came, they took one of them off.  FINALLY!!!  There were no excuses offered or any remedy the first time.  We were really disappointed and she more than me because that's why she chose this restaurant to celebrate my Bday.  Oh well...i've been here quite a few times and have always liked the food and atmosphere.  The chips were great and the salsa not bad.
