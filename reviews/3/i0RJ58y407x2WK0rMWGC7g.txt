I had a late lunch with my daughter today at this place. Decided to try it since I keep hearing good things about their food.  We were there around 2:PM and place was almost empty.  We were seated right away and a waitress brought us chips and salsa and took our drinks orders. Chips tasted fresh and salsa was good it only needed a bit of salt to my taste. In fact everything we ate needed salt.  I order a creamy strawberry agua fresca to drink and my daughter got a Dr. Pepper (can they don't have fountain drinks).  My agua fresca was super good!! So good we ended up ordering one to go after we were done with our lunch!!! I must add this was the best part of my meal!!!! 
My daughter order from the kids menu a quesadilla; she asked to replace carne asada with chorizo; which by the way came with beans and rice as side dishes.  Her beans were great and rice was ok.  I'm guessing her quesadilla was great cause I didn't get to try it as fast as she ate it.  
I order a corn quesadilla with chicharron El King style.  The corn tortilla is handmade and super delicious. I didn't like the chicharron so much but maybe cause I'm not used to that type of flavor. It was a bit too strong.  So almost half way I decided to take the chicharron out and eat the corn tortilla with the extra toppings (sour cream, queso fresco, onions and cilantro). My quesadilla came along with ice berg salad which by the way looked so old I didn't even attempted to eat it.  

I gave them three stars because the place look clean, waitresses were kind and very efficient and I didn't have to wait too long for my drinks or food. But everything we ate including the three different kind of salsas they brought to the table needed lots of salt. I must add that I usually don't add extra salt to my meals but this time I just had to or my food wouldn't had taste like anything.  
 I'll definitely go back and give it another try. Most of all because the the Aguas Frescas!!!
