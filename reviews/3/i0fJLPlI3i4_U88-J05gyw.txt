I ate here the other night and had an assortment of items: shredded beef taco, chicken and cheese enchilada, green corn tamale, green chile, and a tostada. Yes, I know, I am a fat-ass. Deal with it. All the food was fairly mediocre and not at all impressive. Both the green chile and enchilada sauce had a gravy-like consistency and almost had some flavor familiarities as well. The masa of the tamale was a bit dry, and did not have the sweetness I have come to love. Not much to say about the taco and tostada, pretty standard Sonoran fare, but I have had much better elsewhere.

Now to the staples. This is where they earned a few points. While none were stellar, the beans, rice, and flour tortillas were pretty good. The tortillas tasted homemade, but could be purchased from a local tortilleria. They also stay open later than most restaurants in Phoenix.

Also, worth a mention the only area to eat is an enclosure bordered by some walls and security doors on either side. It almost feels like you're in jail and I imagine its sweltering on a hot summer day. If you've had a few stints in tent city you will feel right at home (minus the pink underwear).
