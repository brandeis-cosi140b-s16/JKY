With the lack of a Chipotle downtown, Moe's is my go-to for a tasty burrito or taco.  They treat vegetarians right, having a tofu option and the meatless options cost almost a dollar less than their meatfull contemporaries.  Lots of different options (all with silly names) spanning Burritos, Tacos, Quesadillas, Salads and Nachos.  Ingredients seem pretty fresh, everything comes with chips and salsa (5-6 different options).  Can be VERY busy on a weekday lunch but they move people through very quickly.  Outdoor seating on the square is also nice.
