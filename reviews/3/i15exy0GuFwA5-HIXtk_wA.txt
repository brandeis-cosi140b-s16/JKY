Whenever I eat here I really want to love this place.  The chips & assorted salsas/dips you start with are SO great.  And then I get my entree.  And then I'm just left feeling mediocre about this place.

What's good: The aforementioned chips & salsa. $3 house margaritas (WHA?!? Yes Please).  Most sauces are good.  Food seems pretty fresh.

What's OK: Service. The actual food - it pretty much all tastes the same.

Nothing's bad...it just is a place to eat some OK Mexican food when you want a break from losing your money at the tables.
