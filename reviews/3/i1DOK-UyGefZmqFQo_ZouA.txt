For the amount of $ you will be spending at Javier's it is expensive. I thin that there are places off of the strip for a lot less and just as good. Although I am a mexican food lover and the actual food is good. 

If you have the funds to spend and you want the exciting aria environment than I recommend it. But $30 for a taco, enchilada beans and rice is a lot. 

Food is good though.
