Ok so I went to Americas for the first time and I gave them three stars because I feel that is the most that I can give them. It is a cute place but they only have two kinds of meat..... Carne Asada and Al pastor so those two meats in tortas, tacos, quesadillas and burritos. I had the Al pastor quesadilla and the smallest Orchata I could get. The quesadilla was pretty good the Al pastor was properly made the Orchata was extremely sweet and definitely from a powder mix. My real disappointment was the price for my small meal, 8 dollars my friend got the larger quesadilla and a can of soda and that was over 10 dollars. The food was pretty good but definitely over priced for a normal workday lunch.
