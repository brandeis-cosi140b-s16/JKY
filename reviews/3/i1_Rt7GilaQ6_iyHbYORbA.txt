El Pollo loco is the Spanish word for crazy chicken. After spending hours hiking in Fletcher Canyon then driving across the valley, I felt like an el pollo loco. I was dying of hunger in a part of the Warm Springs corridor where there really isn't many restaurants. After a few year hiatus of dining in an El Pollo Loco, I'd choose this one as my post - hike dinner.

  On a Saturday night, it was calm. A line was nonexistent. I ordered the two piece breast and wing that included two sides and two corn tortillas and a small drink (self-serve refills) for less than  $9. The chicken was good but not GREAT. I'd take Raising Canes or broaster chicken over this in a heartbeat. Regardless, I have nothing bad to write about the chicken. The two side dishes that I complimented the chicken with were rice and cole slaw. I enjoyed the side dishes as much as the three star chicken.

   After leaving El Pollo loco filled up and no longer feeling like a dying of hunger el pollo loco, I walked to my car with the impression that my meal was good but short of the greatness of a Chick Fil-A or Raising Caines.
