The place has good food, but WAY OVER PRICED for the quanity.  If you feel like paying $8.00 for 3 baby finger sized tacos then be their guest. I can't remember the last time that I spent $50.00 for lunch for myself and a women sitting on a stool at a counter with NO alcohol involved. Way over priced for what you get.  I'll stick to Las Palmas for my tacos.
