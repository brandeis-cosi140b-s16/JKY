This place is a toss up... Tamales are good the masa is very smooth and moist and different from a lot of places. It's a small place and not super clean but it's  no biggie since we usually get tamales to go. But I am only posting this in hopes that the owner does read their reviews. Their staff is in big need of evaluation. They are far from friendly, slow, unattentive and seriously need to learn to answer the phone.
