Tacos Sonora Grill is located a stones throw away from Chase Field. Nope, not close enough to walk there...unless you've got the time, but it could be a great little stop on the way to the game. The menu is very limited; I hope you like beef. I do and enjoy the little tacos. They taste good and you can choose from three salsas and a few items to garnish your meal. Unfortunately, the menu leaves me craving a little more variety and I wonder "What if?" Until then, TSG is the little restaurant I'll appreciate for what it is which is simple tacos at a decent price that can suit your needs when you're around the corner or craving some good street tacos. Buen provecho!
