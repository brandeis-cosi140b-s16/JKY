Some friends invited us out for dinner and suggested this place. They recommended the house Margarita's. Our party was for 4 and we all wanted one so we decided to get a pitcher... this wasn't a good idea as it turns out. The pitcher didn't save us any money at all which we all found strange - next time we'll just get our own glass I guess. The Margarita's were good though.

The food was good but the service was so-so...our friends said the service is usually much better and that the waitress may be new since they had never seen her before (we sat on the bar side). I won't really hold the slow service against them too much right now.

So based on my first experience I'll give them 3-Stars; however, we will go again and possibly revise to 4-Star based on the feedback from friends.
