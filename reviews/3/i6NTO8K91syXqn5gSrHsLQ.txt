Chipotle is convenient for a quick and easy meal to go or sit and dine. This location had a line during the lunch hour. However, it moved at a decent pace. Thank you for being quick! Pleasant music was enjoyed during my short lunch break. I don't think I have ever noticed that before. 

To the meat of my review - I've been to Chipotle numerous times to several locations for the past few years. I've noticed that the portions of the meat seem to skimp out quite frequently.  I would like to feel like I spent $8 for half chicken half barbacoa bowl. But I got mostly rice and beans more than anything.  This seems to be a common trend in many chains.  I hate having to ask to put in more meat. 

I enjoy the taste and combination, but please bring back the original portion size for us meat lovers!
