I have been to Maria Bonita a few times for lunch.  We normally go just before noon and so far haven't had  much of a wait.  The chips are crispy, warm and fresh.  I think the salsa is good - it tastes freshly made and has good flavor.

They have a good selection of lunch specials which are a good value. In my opinion,  the quality of food here is very good.   The bright decor and open feel of the space makes it warm and welcoming.
