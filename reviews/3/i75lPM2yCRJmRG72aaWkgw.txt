I used to love this place SOOOO much! The chocolate chile shake is to die for! My standard used to be the chocolate chile shake, fries, stand sauce, and if I was super hungry (yes, I can eat a little bit), a veggie taco. It was all fantastically delicious! 

Unfortunately, the past two times that I have gone, the fries have been either burnt or soggy. They don't taste horrible, but they definitely are not the glorious potatoes that they were before. 

As for the service, it now takes far longer for me to get my food (or even make an order) than it used to.

All around, I'm almost kind of glad that they went down from 5 stars in my book to 3; it makes my move out of the area much easier to handle.
