Holy Crap 14 bucks for a Mimosa?!? Breakfast at the Mexican place sounded way better than a greasy biscuit sandwich or Chili's.  I'm pretty sure everything was precooked but chorizo and eggs was halfway decent, they have Cholula sauce, and the mimosa is Korbel not crappy Cooks or something like that.  But those were yesterday's nasty dried up tortillas. Yuck. 

The server was super friendly and just-right attentive.  And let's not forget that I'm in the airport, so this gets a 3-star pass.
