About one step closer to authentic than Roberto's as Roberto's is from Macayo's.  The meat choices include all the usual including tripas, which is one step closer to authentic than lengua, which lengua is pretty much as far as Roberto's goes.  The Mexican community really likes this restaurant so it must be good!

You usually have to wait in one line to order a certain kind of meat and then another line handles the more exotic items.  Usual stuff but the food is much better than Tacos Mexico.  I'm not much of a Mexfood fan so 3 stars is really generous and if you do like it than you may rate it higher.  It is still very delicious.
