I ordered a Watermelon Rita and got a 14oz drink in a 16oz glass. Looked 3 quarters full so I asked about it... Manger came to explain how it was 14oz in 16oz glass... Really?  Please sell a full glass of alcohol?!?

The food was tasty and enjoyed the salsa that came with the chips. Each of the 3 of us enjoyed what we ordered.  Food was good..... Drinks?  Could be a top tier restaurant...
