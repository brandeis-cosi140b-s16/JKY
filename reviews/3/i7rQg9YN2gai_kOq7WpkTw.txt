Fair warning: The servers here are quite unpleasant, surprisingly indifferent.

Being close to where I stay brings me here mostly. Southwestern wings with cilantro and garlic is pretty nice. Another reason to be here is they have ciders available. For main course my favorite are Enchiladas. The Super Mad Mex with chickpea is awesome n very filling. Chicken chimi is another good dish.

Burritos are quite, boring, to be honest. I can get a far better one at Chipotle. Same goes for tacos. Nothing inspiring there. 

But despite "average" service, I like the ambiance and bar. Not a bad place to hangout.
