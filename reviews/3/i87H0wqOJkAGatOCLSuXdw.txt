I had never been to Moe's but had heard good things and am a fan of build your own type burrito joints so I ended up trying this place out one day when I was in the area and starving for some lunch.  I must say I was impressed.  Not only can you customize you order and watch it be constructed in front of you but they give you free tortilla chips and have a great salsa buffet to meet you fancy (so, of course I had to try all 5).  This is definitely my kind of place.
