Our workplace was slightly abuzz about this new Mexican joint down the street. Everyone heard about the "free" chicken or steak bowl or burrito deal. I say "free" because it's free with the purchase of a drink and chips. How much do said drink and chips cost? A non-trivial $5.82!!!

I won't complain too much. That's a good price for basically a full meal. I just think it's trickery. Anyway, the steak bowl was pretty darn good. Very fresh tasting and delicious overall. Unfortunately, the horchata I had was sub-par. I'm not sure how most places make horchata, but theirs seems like it comes from some sort of powder mix. I felt like I had gulps of undissolved horchata powder. So much for 100% Natural.

As for the chips, no wonder the meal almost costs $6! They give you a humongous bag of tortilla chips. Taste-wise, they were pretty standard. I went through the drive-thru, so I'm not sure about their salsa bar situation, but if I had known they would give so many chips, I would have gone inside and gotten more salsa.

I suppose I'll give this place another try some time down the road. After all, I'm always clamoring for more lunch options.
