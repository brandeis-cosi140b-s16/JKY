The food is delicious but the drive thru takes way too long every single time. My visit today I was the only car and it took over 10 minutes of sitting at the window to get my food, which I can deal with however I got home and realized they didn't put the flan that I paid for in the bag. I live too far away to go back, I should have checked but I assumed they would be able to put the right contents in the bag. Cashier is almost never friendly even when I say please and thank you. Food is good but I don't think I'll be going back again
