The Fuentes family has extended themselves and this Champaign El Toro location is definitely the best one in town (if you don't have a rapport with individuals at another location that is) , and I usually have a pretty decent experience here. 

A few notes:

The place is fairly big, but the parking lot isn't, so if you pull up and can't find a spot in the lot, you can find some parking on-street parking and will still be able to get a table once you go in...don't quote me though!

For the most part the waitstaff's 1st language is Spanglish, so be prepared to talk slow and point to what you want.....I don't think I ever had an issue with lack of communication. 

Additionally  they may be a server short at all times as they are always running around trying to serve and do not fully spend as much time at the table to ensure accuracy of orders (especially special orders, etc.). 

My last experience the food was just alright....maybe a tad bland and lackluster. I usually get the Alambres dish...but strayed this go round....

I'd highly suggest trying the Alambres dish to anyone and will probably stick to that. I usually get the mix of steak, chicken, bacon, peppers, and cheese with the usual sides...comes out like fajitas....sizzling and ensuring it'll be nice and hot.

The drinks are alright, but I think are a little too expensive for the alcohol content.

I think they would benefit from an aggressive happy hour special with extended hours everyday...something to help them stand apart from all of the other competition in town which may have a slight edge in the flavor/authenticity department..

Nonetheless, El toro is a solid place to go.
