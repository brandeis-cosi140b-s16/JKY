Just called to find out if they were still open. Their yelp page says they're open till midnight but a review says 11pm. So I call at 10:58pm and a guy tells me that they're still open so I ask till when and he says "we close at 11pm". I understand people get busy at restaurants but come on! I needed tacos but didn't want nasty taco bell this late. Still haven't experienced the food yet so I'll just give 3 stars then adjust the review accordingly
