Got a carne asada burrito and a side of beans.

Both were very good but the price is why I wouldn't recommend or go back. And the side of beans was only a half pint. You can get the same thing at Filberto's for almost half the price. Period. And, the carne asada at Filberto's has onions in it. :] 

If you're going to open a small non chain restaurant, you need to either somehow REALLY set yourself apart from other restaurants selling similar foods or the price needs to be roughly the same.

Filberto's on McClintock  & Guadalupe is probably at the very top of every mexican restaurant I've been to. Never been let down.
