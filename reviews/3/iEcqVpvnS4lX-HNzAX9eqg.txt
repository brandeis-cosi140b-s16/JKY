This is a hip and casual little mexican place, great for grabbing a quick bite to eat, especially if you're not wanting to spend much.  I'm not sure (and don't really care) how authentic it is.  The street tacos were good and better than anything I've had at Chipotle. 

 El Burro deserves to thrive but I hope it never branches out as a chain because I think that's exactly what really sets it apart from shitty alternatives like Taco Bell.  There's a reason food served by aloof teenagers and generally people who just don't give a fuck remind us we usually get what we pay for, but El Burro is the exception to that rule.
