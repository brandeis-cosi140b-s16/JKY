Growing up in Arizona, I have eaten at Macayos a number of times, throughout Phoenix and Tucson. It is a favorite stop for our kids, namely because of the ambience. You don't feel uncomfortable if the kids get a little noisy.

From that perspective, this one did not disappoint. However, the recipes at this location were a little different. Most notably, everything was a little less spicy. I usually order the "hot" salsa to go with my chips, as well as a baja chimi. Based on my experience in AZ, I expected them to be relatively spicy. Instead, they were pretty bland.
