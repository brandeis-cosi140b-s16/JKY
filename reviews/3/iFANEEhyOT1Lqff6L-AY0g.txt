There food is average, I would say,  I did like there chips and salsa a lot.  I had chicken fajita the chicken didn't have much flavor, and a little dry. I think because of the location they don't get too busy, because on a saturaday they could sit us right away, so that was nice because I hate waiting for a table. I would go here again and try something different.
