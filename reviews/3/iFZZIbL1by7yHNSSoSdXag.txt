I had high hopes for this place. Chinese Mexican fusion sounds like an awesome combo, right??

Unfortunately, the service was somewhat slow, and the food was average. Nothing special at all (I would say some of the noodle dishes tasted premade). 

The tacos are tiny and pricey! I would say they are definitely not worth it (even though they have some cool combinations like Mushrooms and Guac).

The only outstanding items I had here were the lamb potstickers. They were juicy, unique, and tasty!
