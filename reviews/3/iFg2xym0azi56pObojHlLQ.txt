When eating at SomeBurros, I must remember that it is a family oriented, step above fast food, quick/fresh mex place, that does a good job of appealing to all palettes. That means.. from 5 year old kids, to granny.. which equates to.. BLAND. They have a wide array of fairly unique and original dishes, but because it tends to be insufferably bland, SomeBurros only gets 3 stars, instead of 4.  Pre-Diet, I used gorge on their Pollo Fundido.. which is a delightful blend extremely lean, white meat (canned?) chicken, fried in a flour tortilla, and glopped with a tasty cream cheese type sauce. Yum. days of eating fried crispy things, are past, however, and this time, I opted for the Verde Scramble (I luv some MexiBreakfast) and tried one of their new Carne Asada Tacos on the side.  The Verde Scramble was assembled well, but was painfully bland. The Carne Asada Taco was nothing special.. and a bit over priced at $2.50.  
My sum up of SomeBurros - Quick, decently priced non-offensive Mexican food.  Something for just about everyone, and since it's not spicy, it's not gonna rip your gut up. :)  ALSO - Staff is universally friendly, and I love eating on the patio.
