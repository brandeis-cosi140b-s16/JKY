We actually came to the Southside to try Carmella's but they don't serve food on Sundays or Mondays. So we decided to head across the street to Steel Cactus. 
We walked in to a warm, glowing, welcoming place. The host was nice and our server even nicer. We started out our meal with an order of chips & queso. Our wait wasn't long. The chips were hot and crispy and the queso had a little bit of spice. 
For dinner I ordered 3 pulled chicken tacos on flour shells. You could get them 2 ways. I went "Mexican"- cilantro, onion, and grated cheese. It came with black beans and rice. My son ordered 3 pork belly tacos. They also came with black beans and rice. We both thought the beans and rice were okay.  The chicken on my tacos was moist and tender but not much flavor. You could really taste the cilantro or onion. It tasted more like parsley.   I was bummed. My son said his pork belly tacos were really good. They had a red cabbage slaw on top. 
The portions were just enough for a meal but I had already eaten the queso and chips so I ended up taking home one if my tacos and most of my beans and rice. 
The food was okay but we have other places that in the area that are better.
