So this place is definitely a tourist trap, and because I was a tourist and was already under the influence of the Vegas life I enjoyed this place and have less complaints than someone who may have went sober 

I purchased a groupon drink deal before coming and it was pointless because as soon as I entered I saw a sign indicating that they have the deal without the groupon -_-good promotion trap. 

Their food is a little on the pricey and not terrible however there is nothing that would make you say "I need to come back to get this."

While there a family came in with young children and were very offended at the signs that said "horny" "virgin" etc. and left abruptly. From the time they came in I wondered what about the place said "child friendly" to begin with.
