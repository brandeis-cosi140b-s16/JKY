For street tacos, I got the asada... they are good, nothing special. I've had better. The price is good and staff was friendly and fast. Seemed clean enough.
It's better than Taco Bell or Del Taco any day!
Parking is kind of weird, they are set up in the parking lot of a carwash/detail center, so parking can be at a minimum at times and lot can be busy.
Area seems safe, non-seedy...I left my car there for a few hours after the taco stop late at night and it was good when I returned. Yay!
