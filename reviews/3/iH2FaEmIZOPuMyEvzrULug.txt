I love that this venue is right downtown just two blocks from where I work. They've had some great live music in the short time that they've been open. Even if you don't want to pay the cover to see the show you can still hear the tunes while sitting at the bar having a beer or righteous cocktail or two.

I like the atmosphere of the place but was a little disappointed that the cocktail I paid for was at first delayed and finally not available after about ten minutes of waiting (due to lack of ingredients). I'll give the benefit of the doubt and say that they are still getting up and running but that was still a bit of a shocker.

Haven't tried the food here yet but I'm eager to come back and take in some more live tunes and have a few cocktails.
