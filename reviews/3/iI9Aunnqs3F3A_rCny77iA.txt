It's Taco Bell.  If your not ordering with the expectation of future diarrhea, you're only fooling yourself.  

There seems to be high turn around of staff here.  Each time I've gone thru the drive thru, whomever was working seemed like they were doing the very best they could with what they were doing.  Friendly, most likely underpaid, and just trying to make ends meet.  I've never experienced rudeness which is huge.

As for mixed up orders, burnt items, missing items, and sauce all over the outer wrapper--occasional yes to one or all.  Check your bags first.  If they are wrong, they are happy to fix it.  Save some Tums for later.
