OK, so here's the deal, you're at PV Mall and it's lunchtime. You go to the food court and see that Paradise Bakery is the only decent choice but that's where you ate the last 47 times you were here. Easy solution, get in your car and drive across Tatum to Julio G's.
The chips and salsa are free, plentiful, and delicious. The menu has all the standard Mexican menu items and are reasonably priced. Everything I've tried here was OK. Not, "OMG", but OK. Service has also been fine.
Note, the portions are huge! I've never been able to finish my entree but maybe it's because I go through two baskets of chips.
