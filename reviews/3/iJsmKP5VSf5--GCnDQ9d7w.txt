A couple co-workers and I decided to try this place for lunch today since we are working in the Downtown area.  At first, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I didn't realize Downtown and any decent places to eat like this but I was pleasantly surprised.

Area - clean and next to the Mob Museum.

Food - similar to fusion style.  I ordered the chicken Milanese torta.  Very tasty!  I enjoyed this very much.  It was a fairly good portion, however I thought the price was a bit steep.  $10.00 for my order, it came with a small side of chips but no drink.

Restaurant - airy, clean, cafeteria style setting.  Many of the people working in the surrounding areas were having lunch there so this place would be good for a business luncheon.

Staff - friendly.. not much more to say.

Maybe when it's pay day or I feel like splurging a bit on bar-style food I'll make a trip back here.  I also want to try their happy hour.
