The good:

 To be honest ,I've had better (this is not a knock against them, just been to a lot of Mexican restaurants), but I think it is very good. Definitely at least a 7 out of 10, even on a bad night. Chips and salsa is very good.

I really like Friday night live music In Mateo's, the bar side of Sylvias.  A band that plays there often, called Picoso, is a real treat!  They are made up of veteran musicians and music teachers, and do some great classic rock cover tunes, from Beatles to Santana. 

they have a nice out door seating area, Spanish tile and a fountain make it very esthetically pleasing and relaxing.

The Bad:

It takes forever to get your order taken.  I've been there probably 20 times, and we go through this every time.  We usually sit in the Mateo bar side.  The bartender and/or waitress takes forever to get us chips, or even to take our order.  They crawl for the drinks, too.  When in the restaurant side, you get faster service, but not by much.

I recommend them, but just go with the expectation of waiting a while for service and inattentive servers.
