I was told that I have to try Roberto's when I moved to Vegas. I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, so I wasn't really in a rush. 

A friend told me he always gets the breakfast burrito at this specific location the morning after a night of heavy drinking. I decided to give it a shot one morning and I was hooked on Roberto's. I've tried a bunch of items on the menu, but always go back to the breakfast burrito. It cures everything.

The staff here are all very nice and service is quick so you're not standing around the gas station too long.

I visited another location (Buffalo/Charleston) and they prepared the breakfast burrito differently and the tortilla tasted old. I'll never stray from this property.

Additionally, I just noticed that they have daily sales. For example chicken tacos are $1 today. I found dinner!

There's also free wifi if you feel like sitting outside at a gas station eating a burrito and rocking your iPad.
