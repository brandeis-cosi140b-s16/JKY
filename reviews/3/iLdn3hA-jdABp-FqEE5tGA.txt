Oh no.. I've been waiting for my order for more than 15 minutes. I understand it was busy but they've been calling numbers 29, 30 & 31 those people who are eating in the restaurant (my number was 26 and it's to go) They should prioritize orders that are to go. I ordered carnitas and it was not what i expected. I paid $8 something and I didn't even finish it. I should have just ordered crispy tacos on the safe side.
