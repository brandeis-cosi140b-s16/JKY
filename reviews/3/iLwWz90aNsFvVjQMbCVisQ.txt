First visit was a 4 star visit. Second visit was a totally different experience. The food is consistent and good. We happened to go when they were busy and unfortunately the service was really poor. I was left for 10 minutes without my food while the others food got cold. When we asked the food runner about it she claimed to not speak English. Because you pay and tip when you order there isn't much you can do about the service. While I like so many things about the food here I can't see myself rushing back unless I want to eat at an off the norm time.
