Food is always good. I like getting breakfast burritos here. They are better than most places plus it has a drive thru to make it a little easier when I'm on the go. This is the only "fast food" Mexican that I like their red sauce. Their sopes are awesome. The only issue I have had is sometimes their customer service is bad. I have had them be rude a couple times. I also have gone there in the morning and nobody is there. They are supposed to be open but doors are locked and lights are off. That's very annoying because I drive by a couple places that I could get similar food.
