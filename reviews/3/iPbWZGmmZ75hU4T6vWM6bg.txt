Fausto's is in the same strip mall as Jenni Pho, just down the street (south) from Oyshi Sushi. I've been to this strip mall numerous times but just noticed Fausto's a couple days ago. That can't be good for business... having signs so small that people don't even notice it. But, I'm hoping they'll be around for awhile because they've got some decent and cheap Mexican food. I got a chicken chimichanga combo plate that came w/ rice and beans for $6.75. The size of this thing was huge! It was so much food that it almost made me want to vomit... but in a good way. The outside of it was nice and crispy and they smother half of it in sour cream and the other half in guacamole. The chicken was a little tough, but I wasn't expecting fine-dining quality food anyway. The rice was a little dry and the beans were extra mushy. But for the price and quantity, I'll take it. The inside of the place is nice and clean and the staff was friendly. Good cheap eats.
