I've been meaning to try this place out, since it's in my 'hood, and was pleasantly surprised.

I thought I'd try their carne asada, since they're down the block from the wonderful Asadero Toro. Everything was great... the beans, thick and flavorful, the rice spiced deliciously. Grilled onions. A freshly deep fried jalapeno. Smoky hot red salsa.But the beef... left a little something to be desired in texture, though the flavor is great. The portion os huge, but I'd prefer a more traditional flank/skirt than the eye of round or whatever it is they are using. It's a little gristly but not fatty and charred.

However - the flavor and cooking were so good that I'll def be back to try a sopa, torta, or for breakfast. I could see writing a 2nd review with 4 stars. The 3 is only because of the cut of beef used for the carne asada. 

I photographed my food and the menu - uploading shortly.
