This place is not one of my favorites but we were at Sunset Station and decided to go.  First off, I love that they have a salsa bar!  They have tons of different salsas and I always head there before I even sit down.  I just break off from the hostess and always have to find my way to our table with chips and salsa in hand.  The past two times I have gone, I got back to the table and there were chips and salsa waiting.  Why have a salsa bar AND bring chips to the table?  If you find out, let me know.  My big problem with this place is the chicken.  I'm not sure if they boil it or what but any chicken dish I have eaten here is dry and not too tasty.  They do fine cheese enchiladas but I think chicken at a Mexican restaurant should be top notch and at this place, it just isn't.  I don't have incredibly high standards for Mexican food and this place is alright.  Salsa Bar, Yes!  Chicken, No!
