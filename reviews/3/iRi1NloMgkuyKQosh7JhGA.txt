Used to be an amazing franchise when it was in the Palazzo... but now, I am somewhat concerned.

The ambiance felt too much like a run down, Tijuana joint... it certainly has potential, but I felt the effort was not to the luxury that the Dos Camino's name is used to.

Food wise... the Guacamole was still fantastic... I had the Mahi Mahi Tacos, which were also good, but I heard conflicting reports on the Tuna Seviche.

My biggest concern was the fact that although they accepted Open Table reservations, they denied using OpenTable dollars for the meal.  It is embarrassing to show up to a venue, in hopes of using your rewards to assist in the bill payment, and to be denied because "Corporate doesn't allow us to use gift cards/ OpenTable checks"... BS! Open Table is just like cash currency, they are required to use them... but instead of admitting that they don't know what they were doing, they denied me and advised that I must pay full price up front.

Needless to say, I won't be returning.
