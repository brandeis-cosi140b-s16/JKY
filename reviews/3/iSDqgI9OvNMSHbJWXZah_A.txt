Friday night, meting a several friends for a drink. They had a live bad and the weather was great. 

That was the good of it. 

The server, while nice, was slooow and the drinks were weeeeak. The prices are average, which makes a bad combo. 

Once the band stopped and the house music started it pretty much killed the fun. 

Was not a fan of the food last time but neglected to eat this time.
