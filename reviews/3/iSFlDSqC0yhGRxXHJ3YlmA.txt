Came here alone on a business trip, restaurant wasn't terribly busy for a Sunday. The chips were ok but the bean dip was really good! Got the Pollo Monterrey and it was really good. A large juicy chicken breast served over fresh pico de gallo topped with avocado slices and then cheese over top served with rice - ingredients were fresh flavored were simple and well done. The restaurant was clean with nice decor, wait staff was nice enough, I would have gone for 4 stars but there just wasn't anything that really stood out here!
