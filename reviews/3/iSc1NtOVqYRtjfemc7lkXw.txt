Good food, little more expensive than chipotle and you get less. Not that anyone in America needs any larger portions given the average size of obese America lol. TERRIBLE,  customer service from the two ladies I see working here on a daily basis. They should be in the back doing paperwork, being in the front of the house involves personality and friendliness. Doesn't surprise me why this place has 2.5 stars, they'll never be able to compete with chipotle with that business motto
