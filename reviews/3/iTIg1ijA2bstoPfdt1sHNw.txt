They were OK, I have been eating pupusas for 30 years all over SoCal/SF/Phoenix, these were decent.  We had revueltas, bean & cheese, calabasa.  Like most pupuserias in the US, the curtido is too fresh, curtido gets so much better the longer it sites.  I will try others in Vegas to see how they compare.
