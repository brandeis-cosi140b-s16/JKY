We were looking for a quick place to grab a "snack" in Boulder City. Perfect. 

Food was ok. I was kind of dumb and ordered a 'platter' for a snack, so I had way too much food. (a beef burrito and a cheese enchilada with beans and rice.) 
The food came up quickly, but the cheese in my enchilada was not melted. At all. I didn't want to make a fuss so I just ate it. 
Burrito was ok - just meat, I think. The tortilla was really soft and chewy though. 

Co-guests had tacos that looked good. I should have just kept to a 'snack'.
