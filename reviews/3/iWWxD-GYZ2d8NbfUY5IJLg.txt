I saw a write up on this place some time ago in the New Times.. figured with the sea of Mexican restaurants over on that side of Mesa this would have to be special to stand out. Does it stand out, meh? It's alright.. the food is very fresh and grilled to order as well as the tortillas. They also have a fresh veggie and salsa bar that pretty decent. The avocado salsa is very good as is the pico de gallo.

Just for me the flavors weren't all there on the meat. I had the biztec and the pork adobado.. both were decent enough but the meat for the biztec just seemed not as fresh as it could have been. If I were in the neighborhood I would certainly stop by again but since I rarely venture to this side of town I'm not sure if Ill ever go back. 

I think Id like to try another location, the one on 35th ave isnt to far from my work.. plus the service was so friendly and well organized.. its worth another shot!
