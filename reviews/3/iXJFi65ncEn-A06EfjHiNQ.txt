When the option is available, I will choose to eat at places like Martinez Taco Shop any day over Roberto's. That being said, there's definitely room for improvement at this Taco Shop. Being the difficult ass that I am, I ordered a custom burrito with the fixings I wanted (5 ingredients). My better half ordered the "Surf and Turf" burrito ($8.99). The soda machine was STILL broken since our last visit a month or two ago, but this time our drinks were comped and we were given 2 glass Coca Colas "Hecho in Mexico". 

My burrito was missing sour cream, even though I had to repeat what I wanted to the cashier and cook 3 times. I still ate it though- I mean, the burrito was good but could have been better if they made it right. On the other hand, my husband's burrito was missing the steak and french fries. Those are key ingredients to the burrito people! He had to get a new burrito made. Instead of the cashier verbally telling the cook what the order is, there should be a ticket system where she writes out orders so there's no mistakes or any of this back and forth nonsense.

Unfortunately, it was also stifling hot inside the restaurant. It's summer and I want some A/C dammit! The tables and chairs were a little dirty too. This place isn't busy, so there's really no excuse for that. What the problem is? 

Customer service and food is good. I love the way the place is decorated! Martinez Taco Shop just needs to clean up their act and get organized.
