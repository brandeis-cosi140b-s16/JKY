It doesn't matter if this place has a one star rating or a five star rating. You will go here  because you are desperate for a pre-flight beer and you want some nachos. That being said, the pork nachos are pretty good. Don't expect it to be cheap, you're at an airport and it the only place in the terminal that serves alcohol. They know the demand is high.
