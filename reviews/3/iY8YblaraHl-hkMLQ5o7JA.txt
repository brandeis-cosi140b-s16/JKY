I always like to give my business to local, family owned places.  La Fonda is just my kind of place.  You could tell most of the diners were regulars and the wait staff knew them.  We were greeted and seated quickly.  Our drink orders were taken and a minute later a bowl of fresh, hot chips and salsa arrived.  I have to say these were hands down the best chips I have tasted in ages!  The salsa was great too!!  If you have a craving for chips and salsa, this is the place!

I have a chicken burro.  The chicken was tender and tasty.  It was a good size too.  I was very full afterward.  My daughter had chicken nuggets and fries since she was not feeling "mexican" that night.  She said they were very, very good and gave a big thumbs up to the server when she asked her how her dinner was.  

This place is just up the street from my daughters school, on the way home.  We will be back!!  And even I'm not too hungry, just chips and salsa will do the trick.  YUM!
