I have only been to America's 3 times and every time I try to have something different because I always hear people rant and rave about it.  I only give it 3 stars because the food is just fair in my opinion.  I have been to other places that have better tasting carne asada and a better selection on salsas.  I think they try and put amodern twist on their tacos but sometimes simple and old fashion is better than "fancy" ingredients.

I will probably still go there if I need a carne asada fix and cant get to Tucson but it isnt someplace that I would take people for anything authentic.
