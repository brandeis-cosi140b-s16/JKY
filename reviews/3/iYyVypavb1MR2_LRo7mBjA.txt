Hey Yall....I don't ask for much and what I do ask for is HOT FOOD.....not scalding but yes throughly heated not cool/cold to the touch....1st impression was nice quaint place...my waiter who NEVER told me his name tossed the menu on the table then stepped back to allow me to follow where the menu landed....i ordered the Chicken Creamy Burro thingy and I should have kept the cold one that came out 5 minutes after i ordered.... Oh oh wow your food is already come up. I'm far from an idiot and have eaten out enough you know that that was someone else's order in something with me the wrong or they change their minds. So after they know if the time was ice cold okay maybe not ice cold but it was cold enough that I could stick my fingers did I mention I that I have been sensitive hands and was able to put my fingers my beans and into the sauce. Long story short they brought me another creamy cheesy burrito thing it was okay not as good as the one I sent back having regrets hmmmmm regret sorta
