I have found that the food is not very consistent here. By that I mean that some items are delicious and some are nearly inedible. Here's the breakdown: 

Chips and salsa/ beans- quite good 
table-side guacamole- delicious! 
Shrimp tacos- icky disgusting with no flavor at all 
Chile Verde- gross partially sweet stew with a minuscule amount of pork 
tortilla soup- nice broth with smooth chunks of avocado, my usual dish 
bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer- sometimes amazing, sometimes overcooked and sat under a lamp for too long. 

Given the current choices at the Santa Fe, you might be better off hitting the food court.
