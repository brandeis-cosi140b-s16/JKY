It's overhyped. I loved Esmeralda's before they shut it down. Ordered pork and cheese pupusas. Cheese was tasty but the pork had no taste. Even the tomato salsa and curtido were just ok. Pretty disappointed but what should I expect taking advice from Mexicans and Asians who don't have a tongue for salvadorean food. If your full Salvi like me don't buy into the hype. This place is just OK.
