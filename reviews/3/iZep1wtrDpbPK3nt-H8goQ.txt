First off, it's Chipotle. I already know what to expect when I walk in the door. The food was consistent, the staff was nice, but the place was dirty. Granted, it was filled with college kids, and this was a busy time for them right after classes got out at UNLV (around 4ish). That being said, it was hard to get over the dirtiness of the dining area, the lack of a salt shaker (hey I found one sitting on a table, some kids thought it was theirs to have and hold for all eternity), but maybe Chipotle should invest in more than one. 
Staff was nice, I'll return again.
