I went here for dinner once. I saw duck tacos and got really excited because I love duck, but it wasn't really that good. They weren't really tacos as much as they were mini burritos or rolls. The chips and salsa didn't really stand out either as being anything special. The food and drinks are just ok. 

What I assume you would come for is the atmosphere. There's live music playing, and the decor is nice. Seems like they're going for the "romantic" vibe with the lighting, or lack thereof. 

The waitress was telling out that Carlos Santana was there, and pointed him out. He was really far away and I really didn't care. Anyway, I wasn't too impressed with the performer, and I can't imagine he was either. 

This place is good for large groups, and it worth a visit if you're in the area.
