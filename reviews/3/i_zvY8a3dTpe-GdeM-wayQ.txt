Takes FOREVER to get your food, if you have less than an hour to get food here, don't plan on going...or call in ahead of time. The burger and fries were super greasy! maybe you like your food like that but i am not that big of a fan. The burger is pretty typical, nothing special, priced pretty high for the quantity and quality you get. 

It is a nice change of pace for the food that is around in this area though.

I would hesitate on eating there, really dark and the tables are super sticky...blech...


Oh yeah order at the right of the cage of confusion...
