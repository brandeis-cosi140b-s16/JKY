I don't get over to the east side often so Los Antojos has been on my to try list forever, but I finally had the opportunity to give it a try. Walking in, I was overwhelmed by the menu. I wanted one of everything. I settled on the enchiladas with mole. I don't find it too often outside of my visits to Mexico so I had to try it. The husband ordered something else that sounded delicious. I don't recall now what it was because there was a mix up in the kitchen and they served two orders of mole. It mattered none to us. No sharing needed. Although, the mole sauce was bit too bitter. 

When I find myself in the area I'd seek our Los Antojos again and try another menu item.
