One does not expect a 1960's Esquivel space age bachelor pad decor when wandering into a Mexican restaurant but here it is; looking like something out of Epcot Center/ opening year. The Kenny G flavored smooth jazz doesn't help matters much. By the time I was seated, my senses were very confused. Smelled Mexican, but it looks and sounds like The Jetsons. 

My first step was to order a house marg, which came accompanied by chips. A little late - but pretty good if you ask for the hotter sauce and the verde to go with.   Carnitas seemed easy - they were a good sized portion served with refried beans and rice, a splut of guacamole salad and salsa with no cheese in sight. Carnitas lacked pizazz for the only Mexican restaurant that I'd describe as "Kubrickian."  Beans and rice were passable. 

I asked for extra tortillas and was told they would be extra. Always take points off for that. 

The server was sweet and nice enough and the music choices improved  (kongos!) as time went on. It's not the worst I've had and far from the best. It's a place with a palpable identity crisis and that was foreshadowed by way of the "Help Wanted" sign on the front door.   I've heard they're bouncing back from an unexpected move and expansion, so here's to hoping they find the right combo that works. Right now, there's work to be done.
