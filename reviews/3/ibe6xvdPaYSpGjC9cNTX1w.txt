Went here yesterday for lunch, my steak bowl was made perfectly and all the employees were friendly and helpful until I reached the register. I said hi to the girl and she stared off into space behind me and said "$7.70". I headed her my card and said thank you. She then hands my card back after swiping and I say thank you again..Not a single word came out of her mouth and not once did she make eye contact throughout the transaction. This is definitely not what I've experienced at any chipotle before. I'll probably avoid this location from now on, that girl was depressing.
