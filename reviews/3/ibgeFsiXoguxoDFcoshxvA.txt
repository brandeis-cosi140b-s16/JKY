La Palapa is a small (BYOB, who knew?) Mexican restaurant located in the South Side of Pittsburgh. I was happy to find a Mexican restaurant located near where I was staying in Pittsburgh with such a high rating on Yelp however when I went to La Palapa for dinner on a Thursday night looking to score frozen margaritas and tasty enchiladas, I was surprised at how bland and flavorless the food was.

My boyfriend and I ordered the Platter for 2 for dinner and were disappointed in the lack of flavor and seasoning. The Platter for 2 features 1 Tamal, 1 small Quesadilla, 1 Taquito, 1 Empanada, 2 ribs, 1 Chicken breast with a bowl of white rice and a few slices of avocado. We ordered this platter as a great way to sample just about everything on the menu but we didn't really enjoy anything. 

My boyfriend loves, I mean LOVES Mexican food and all of its glorious spices so he was really disappointed that La Palapa fell flat in all areas of Mexican cuisine. We were also informed that in Pittsburgh it is difficult for smaller establishments to obtain a liquor license.. but what is a Mexican restaurant without Margaritas and Pi√±a Coladas!
