Sadly this Burrito Bandito is gone. I drove by the other day and there is a notice on the door saying they have repossessed the suite and everything inside for non payment. That doesnt sound good to me. Im not sure if the one on 19th ave is the same people but im going there today to check it out. I hope I can still get my tamale's this holiday season I really love those.
