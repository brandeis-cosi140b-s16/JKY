Love this place for food, drinks, atmosphere... but the service needs some major work.

Went for brunch the other day and it was pretty poor service. I should mention the food was FANTASTIC... but we had to ask for everything, like salt, pepper, silverware, cream, sugar... and the waitress seemed to be burdened by the fact that we were asking (and in some cases, needed to ask again). There was a male waiter though who was very pleasant and helpful when he came over. 

I realize this is not a fancy place and is going for more of the hipster vibe (it's obvious)... and I'm not one to hate on hipsters... and that's not the point. Wait staff, no matter the vibe of the place... should be paying closer attention to customers' needs to ensure a pleasant experience, and less on rolling silverware and catching up with one another. 

Also the tall chick tending bar in the front ALWAYS has a nasty attitude when I ask her anything. Generally with any females I've ever been to the bar with, too. Not sure what she's like to guys.... either way, it's really a bad reflection of the place. But I have no complaints about the drinks...

FOOD - order the churros... and the chilaquiles for breakfast are amazingly delicious. the tacos aren't that great, though. the quesadillas are good but nothing to write home about.
