I had a chance to visit on the second night they were open.  During a soft opening there are always a few kinks that need to be worked out.  I like the new decore and think the fajita bar will be a big hit once it's up and running.  The menu offers a nice selection to choose from however the kitchen will need to step it up on ticket times to get food to bar a little quicker. I'd pass on the free chips unless they can explain why they tasted stale on the second day they were open?  The staff was very nervous you could tell but I'm sure they will get the hang of it.  I'll give them a second chance in a few weeks to see if they have it running smooth yet.
