Lets be honest...it's Taco Bell. It is meant to be cheap and yummy.I fed my family of 6 for about twenty bucks. I personally love the Volcano Tacos. I ate them for a month straight when they came out. While I am fifty pounded overweight bIecause of Doritos, I don't really like the Doritos tacos. The order was correct,  we all ate and no one is sick. Not a bad experience.:
