Pros- Great ambiance and decor, love the patio and booths. Pretty good happy hour prices for drinks and appetizers.  I ordered shrimp tacos and they were delicious! 

Cons- Inexperienced servers and bussers, we had a busser approach our table with a gray bucket, he then proceeded to scrape our finished plates across the table dumping them in the bucket. Sort of made me feel like I was in the school cafeteria. Also, rather small portions, if you're a dude you'll probably want to get 2 orders of tacos. 

This place definitely has great potential after they iron out the kinks!
