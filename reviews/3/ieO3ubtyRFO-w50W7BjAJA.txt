Decent knock off of Chipotle. Same set up, basically the same menu, and eerily similar d√©cor. I do like that they have a few outside seating options. Really dislike driving in that part of town though, since it's so congested. But if I'm already over here, I'll keep it in mind for lunch or dinner.

Stopped by prior to a recent training at the GATE center. Opted for the carnitas burrito bowl with brown rice, black beans, extra grilled veggies, light sour cream and guac, pico and corn salsa, cheese, and tons of lettuce. Essentially I wanted more of a salad, really. Portion was huge. Also added on a completely unnecessary, overpriced, and way-too-big side of queso. 

Got my order to go and munched through my meeting. Like, I said, it was a huge portion, and I saved it for a lunch the next day. Not bad for the price, I guess, though it's not exactly inexpensive. Good value, I guess.

Flavors were okay. For so many varied ingredients, I expected it to taste a little better but everything kind of melted together, especially when some of the cheese was added in. I really liked the plentiful grilled veggies, but the bowl was pretty one-note. Maybe an extra side of another salsa would have added some acidity? Or some lime/cilantro? I don't know. Not bad, but not four-stars worthy.

Service was lacking. I walked in and there were three guys in the kitchen portion who just stared at me for a minute. Finally one came around to help me but didn't seem to speak much English. A girl walked up at one point and he simply walked away, leaving her to finish my order. She didn't seem to be too confident in how to work the register, but did ask if I had one of their loyalty cards and explained how they worked.
