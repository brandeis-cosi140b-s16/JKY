I thought the hot sauce was great. But the chips were not warm and sort of stale. I got the # 11. Three rolled tacos rice beens. It was ok. Not very big. Not very tasty.... the hot sauce must be used a lot. I guess I just feel it was too much money. The meal plus small drink was 10.16! Kind of a lot for what really is a lunch sized portion. I was not impressed.
