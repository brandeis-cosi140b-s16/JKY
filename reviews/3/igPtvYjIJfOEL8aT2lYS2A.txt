Seems like a carbon copy of Roberto's or Don Tortaco. Cheap, tasty mexican food. I would give it more stars IF there was ever a clean table in the place. Seems like everytime I go in there is crumbled up taco all over the table or seats. I also wish that their enchilada sauce had a little more pep in its step and the cheese on the inside was actually melted. You can't go wrong with chicken tacos or rolled tacos tho! Summer yummy.
