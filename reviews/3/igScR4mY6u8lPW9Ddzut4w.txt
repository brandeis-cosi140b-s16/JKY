Got the lengua burrito and a horchata. They were a little slow on the service, but granted I came in a large group and they seemed somewhat overwhelmed. The lengua was nice and soft, but I kind of wished it came with beans and rice inside the burrito. The lady also only gave me one container of each salsa (red and green) and wouldn't give me more, which would have been nice to have with the rest of my burrito. Horchata was pretty good though.
