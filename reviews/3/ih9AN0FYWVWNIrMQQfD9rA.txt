Went for lunch last week and was very impressed with the service. We tired the guacamole and it was wonderful, full of tomatoes, onions, cilantro and lime juice. 

I had the tri tip burrito and also tried the green chili pork, while both were good unfortunately the amount of salt was so overpowering I could barely eat them. 

Hopefully that was just an off day because the place itself is great, love the decor and the servers rocked. I will still try it again and hope the salt level lessens. 

The other complaint is the amount of time it took to get our bill, I think we waited about 20 minutes. They need to keep in mind a lot of people in the area are on the lunch hour, so be timely is important!
