Went here on Friday night with my sister and hubby. I would like to give it more stars but as we just sat outside on the deck to people watch and have drinks and free chips and salsa I feel bad giving it more than three stars. 5 stars for great location, in the sun, plentiful outdoor seating for the area, great chips and salsa, food that came to nearby tables looked great and seemed to be finished by other diners, and the drinks were good. I got a Coronagita (SP?? basically a maragarita with a corona tipped over in it) $7. hit the spot. Sister got a couple of margaritas and hubby got a Dos Equis. Would go back for food for sure.
