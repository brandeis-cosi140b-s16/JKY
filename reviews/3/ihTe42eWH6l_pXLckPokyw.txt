Visited here for the first time a few days ago. I've been to Qdoba many times over the years, but had always avoided Chipotle due to the much longer waits.  I generally avoid campus eateries when students are here, but since it was much less crowded on campus a friend of mine and I decided to take advantage.

I wanted to get a chicken burrito (as did my friend), but we were told it would be at least an additional 5 minute wait, so my friend chose steak and I decided to try the carnitas.  I was expecting something very flavorful, but I felt it was rather bland. I chose black beans, medium salsa (wish I had gone with hot now, because medium had no heat or taste at all), and cheese.  Perhaps it would have been better with chicken, but I would have taken a steak queso burrito from Qdoba any day.  I will probably give it another chance if I have the urge to go on campus, but the hype I had heard before going outweighed my actual experience.  Extremely loud, but you kinda expect that on campus.
