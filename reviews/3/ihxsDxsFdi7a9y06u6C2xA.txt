I have been a regular at Cabo Fish Taco for the past 3 years. I've told friends and family about how awesome it is and every one wants to eat there when they come into town to visit. However, my opinion about Cabo has changed in the last 5 months. The food has became greasy and tasteless. My once favorite shrimp tacos are made up of overcooked shrimp and a greasy a tortilla shell. I just wonder if management has changed or what has happened because it's really disheartening to see such a great restaurant go downhill. I continue going back hoping I've just had bad luck but each new visit doesn't leave me feeling more hopeful.
