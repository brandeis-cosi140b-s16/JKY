So I've been to this place many times over the last year, Always for lunch though as the lunch menu includes a drink for only $8.75. I will say that there is only about 8 items on the lunch menu but the Monterey is very good. I get it with the red sauce but normally it is served with their poblano cream sauce. Its good either way but red is my preference. The staff is great and the place is clean. Great place, great people, great lunch!!
