Mango Margarita was on point!!!

Funny because I felt like I got a little more star treatment than my friends. Got the garnishments for my drink... they didn't. Got my food first... they didn't. Got to take the dipping dishes home... they didn't. 

The Yucca fries are good with the homemade ketchup (which I thought was salsa) and some sauce. 

My tacos were decent. I tried some of my friends rice and beans which was pretty good. 

I'll definitely go back and try another set of tacos or perhaps a burrito. 

Definitely getting again:
