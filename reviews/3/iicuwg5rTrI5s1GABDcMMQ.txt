I'll start with the positives (I did give it 3/5 stars, which technically is a passing grade):

The place is clean.  The people seem like hard-working, honest folks, the kind you wish success to.  And the tortillas (used in the street tacos) are very good, possibly even made there.

As for the detriments, basically the food is not all that good.  The chicken chipotle, for example had a very odd taste (and even smell).  It was also dry.  I'm glad I only ordered one of those, I don't think I could've eaten a 2nd one.  The barbacoa simply didn't taste good, and the adobada was so-so.  The green chili tacos were the best ones of the bunch.  I admit that these main reasons are somewhat subjective.

But additionally, while I said the place is clean and the people hard-working, they are also disorganized.  It took an unusually long time for someone to get to the counter after I had gotten my food so that I could pay for it.  They had also "ran out" of aguas frescas, which was very disappointing.  This was at 12:30pm.  And the usual containers for them weren't even out in sight, which leads me to believe, based on the fact that they were running around the whole time, that they simply didn't get to make the aguas that day.  For a while they were also out of napkins.  Napkins!  And when I bought a glass-bottled soda, nobody could find the opener, so one of the guys grabbed his Rambo mini-knife and used it as a lever to open the bottle.  These are the kinds of things I mean by disorganized.

One FYI that has nothing to do with my grade:  if you are used to or looking for Northern Mexico style food, this is not your place.  None of the staples like asada, pastor, cabeza, etc.  And the meats like barbacoa and adobada are completely different than what you may be used to.  If you're very familiar with Mexican cuisine across the board, then you already know about these differences.  But otherwise, FYI.
