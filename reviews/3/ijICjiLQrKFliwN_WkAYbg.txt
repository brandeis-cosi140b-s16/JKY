Right off the bat: the food here is good. My burrito al pastor was a bit skimpy on the al pastor part, but tasted good and was also enormous. They really seem to love chipotle, which can be too smoky for me, but to each their own (or, using my new phrase gleaned from a Pgh cabbie: horses for courses!)

The guacamole is really good and made fresh at your table. You see exactly what goes in to it and can decide how spicy you want. We went whole hog on the chiles and it wasn't all that warm, but it could just have been those peppers.

The horchata is a little sweeter and cinnamon-y-er than I prefer, but again, different strokes.

So, three stars are why? Well, the layout is weirdly very very open. It's not especially inviting to sit down, and service isn't super attentive.

But mostly: what is up with restaurants in Pittsburgh not turning on the heat in winter? Here and at another place I had to wear my knee length puffer coat and my scarves through the entire meal. It's not nice, and I don't like it.
