Nothing wrong with this place at all, service was good and food came up quick.  We had to turn down the volume on the tv with the mexican soaps blaring but all good.

I'd say it's setup and the menu is quite like any of the *bertos around town but I had the #26 Pollo Asada plate... VERY good... typical beans/rice and peppers... came with one big Jalape√±o and then green peppers in with the chicken and a big hot flour torilla.

Nothing special but good food.  Also very clean inside...  And it says they're open 24 hours.... THAT may come in handy some night :)
