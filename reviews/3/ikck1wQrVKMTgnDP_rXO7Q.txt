Ok this is better than taco bell. The burritos are gigantic so you do get a lot for your money...but they are kinda greasy and unhealthy . Some sides cost extra like sour cream, cheese, salsa etc. So the price can go up pretty quickly if you order lots of add ons' so double check what is included on your item first.
 Overall this place is cheap convenient eats.
 I'd go here for convenience, but It isn't my favorite. It does have its good points. I'd give a 3 1/2 if I could. The customer service has been great so far.
