Stopped here with two of my buddies to eat dinner. Before getting ready for a night on the strip. We were pretty hungry. This place is ok. Nothing amazing. Beer and food was all we needed to refuel for a long night. And that we got.

I ordered a chicken chimichanga. Came with beans and rice. The usual stuff. Buddies ordered some beef tacos, and nachos. Had a few rounds of beers. Also they were debuting some new tequila that night. So we got complimentary shots. Free is always good. Prices were ok. A little overpriced but thats expected. The atmosphere is pretty cool. They had a live band playing Spanish music that night. Not too loud, as others have stated. It's not a rowdy get your ass kicked kinda place. At least I didn't feel it was. But id come back if I was craving Mexican food in Vegas.
