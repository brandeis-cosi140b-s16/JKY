Gee, I've found some things I really like here...and Jo really likes the place.  Yesterday I tried their new Taco Melt (make your own tacos based on melted cheese, taco meat, lettuce, tomato, sour cream - with beans and rice on the side) and it was very good, and plenty large.  Jo had the luncheon burrito and said it was very good.  I've had their fish tacos and they were good.

Hey, this isn't true mexican, probably not real tex-mex, but I've never left feeling like I didn't enjoy my food.  And their Gold Rocks margaritas aren't too bad - just a little small!!
