Good place to have a drink while waiting for your flight and I'm sure nothing more. We had the spicy mango margarita and the strawberry margarita with chips and salsa for snacking. The salsa was nothing special but these margaritas are big! I definitely was feeling it after  my one spicy mango margarita.
