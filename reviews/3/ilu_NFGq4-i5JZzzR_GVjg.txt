Everyone RAVES about this place. I finally went, met a friend who told me we should meet up at 11:30 right before it gets packed and so we did. We had a choice of tables and was seated promptly. Water, chips and Salsa were delivered right away. Our server introduced herself and was very attentive. The food is fresh and the tacos are very traditional mexican soft tacos.

We started with an order of Guacamole which I thought was very good, fresh avocado, could of used a little more seasoning, but I ate with the salsa and was good. My friend had ordered the 2 taco (Crispy Fish and Ahi Tuna) and salad (Ensalada Fila) special. She loves this place. I had ordered the 3 tacos (Shrimp, Crispy Fish and Baja Fish) and mine came with a choice of side, so the Black Beans it was. Honestly the food was good service and atmosphere good. I just can't get over the markup in pricing. Its trendy marketing: catchy name, cute place good food, but come on guys its a Taco Joint! With the 3 taco +side, and order of Guacamole and a Corona beer with tip $31.

So with that said and done. I"m glad I tried it myself and I would go back only if I was meeting people and that was the restaurant vote.
