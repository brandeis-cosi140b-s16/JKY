The environment at the Hilldale location is very suburban BigCity -- but I think Hilldale is trying to be the typical suburban BigCity mall these days.  The food seemed to be the same to me. It was quite tasty, but basically the same as Monroe Street.  [[minus the kitchy flowers marking the tables after you order and plus actual servers.]]  If I had a choice, I'd go to the Monroe St location, but this one would definitely do.
