Must say that the entrees are extremely cheap and generous portions.  Expect to pay $6 to $7.  They have a bar available to pick out your sauces and peppers, it's a nice touch.

I ordered the chicken burrito complete meal which includes beans and rice.  It was ok but the biggest minus is that they didn't flavor the chicken meat which is unbelievable!  No wonder they need the sauce bar to give some flavor.
