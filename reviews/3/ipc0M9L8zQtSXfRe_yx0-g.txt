After blowing out a tire on our car nearby, it only seemed logical to grab some burrito's while we waited a few hours for AAA to arrive (..apparently from Tennessee..)

At this TJ Flats, you order your food at the counter and then from there it is full waiter service at your table. After placing your order at the counter, the fun begins....
This place has a hot sauce bar with all different types of sauces, varying in spiciness, and little plastic cups/shot glasses. Naturally, the goal is to take a shot of each sauce prior to your food coming out.  This isn't really pleasant., as you may have guessed...but it is fun and satisfying.

Now that my face and head were sweating, it was time to eat the burritos.  Nothing remarkable here.  Probably my biggest gripe is that the burrito wrap to filling ratio was way off.  The burrito looks massive, but it's primarily for show.  I ended up with a few sq. ft. of wrap left over.

Everyone was really nice and the hot sauce bar was awesome, but the food did not really pan out.  It's worth going if you want to play the hot sauce game, but aside from that, you would most likely leave Chipotle more satisfied.
