Counter service.  You order and the food is delivered to your table.  Each customer gets a paper bowl of tortilla chips.  I don't know if I was lucky or if the chips are always DELICIOUS.  I ordered the veggie burrito and it was just okay.  Nothing special about it and I had to add salt to give it flavor.  In a Mexican restaurant?!?!
