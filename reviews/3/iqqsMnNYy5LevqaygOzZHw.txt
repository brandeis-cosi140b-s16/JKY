Went with some friend after a tough semester for some drinks. Great atmosphere, service was awesome, drinks were reasonable, and the burritos are big enough to feed a small army. I paid $5 per beer (not too shabby) and $10 for the burrito.  I ordered the spicy burrito and that's really all it was...lots of spice and not enough other flavors.  I'd go again for apps and drinks but I would skip the food.  Peace!
