Food was good.  Place was small and it took me a while to figure out that we had to order at the bar.  After paying for our meal, we enjoyed the salsa bar, then out of one of the black t-shirts a roach comes out and was about to get on another woman who was leaning on the wall.  I immediately informed her and they left.  I just sat there and pondered whether or not to eat the rest of my tacos, they were good after all.. I won't be going back.
