Went on a Sunday at noon, waited close to an hour in the Carne Asada line. Got the Carne Asada fries which were bomb but was surprised that the Horchata was not homade. The price is pretty good but honestly not worth the wait in cramped quarters with people yelling and children scrambling around. They really need a better system than having lines out the door. Also customer service sucked and challenging to navigate if you're not a Spanish speaker.
