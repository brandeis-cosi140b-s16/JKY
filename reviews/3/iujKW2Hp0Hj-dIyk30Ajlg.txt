Definitely a good place to go when you have that hankering for late night mexican. In my opinion 1 step above Filibertos and cheap. 

I've had the Super Nachos (4stars), Arizona Burrito (3 1/2 stars) and Carne Asada Burrito (4 stars)

Overall A-Ok place to go when your in the mood for this kind of food
