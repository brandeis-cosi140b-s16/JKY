I have been coming here for years, and I don't plan on ever stopping. This one time photo development booth is now home to the best breakfast burrito around. Has it been shut down due to sanitary issues? Yep. Has it even began to influence whether I'll eat there or not? Nope. Breakfast burritos get five stars, most other food gets four stars, the flies buzzing around and sketchy sanitation get one star.
