I've had different experiences at this Macayo's.  It was hard to give the amount of stars on this one.  

All times I have eaten a meal at Macayo's, the food has arrived in 8 minutes or less of when I ordered-- this is really great for lunch on M-F when I dine here on work days.  I've had a few lunch meetings here and we were able to get seated quickly and hold a conversation at a normal level, so that is good too.  It's not too loud and the restaurant is large enough to find better seating should you not be satisfied. 

My last dinner here was not so good as lunch.  I had the fajitas and they were just off, not right.  Can't pinpoint exactly what was wrong with them but I will probably never order them again.  I'll stick with my taco salad and try not to eat the bowl, Do you know how hard it is to not gobble that greasy taco salad bowl?  It's hard.
