My meal at Macayo's was decent.  I tried the Mex and Match with a shredded beef taco and carnitas enchilada.  It came with beans and rice.  The shredded beef taco was good but nothing to write home about.  A taco of the same quality can be found at any local Mexican joint.  Just throw a rock and you'll find a taco just as good.  The carnitas enchilada was not to my taste.  Macayo's must have a house marinade or seasoning and I didn't care for it.  Not horrible but I would refrain from ordering their carnitas selections in the future.

Staff was friendly and my drinks were refilled without any effort from myself and the atmosphere is good.

It is not, however, a "must go" for Mexican.  You'll find food of the same or better quality elsewhere and for less cost as well.  I would say Macayo's is good for groups or if you have visiting friends and family that are averse to eating at fabled & filthy hole-in-the-wall Mexican joints.
