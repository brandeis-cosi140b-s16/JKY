You call that a California Burrito?  Las Vegans... that's not a Caifornia Burrito.  Don't believe what you hear; a California Burrito does NOT equal salsa, no guacamole, or "healthy."

The perfect California Burrito is debatable.  But mine is a big fat burrito (and you call your burritos burritos?  Those are flautas as far as I'm concerned) with greasy carne asada, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream, and FRENCH FRIES!!!  Oh Roberto's please add the french fries to your California Burritos and give a San Diego-girl a taste of home after she goes grocery shopping at Smith's!

BTW, we got our first taste of good old-fashioned racism when this haolie asked my BF what was better Chow King or Roberto's.  I was sitting down putting our salsa in the bag and I was SOO confused by how the two are even related.  They aren't!  He just asked because we're Asian... and my BF isn't even Filipino!  I busted up laughing but I know he didn't mean anything by it.  Personally, that was the best taco shop story ever.
