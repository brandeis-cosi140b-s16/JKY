I came here wanting to venture out and try a different Mexican restaurant l other than my usual favorites. This place is a little different sense it has a sports bar appeal. After I was sitting I was brought out the usual chips and salsa.  I wasn't impressed with the salsa u thought it was bland and the chips were cold. I ordered the vegetarian combo which included a bean burrito, cheeses quesadilla, and a chalupa. The burrito was bland but the chalupa and quesadilla were my favorite. My server was quick and attentive. I would rank this place as average nothing special.
