Passable.  Good for big groups.  The queso is better than the chips and salsa.  The various menu items *sound* incredible, and what I've had wasn't bad by any means, but not particularly memorable either.  Extremely convenient if you're staying at the hotel next door though, definitely worth it in that case.
