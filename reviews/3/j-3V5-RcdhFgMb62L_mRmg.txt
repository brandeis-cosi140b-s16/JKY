I'm a little surprised by some of the reviews.  New menu, perhaps new staff - give them the benefit of the doubt and some time to work out the bugs.  Our experience last week was great.  Very good attentive service, food - not "fantastic" but solid.  All of us at the table were pleased and we'll go back.  Cave Creek yearns for some dining options.  Support your local businesses!
