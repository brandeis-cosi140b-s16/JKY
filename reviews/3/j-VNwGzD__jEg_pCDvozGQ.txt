This place seems somewhat hidden behind McChevron. Walking in we were greeted and given a chance to glance over the menu. The food is made fresh to order and they have a free salsa and veggie bar. Priced just under $3, I ordered a "Cheese Quesdalilla" and a "Fried Beef Taco" for around $2. Can't say I was a fan of the quesadilla. The tortilla tasted store bought and the cheese was lacking and had a somewhat pasty texture. The fried beef taco wasn't bad actually, but the chicken taco at Roberto's, grease and all, is by far better and larger in size. They have plenty of tables inside and you can call your order ahead of time too. The employees were very nice and inside was clean, but with other nearby options for lunch that I have enjoyed more and this place tasting average or just under, I can't see coming back.
