Kinda of disappointing.    I'm a huge fan of Mexican food so we stopped in for a bite.  The decor is cute and definitely a real Mexico feel.  I was mostly disappointed in the value of the food.  I wasn't very hungry so we ordered the nachos poblanos.  The flavor was good but I've never in my life ordered nachos and had 4 nachos.  Yes 4 nacho chips with all the fixings.  Needs less to say I won't be returning.  Kinda sad when we are locals and used to good deals and good food.
