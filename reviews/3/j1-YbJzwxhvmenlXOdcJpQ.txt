So overall I am a big fan of Chipotle. I usually go here for a quick bite or after the bars (if open) but this Chipotle didn't quite hit the mark for me. I am very simple in what I order- cheese quesadilla with a side of sour cream and guacamole. Not hard to make. So at this location, there was almost no one there so when we got to the counter, the person that was standing there walked away, turned her back and started talking to someone by the back grill about when she was going to get to take her break. So a different guy had to come up and help us. He was very nice and pleasant. We ordered and my quesadilla went on the warmer to melt the cheese. We moved down to the cashier and right in front of her, I asked for my sides. I had to ask 3 times because the guy that helped us went somewhere else and the other girl was still talking about her break. I also had to remind her about my quesadilla right next to her. She went to get my sides and the cashier looked at me after we paid and made a snide comment about how I should have told her so she could have charged us for those sides when in fact I was standing right in front of her when I asked. And the worst part of the whole experience was the quesadilla. The cheese was only partially melted. And if you have ever had heated but not melted cheese, you know it gets greasy so it look 4 napkins to soak up that grease. On the plus side, my boyfriend got a chicken bowl and really liked it. 

Maybe they were having a bad day at this location, I'm not sure. I personally don't think this location is indicative of what a Chipotle normally is like.
