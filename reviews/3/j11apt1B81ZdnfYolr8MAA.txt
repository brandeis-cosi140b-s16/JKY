I had heard this was operated by the same peeps that rock Delux and Zen 32, so I had to give it a try.  Living in Arizona, there is ALWAYS room for another fantastic burrito and restaurant to serve it, but sadly, I'm not sure this is it...

I took a lady friend with picky eating habits (the ultimate test) for a dinner on our way out for the evening.  She stayed true to the New Years mantra of eating healthy and got the Chicken Fajita Bowl with the brown rice.  I am sad to say I didn't order it.  It looked and tasted great.   I had the black bean burrito.  I love black beans, and while the beans were plentiful, the burrito was missing something.  It was bland, and the white rice mixture that came with the combo was actually kind of nasty.  Not sure what kind of milk like product is in there, but it upset my stomach.  I will say their tortillas were amazing.  Not quite Carolina's good, but the best one can do without using lard!

Beyond the food, the service was a bit slow and unorganized.  They had more people working (and looking around not knowing where they needed to be) than eating.  The decor is cool, and the environment, minus the shakira playing over the radio, is quaint, but I thought the overall experience was disappointing.
