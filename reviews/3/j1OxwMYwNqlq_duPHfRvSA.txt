This was just ok, BUT I did just have a breakfast burrito,  hard to judge a place on that. Average price.  They threw a few tortilla chips in probably as decoration as they were literally just a few, and a little stale.  The house made red salsa was good I'll give them that. I'd be interested in trying something else but only of I'm around,  today I'm here while I wait for my oil change next door.
