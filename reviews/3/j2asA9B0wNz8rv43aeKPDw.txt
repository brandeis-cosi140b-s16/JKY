I like Dos Reales.  As a vegan they have a few options, and this has gotten better since they added black beans.  My only complaint is that they are inconsistent.  I usually get the veggie burrito with black beans and no cheese.  Sometimes the mushrooms have this wonderful flavoring.  Other times they are flavorless.  The difference between the two is a good burrito or a mediocre one.  They offer great free chips/salsa.  They are *very* fast, especially at lunch.  Although they can be backed up then too.
