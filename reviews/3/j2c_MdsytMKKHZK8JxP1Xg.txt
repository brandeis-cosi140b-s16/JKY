My salad was very tasty. My husbands tacos were good but had very few veggies on it, mostly meat, which isn't what we prefer in a taco. Service was so-so. 
The biggest complaint was the music was so loud we couldn't hear each other at all. And one of the waitress smelled heavily of alcohol. I MIGHT come back but my husband definitely would not.
