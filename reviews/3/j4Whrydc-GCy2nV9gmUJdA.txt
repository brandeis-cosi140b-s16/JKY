I have been to many Wahoos in Cali, Hawaii and here in Vegas.  I went tonight because it is right down the street from my house, and the food was great as always.  I sat in the bar because, I often am by myself.  I am a horrible looking person and no one ever wants to eat with me and my wife travels for work.  LOL.  The experience was completely ruined by the people who smoke in the bar area while people are eating, and they go unchallenged.  There were two guys next to me playing Golden Tee and every time they wanted a smoke they had the decency to step outside.  Someone take a stand at this place and tell people that you can't smoke.  THEY WILL GET OVER IT, TRUST ME.  I waited so long for you to open.  California is a big place and people just go outside, they got use to it.  Make a cool little place out back where they can go in the alley and smoke.  They can watch the kids skateboard in the drain ditch.  Why let them ruin the experience for the rest of us.  I will come back at some point soon, but if there are smokers in the bar.  I am done.  back to Faustos.
