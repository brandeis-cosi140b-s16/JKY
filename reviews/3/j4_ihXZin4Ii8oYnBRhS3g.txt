I like to goto this place for the tacos to go. They have a special 4 tacos for $2.75 and I have been getting them here on and off for years. Tacos are on the level of Taco Bell but the salsa is alot better and for $2.75 it's a nice snack where I'm in the mood for it. These days I don't live close to Panchos anymore so I very rarely go but yesterday I was nearby and in the mood. Still the same..
