Pretty good stuff. I'm fairly particular about Mexican food, having been surrounded by the most amazing Tex-Mex for the first twenty years of my life, so I can't say it's anything spectacular.

From the vegetarian point of view, it's pretty disappointing. There are a few veggie dishes, but my date wanted a veggie chimichanga, which wasn't available. We ordered the chili con queso, cheese enchilada, spinach enchilada and veggie fajitas.

The salsa and con queso were okay, the cheese enchilada was pretty good, but the spinach enchilada was way too rich. I could barely eat one bite! The veggie fajitas were very good, though, and made the experience worthwhile. The rice and refried beans were both on the dry side, which I didn't care for.

Still hunting for a great Mexican food place.
