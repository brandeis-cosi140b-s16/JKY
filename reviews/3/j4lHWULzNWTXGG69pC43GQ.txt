Dos has become the regular hangout for our group on Monday nights, for a few simple reasons:

1. $2 beers after 10pm
2. $4 meals/apps after 10pm
3. Atmosphere and service.

Dos Gringos is not the type of bar one would frequent because it's high class or offers a bevy of unique mixed drinks or beers on tap.  At its heart, it is a dive bar that excels at being kitschy and serving super cold bottled brews.  Its location takes advantage of Arizona's stellar weather, as it is an outdoor bar.  We've never gone during the day, but even during the warm summer evenings, the fans do their job at keeping everyone cool.  

The servers here are always friendly, checking in frequently and serving up food and drinks quickly.  Our group tends to trickle in, and I'm always impressed at how easily the servers manage to keep everyone's tab separate without us requesting it, or needing to dissect what each person at the table ordered.

The reason for the three star rating lies primarily in selection.  For those looking for tequila or Mexican beers, Dos Gringos provides a great selection.  For those looking for something else, it may be a bit harder to select something from their drink menu.  This isn't inherently a bad thing; if I wanted a particular type of beer, I'd go to a different bar.  The music leaves a lot to be desired, though it is the standard bar mix of current popular songs (though they earn a point for not having played "Party in the USA" like every other bar I've been to over the last 2 months).

For Monday nights, Dos Gringos is the perfect scene for an ice cold Fat Tire and some nachos.
