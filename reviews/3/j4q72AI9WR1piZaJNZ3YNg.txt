Had some time to kill at the airport so I decided to come here for some Mexican food! 

-Their signature burrito was about $8...
-I had their rice bowl for $7 (spanish rice, steak, chili, and veggies) I was expecting some huge bowl full of the ingredients mentioned, but the bowl was so dinky I finished it in less than five minutes! I mean it was really good and all, but the size and portion was not worth that!
-Fiji water was 5$!!!!!

I'm not really a big fan of fast food (burger king, McDonald's, etc...)when I'm on vacation so I like to try places like this one! Lesson learned though, eat before heading to the airport!!!
