Two and a half stars. 

To begin, I know it's their 'signature dish,' but the name Pink Taco compels me to believe that Harry Morton is a total doucheburger. 

Aside from that, the fact that he called it the "Best Mexican Food in the Metropolitan Area" is absolutely appalling. Has he ever left that block and a half radius of Old Town Scottsdale besides to board a plane to LA? Doubtful. 

The food is average. I appreciate that some of it is actually somewhat creative, with a good use of sauces and colorful presentation. 

But, best Mexican in the metro area? Please.
