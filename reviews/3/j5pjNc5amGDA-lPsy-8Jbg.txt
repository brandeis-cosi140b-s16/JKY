Went with a friend. I had a margarita, queso dip, shrimp and barbacoa tacos. Full serving size. I would say both were good but nothing amazing for the price. The queso dip was great and the margarita was just the way I like it STRONG! I would go back but to try something else on the menu. I see a lot of complaints about the service. I will say out waitress was fine. Checked on us and refilled are water when needed. I'm only giving this a 3 out of 5 for the tacos. I will go back and try something and then I hope to add another star.
