Typical QDoba food in the Madison suburbs.

Went for a late lunch around 1pm on a Monday and definitely avoided the lunch rush.

Grabbed a veggie burrito bowl and added the ancho chile BBQ sauce. Dang! That sauce is good. I swear it would taste good on anything.

Service was quick and mostly helpful. The guy that put the BBQ sauce on didn't seem to know what I was talking about (hard to believe when it's listed on the menu, right?), but otherwise my order went off without a hitch.

Plenty of spots to sit and overall, a clean dining room.

I noticed they have an outdoor seating area that I can't wait to try this summer!
