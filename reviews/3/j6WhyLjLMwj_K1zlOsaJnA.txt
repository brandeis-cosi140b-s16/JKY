I finally stopped by this place after driving past in numerous times. I ordered a steak   burrito. It cost about $6.00. It wasn't to bad, I feel like though it needed some salt. I don't know if they forgot to put it on but it was kind of plain. Had it had a more flavor I would of given it 4 stars. I will try it again though as the prices are pretty fair.
