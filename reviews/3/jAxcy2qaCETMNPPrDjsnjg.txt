Went there last night (Friday) for the first time around 8:30, so a little later.  Pretty quiet in there for a what should be one of the busier nights for a restaurant.  The food itself was solid (tacos de carne asada).  Good flavor on the steak.  The plate was overwhelmed with the side items (refried and rice) and the three tacos were set off to the side instead of featured.  
My wife commented that her peach margarita was excellent.  On the other hand, she asked for water when she ordered the margarita and it never came, even as a manager asked us if there was anything else they could get for us.  
Their patio area is a nice place to sit out on a Carolina evening.
