Eva's seems to be the place we go to every time we visit family in Casa Grande now.  It is a pretty consistent experience, and that's good enough for us when we're out of town.

The food is pretty good.  Their sauces are on the spicy side, but that's ok with us.  They're still packed with flavor, and they compliment the meals.  The carne asada burrito (enchilada style) is a large portion.  Again, the sauce elevates it to being a little bit better than average tasting.  The  cheese enchiladas with their white jalape√±o sauce were a little bit small, but very good.  The rice that the combinations get served with is just so-so.  Their chips are fine, the salsa is a little bit weak.  The food quality is average overall.

The service has never been that good.  They're not particularly attentive or personable.  I felt like we were a little bit of a hassle at times.  The last waiter we had advised us to go with a combo plate because it would be cheaper, when it turns out, if you do the math yourself, it was about $3 more expensive.  The manager's solution was to take $1 off the bill, and then comp our sodas.  Hmm, ok.  A warning then to you all out there that are watching your cost.  Add your a la carte items up yourself and don't get pressured into the combo, especially if you don't want rice and/or beans anyway.

The menu is also slightly confusing.  The prices are average.  The decor is nice.  The restaurant looks like it can serve large groups and parties very well.  Overall, Eva's seems to be a safe place to enjoy a meal, and we'll go there next time we head up that way.
