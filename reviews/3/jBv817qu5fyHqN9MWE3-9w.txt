Lots of continental and nouveau options on the menu, but we went for a more American-style mozzarella, sausage, mushroom, black olive and spinach. It did not rock our world we are disappointed to say. The crust was soggy and lifeless after 10 minutes in the box.  The sauce was thick, but the spices were by no means a secret recipe.  The whole milk mozzarella and the local sausage were not distinctive.
On the isthmus with a well-staffed kitchen, trendy menu and decor (which you'll pay a little extra for).
