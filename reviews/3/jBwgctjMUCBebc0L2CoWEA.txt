Used to visit their sister location up in North Las Vegas on Cheyenne and loved it, so we decided to try this location at Eastern & Trop. This location is a lot bigger. The smells of the carne cooking over the grill are very enticing. Their carne asada tacos and carne burritos are about as good as they come here in LV. The enchiladas have a very tasty homemade red sauce and were devoured quickly. Taquitos were rolled when we ordered and were fresh, and very delicious. The place was packed (not surprising for a Sunday afternoon) with large families eating everything from tacos to menudo and pesole. Definitely a fan of both locations.
