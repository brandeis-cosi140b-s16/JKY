There's a few Cuzamils in every city - simple restaurants with very predictable Mexican food.  There's nothing wrong with that, but there's nothing particularly exciting about it either.

We were trying to go to Sababa, but it was closed for Passover, so we ducked in to Cuzamil instead.  The interior is very simple - some decorative items and a TV.  I didn't see any booths, only tables.  Our server was really friendly and generally cheerful, so that was a big place.

She recommended the Poblanos Chiles Rellenos, which I tried.  They were pretty much what I expected - served very hot, with gooey cheese.  The chicken was surprisingly good and pretty tender.  The rice and beans on the side were hot.  Our server got us some hot sauce which was much needed, as the dishes themselves didn't seem to have too much spice.  My boyfriend got the chimichanga, which he enjoyed.  The food was heavy, saucy, and cheesy - just what you expect from most Mexican-American restaurants.  Prices were a bit higher than I'd hoped - the food is fine, but also uninspired and leaves a brick feeling in your tummy.

Chips and salsa were pretty plain too - the salsa was sort of saucy, lacking the tasty tomato and pepper chunks that normally give it texture.  Margaritas tasted okay but were very weak - I didn't even feel a buzz, which was a bummer!

I'll give it three stars since the server was so nice, and there was nothing wrong with the food, it was pretty much average across the board.  It's a good place to have in the neighborhood if you get a Mexican craving.  Still, it's places like this that make me long for the taquerias and fresh, authentic Mexican food you can find in Chicago.
