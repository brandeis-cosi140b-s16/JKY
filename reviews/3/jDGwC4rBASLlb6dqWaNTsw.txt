I have to agree with previous reviewers. While the food itself was alright the tacos I ordered fell apart too easily. The quality of the meat and condiments were ok but certain members of the staff could have been more friendly regarding the location of utensils. Also my table was uncleared as evident by left over food and sauce stains! Overall the food was cheap for the airport but I was disappointed with the eating experience and quality of service.
