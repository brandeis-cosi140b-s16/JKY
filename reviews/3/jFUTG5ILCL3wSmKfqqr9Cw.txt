Came in with a larger group on a Sunday afternoon, and we were seated quickly in the back area and received pretty good service.  The chips and salsa were flowing and they had well priced lunch specials, which I ordered one to go for the misses!

Located towards the back part of the Ayrsley commercial area across from the movie theaters, so I can see why it's hard to drum up business from S. Tryon traffic, which is why I've never heard of the place before.  I would recommend for an affordable lunch if you're in the area.  The only problem is the food is typical and not the atmosphere of a similarly priced Azteca which gets kudos to the bustling atmosphere inside.
