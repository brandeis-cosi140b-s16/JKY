Last night we went to Rosa's due to the fact that we were near Mesa and to my surprise it was semi disappointing. We thought since it's a "hole in the wall" Mexican restaurant, it would be delicious, but the food was just sub-par.
I ordered the two seafood tacos (shrimp and cod) with a generous side of black beans and Spanish rice. All in all, it satisfied my hunger, but it was much too sweet and kind of bland, due to a lack of salt. The food was also cold by the time it got to us. The best part was the chips and salsa and the black beans. 


We may come back, but so far it wasn't all that impressive.
