In a city without a chipotle or a decent local burrito joint, Moes would reign supreme. Unfortunately this Moes just isn't up to par.

I've been here 3 times and each time it's just been underwhelming. My burritos are always devoid of a decent amount of meat or even beans (I've seen them remove pieces of meat that they've added since it was evidently "too much")

The chips here just seem off compared to other Moes in the area. Some are soft and chewy as if they fished them out before they were ready.

Maybe it's because I come after a lunch crowd, but the salsa bar is always empty in some containers.

In a city full of amazing local joints, you'd think the chain places would try to keep up, but this place just seems content in going through the motions.
