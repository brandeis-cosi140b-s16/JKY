Large, inexpensive portions of tasty Mexican food? Sign me up!

Unfortunately I don't have that much to say about this place because it is what it is; solid Mexican food that really hits the spot once in a while. My only issue was their dessert. The fried ice cream was amazing except for the fact that it was covered in clearly frozen strawberries which ruined everything. Oh well, still solid!
