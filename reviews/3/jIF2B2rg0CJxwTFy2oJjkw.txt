This place is pretty good. It's a small little restaurant that has room for some inside seating but not a lot. The staff is really friendly and talkative. I don't recommend the tacos al pastor, the meat is soggy  and a little on the greasy side which I've never seen before. The carne asada tacos are really good though.
