Let me just say that the food at this place was really great as well as the atmosphere. Our server was one of the worst I've ever had. I asked her if the restaurant did anything special for birthdays and she answered was an incredibly snotty "No, not at all". When we had questions about the menu her replies were short and condescending. Nothing was particularly slow but the real kicker was that when she gave us our bill, she requested that we initial next to each menu item because she was apparently completely incapable of keeping track of what we had ordered. We marked our receipt as she requested, but when she returned to our table we had apparently "really screwed up" by doing her job for her. SHE MADE US REDO IT and then stood impatiently at the table while we finished. We commented that it was ridiculous and she started trying to make excuses. She couldn't even finish her sentence. This woman has no business working in the restaurant industry if she is this disrespectful to customers.
