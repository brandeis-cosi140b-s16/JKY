Like others have said, its just like Chipotle.  Jack In The Box's version of Chipotle (which used to be a McDonalds company).  Someone could give me a chicken burrito made the same way at both, and I probably would not know the difference.  Chipotle's chicken has a little bit more spice, but other than that I can't see much of a difference.

They do have slightly more variety than Chipotle does in terms of the entree's you can get.  I see no point to drive out of my way to go to a Qdoba, when there are like 5 times as many Chipotle's around.
