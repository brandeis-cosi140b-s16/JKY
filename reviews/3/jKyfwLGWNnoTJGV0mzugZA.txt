All day happy hour on Sunday? We decided to try it out. 

The chips served with 6 different salsas: impressive. And free. And re-fill on the salsas. We were happy.

I got the taco trip: chicken, shrimp, steak. They were smaller than i expected but good. The shrimp taco was the best in flavor. I wished I had gotten three of those instead of mixing it up. 

The nachos were okay, but the sight of melted cheese and sour cream atop soggy chips was unappetizing after a few minutes. 

The margarita (frozen for $2.50) was pretty good actually. Tasty, strong enough and great price. 

My daughter ordered the cheeseburger with fries and liked it. So that was a plus. 

We will come back for happy hour to try the avocado egg rolls and a few margaritas.
