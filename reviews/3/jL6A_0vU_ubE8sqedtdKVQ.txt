Ok just stopped in for some greasy authentic Mexican food... I got what I wanted. From the outside it looks like and old sonic or a and w. Parking lot is set up a little weird but good use of space. Inside the dinning area is small 6 tables. Very colorful. Menu on the wall has many was to use meat and tortillas in the same dish. Tacos, burritos, chimichanga's and so on. Beans and rice are average. Chips are soaked in hot grease but taste old. They masked the old taste with tomatoes and onions. The green salsa is very mild but has a good flavor. Red salsa has a slight more heat still mild. (Gringo Style) the chicken is spiced with peppers. So so as far as chicken goes. I would have giving 4 stars if the chips were free for dine in. Over all just a regular Mexican restaurant just like any of the "berto's" throughout the valley.
