The food was good and tasty.  We both had chicken taco salads.  The salads were pretty massive with all the fixing.  I wouldn't recommend the ranch it taste like hidden valley which means its not homemade.  There was a ton of meat in my salad which i liked because it filled me up.  The chips and salsa were fresh.  The salsa was tasty.  

I give it a three star based on value and atmosphere.  While it is a bar and grill from the outside it looks trendy and cool.  On this inside however its mostly just a bar.  The food and drinks were pretty pricey also.  They overcharge for drinks like most places do which if they would put them at a decent price this place would be a great mexican place on the westside.  

Overall I would probably give it another chance but we will see.
