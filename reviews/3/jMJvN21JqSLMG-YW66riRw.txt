I stopped in today because I was tired of the hospital food across the way and had been eyeing up their food on here.  It's a very intimate place without any hint of intimacy.   Saying it is tiny and lacks atmosphere is a more accurate representation.   I got my food to go so maybe the real flair is in the presentation of the meals.  I ordered the fish tacos, the carne asada fries and an order of churros for a total of 23.00 and change.  The carne asada fries looked great with the exception of the guacamole.   I'm not a huge fan of guacamole but at times I'll try it when it looks fresh and chunky.  This stuff was thin and watery which made it very tough to remove from the meal.  The remainder was good but nothing spectacular.  The fish tacos got mixed reviews but I found them to be better than expected.  I would certainly have them again.  The refried beans and rice that came with them were also very good.  The highlight of the meal was the churros.   It's just a shame that an order is only 3 pieces because I would of bought a second order if I had known.  Don't judge me for that.  I'm sure this place has a few highlight dishes and if it was closer to my home I'd be tempted to try a few more items and see what gems they have to offer.
