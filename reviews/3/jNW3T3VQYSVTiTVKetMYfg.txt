I recently was in Las Vegas for a convention in the MGM's Convention Center.  I was amazed...We checked in Sunday night and although we worked, ate, drank, gambled, drank more, etc...we did not leave the MGM until Thursday night...WTH!?

My buddy and I tried to hit up the Happy Hour at Seablue, but a lack of seating at the bar mixed with a pair of empty stomachs just wasn't workin' out there...I swore I wasn't going to go there, but it was a peak dining hour and we weren't going to eat unless...dammit, here goes...

A step away from the bouginess of the MGM...there rests Diego.  Casual dining, this is not Nobhill, nor L'atelier...you will not be eating a 16-course tasting menu, or enjoying a lobster pot pie, lobster corndogs, etc....No, this is Diego!

Have you ever thought about what it would be like if a Kenyan vegetarian reworked the menu at El Torito?  No?, well think about it...It would still be food, but it wouldn't really be Mexican, would it?  Well, that's how I feel about Diego...it's food, but it's not really Mexican at all...

You know that salad that you get on the side of your plate at most white-washed Mexican places?  Usually crappy iceberg lettuce and some carrot shavings, I tend eat around it...I order some Chicken Enchiladas thinking it's gotta be the least disappointing thing on the menu.  Ugh, my food is buried under this lettuce...WTH!!?  Scrape the lettuce away and you see what it was hiding, BLAH!!

Service was good...come enjoy the beer and the chips & salsa...Come because the wait is too long everywhere else, come because you're starving, but not because you're hoping to try the MGM's unique twist on Mexican food...it is what it is...
