Carolina's is usually great and cheap Mexican fare.  If you choose to have a 'cheat day' off of your normally healthy diet, this is a good choice.  The flour tortilla's are infamous, as well as the green chile (w/ pork).  The bean and potato burrito is good too.   

Last week, a friend and I had an usually, poor meal (very cold dishes)...but I can't help but believe it was a very rare occurance...will give it another shot and assume it's not a trend.
