We were greeted warmly upon entering, good start.  Seated, then waited about 20 minutes until someone asked if we'd seen a waiter, thumbs down on that one.  I ordered a house Margarita on the rocks which tasted mostly of Margarita mix (no hint of alcohol) and was about 90% ice.  Won't do that again.  We shared the Family Style for Two chicken enchiladas, which came with a variety of sauces for our pleasure, all this was quite good.  Then my wife found a small bone in her chicken, not good.  And the menu has very little to choose from, something rare to see these days.  
     So we'd go back again (if we had a coupon) only because there were some enjoyable parts to the visit, but too many negatives for us to make it a regular haunt.
