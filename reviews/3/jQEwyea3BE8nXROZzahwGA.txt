Great place but the employee tonight in the red crescent ballroom shirt is completely rude and was out of line. Doors opened at 7 for the get up kids, it was 7:10 so we walked in (with wristbands on) once inside we asked him if it's open yet l, his response was "sure I guess signs don't mean anything anymore do they?" In an extremely rude and condescending tone. If we didn't want to see the band so bad we would have left right then and there.
