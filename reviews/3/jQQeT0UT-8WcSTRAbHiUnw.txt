OK Mex.

Went here on a early Sat evening for dinner. We sat outside on the patio which was nice.

I had the two Amigos with grilled shrimp and chicken in a sauce of sour cream and
melted monterray jack cheese.

It comes with refrios and lettuce with a choice of flour or corn tortillas.
The taste was somewhat bland.

Their salsa was very heavy on onions which I didn't care for.
