Read some reviews before coming here so I knew it would be hit or miss. The experience wasn't amazing but I wasn't disappointed.

My meal consisted of a bean tostada, cheese enchilada, and a beef taco. I don't remember what the the combo was called but I was having a hard time making up my mind and figured some variety would be nice. The taco was good, the beef was shredded and a had a lot of black pepper. The cheese enchilada was good but I prefer my enchiladas real saucy. I didn't finish the tostada because I didn't really like the shell.

The kids got chicken fingers with fries and said the fries were no good. I think there were only three little chicken fingers in the meal.

The best part of the meal was the waitress. She let us know about a promotion that is going on where you go online, get the phrase of the day, say it and you get a free food item. The day we went it was flautas and we each got a free one. We ordered two beef and one chicken. They were good. The food item changes daily.

I may or may not be back. With all of the Mexican food choices around here I will probably choose an establishment that I haven't yet tried.
