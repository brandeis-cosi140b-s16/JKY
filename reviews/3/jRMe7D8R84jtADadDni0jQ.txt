3.5 stars.... maybe 4

Forget about any of the other fast food Mexican food joints.  The "Ricos", "Bertos"...  Taco Bell... etc. 

This place produces really good fast food/ Mexican food. The beans are great!  The rice isn't bad and the burritos are huge!  

We've eaten there twice and the first time around everything was a hit. No issues with the food or the service.  The second time around... the food was still pretty good. The grilled chicken nachos were pretty greasy. the chicken... although flavorful was fatty and this set the tone for the rest of the meal.  Wasn't horrible.. just could have been better. 

 Do drop in and give this place a try. It isn't expensive... and you better bring an appetite....as mentioned... the portions are huge. 

We will go back.
