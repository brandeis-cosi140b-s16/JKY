I visited El Pastor a few nights ago and was a bit disappointed.  I had bookmarked it based on a few reviews and finally found the time to go for dinner.  I ordered the chicken fajitas which are usually a hit in most places.  I don't know what it was but I didn't really enjoy it.  I think maybe it was because there wasn't really a Mexican flavor, who knows.  Either way, the fajitas were def not a hit.

I will be back to this place though.  They have a large menu and it's possible that I ordered the one bad thing on the menu.  Also, they have a bar; one that is separate from the actual restaurant.  I can't discount this place until I've truly experienced their bar.  Only a monster would do that and I'm no monster!

I would give this place 2.5 stars for now but look forward to updating my review after another visit.
