Wow, you'd never know this was the old Zink location. Talk about a complete renovation and makeover! 

It's a lively spot. Be in the mood for lots of noise and bright colors when you come dine at Chuy's. 

Having lived in the great State of Texas, I was eager to get a little taste of my previous life. However, maybe I've acclimated to the Carolinas more than I thought because I wasn't completely knocked off my boots, er, um, feet from this place. The salsa seemed to be made with fresh ingredients, but maybe not the most tasteful. I ordered the veggie enchiladas and they were good, but not to die for. 

I think I went on the second day they were open. Some of my friends say I'm brave. Hey, I like to live on the edge...having said that I was very impressed with the service. Our server was very friendly, checked on us regularly, and it was seamless for being brand new.

For a late night meal in the South Park area, this fits the bill. 

I've been known to have high expectations and the night I was there was no different. You are always harder on your own, right? And I still claim Texas as part of me...so like any good "family member," I'll have to give it another go to see if it can earn any additional stars in my book. For now, it's a solid 3 stars with plans on returning.
