Hey, you know....It's fast food.  I don't expect a 5 star joint when I go to these places.   This place happens to be cheap, fast (usually), and better than average fast food eats.  

I've sometimes been a little impressed, sometimes a little let down but this place is overall worth coming back to and while not as good as some, its decent food, quick and on the cheap (and I think better than that other national chain).
