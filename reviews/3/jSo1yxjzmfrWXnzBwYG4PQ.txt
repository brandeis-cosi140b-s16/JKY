I am quite snarky when it comes to considering Mexican food outside of my home state of Texas.  My coworker is obsessed with Macayo's, mainly because she is a Vegas native and grew up eating here.  She is really fond of it.  The restaurant itself is very large, and boasts a UNLV discount but it does not apply to any of the specials and we only go at lunch so I am not sure if it really works.

It is located right next to Metro Pizza off Tropicana just east of Maryland so it is easy to get to from campus.  All celebrations surrounding her happen here, so I have eaten here more than I expected to ever.  There are plenty of reasonably priced, filling lunch specials - a whole large menu page of them - but I always stick with the combinations.  There is a choice of one or two items for $8.59 or $9.59 and it comes with rice and beans or double of whatever one (I get double rice), plus a small shredded lettuce and diced tomato garnish.  The choices include chile rellenos, enchiladas, tamales, tacos, and probably a few other options.  

I typically stick with the chicken enchilada and the green corn tamale covered in spicy tomatillo sauce which is quite wonderful.  These items are covered in cheese so if you are not big on cheese, let them know.  I am never wowed by the meal but it is a good average Mexican meal if you are craving one.  I can justify anything covered in green sauce and I can assure you can find something on the menu to satisfy you here.  Service is hit or miss.  Today lunch was smooth and very fast.  Complimentary chips and 2 salsas are included.  Remember, guac makes everything better but costs extra!
