I'm thankful for El Bravo being in the Airport. It's probably the only place in Terminal 4 serving food that didn't come in a box marked "Sysco".  

El Bravo serves up a number of different authentic-style mexican dishes, but sticking to my successful action of not eating meat from a place I'm not familiar with, I chose the Bean and Cheese, adding rice for a complete protein*. 

The food tasted home-made and the ladies making it are the real deal. It didn't taste like they used any processed ingredients and it filled me up pretty well.

Only problem I had is that they didn't offer any commercial hot sauce, like Tapatio or Cholula. The food I had was very bland and could really have used a few ounces of help.



*Rice and Beans, the complete protein: Rice is rich in starch, an excellent source of energy. Rice also has iron, vitamin B and protein. Beans also contain a good amount of iron and an even greater amount of protein than rice. Most significantly, the consumption of the two in tandem provides all the essential amino acids.
