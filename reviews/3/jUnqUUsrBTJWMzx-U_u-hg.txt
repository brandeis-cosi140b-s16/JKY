I love Del Taco...with all my heart...but this location seems so "ghetto" compared to other locations I've been to. People wearing sloppy t-shirts and not proper uniforms. Workers acting like total slackers when you order and when you get to the pick-up window. Talking like thugs to customers (yes, I heard one worker talking that way to a customer at the counter the first time I went there, while waiting at the pick-up window to receive my food)

Asking for my food to be placed in a plastic bag with carry handles seems like such a hassle from the looks on their faces when I ask nicely. Then they've tried to give me cookies in small bags and NOT put in the bag with the rest of my food. What's up with that? Not acceptable, that's what's up!

I really hope they improve their work ethics and customer skills because I really like Del Taco's food and want to keep returning. It's either that or I wish they would build/open one up closer to my place (I have to drive over to Chandler and I live in Tempe).
