Ok, so how do I start. Well, we walked in and were greeted enthusiastically. It was a really warm welcome, and we were happy to be there. 

I'm not sure what happened, but we did not get what we ordered. Yes, we should have verified our order with our receipt, but we have ordered the same thing many times. We wanted the battered fish tacos, but got the grilled instead. They were good, but not what we were looking forward to today. 

I love their salsa bar with the variety of salsas, Pico and limes. We got a healthy serving of tortilla chips. Unfortunately, I think that we got the leftovers from the previous day since we arrived shortly after they opened. They were stale. Blah. 

The set up here was odd. There was the main dining area, and then a whole other side with a soda machine and condiment area. Except, there were no condiments, and I'm not sure the soda machine worked over there. The ceiling fans were on high, and were blowing our napkins around. The music came on a few minutes after we arrived, and was way too loud. 

I believe our cashier was named Gregorio, and he was the highlight of our experience. Extremely nice and enthusiastic. Other than that, this is my least favorite Baja Fresh to date.
