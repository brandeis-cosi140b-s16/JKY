Tried this place for the very first time yesterday. Not bad for a drive-thru Mexican food place. I will give them time though before I try it again. Why? Because I know they just recently opened at this location and the food was okay but not super spectacular.. Like every place, they need time to "get the bugs out", so to speak.

I will say this about their customer service: top notch! Very friendly people and you can clearly hear them over their loudspeaker, not like at their competitor's place, where you have to scream to be heard and also make them repeat themselves over and over.
