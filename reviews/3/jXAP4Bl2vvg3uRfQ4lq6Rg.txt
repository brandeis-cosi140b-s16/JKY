Its a cute bar. Its was super busy when I went so that was probably the reason for the long wait for drinks. I did like the band that was playing though. Other than that, thats all I remember besides the worst thing about the bar was the bathroom smell....OMG...it stunk like straight sewer! I would give this place another chance but if I went back and the bathroom still smelled I think I would probably not come back.
