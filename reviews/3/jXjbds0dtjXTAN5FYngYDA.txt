We held a co-worker's going away party here and I have to say that for a group of 16 people and one child-they did really well at serving us. The guac was good and I really liked their "hot" salsa that you have to ask for. The sangria is overly sweet but the house margarita on the rocks was better. The meals were so-so. I had some tired chicken enchilada's, but they werent horrendous, just pretty boring. My favorite thing about the whole night was hitting up the Trader Joe's in the same complex after dinner!
