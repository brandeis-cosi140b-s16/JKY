I recently moved to the east side from previously being on the West. Chipotle is always a good, reliable source when I need something quickly to tame my blood sugar. This location has been disappointing. In the several times that I have been here, they never seem to have their supplies together. No guacamole made, ran out of rice or chicken, which makes the line long and the food less satisfying. Great food, but service is just inconsistent.
