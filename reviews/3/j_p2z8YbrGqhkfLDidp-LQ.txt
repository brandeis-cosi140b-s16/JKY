Some things were okay.
-  The server was pleasant and attentive (I was one of two tables though). 
-  The decor is slightly better than average and clean.
-  There were three salsas presented. Of the three, the roasted peppers and onions         salsa was good.

Some things were disappointing:

-  I ordered huevos rancheros and coffee. The coffee was okay (nothing special, but it wasn't burned or instant.) The eggs were okay, but again, nothing special. 
-  The beans were on par with Taco Bell.
-  Though the food was mediocre at best, the bill was $10.

Simply put, the food is passable but with all the great options in the same price range, I won't be returning.
