My sister pretty much summed up our evening in her review (LeeAnn D.) but I thought I would add my take on the evening.  I found the chips, salsa and guacamole to all be excellent, to the point where I could not stop eating all of it and knew I was gonna be full for dinner!  I liked the prickly pear margarita, though I would have liked to have known it would be served up and not on the rocks.  I followed this up with the Partita margaritas and those were all very good as well.  My dinner was the tortilla pie, corn and the black bean and plantain mash.  All was good, but, my entree and corn were not served hot.

To add to the weirdness factor with the service, the guacamole maker took some and put it on a chip when he was done making it, and put it 2 inches from my face, just waiting for me to notice it!  It scared the shiz out of me when I finally saw something out of the corner of my eye!  I thought he was going to try and feed it to me!!  

And also, the bar staff either needs to learn to pick up the pace or the restaurant needs to hire more staff.  We had just received a round of drinks and decided to put the order in for the next because it was taking soooo long.  Our server decided to tell us that there were 17 tickets in ahead of ours and he got in trouble for putting our other round in so soon after the previous, um okay TMI maybe??  And somehow, even though he asked me a good 3 times if I wanted another one, when everybody else got their drinks, mine wasn't there and I had to wait even longer for mine =(

Overall I think the space is nice and I liked the food and drinks, it didn't end up being crazy expensive, where it can be when multiple drinks are involved.  But the service situation needs to improve for sure!
