Average food, average prices-for vegas I think. This was close to the venue we were going to so it worked. 
There was a good variety on the menu.
We were seated right away but then our waitress never came over. 10+ minutes later I asked and then she came over (didn't even know we were seated..?not sure where the miscommunication was since it wasn't that busy). 
Aside from that delay^^ all else was pretty timely. The food came fast after that.
Overall, it was okay. I would probably choose somewhere else next time.
