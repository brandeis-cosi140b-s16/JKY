I'll raise Cozymel's from a 3 star to a 3 1/2 star rating because of the dessert.  More on that later. 

It's been probably over 10 years since I ate here once as a tourist.  As I was driving by, heading to a familiar place, I decided to give it a go and try something different.  I was glad I did.  It's standard Tex/Mex.  The food could use a little more spice, but I assume they are directing their seasoning toward the people who want the Tex/Mex flavor without any zing.

Chips and salsa were completely average.  The salsa tasted like it came from a bottle of Pace salsa - nothing special there.  For the entree, I had the Pork Rostistado with "spicy verde sauce" or so the menu says.  The meal came with rice, black beans with some cheese sprinkled on the beans, and some great sauteed vegetables - zucchini and carrots - and the standard container of tortillas. As for the "spicy verde sauce," well it wasn't spicy.  The plain black beans had more zing than the verde sauce.  I asked my server for some Cholula and the dish took on a spicier flavor, more the way I like it.  The pork was very tasty, and in all, it was a good meal.

Of course, going to a different place means you have to try dessert just to see if the place is on the up and up.  I got their Banana Napoleon that was highly recommended by my server.  It was layers of banana pudding, sweetened, fried tortilla squares, and fresh bananas and whipped cream. She was right.  It was superb, but way too big!  OK, I made the sacrifice and finished it so there was no waste of food from me.

Service was excellent.  My server was a delightful young woman, very attentive, and she brought me refills of my iced tea promptly and without me having to request it.

I'll be returning.  This is an OK place for what it is, Tex/Mex in a nice atmosphere and a different selection of some menu items.
