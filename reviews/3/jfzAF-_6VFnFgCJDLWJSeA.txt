Be forewarned this is primarily a sit-down restaurant.  I ordered the "El Fish Taco" from the menu with shrimp for carry out since I was on my work lunch. Was brought a little silver cup of what I thought was sauce, but also received plastic cups of sauces when my taco arrived.  1 tiny baby taco with 3 shrimp, a slice of avocado, and some beans & rice showed up even though the menu only showed pairs of tacos. Was given my bill in a padded cc portfolio like a higher end restaurant would do and was told they would take it when ready. ???  1 tiny shrimp taco is $4.32 incl. tax.  I just left a 5. The taste was alright, nothing out of this world. I have to say seeing El Pollo Loco across the parking lot on the way to my car with my baby taco almost brought a tear to my eye. Lol
