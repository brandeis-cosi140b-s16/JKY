Lotta red flags when walking in. Ketchup on the tables, video gaming machines in the back, confusing layout, too big a menu, pronunciation guide for words like "verde" and "roja".

That being said, it was much better than it should have been. Meaning it was perfectly adequate Midwestern Mexican restaurant food.  Tamales were decent, as was the chori pollo. The outside seating area was pretty nice.
