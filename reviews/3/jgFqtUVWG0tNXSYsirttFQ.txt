You know, for Phoenix, it's not too bad for Mexican food. 

While our car was broken down, we walked over here and decided on the quesadilla. WOW! It's gigantic. And I didn't think of taking a pic. And not too bad! Nice and cheesy with chicken and sour cream/guac. It had other stuff in it too I just can't remember. 

They have a great outdoor seating area and prices are pretty decent. But, it was just missing that Cali flavor that only Cali knows. I just can't give it better than a 3.
