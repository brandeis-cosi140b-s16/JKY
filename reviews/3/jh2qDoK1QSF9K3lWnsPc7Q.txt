Ordered fajitas-pretty good 
My sister go chilie relleno- even better

It's kinda cool here outside seating-although river feels a little cheesy/man made/disney like-I don't really get it? 

Seemed a little pricey $15 meals-They are huge though
For 3 women we barely ate half our meal so definitely we should have split 

3 meals with 5 drinks total (3 house wines & 2 beers) was $75 plus tip 
$90 total seemed stiff to me but I live in Gilbert with 3 little kids so maybe I am bad judge of eating out pricing ??? 

They should really give out free chips & salsa-If they start doing that then I would give them 4 stars
