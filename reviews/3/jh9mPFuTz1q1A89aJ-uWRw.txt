I went here to grab lunch and a beer between classes. The service wasn't all that great. I don't think the waitress ever told me her name. I ordered the fish tacos and a tall beer. They start you off with chips and salsa. The chips were really good but the salsa could have been better. The fish tacos were just okay. They needed something more. The food came out quickly which was a plus. As others have mentioned, this place definitely has potential but needs a bit of work. I definitely will go back in the future during my lunch break.
