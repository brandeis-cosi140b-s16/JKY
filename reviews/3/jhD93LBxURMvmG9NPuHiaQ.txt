A group of about 10 of us came here for breakfast/lunch on our first full day in Vegas.  We had good and friendly service.  Quite a few of us ordered the frozen $20 margaritas... Sweet and delicious!  We got our chips and salsa quickly which were pretty good.  I ordered the $10 combo plate with one chicken taco and one chicken enchilada which came with rice and beans.  The food was pretty good, though I could have used some hot sauce.  Overall, it was a good experience.
