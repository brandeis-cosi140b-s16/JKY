Normally, I get good service in here and friendly people. Tonight the girl at the drive-through screwed up the salad I ordered ask for dressing on the side. When I tried to get her to fix it she wanted to know what was the purpose of the dressing on the side when it comes with dressing., Some people are dieting and maybe they don't want somebody else pouring a big glob of dressing on their salad. anyway A little disappointed with the service tonight.
