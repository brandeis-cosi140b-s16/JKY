In my opinion not a good Mexican restaurant with the exception of the poor decor. There is no music and no fruit water I.e. Pinapple etc. the burrito was $7+ for chorizo, and ham added as extra... Not impressive. I give it three stars at least because it was tasty and they weren't stingy on the meat.
