OK, we went here because it was close and we wanted Mexican food.  It's right at the end of the Fashion Show mall which makes it mall food in my book.  Let cut to the chase and say if you come here, the best part is the guacamole which is made to order at the spice level you want and the amazing margaritas.  I had a skinny one so I can pretend I'm not getting a boat load of extra calories and it was one of the better ones that I've had.   The chips that came complementary were a little stale and although the service was ok, the food came to the table not piping hot and just average for a Mexican place.
