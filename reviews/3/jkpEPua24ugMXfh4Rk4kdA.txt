America's Taco shop is in a cool little house on 7th St.  I'll make this review short and sweet:  they have some great carne asada, but something is wrong with the tacos...they have lettuce...maybe they have an option to get them with onions and cilantro?  I don't know maybe my taco sense is off, but I am more of a fan of the roadside taco stands with simple good tacos for cheap...like they have at El Gran Taco....tacos de cabeza, de lengua...mmmm, real mexican.

Although I wouldn't drive out of the way to go to this place, I loved the vibe, and I would like to try their ceviche, tostadas, hot dogs and corn.  It all looked fabulous and one couple must have eaten one of everything on the menu... I was jealous.  

Yes, I'd definitely go back, it showed promise...maybe I was too harsh with the lettuce on my tacos.  They were pretty tasty and the salsa was a nice smoky flavor...and I really liked the carne asada. 

I'll see how round two goes....I have good hopes for a successful lunch or dinner here.
