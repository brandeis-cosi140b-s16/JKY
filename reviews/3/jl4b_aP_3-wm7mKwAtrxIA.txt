I wanted to like this place. I think you can if you're interested in wine and maybe one dish. However we were a hungry group, and ordered a few items. What you'll come to quickly realize is they only have a few items that are repeated multiple times on the different dishes. For example - olives and macrona almonds. These two will end up repeatedly on every dish. They were also out of a few items which were frustrating. 

Diners beware - if you're getting one dish you may enjoy (although there is little substance). If you want wine you'll also get a selection. Otherwise be prepared to get a sandwich next door (or keep walking to the next dining and drinking area in the grill by gate 11).
