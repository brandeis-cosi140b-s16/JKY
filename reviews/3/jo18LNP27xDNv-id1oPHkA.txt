I'd give it 3.5 stars. Good food for cheap, real cheap! Just bring your pepto.

So we went here 4 days ago just as we arrived in Vegas. 

I ordered the 3 tacos plate (comes with rice and beans and a soda for under $5!!). My gf ordered the sopes, and our friend got the taquitos. 
Everyone was pretty satisfied with what they got, the food was super filling. I'd recommend the carne asada tacos over the chicken. 

They also have a good salsa station where you can grab some pickled carrots, jalapenos, radishes, fresh cut lemons, along with 4 different salsas. We also ordered a side of their guacamole, which wasn't anything special, but I'd still order it again. 

I have to say though, the reason I'm not giving them 4 stars is that we all felt kinda crappy after eating here, very sluggish. I know it's mexican food, and I know it was probably greaser than you can taste which was probably the culprit, but nonetheless the feeling was mutual between us 3.

I'd still go back!
