Stopped in to the new El Rancho Mexican Grill on S Park last night and was pleasantly surprised. Think of it as a small-scale local Chipotle or Panchero's in the "quick casual" space, with meals generally ranging from $5-8. They have a small but solid menu of tacos, burritos, tortas, quesadillas, and nachos.

You simply order and pay at the counter - staff was funny and accommodating. There is a small, poorly lit sitting area with a few tables surrounded by dark wood paneling or you might just want to take your food to go. 

We tried the tacos (corn tortillas - yum) and the build-your-own nachos. Overall, things were good - favorite meat was chicken. Carnitas was okay - the meat needs a bit more seasoning, but it is on the right track. Red salsa is sufficiently spicy and the green is available for the less adventurous eaters.

Need something quick and cheap and in a mood for mexican? Stop by.
