¡Su burrito de desayuno es muy bueno! 

I've been to Burrito Express a couple times, and on each occasion, I was drawn to have breakfast for dinner. The first time, I tried the regular ham and egg burrito. It's big with healthy amounts of egg, ham, and cheese throughout. The dish is served with a side of lettuce and the servers will bring out bottles of red and green sauce to top it all off. In the mood for even more? Step up your breakfast burrito game and get one with steak and eggs. It's what you'd expect and loaded with potatoes to boot. This one had me full and satisfied. My wife enjoys their bean and cheese burrito.

The inside of the establishment is deceivingly spacious for the location. You can choose to hunker down at a table or booth, all within viewing distance of the big TV on the wall. I noticed that each time I went the TV channel was playing an international or uncommon American sport like women's boxing or volleyball. The outside of the restaurant even promotes English Premier League soccer, so that's pretty cool too.

So, hey, whenever you're in the mood for some conveniently priced, quick and tasty Mexican food, give Burrito Express a try.

¡Adios amigos!
