I like this place for the decor and seating set up. There were high tables, lounge tables, couches, indoor/outdoor, etc, and the indoor pergola was kind of cool. 

The happy hour menu is pretty good too. M-F 4-6:30 they offer drink and app specials, as well as deals on their tacos. 

I sampled some of their tequilas, which you can order various ways: as a shot, in a snifter glass, over rocks, etc. We also tried the grilled fish tacos and mushroom tacos were very good and you get three for around $7.50. 

We even checked in on yelp (aw yeah) and got 4 penny shots (there were four of us) of the featured shot-which was sex on the beach. 

My negatives were more service based. Our server made an error on one of our drinks, forgot to bring another drink entirely and failed the water test miserably. We not only asked her for more water, but another staff member who came by and checked on us. Both of them never returned with any water so we had to go to the bar and get it ourselves!
