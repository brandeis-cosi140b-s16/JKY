3.5 to be exact. The first issue is getting into Ruru's. There are several business signs on the front of the building, but it's not clear where to enter. There's a random door that says "open". It looks like the door for a jewelry store, but you can in fact go to Ruru's through this entrance. I was seated immediately. They don't comp chips and dip, which is bad for the consumer, smart for business because we're just going to buy the chips and salsa anyway. I ordered a grilled chicken taco and a shrimp taco. Like everything on the menu, they had some sort of name that reflected Ruru's theme. I thought the menu could've stood to be more straight forward. The upside to Ruru's is that the food was really good. My drink was weak for $9. I would skip having drinks here. Service is good. Overall, decent experience and I'll be back.

My friend, who is a vegetarian, ordered a steak burrito, subbing steak for tofu and no price adjustment was made.
