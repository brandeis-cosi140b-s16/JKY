I love tacos el Gordo!! Their buche tacos are the best in town. They get 3 stars because they are a bit over priced, and the rude lady at the cash register that refused to give me more salsa. I was pregnant, my husband and I got around 10 tacos (I was eating for 2) and the lady only gave me 2 salsas. When I asked for more she said the tacos already came w salsa!!! Wtf is wrong with thi girl!!!! I had 10 tacos in my hands, are you serious!!! Needless to say their mediocre choice for staff made them lose some really good customers!!
