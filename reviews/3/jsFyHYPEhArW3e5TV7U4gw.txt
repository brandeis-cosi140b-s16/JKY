I have tried several time to like Robertos and it literally does nothing for me. 
I give 3 stars for the employees, everyone is always nice and personable but the food just doesn't tickle my fancy. I love mexican food but the taste just doesn't agree with my tongue... idk all i know is ive decided I wont be back!
