I really considered not writing this review at all. A lot of the other reviewers here seem to have experienced similar trepidation, but I guess that says something about the restaurant itself.

I fortuitously managed to try Chica Loca on Taco Tuesday(!) and was treated to the super-special deal of 2 tacos for $5, otherwise known as, exactly how much tacos should cost. The chorizo (sourced from Las Palmas in Oakland) taco was really tasty. As noted, they provide the traditional taco format: 2 corn tortillas, lime wedge, topped with cilantro, queso fresco, and diced onion. I got mine with pico de gallo but craved more taste and ended up using extra spicy salsa. The carnitas taco was good, I suppose. Individually, the meat was flavorful and tasty but it got lost in, surprisingly enough, the tortillas. You know there is a problem with your seasoning when it gets overpowered by corn tortillas...

The decor is nothing to write home about: chairs and tables that would look normal on a suburban deck, bright wall colors, and a rather bizarre shotgun layout in which the counter is at the far back, requiring you to walk down the 4 foot aisle past other eaters.

I feel bad because I love eating tacos and supporting local business but I was not that happy with this place. I tried to order the "super secret salsa" as well as the tomatillo salsa and was informed that they were out (this was around 7pm on a weekday). I think the woman I was speaking with was the owner and she was very nice and talkative, encouraging me to return and try the salsas I missed. I probably will go back one day because it was objectively enjoyable food. That said, I would only go back on a tuesday. Having never tried their more expensive tacos, I still think I can say their prices are absurd. Show me a fish taco worth $7.50 and I will gladly devour it. Until then, my Pittsburgh taco quest continues.
