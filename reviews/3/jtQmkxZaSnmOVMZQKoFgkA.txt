I loved their Adobada tacos. When you take a bite of the taco the sauces they put on top of the taco makes it that much better. I only gave it a 3 star because there are ALOT, I mean ALOT, of flies. I was trying to swat away the flies as I was eating which made me so annoyed. If there were no flies I woulda gave it 5 star.
