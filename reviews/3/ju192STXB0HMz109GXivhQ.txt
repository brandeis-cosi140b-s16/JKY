IT IS A FOOD TRUCK. I wish that was stated somewhere on the page. I drove miles and miles today to find out it was not there. I had to do a web search, and that is where I found out. . I think that the word food truck should be put next to, or below the name. The stablishment at least should keep cust up to days of the whereabouts. Big bummer.
