I enjoyed Spanish Fly on Cinco De Mayo. I made a new facebook friend and everyone there was friendly. 

My Buddy who is gay even had a good time there with the eye candy and friendly atmosphere. He said it was the most fun he's ever had at a straight club.

Its major drawback is its dance floor. When you get past the reception the first thing you do is walk onto the dance floor. This is good if you're there to jump right into the groove but bad if you'd like to get past the crowd and sit by the pool. 

Honestly, the club is only special because of it's pool. The music is ok, the drinks are good, seating is plentiful and comfortable, and the eye candy is a mix of young and old. I personally think it's a great place to relax and drink after a long day.
