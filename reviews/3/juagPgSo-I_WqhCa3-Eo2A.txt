The food and service at Tako was 5 stars, the drinks were a 3; decor was amazing, however, the volume of the music just made our meal unenjoyable.  An avid concert go-er, I don't mind a party, but I like to talk at dinner.

We shared the guac which was great, chips had perfect amount of salt, chicken, Korean and al pastor.  All were good, Korean was clear winner for taste- it was excellent.  The drinks were distinctive and creative, but not great.  Our server was knowledgeable and prompt with service. Price was very reasonable for downtown and volume of food.

I understand why restaurants crank up the music (you drink more because you can't hear what other's are saying so you don't talk and it helps tables turn faster), but I just didn't like having to eat my tacos in silence because a conversation would be pointless.  I'd get the food and eat on the patio again, but won't be back inside again.
