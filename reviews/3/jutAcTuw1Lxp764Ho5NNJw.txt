The teriyaki and white rice plate was good but I would not recommend the rice cake tostada the rice was very hard. I did feel extremely rushed by the waiter.  
I understand he was there by himself but when I go somewhere I want to sit down and relax to eat I don't want to feel like I cannot take my time ordering. 
He was also short of patients explaining the menu.
