Back again for Kickball post game party.  I decided to eat last night as I was still a little under the weather.  I got the special which was 3 steak street tacos and re-fried beans for about $8.  As I was waiting I could smell the steak and onions grilling up in the back and even the people next to me were asking what that was cause it smelled great.  Out came my tacos and I was excited to get my grub on.  They were plenty filling and went well with my still overpriced Blue Moon.  Overall still a 3 as the food is good and the beer is still a bit pricey for non Bud Light drinkers.
