This is an excellent Mexican option in South Oakland just down the street from the far more famous Mad Mex.  The prices are eminently reasonable; the portions are good; and you'll have a much easier time getting a table or spot at the bar than you would at some inferior but trendier places.  The cuisine here is noticeably more authentic than its nearby counterpart as well.

There are a few drawbacks that keep Mi Ranchito at the 3-star level:
-The cheese sauce is just sad.  It's runny and bland to the point where it's not even worth dipping a tortilla chip in it.  Too much mess for too little flavor gain.

-The salsa is likewise watery and difficult to enjoy.  Come to think of it, if you want to keep any dipping sauce on your chip in between the bowl and your mouth, you'll have to perform such amazing repeated feats of hand and wrist gymnastics that two meals a week here would be more than enough to give you carpal tunnel syndrome.

-I've been here a few times, and every time they've been out of the goat meat that sounds so delicious on the menu.  I keep trying to order it, only to be rebuffed.  The fourth star might be in those barbacoa dishes...only time will tell.
