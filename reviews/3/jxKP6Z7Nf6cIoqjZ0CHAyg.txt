SLOOOOOOOOOOOW SERVICE (which is why not 5 star)

Came with the family last night. I've eaten here many times before. Never had any complaints.

FOOD:
Absolutely delicious! The food was definitely some of the best Mexican food I've eaten. No complaints at all.

SERVICE:
We were promptly seated and our drink orders were taken. The waiter disappeared for 20 minutes before he took our food order. Food came quick. After we were finished the bus boys cleared the table. It took the waiter 30 minutes to bring the check!

Like I said I've eaten here quite a few times and never had such slow service. 20 minutes to take a food order and 30 minutes to get a check is simply not acceptable in the food service biz. The waiter was nice though but just real slow.
