I think it was an off day for them last time I was here.

They almost never get my order wrong. But for some reason I was given beef taco's instead of fish. Damn language barrier! :(

My friend ordered a shrimp burrito. I tasted it. It was good. I was a little skeptical about how it was going to taste at first. If it wasn't so salty I'd consider ordering it myself.

My chicken chimi was just huge! Like always :) But it always surprises me how humongous they are here.

Their horchata wasn't as good this time either. Maybe it was a fresh batch & needed some more time to set up. Not sure. But it needed more cinnamon.
