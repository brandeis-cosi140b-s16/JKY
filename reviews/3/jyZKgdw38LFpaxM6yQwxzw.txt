I don't expect to have great Mexican food here when I visit, but it does in a pinch, and visit often due to the convenience of the location.
The service is so slooooow. I don't think we have ever had anyone come and check with us during our meal. Not to mention I have not seen the same wait person more than once. I pay attention to that kind of thing.
Make sure you ask for the "hot sauce", it is good.
