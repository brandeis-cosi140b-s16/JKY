We were visiting the area and there are no Del Taco's in our home area.  The 39 cent taco special caught our attention.  They have them on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday evenings.  The taco was crisp, flavorful, and tasty.  Certainly nothing exotic, but basically a good taco at a good value.  Line moved a bit slow, but they were busy.  Overall, an OK experience.
