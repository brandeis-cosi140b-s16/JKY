I have exclusively heard negative things about the Food-Fight, inc chain of restaurants.  So, I had to try one of them for myself.  

The tacos were good and the lunch special is quite reasonable.  You can get out of there for less than $10, if you play your cards right.

Negative:  chips and salsa aren't free...
