Before I start, understand that my family and I love Rubio's and have eaten at several locations throughout multiple states.  It is only unfortunate that this particular location is the one nearest our home.  The problem lies solely on the patio location.  The proximity to the 101 frontage road and the neighboring pub patio leaves the possibility that you will be huffing either exhaust fumes or cigarette smoke dependent on the prevailing wind if you choose to dine al fresco.  I highly recommend that you eat inside or get your food to-go.  The cuisine never disappoints but the patio location is a big drawback.
