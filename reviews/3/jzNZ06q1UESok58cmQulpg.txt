Aah, cheap, street-style mexican food next to a Wal-Mart. 

I've been spoiled by places like Chipotle, but sometimes I just want a small, greasy taco dammit! 

It's not really a place to go out of your way for. More like an option if you're hungry and happen to be in the neighborhood. (There's something about shopping in Wal-Mart that makes you hungry, and a lot of the time you just don't feel like grabbin' the required Mickey D's in every Wal-Mart Supercenter location).
