Tacos were good but like someone else said, "Mexican food made by real Mexican's", I expected their tacos to be even better than what they were. They got the food out super fast which was a + considering we were on a time crunch. They are really expensive for tacos though. Almost $30 for 2 people to order 3 tacos and 2 drinks? No tiny taco should be 3$. Maybe visit the LA taco trucks for ideas?
