First time we ate here on a Saturday about 1. We were sat quickly and our server came to offer drinks . We ordered heradura margaritas very fast and they were awesome. Chips and salsa were good tasted freshly made. We were also given queso moments later. Then manager came by to see how we were liking it so far and introduced herself and recommended the green enchiladas with hatch NM chili.  My wife got the new mexico relleno and enchilada. Then other manager came and introduced himself and offered us the queso and sopapillas  free. Great service from everyone and our server was very attentive. We got our food fast not bad at all. Enchiladas were good not as good as I make but not bad. We would be back if in the area again.
