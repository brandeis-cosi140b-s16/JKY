This is one if my favorite places to eat. The perfect "hole in the wall", so if your expecting fancy, this place us not for you, but the food is fantastic. Love the Jerk Chicken and Jerk Rice. Very spicy!  Jade Chicken is the bomb. Love how you can make your own combo. They also make really tasty refried beans. Never had a bad dish and I have been a patron for loooong time. They have scrumptious cookies too!
