Located in the University hood. Macayo Vegas serves pretty good Mexican chow.
I had the enchilada sampler, which was good, but not quite a "WOW" experience.

Their chips and salsa are pretty good, their frozen margaritas are pretty good, the service is pretty good, etc. 

I would return and try something else on the menu, but would not go out of my way to go here.  

Not bad, but personally, I prefer Lindo Michoacan on East DI.
