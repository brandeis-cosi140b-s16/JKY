Not bad for an airport. The drinks are a tad overpriced but my food was good - I had the chicken verde enchiladas. They came out quick. I cleaned up the plate. Service was fine and the music was good too although a bit loud (salsa, merengue, cumbia, bachata), but I thought it was weird that there were no Mexicans on staff.
