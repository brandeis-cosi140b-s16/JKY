I really like the food at this place and I have gone here a lot.  How can you mess up Mexican Food?  Some do, and in my opinion, Amigo's doesn't.  My biggest problem is the service.  The service is never great.  It's never bad enough to not come back but it is always annoying.  Chips come out quickly, food comes out fast, and then they always seem to have the biggest problem bringing the check.  It's just ridiculous.  If the food wasn't good, I'd give the place a 1, and if the service wasn't bad, I'd give it a 4.  Here they are, right in the middle.  Oh, and they do have some good specials and pitchers of beer are cheap too.  $6 I think but they have to bring them from the bar and it takes them forever.
