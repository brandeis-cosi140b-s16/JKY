Decided to stop here to eat after coming to Vegas from out of town.. The food wasn't bad at all! Nor the service! Usually I'm the kind of guy that like to chat with the waiters and waitresses a bit but I just felt like these guys just weren't in the mood to chat. I'm not sure if they were kinda ticked off because Mexico lost in the FIFA tournament (given it's a Mexican restaurant) or what but I wish I wasn't treated like cattle to get me in and out of there.. Would I eat here again? Of course! The food was excellent! I enjoyed the combination plates they offered. It was the perfect meal and the prices were very reasonable! Although I paid 12 bucks for a margarita :( but no doubt, I would suggest this place for a quick and easy meal!
