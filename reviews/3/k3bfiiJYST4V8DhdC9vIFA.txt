As a crabby ASU alumni, usually the thought of anything Mill-related is highly unappealing. However, I was mostly satisfied with my visit to Fuzzy's. When I was there it was pretty clean, it was inexpensive, and the food was ready fast.

I ordered a vegetarian sandwich. I'll admit it was a little weird to eat a sandwich that had the filling a burrito normally would have, but I still liked it. I did not get a drink when I went, but I would be interested in trying one another time. 

I would be glad to try this place again, but I would probably order tacos or something instead!
