I skipped lunch and was running around between Downtown and our training center near Metrocenter.  I know I can always count on this location for a good quick bite to eat.  And it's conveniently located near I-17. 
On this visit I decided to get their Monday 99¢ special which was 3 rolled tacos (beef).  I also picked up a carne asada burrito for dinner. 
Luckily I had cash. They dont take credit cards and charge you 60¢ to run your debit card. 
I pulled up to the window and picked up my order.  Nothing special other than good quick mexican food.
