I went here with a friend last night after wanting to try this place for some time. It was nice that they are open late (ish... 11pm). I was really excited to try their food after reading all of the rave reviews, but overall, I thought it was just ok. I ordered a birria taco, a carne asada gordito - crispy as recommended by the girl taking my order, and a pollo vampiro. All of this (plus my free chips... thanks Yelp!) cost about 9$, fairly reasonable. The restaurant was busy, with many people waiting to get a table inside due to it being fairly cold outside (though they had heaters going outside making it effectively warmer out there), but we managed to snag a table inside. The food was prepared quickly and with a stop at the salsa bar, we were ready to eat. Unfortunately, the food was sort of a mixed bag. My friend had a bean and cheese burro and said it was amazing. The birria taco was fairly good, the meat was tender and flavorful. The vampiro was decent.... I liked the crispy tortilla, but the meat was nothing special. The gordita was not so good. The shell was incredibly chewy and hard to eat, the flavor was on the burnt side.... the carne asada was fine, but the shell... not so much. I'm not sure if this is how this dish usually tastes or if it was just an off night. The salsas from the salsa bar were all good and tasted fresh. They had many salsas that tasted unlike anything I have ever had before... in a good way. Overall, this place was alright, but I couldn't see myself making a special trip out here to have it again.
