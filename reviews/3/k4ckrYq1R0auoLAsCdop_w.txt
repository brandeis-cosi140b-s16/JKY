My favorite part of this place will always be the salsa.  I love it!  

The food though, I'd agree it's so so at best.  Last night was my first time here as a vegetarian, I ordered the Veggie Quasadilla, it was alright really a bit greasy from the cheese for my taste.  It really was nothing more then some shredded cheese diced up tomatoes, onions, and jalapenos.  It was not bad, but not great.  

Prices are great, we had 4 adults and a child for around $50, my husband ordered a chimichanga which he said was good, my grandmother also had the chimichanga and she enjoyed it.  My mom had a taco/enchilada/tostada combo.  The tostada was rubbery but everything else she said was good.  Guacamole was alright, huge chunks of avocado which I enjoy but not much in way of flavors beyond the avocado.

All in all we'll return again, we've been here tons of times but it's certainly not the best Mexican in the valley.
