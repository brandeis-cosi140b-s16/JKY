Tried the Torro Verde tacos today. Kind of wish they were on crispy taco shells instead of soft corn tortillas but very delicious.  
Watch out though, these are messy to eat. Needed several napkins.  Not that that's a bad thing. 
Pineapple juice was good too. Nice to have options besides soda or water. 
Prices were very reasonable and the ladies running this truck were very nice.  Food was fresh and quick.
