Overall everything was good, but I wouldn't say it was great and I wouldn't seek this place out when there are so many other choices.

You have to order at the counter, then they bring your food out to you.  The chips were probably my favorite part of the meal.  They were obviously freshly made and were warm and crispy.  They came with beans, rice, and pico de gallo.  The beans were great, but the rice was just OK and the pico de gallo was disappointingly bland.  I had the carne asada burrito as the main part, it was short on meat, and what meat it had wasn't flavorful.
