I wanted to like this place as much as I LOVE Chipotle's.  I have been going to Chipotle's so much (I think that put some thing in the food to make you CRAVE it) that I needed to break away to try something else.  We spotted Baja Fresh, so hey....  It was good, staff was friendly, but it was not GREAT!!  

I got the bean and cheese add chicken burrito & chips with queso.  The bean was ok, I did not see or tasted too much cheese, and the chicken was ok.  The chips that weren't too over fried were good, but we had 50% that were overly brown.  The queso was pretty good.
