All my friends know the T-Q-LA
The T-Q-LA makes me a little hungry

T-Q-LA drinks a little spicy
T-Q-LA is a real goer

T-Q-LA knows a good fajita, yeah
T-Q-LA is the one to eat, yeah


TQLA is a modern Southwestern restaurant located in the hot spot of Mesa in the Dana Park Village Square.  

I came here with some friends for brunch after a long hike at The Lost Dutchman.  The staff was very accommodating since our group went from big to small and had to switch tables.  My friend shot for a spicy margarita and bloody mary while I went for a beer.  They have tequilas on tap, but as we all know that's my Kryptonite!  The bloody mary was nothing too special according to my buddy while the spicy margaritas was not spicy.  Our server later went out of her way to make a second, but this time with some habanero peppers; which really made the drink awesome!  

For our entrees I got the fried fish tacos and both my friends ordered Fajitas.  I loved the blackbeans that came with my tacos; sweet and creamy.  My fish tacos were good, but way too big for a taco.  Looked like entire fillet of fish breaded and place in a small corn tortilla.  I ate only 2 and gave the rest to my buddy.  Well breaded for sure with a crunchy texture along with the cabbage slaw within.  My friends fajitas were pretty good according to them, but I had a taste of it and the beef was juicy and tender. - Enjoy!

Overall, a solid spot for some Southwestern bite and the service is always welcoming.  - Enjoy!
