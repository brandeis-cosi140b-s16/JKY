Simply good solid Mexican food.  Ignore silly rules on their promo (buy one get one free excludes seafood, even if you want to pay for the seafood and get a cheaper non seafood dish free)  don't seem to get bean dip for free anymore.   Can't sub tortillas soup for salad anymore.  Besides that its the same great solid Mexican food we've come to expect.  Gets more stars when the above situations are taken care of.  This is our go to Mexican restaurant this neighborhood.
