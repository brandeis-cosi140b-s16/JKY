I have no idea why I keep returning to this place, it really isn't great or fancy.  Last night I didn't even like the salsa, and the chips seemed stale.  I had a pork burro, very very very very very salty.  Yikes!  And I a usually the one who uses the salt shaker.  I guess it is convenient to meet a friend, but something has got to give here.  One more shot then I will possibly have to move on.  Oh, and did I mention that they didn't even offer us a refill on the chips?  they gave us an extra salsa but whatcha gonna do with extra salsa?  It was ok, just not great...
