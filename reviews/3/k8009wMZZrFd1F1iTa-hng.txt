Went out to dinner with the whole family. We love Mexican food! 
First impression was not that good. If the hostess worried about the customers as much as she did about her hair & make it would dramatically improve the "Welcome"  feeling you get. She then proceeded to seat us (5 adults, 2 kids) in a booth. A booth in which the car seat of our 2 month old would not fit. She told us to just put the car seat on the table....
Anyway, after that whole situation we received the chips & salsa. They were really good! 3 different types of salsa, heck yea! 
Food soon followed, and I really enjoyed it. Service with our waiter continued to be slow, but the food was great!
Prices were a bit high, average was $12.  I will return, but it's not going to be a "go to" for dinner.
