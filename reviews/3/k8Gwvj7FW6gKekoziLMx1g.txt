I think Rubio's is my least favorite of the quick-service Mexican restaurants. I want to like it, but somehow the flavors just aren't my bag. They do have fish and shrimp here, but again, not really my bag. 

On the day in question I had a salad. It left a little something to be desired--though it was fresh. They make it seem like you're getting buckets full of avocado, and then you get three teeeeeny little slices. 

I will say that the service at this place is stellar. Everybody was so friendly, even brought me my food when I cold have gotten up and got it for myself. If I liked the flavors more, I would definitely be giving them more business based on service alone!
