I was dying for some Mexican food. Unfortunately I am surrounded by nothing remotely yummy enough. So I get my #1 to jump in the car with me for a scavenger hunt of yumminess (yes that is a word ;) 

We drive up north because of a review about "life changing" tacos. Alas, we could not find the darn place even though Google maps assured me I was on top of it!!! Frustrated but not defeated we jump on the freeway and head back to the old stomping grounds (cenPho). As always we somehow manage not only to find a place, but a GREAT place!!! 

So upon walking in, I felt like I should be in Cali.. The psycho colors and trinkets all over are awesome.!! 

Now to the food. I got the mahi tacos and #1 got the steak burro. We shared the shrimp skewer and I got a marg! 

Kids this stuff is no joke. It's so yummy! And the prices are ridiculously low. 

To top off all the wonderfulness (yes it's a word also ;) of this place ( the great food. cartoonish atmosphere. Service with a smile. Salsa bar. Endless chips.... I got a free Teddy bear! Well bunny actually !!! His name is Don Julio De Cervantes (see pictures) and is quite the cutie pie!

Go grab some grub. You will not be disappointed, I promise. This is one of those places where you want to try everything on the menu.

Enjoy!
