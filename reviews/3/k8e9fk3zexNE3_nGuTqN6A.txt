This place has definitely changed over the years!  Just found out this location is under new ownership. All the old employees have left and the prices have been raised. The reason for the 3 stars is that there is absolutely no consistency here anymore. Depending on who is in the back making the tacos results in if you get a taco with barely any meat or a wonderful taco filled up properly.  Please bring back your old cook!!!!  The younger woman that is predominately back there now makes them so weak!  You're basically eating tortilla and lettuce!
