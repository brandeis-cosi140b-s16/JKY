Not too impressed with the food. We ordered a number 19 and a chicken burrito. I've never had mexican food with cheddar cheese on it instead of the traditional white cheese before. It was very stringy and didn't melt in the enchilada. The chicken in the burrito tasted off, kind of like it was frozen first which was probably the case, and the tortilla tasted very different. Maybe other dishes would be better but we're moving onto the next place.
