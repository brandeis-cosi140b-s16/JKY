Pretty good darn torta's! Most usually comes with guacamole slices.  Ingredients seem fresh too!  If you do stop by, get the hot guacamole salsa, it's blended really well and has a kick! Apply it onto your tortas! so good! Wash it down with a can of Coke, seems to go really well with it.

The menu seem to have slimmed down over the past few times I've gone, so that's why I have given them a 3-star, otherwise a 4.
