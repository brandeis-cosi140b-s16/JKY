It was actually a pretty quiet night when my wife and I came in here to eat. The outside portion of the restaurant was crowded and loud and we were initially reluctant to try it out but once we peeked inside it looked pretty sedate. So we decided to give it a shot.

We ordered the Grilled Top Sirloin Fajitas for two with beans and rice on the side. The food was really good. I enjoyed it a lot. I wish that they would bring more tortillas though. The waiter only brought three for each of us. We breezed through those pretty quick and had to ask for some more because there was still a lot of meat and veggies that we hadn't finished that we needed to wrap up. The waiter apparently expected that we would need more from the beginning because when he brought the food he told us to let him know when we needed more. Why wouldn't he have just given us more at the start? They should bring five tortillas per order, not three.

For a drink I had the Sammy's Toasted Colada which was a bit fruity for my taste. It was okay but I wouldn't order it again. I was a little bit disappointed with the drink menu. With the amount of sweet, fruity drinks they specialize in one would think that they might cater exclusively to Mexican Bachelorette parties. Everything seems to be rum (oh wait - Sammy's Beach Bar Rum), pineapple juice, coconut, and various fruity fillings. Not the manliest drinks.

I liked the quiet atmosphere (judging by previous reviews this seems to be a rarity here) and the food was good. Expensive, but good. There's no sense complaining about expense when you're in a place founded by a celebrity and it's on the Las Vegas Strip. Ni modo, as√≠ es la vida.
