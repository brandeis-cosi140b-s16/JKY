The food at Mi Casa is very good. Tonite was no exception. The service, on the other hand, was horrendous. For a Saturday night in Las Vegas the place was dead (8:00 pm), the service should have been spot on. We got the 3 salsa and table side guacamole, the chips ran out, we had to ask 3 TIMES for more chips and they didn't come until we had our entrees. We asked for a desert menu which took 10 minutes to appear and then 20 minutes after that when asked what we wanted for desert we said "the check". When we advised the hostess of the miserable service she said to "ask for so and so next time". Really, is he the only good waiter. We live 3 miles from Mi Casa and we will never go back.
