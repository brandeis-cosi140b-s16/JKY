The hubs and I were on the hunt for lunch and both starving! We both get hangry, so food was a must asap! We found this place and since we had the pup, needed a patio. They obliged so we sat down. 
Pros: $2 mimosas, good salsa, friendly servers, dog friendly patio
Cons: Tiny portions for starving people, grenidine in mimosas and not very good food
The $2 mimosas seemed great, but were pretty lame (you get what you pay for) and had my second least favorite substance in the world in it, grenidine. 
The food came out pretty quick, but we were starving and my two tiny tacos and ramekin of beans left a lot to be desires. C ordered the huevos rancheros and they put fruit on his plate and the juice leaked on it eggs. Kind of gross.
It was good enough, but I wouldn't go back
