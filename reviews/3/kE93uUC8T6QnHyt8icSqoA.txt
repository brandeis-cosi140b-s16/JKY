Errrrrrrmmm....If you're open 24 hours, you should have consistent service all 24 hours, right?

I work nights and was driving through around 1am on a weeknight. It took an average amount of time, but by the time I drove the remaining 10 miles home, my food was cold. Was it because the cheese inside my cheese enchiladas wasn't even melted? Yes, yes it was. 

I'm sure I'll try again since it's 24 hours and sometimes you just gotta have Roberto's in the middle of the night, but on first experience, it wasn't so great.
