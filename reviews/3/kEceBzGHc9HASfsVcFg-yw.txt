We ordered take out tonight and got home. First bite into the Baja chicken burro there were 2 chicken bones. Although that is absolutely disgusting when I called them they offered to replace them and give me a credit in which they did. I did have to drive back and go pick them up which sucked. But great customer service, just a surprise with having chicken bones.
