Los Reyes is great, don't get me wrong.
Food rocks, but there are a few items I wish were better.

1)  They have no Ice Tea.
2)  I have had some cleanliness concerns in the restroom.
3)  I darn near cut my fingertip off one day on a broken chair.  They didn't seem to really know what the heck to do.

But the GOOD STUFF is...
The "Aquas Frescas" are great, but often a bit sweet for me.  So I ask for my favorite "Aqua Limon con poco Azucar".  I crave this drink, it is extra yummy.

The tacos and burritos are all great.  Especially the Alambre de Pollo and Alambre de Res.

The Tortas are killer.  Never had a Torta, huh?
Just trust me and try one.

I really like the Ranchera Especial (with a can of soda??)
This is a soft warm bun type sandwich with a mixture of shredded or ground beef inside with cilantro and onion in a slightly spicy saucy  mixture.  Maybe you could call it a Mexican Sloppy Joe?  But so much better.

No ice tea, no tortilla chips (Ruffles instead) and some really amazing sandwiches and other mexican treats.  Muy autentico.
