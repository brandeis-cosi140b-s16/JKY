Everything here wasn't exactly authentic Mexican food, but for what it was, it was still good. It just wasn't very memorable in my opinion. I got the chicken nachos. It was loaded with everything on it and the nachos still managed to stay crispy so I could appreciate that. I also got the elote. The elote was huge and perfectly covered in cheese and chili powder. I feel like it needed more lime juice though. They have a variety of fruit waters which is probably my favorite thing about this place. I got the watermelon and damn, it was refreshing. I can't wait to try the other flavors. I will probably be coming back to this place to try something different and try out the rest of their fruit waters lol.
