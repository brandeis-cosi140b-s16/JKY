This place should be called Taco's Yum.  At least that was my thought after having some of their yummy yummy tacos.  I've had just about every kind now and while I can't say for sure that I have a favorite the carnitas and the fish are totally on top of the list. Mmmm.  Folks I've gone with have done plate food and burritos and both really liked what they've gotten.   Me, I stick to the tacos.  Yummy every single time.  Fresh veggies and herbs.  What's should be cold is cold and what should be warm is warm.  Juicy meat, but not so much so that it soaks totally through the corn tortillas.  I could go on, but really, I think the pictures of the tacos speak for themselves.  

And did I mention it's cheap?  Sooooo cheap that I almost felt bad using my 2 for 1 coupon the first time I went.  Of course, I did anyhow.  And let me tell you that a free taco tastes just as good.
