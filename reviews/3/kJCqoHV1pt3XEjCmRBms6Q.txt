Well, what can I say. I love Mexican food and this is pretty good. A group of us had just left a meeting and needed a place to unwind. It was a quiet Tuesday evening and the weather was perfect for sitting outside. The view of Uptown was perfect. We chose our Kryptonite and it was a pitcher of Margaritas on special. We were like Superman and folded after the first one. It was delicious! 

A few of us ordered meals and the food was good. All of us being Latino and growing up with Mom & Grandma's cooking makes us a little tough to please but this certainly passed. I would definitely go back for more. This may become our new hangout after our meetings. :)

The wait staff was fabulous. They were so helpful in pulling a bunch of tables together for us quickly without disturbing the other diners and were quick to bring out the chips and salsa as soon as we were seated. They got all of our orders right and we were more than happy with their suggestions. BRAVO!
