The food is good and a welcomed break from the average fast food joint.  However, when I was eating there, something in their kitchen started beeping really loudly.  I watched to see if anyone was going to turn off whatever was sounding the alarm...but no one looked affected b the noise.  The beeping continued for over 8 minutes before I asked an employee what was making all that noise.  She said they were cleaning some equipment.  And asked if the noise was bothering me with a tone and look that showed she was confused that anyone would be complaining about it.  It was very annoying and caused me to rush to finish my food just to get out of there before I ripped all my hair out.  

I only give them 3 stars because the food was good.  Otherwise it would have been less just for the poor service and disregard for their customer's dining experience.
