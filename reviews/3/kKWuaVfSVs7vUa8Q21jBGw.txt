I stopped in yesterday to pick up a take-out menu and ended up leaving with a chicken & bean burrito enchilada style in my tummy.  I thought it was delish!!  Great salsa too,  although they could have been a bit more generous with  the chips.  I think they gave me 6.  Don't expect anything fancy since they serve everything on styrofoam.  I will go back again soon to try other items....
