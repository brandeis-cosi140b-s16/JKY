A clean restaurant with hard working staff and pleasant customer service.  Our food was prepared quickly and looked very good.  Unfortunately,  there just wasn't any flavor to the dishes.  The carne asada had several pieces of tough gristle which was unexpected,  but it was hard to reconcile the appearance and preparation with the absence of the wonderful mixture and bursts of flavor that one associates with mexican cuisine;  the house salsa was the exception and I found it rather tasty.  There were many diners who seemed very happy so the issue may be one of my palate.  Give them a try for yourself as the site and staff are clean and welcoming.  I'll try once again too.
