Upon entering Zapata's, I felt like I was walking to a Chi-Chi's, which was a special occasion back home in Va Beach when I was a lil evil monster because of my dad's dislike for indigestion-causing foods and chains.  Brightly painted walls and interior decorations made it feel like an Americanized version of a Mexican villa.  Nice digs, it was kitschy homey.  

Located over by the burger joint in Ballantyne that shan't be named (bleh), I headed here for an after work meal that was going to require cheese dip.  And cheese dip was had ($4.50).  Creamy and very good, served with substantial chips that held up to the dipping, but I was quickly filling up on.  The table salsa was cilantro-heavy with a kick, so I passed on that.  

My entree order was a General Combo, which is a pick 2 combo that I chose a chimichanga and a taco for, both beef.  The combo comes with rice and beans ($11).  The beef was over-seasoned - the first thought was too salty, but it wasn't just salt.  And not over-seasoned meaning spicy - just too much stuff that overwhelmed everything.  I poured what was left of my queso on everything and ate what I could.  The rice was typical mexican joint rice, as was the beans, though the beans had a little more flavor than most places, almost a little smoky - but in general the same rice/bean taste as Azteca, Monterrey, etc. 

The service was exceptional (it says Hector on my receipt).  He was friendly and attentive, my drink never went empty and he checked on me without aggravating.  Overall a good experience, but nothing extraordinary.
