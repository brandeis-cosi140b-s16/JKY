I'm excited to finally have a casual and affordable place to eat in the hood!  I walked up there this morning for a delicious chorizo burrito and I wasn't disappointed.  The person working the register was very friendly and actually funny too.  
I will say when I've been there in the past they've seemed a bit scattered but not this time.  
Just hoping they'll stick around a while.
