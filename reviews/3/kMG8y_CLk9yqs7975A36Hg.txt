I haven't been to many Mexican restaurants in the area, so I don't know what the standards are for authenticity around here, but this is a very stereotyped Mexican restaurant.  The decor, music, food, everything is not like it is in Mexico, it's like you might think Mexico is like if you've only experienced Mexico from Epcot and old movies.  The food isn't bad, but it's not great either...and there is A LOT of food.  So it's a great value if you're hungry and definitely edible.  They have a few items that aren't found in most such places so that's good, but I'd guess that if you wanted Mexican food it wouldn't matter if you chose this place or one of the other equivalent places around here.
