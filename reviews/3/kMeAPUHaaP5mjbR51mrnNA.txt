Stopped in by chance, after not being able to find another restaurant in the area. There were quite a few cars in the lot and people eating outside. Found out it was 99 cent taco Wednesday. I was going to try a few tacos, but they only had the special for hard shell, not soft tacos, so I went for the carnitas. 

You order through a small window and then wait for the food to be done. There is no table service. Food was priced well, but the portions were not large. I had enough carnitas meat for two tacos only and the rice and beans were maybe 3/4 of a spoon full. The flavor overall was average at best. The salsa was bland.
