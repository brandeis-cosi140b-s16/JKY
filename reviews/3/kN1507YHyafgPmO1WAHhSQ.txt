My latest meal at Loco Lime kicked off by checking in on Yelp and getting 10% off our bill. Boom.

Pretty standard menu here. I do not have a go-to order.... think I get something different every single time. I do love the option of three different sauces (green tomatillo, red citrus chili, white queso) for the enchiladas. I recommend ordering all three together with the barbacoa (soft shredded beef). The menu also has a nice selection for vegetarians.

Specials you need to know about:

-Margarita Mondays: Half price, rocks or frozen. Like a little heat? The jalapeno margarita is fantastic.

-Taco Tuesdays: $1 tacos. Get there early. Full house every time.

-Kids eat free on Wednesdays. If you do not enjoy children, probably want to skip this night.

-Sundays: $1 tacos in the bar area only. Nice spot to watch games.

The parking lot here is kind of awkward. Sometimes it's difficult to get in and out when it's busy. Great patio. Very spacious and dog friendly.
