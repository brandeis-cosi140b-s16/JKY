It was 10pm on a Sunday night. We'd been unpacking and cleaning and moving all weekend. Our goal had been to cook our first meal together in our new place that night, but, um...you know, the best laid plans... We're ravenous and everything's closed! Qdoba to the rescue. Kind of.

Our burritos, while delicious, were hastily built. In the car ride home, one of the burritos unrolled, split open, spilled grease and hot sauce on the passenger seat. Oh well. Appetite rules and once it was in our tummies, who was to be the wiser? The fajita veggies in the burrito were fresh, the sauce was perfectly spicy, and we didn't go to bed hungry. Goodnight!
