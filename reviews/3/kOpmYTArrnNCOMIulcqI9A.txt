Unlike most Mexican restaurants, this one is not especially vegetarian friendly.  The only thing I could find on the menu on a recent visit was a bean and cheese burrito.  Pretty standard burrito in a great tortilla.  Unfortunately, I left feeling decidedly "lardy."

I've heard that the carne asada and pastor tacos are great. 

Having been to both:  I do like the downtown location much more than the Tempe location.
