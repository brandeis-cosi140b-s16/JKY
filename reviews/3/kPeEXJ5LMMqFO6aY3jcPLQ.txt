Our server Tom was fantastic.  We sat on the patio, and with some pleading they turned off the misters since the weather was pleasant and the table was getting wet.  I started with a margarita, was going to have it on the rocks but was told that the frozen was a better "kick".  So I went with that.  YUM!  Good call Tom.

I ordered the meatloaf.  Weird I know but it sounded good with the chorizo and stuff.  It was delicious.  But the biggest surprise was how tasty the Sticky Rice was.  I thought it was going to be a pile of white sushi rice, which didn't make sense, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It was savory and yummy, only complaint is that it could have been served warmer.

Happy we went, and I expect I will be going again.
