Food is ok i had the corn chowder, the chicken tacos... It was not expensive... The two salsa were ok... I've read some reviews this is very good place - ok. Not my taste. I'll come back and give it another shot. Wait staff nice again they were fine... Nothing to shout about nor can I really complain
