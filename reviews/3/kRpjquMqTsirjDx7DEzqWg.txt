Overall the prices of this place was really reasonable with large portions. The food was good but not amazing. The server was a doll but the atmosphere of the restaurant seemed a little run down and dirty.

I think the only reason I didn't love this place is because I had high expectations for this place! 

I can not get over how dirty this place looked. I ordered the lettuce wrapped with Bulgogi and again although an interesting concept, the food was not amazing.
