Drive by here all the time. Close to work. Outside is a little iffy. Easy to drive past. Inside is a pleasant surprise with interesting tidbits hanging on the walls creating a fun atmosphere. Free chips arrive at the table with both red and green salsas. Ordered the Carne Adovada Burrito with the Xmas tree toppings of both green and red chili sauce. It also came with beans and rice. A mouth full of flavors all at once. Reminded me of what we call "Tex Mex" style back in TX but with the flavors of New Mexico. Definitely spicy which I enjoy. Expected the layering of flavors and textures to pop a little more. I hear each location is a little different. Gets really busy fast at lunch. Undaley!
