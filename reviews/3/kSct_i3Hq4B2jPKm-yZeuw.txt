I'm writing this review for two reasons....
1. There is no drive-thru here
2. It's 24hr (are all Roberto's 24hr?)

So, know that if you come here, you have to leave your car (gasp!), but their doors will always be open (there aren't many 24hr 'fast food' joints open in this area). This particular location is clean and has about 10 tables inside. I've never seen more than 2 tables being used. Taco Tuesday is $1 beef tacos (max 12). 

That being said, it's Roberto's. It tasted just like every other Roberto's. You can find a better version of everything on their menu somewhere else in this city. The question is, can you find it at 3am...
