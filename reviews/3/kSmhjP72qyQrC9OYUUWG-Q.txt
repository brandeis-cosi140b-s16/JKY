It was late at night on The Strip, we had been wandering around for hours and we wanted a place to eat that wasn't too expensive, was casual, but not a dump. Senor Frogs fit the bill pretty well. Although we came just as a torrential downpour occurred, which pushed us from the patio, to the bar to finish eating, the food and service were quite good and the prices reasonable (for Vegas standards). BUT, while we were there there was some sort of singer/karaoke going on. I'm thinking a mixture of the two because we heard one girls' voice for several songs, but every once and awhile some obviously amateur's voice would ring out "I'm too Sexy" or a Spice Girl song.
Problems: First of all, I did NOT sign up for karaoke. We sat AWAY from all of that to avoid it, but the problem was that they have speakers over all the tables, regardless of where you are and they were LOUD! Secondly, the woman singing, who, from what we could gauge over the speakers, worked here, was NOT a good singer. It was like listening to one of those American Idol auditions, where the person thinks they're great, but just sort of yells the song out and no one can be bothered to tell them they suck, because they're not nails on a chalkboard, but they're still not good either.
Sadly, we had to listen to this, even though we were in a totally different room!
I WOULD go back, but not during karaoke!
