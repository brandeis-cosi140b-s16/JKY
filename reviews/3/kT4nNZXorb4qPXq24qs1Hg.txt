This is fast food and its located inside the Palms LV food court so don't expect much :)  We were starving from an early flight and our room wasn't ready yet. Since we all love tacos so this was the logical choice to satisfy the hunger. Pick your protein and toppings...Done.

I got the Al Pastor and Carne Asada. Obviously, the ingredients were pre-prepped, as the server scooped them out of the line....Chipotle style. They warmed the tacos, then stuff the meat and top off with whatever veggies, salsa & sauces you ask for. Surprisingly, the meat fillings were not bad at all. It had flavor but served lukewarm. Service was also pretty friendly and prices didn't break the bank. I can go for another round after a night of drinking :)
