Great place for dinner. The food is absolutely some of the best Mexican food I have had. The service, unfortunately, was terrible. My appetizer didn't come out until after I received my entree. My drink stayed empty more than it was filled for most of my meal. My server passed my table four or five times and then stood around with his hands in his pocket and I am staring like when are you going to fill my drink. If the server staff was as good as my meal this would definitely be a five star experience.
