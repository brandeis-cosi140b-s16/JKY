It's over rated. I like how the ingredients are fresh and that you can actually taste the fresh onions, even though I hate onions (hey it's the freshness i'm talkin' about) It's like a subway but in mexican form. I wanted to order two but since it was a line like kinda deal I was hesitant to even ask for another.

I ordered a chicken burrito and the way they made it seemed like it was half a burrito..like a square shaped burrito and not the usual rectangular shape which made me think I was jipped. 

I'd eat there again but it's nothing to go crazy over for.
