The service isn't bad, the food is okay.  What I find disappointing is they do not have a lot of vegetarian options for breakfast.  The refried beans are made with lard, which I cannot eat, and the only way to get a veggie omelet is to order a cheese omelet and add vegetables for an additional $1.99.  I dont know if it's good as I'm not paying $10 for it.  Unfortunately, they're pretty much the only game in town for breakfast,  and they know it.
