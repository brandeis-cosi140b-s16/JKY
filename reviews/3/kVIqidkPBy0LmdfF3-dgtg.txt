Mucho Taco was ok.  It was nothing unforgettable; in fact, I'd forgotten about it.  While reading Andrew S's review I got to the part about his gf's Chimichanga, and I did a double take because I hadn't realized I'd been with him  for the experience in question.

As mushy as the chimichanga was, it had good flavor.  I'd give the place another chance, and probably get a burrito.  My only other complaint is what seemed like an unnecessarily long wait to get our take-out order.  

Located next to a Goodwill and in the same strip as several other small businesses, this place is easy to miss.  I probably wouldn't miss it if I weren't to retuurn, but it's decent enough if I needed some Mexican food nearby.
