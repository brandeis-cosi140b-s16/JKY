Doña Maria's is a classic family-style Mexican restaurant, from the grey vinyl booths to the "cantina" inspired decor. From the outside it doesn't look like much...a squat, dusty building with bars on the windows. Yet, considering that it's been around since 1980--practically Biblical times in Vegas years--you know it's probably pretty decent. 

I arrived for happy hour at 4:00, walking from the nearby bus stop. Other reviewers have (accurately) described the neighborhood as dicey, but it's perfectly fine in the afternoon. I ordered a jumbo lime margarita for $4.95 which was roughly the size of my head. It was far from a masterpiece, but certainly got the job done!

The chips & salsa were fair--chunky corn chips in a thick, fruity salsa. I followed up with a bean & cheese burrito. In addition to being one of my favorite dishes, it's a surprisingly reliable benchmark of quality. It arrived, somewhat alarmingly, in two minutes. The presentation was straight out of 1983, replete with the decorative lettuce and tomato garnish that inexplicably accompanies Mexican platters. It was fairly tasty--dripping with melted jack-- and I nibbled for about an hour as I emptied my glass. 

Apart from happy hour, it's not especially cheap. with a la carte lunch entrees in the $10 range and seafood dishes exceeding $17. While hardly outrageous, I personally expect a bit more individual attention and detail for these prices. Nonetheless, I'll probably return to Doña Maria's and write up a full review of their eponymous tamales.
