I love the food from cafe Rio but I have not had very good service at this location. I went in with a coupon, as did everyone else, and at 5:30 on a Friday night they were out of everything you could get without paying for an up charge. The woman in front of me complained about having to pay when they were out of what she wanted and the manager refused to allow a substitution. That defeats the purpose of sending out a coupon. It brought you the business and then you squashed any chance of getting repeat business when your service is like that!!
