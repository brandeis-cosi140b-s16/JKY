I've been going to Roberto's for so many years. Not a lot has changed except the prices! If you want yummy mexican fast food that is a better then Taco Bell this is your place. They have drive thrus and most are open 24 hours. 

I've always liked them for a late night meal. Some of my favorte things to get are the Carne Asada Nachos, a Chicken Chimichunga and cheese enchiladas. I also enjoy their menudo on the weekends. 

Roberto's is yummy for sure! It's a clean location and has friendly staff. The salsa bar is  always stocked and has fresh salsa. If you've never been your missing out!
