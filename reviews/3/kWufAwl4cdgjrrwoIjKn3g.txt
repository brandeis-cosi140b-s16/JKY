I saw my review from a while back and thought to add a few NEW positive thoughts to be fair!  We've eaten here many times since.  This is a very clean "Bertos" restaraunt!  The food is ok, others would say very good...I like some other places better! The service is good now.  Its close to home and I have no complaints.  This place has definitiely improved over time... well done Federicos!
