This place is literally across the street from my house. Which is the ONLY reason I eat there (as rare as it is).  The Fat Burrito is like a dumbed down version of Chipotle.  It has a line cook that makes your big ass burrito to order and then you pay for it at the end of the line.  Truth be told, the burritos are decent.  Nothing exceptional, but decent.  The Chicken Quesadilla's are made by folding a huge tortilla in half, and the nachos are from homemade chips (that look like they were cooked a week prior)...

The place is clean and the cook/owner is a humongous guy.  He's cheery and funny, and almost makes you forget the fact that his place is mediocre.  I have never had a bad trip.  Then again, I have never had an exceptional trip either.

I give this the dreaded "Meh" seal of mediocrity.
