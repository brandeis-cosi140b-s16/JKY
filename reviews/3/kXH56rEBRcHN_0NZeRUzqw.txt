not super authentic at all, chips are soo good, but salsa is kind of weird but still good. I dont know why but old people love this place! I like the chips with queso dip for apps then chicken enchaladas, classic but really good! Friendly hosts but waiters could know more about the product! over all I think it gets lost in the many mexican restaurants in AZ, and higher prices for the same food.
