Oh sh***#!! --It's Christmas Eve at 7:27pm and my brother and I still haven't decided where we're going out for dinner... We've been debating what kind of food, how fancy etc for 45 minutes. I'm picky and have diet restrictions. He loves meat which I don't so much. The kids are just flat out hungry! He's local and I'm not, so finally I just ask him to pick a good Mexican food restaurant. He calls Manuel's and they tell him they're only seating till 8pm. Let's go!

We arrive at 7:50 and the hostess immediately says "we're not seating anymore." I reply that we just called and were told they seat till 8, and that's why we came. After she goes in back, our party of 5 was seated --5 minutes after we arrived. 

The food was not bad, but it was a bit expensive for what we got. I had vegetable fajitas with shrimp added which put mine around $15. The fajitas were good and came with whole pintos which had great flavor but were a bit crunchy. The regular salsa was sweet, and the hot was all pepper. Wallace gets them three stars: he was professional and patient ("up to a point" as he told me). When we arrived every seat except ours was full. When we finished at 8:45, we were the only ones there. Before Wallace brought the check he even asked if I wanted another beer or if we wanted dessert! That's saying a lot on Christmas Eve. I'd definitely give them another try.
