I just realized this Chipotle was open in the old Qdoba space so during my lunch hour I decided to grab a to-go order to take back to the office. It wasn't until I arrived and checked in that I saw the bad reviews of this location. 

I decided based on some of the previous reviews to order a bowl & asked for my salsa on the side, which they were happy to oblige.

I think they have been trying to train people a little better since the grand opening because the folks making my food seemed to be doing an ok job. The kitchen seemed a little chaotic and the "assembly line" could use a little better flow...but it wasn't as bad as I expected based on the reviews when they first opened.

So while this location  may still have a few small kinks to work out, it seems like they are headed in the right direction. I will definitely going back to give them another try later on.
