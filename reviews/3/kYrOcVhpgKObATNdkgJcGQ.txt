Manuel's personifies Mexican food in Phoenix--Nothing amazing, but very satisfying nonetheless.

Manuel's simply has a huge variety of items including the Americanized treats that are cheese crisps and chimichangas, and all are prepared effectively, if not spectacularly.

Is it a Mi Nidito, El Charro, or La Parilla Suiza, three mainstays of the Tucson Mexican food scene? No way, no how. But if you're in Phoenix, alas there isn't much of that caliber to choose from. Manuel's has several locations in Phoenix, so they're convenient, the service is usually pretty good, and the food quality is consistent and generally quite satisfying.

With realistic expectations, a pretty reliable choice for (Phoenix) Mexican food.
