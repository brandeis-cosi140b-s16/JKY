If the wait across the street at Azteca is too long, wander over to Tres Pesos. Bright colors and attentive service, I was pretty pleased with the meal I enjoyed here. And you certainly can't beat the price!

I can't agree with previous reviews of the salsa. While it wasn't the way I would make it, the salsa I was served was large-ish chunks of tomato and small pieces of onion and spices. Yes, there was a good amount of water in the bottom, but the stuff above the waterline was spicy and hit the spot with the chips while I waited for my entree.

My margarita was massively huge though I'd say it probably only had one pour of tequila in it. I've never had one served with an orange and a cherry on the rim before. Weird.

The "two enchilada combo" also comes with a scoop of Mexican rice and a cute fried corn tortilla bowl of refried beans. It was satisfying, for being "Americanized" Mexican food.

Would I come here again? Sure, why not.
