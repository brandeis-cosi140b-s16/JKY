Nice clean atmosphere set in s newly remodeled strip msll. Service on a Friday night was quick and friendly, maybe because I was one of 2 tables with guests at 7 pm. Could it be the food, I had to ask myself as the parking lot was full. Ordered the carne asada torta and my friend ordered a green chili burro deep fried enchilada style. The food arrived surptisinly fast, it almost beat our water drinks. I will start with my torta, the carne was almost cooked to crisp leather and chopped fine to maybe disguise it. The roll was tossted nicely but the rest made it the worst torta I have ever tried to consume. My friend let me taste her burrito which was very good. I gave up on the torta and claimed half of my friend's burro. The green chili and service raised my rating to 3 stars but the torta might explain all the empty seats on this Friday night.
