Mexican and Chinese are both delicious so of course one would expect them to be delicious together.  Therefore I decided to stop here on a recent trip to AZ.  Kind of a divey feel to the restaurant but that's ok, I don't mind.  Also - I love the Mexican Panda mascot!  So as I said, it is not a super nice place.  You walk up to the counter and place your order then have a seat in a almost cafeteria style room.  I ordered the pollo diablo with the jerk style rice.  When I got the bowl I thought it looked a little small but it was actually quite filling.  The meat was actually spicy which makes me happy and the rice was pretty good.  The prices were good so overall it was an ok lunch.
