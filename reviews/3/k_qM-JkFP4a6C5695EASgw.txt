I really hate writing follow up reviews that aren't as stellar as the first, however, in this case I have no choice. 

I took the parents here for a Sunday lunch this past weekend, and had a very underwhelming experience, service side only. *FOOD WAS AWESOME* Per usual, but the service was seriously lacking. I am not sure if it was because we didn't fit in to the usual hipster crowed, OR if our server was tired from a busy brunch service, either way unacceptable. 

First the hostess was very nice and sat us sooner than we were quoted. We were hungry so that was awesome. We first got a drink and an appetizer from the bar while we waited. The bartender was in no hurry to make anyone's drinks so we had to wait a few minutes for her to get herself together, ok though because they tasted so good once we got them we forgot all about the wait, bloody marys and sangria! Then when we sat down the waiter seemed a little upset that we already had a first round of drinks and an appetizer. A bit rude, but we let it go. It's not like we were planning to just sit there and not order anything else. He never really smiled, nor seemed interested in serving our table. We might have seemed a bit high maintenance to him, as we had to ask for several things every time he was at the table, but if he got the order right and listened the first time we wouldn't have had to. Our second round of drinks took forever from the bar, not sure who's fault that was. 

All in all the food and drinks were great, but left feeling a little unwanted and unwelcomed, no we didn't have pink spiky hair or were same sex orientated, but the $100 we spent on a simple lunch should have been enough for them to make us feel welcome. Better luck next time I hope.
