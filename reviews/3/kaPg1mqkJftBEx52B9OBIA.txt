we've been several times and the food while good-is never consistent. Last night we did have a very nice waitress who saw that in our party of 4 adults we also had a 20 month old-she brought out his food first.  Great service.

My sister in law and I had the tilapia burritos special-mine was "altered" due to food allergies, but we were both in agreement that it was pretty tasty.  the nachos my husband ordered were given w/ a challenge to finish them.  don't know how he did it!

Our daughter had the taco salad and said it was really good.
