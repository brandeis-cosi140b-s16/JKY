Time for an update.  This Taco Bell is located right off the 101 and is very convenient when I'm on the go.  Since my last review, they discontinued the Cheesy Beans & Rice Burrito (Boo!), so I've replaced it with just a regular Bean Burrito on my normal order.

The customer service here is good most of the time.  When you employ teenagers, you don't know what you're going to get, so it's always inconsistent...but they do a good job for the most part.  They've always got my order right and served it up fast.  What more could I ask for?
