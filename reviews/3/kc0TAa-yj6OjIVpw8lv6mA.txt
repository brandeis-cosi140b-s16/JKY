This dos is pretty great for a quick lunch when you're on campus but you don't want to eat lunch on campus, especially for habitual beckman cave people like myself.  I had the enchiladas nortenas today and have no regrets.  

It does get crazy nuts busy during lunch, full of beckman faculty and grad students and other individuals who occasionally have seen the sun in the past six months. 

I can't really tell the difference between dos, el toro, and el torero, but this dos is at least as quick, cheap, and tasty at stuffing almost unidentifiable white cheese into various starches and serving them PIPING!  HOT! as the other mexican restaurants in town.
