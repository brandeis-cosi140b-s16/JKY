Personally I find Chipotle, Qdoba, and Panchero's to all be roughly equivalent.  This place happens to be reasonably close to my work and I go there on occasion.  Probably will go there more now that Panchero's has closed.

Anyhow, pretty decent stuff, with the exception that once or twice I have gotten a nice helping of crunchy rice.  Nothing ruins a burrito like undercooked rice.  

I have to agree with another reviewer that going during the lunch rush can be a little stressful.  There are very few seating places (get it to go instead) and the parking situation pretty much sucks, but the line does move quickly.
