The good: food is awesome, staff is friendly, they serve alcohol, cool decor.

The bad: dining and bar are physically separated but they leave the door near the order counter open and thereby creating a disgusting smoke smell when you walk in and are forced to stand in that smell while you order. The order-taking process is really too long. It feels like they have to push too many buttons to make a simple modifier (ie: no cheese).  
Without that gross cigarette smell and with a quicker POS, Wahoo would get 5 stars from me.
