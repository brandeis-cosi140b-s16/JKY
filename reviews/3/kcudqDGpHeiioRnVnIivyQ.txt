I had a fun time last night with my girlfriends here! The drink prices are okay, and the dance floor is always fun! The DJ likes to play a lot of techno, but later on in the night he was playing some good, older hip hop music! I had a good time and the bouncers are pretty nice too. Overall, a good place to dance and have an awesome Friday or Saturday night.
