Had the chicken machaca.  I thought it was pretty good, but I wouldn't call it great.  So, it's a pretty good burrito for $6.50.  it came with some tortilla chips and they gave me a couple of salsas for the chips and the burro.

It's an attractive restaurant, with lots of cool visual details.

I'll probably go back to try something else on the menu.  They have a big menu, so there are lots of choices.  But based on the chicken machaca alone, I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Revo again.
