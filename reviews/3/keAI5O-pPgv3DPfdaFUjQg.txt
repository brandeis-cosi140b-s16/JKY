I am not a big Chinese food person, but I pretty much loved everything I tried here. For the life of me I could not tell you what half of the things were called, but I do remember that the best thing I had was
Chicken Ji Song , which was chicken in a sweet sauce of some kind on a lettuce cup topped with shredded sweet potato. It was amazing. I would have never thought to try a place that entailed Chinese and Mexican foods, but I am glad I was invited to try it. 

The service was great as well and the drinks were really good. One of the most creative ideas I have seen in awhile is the straws were wrapped in a green onion shoots.
