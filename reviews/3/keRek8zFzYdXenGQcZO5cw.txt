To start I think it's only fair for me to say that for my fresh-mex fix, I tend to prefer Zabas.   Only if convenience plays a role in my choice will I go to Chipotle.  SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL BUSINESSES PEOPLE!

With all that being said, this Chipotle recently opened within walking distance from my work.  Naturally I offered to pay a co-worker to go pick some up because heaven forbid I get some exercise.   I was happy to see this location offers online ordering so that I didnt have to even use my vocal chords in order to get food to my mouth.  2012!   I ordered a Burrito Bowl with Barbacoa, opted for Brown Rice (which I dont believe is available at all chipotle locations, so bonus), black beans, both medium salsas, and guacamole.  The online system said it'd be ready in about 30 minutes.   40 minutes later I was presented my food and on my first bite I noticed it wasn't very hot and the guacamole had lost some of his texture due from being with the rest of the food for what seemed like a while .   This is one of my pet peeves with online ordering in that I THINK some use a default timing system of when the food will be ready, but the employees might just start making it immediately.   So if they tell you 30 minutes, your food often sits out getting cold for 10-15.   Temperature issues aside, the food tasted about what I expect from Chipotle.  The baracoa was spiced nicely and the salsas and rice tasted fresh.  I also ordered a bottled water and was displeased to see a bottle of Arrowhead when it was delivered.  As you all probably know, Arrowhead is disgusting.  Next time I will order a Nantucket Nectar instead, or have them just pour their pinto bean juice in a jar as that'd be more refreshing than Arrowhead.

So on one visit, nothing to really set it apart from any other Chipotle experience I've ever had, and I'm sure I'll be going there often if I'm ever in a time crunch for lunch.

Now if only we could get a Zabas near here...
