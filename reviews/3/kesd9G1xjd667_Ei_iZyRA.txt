I wish I could give more stars because the food was certainly worth it.....but the restaurant staff just wasn't friendly.
walked in Sunday afternoon....it wasn't very busy at all. I greeted the hostess she hardly even acknowledged I spoke to her let alone I had two people with me.
we were promptly sat but had to wait a while for someone to even come over to us. We were first given the chips and salsa (delish) but no water or beverage....i hate eating salsa without water...what if the salsa is too spicy???
We waited about 5 more minutes before Ramon (our waiter) came over to us...thank GOD he had a personality. we ordered Queso Laredo and table side guacamole...the lady who came over to make our guac had zero personality....I tried to joke with her and talk with her and ...nothing! She did make good guacamole!! Our queso cam out and it was good as well....how can you go wrong with CHEESE!!
We ordered our entrees....I was happy to see they had a brunch menu...it includes a mimosa or bloody maria (I wish it would include a margarita....that's what we were drinking)
I had the Migas con huevos (a scrambled egg dish that had jalapenos, bacon, and tortillas in it) I added cheese to it (doesn't all mexican food need cheese) and the added 1.45 to the bill....really I wasn't spending enough money???
My husband had the salmon we said it was very good...it came with some sort of rice and myf riend had the ensalada de cilantro pollo...it was a beautiful looking and large salad...she said it was good as well.
Margaritas!!! (the whole reason i wanted to go) we ordered skinny margaritas and had them add jalapeno for a little spice....they were very good...in a tall and skinny glass....we only had one each (not sure if I was too full from the food).
The food is very good...Ramon was a good waiter....the restaurant needs a more fun vibe....I will go back I love the location and like I said food was great!
