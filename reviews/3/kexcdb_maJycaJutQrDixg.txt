For my anytime I crave a carne asada burrito or carne asada fries. Roberto's is here! Open 24 hours a day, you can get your fix the way you like it now or later! Based off San Diego...this franchise is like the McDonalds of authentic Mexican fast food.  They are on all sides of town...from eat in restaurants to small take out only gas station corners...so they are practically everywhere.  Be aware of some copy cats...some just plain dont get at this level. But also know there are a few others that do justice, and sometimes even better than Roberto's....

This location borderline of Summerlin is clean and safe.  It's a small take out only shop, so it can get cold or hot outside depending  on the time of day and season of the year you choose to fulfill your craving.

  If out door dining is your thing and the weather is complying, one may feast at the patio tables....about 3 tables with 4 chairs each. Hardly anyone sits there so it should be ample enough.  The huge windows up front are nice and you can see them cook your food...so that's great as well. 

Like I said there are tons of Roberto's across town...but this place i can vouch for that delivers on quantity and quality for what it is. It is quick and convenient and call me biased but it is a 1 minute drive away from my house.  If you are ever in the area, want something quick, don't mid take out and Roberto's is your thing ...  You can trust this place. NoM NoM goodness! Arriba!!!
