Customer Service : There is something about the people that work here that make me not want to come here. They make it seem like customers are annoying when asked a question. The first time I went here the girl was getting annoyed because I did not know what anything came with(even though I explained that I had never been there). I gave it another chance and it's the same thing. They just start putting stuff on there and when my friend asked for shredded lettuce instead, the woman rolled her eyes.

Food: The food is delicious.  I have only tried the chicken burrito and chicken salad and both are wonderful. There are plenty of choices to customize it but still very yummy. It has different taste profiles than other similar restaurants like chipotle. The portions are large for the price and the food is still yummy if finished later in the day.

The environment: The actual restaurant is interesting to look at and offers plenty of seating indoor and outdoor.
