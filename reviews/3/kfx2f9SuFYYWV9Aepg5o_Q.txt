An old-school taco truck, packed with FIVE employees cooking up food for the crowds- no exaggeration. I found this spot not because the truck itself is brightly lit or anything, but because the whole parking lot is full of parked cars and trucks with families chowing down. 

We ordered five different tacos and a quesadilla. Pricing is good, ~$2/taco and $6 quesadilla. I appreciated that the portions were generous and the meats were not greasy. However, the meats tasted very similar- the al pastor and lengua were our favorite, everything else tasted more or less the same. Quesadilla had tons of cheese. Salsas are either very spicy (especially the verde) or not spicy at all (the creamy avocado sauce).

This location is clearly very popular, but perhaps we just didn't order the best dishes. Note that there is also a hotdog cart in this parking lot. If you don't care for the tacos here, there are three more taco restaurants (also open late) in the next block.
