I have been eating at both the north hills location along with the one in south side since either have opened and I have to say that the food has gone down hill. My boyfriend and I really wanted good Mexican food but we both have different ideas of what that means. I like food that reminds me of what my great grandmother would make and he likes Tex-Mex (anywhere that puts cheese on their tacos) Emiliano's seemed like a good compromise. He ordered the shrimp taco salad and I got shrimp Vallarta. We also shared some guacamole. The guacamole was good and made table side. My boyfriend's salad looked pretty tasty to me but he was not impressed. The shrimp Vallarta was extremely disappointing. It tasted like a plate of shrimp covered in ketchup. I know that the sauce should have a similar taste profile because of the ancho and vinegar. But, this was almost as is if they cooked shrimp and poured a bottle of sacred Heinz all over. It was not good.
