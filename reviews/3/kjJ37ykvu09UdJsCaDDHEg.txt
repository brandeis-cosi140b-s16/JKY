I really wanted horchata, so when my boyfriend and I were driving around for lunch, I searched on Yelp for a Mexican restaurant and decided on this place. The man behind the counter was nice and just said to let him know when I was ready to order, since I was still waiting for my bf to come inside. I decided on the chicken enchiladas and horchata, and my bf got a burrito. The chips and salsa they brought out before were tasty, and my horchata was good was well (free refills if you get a large!). My enchiladas were okay, but my boyfriend devoured his burrito and said it was really good, so I guess I'll have to try that next time.
