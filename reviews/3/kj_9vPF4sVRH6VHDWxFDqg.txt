I'm in the same boat as Shannon N. San Felipes will always hold a special place in my heart, not because I've been coming here since the very beginning, but because I (drunkenly) asked my boyfriend out in the parking lot. 

Romantic right? Nothing says "I like you" quite like dancing on the bar's stripper pole to an AC/DC song, breaking your shoe, and then slurring out "So are we doin' this or what?"

This little story is told to really illustrate the strength of their drinks. I only had an AMF, a grapefruit shot, and a Long Island Iced Tea and I was ready to commit crimes. They used to have $0.75 shots from 9-11pm, but now they have $1.01 well drinks on Wednesdays.

This isn't the greatest place, but the food, service, and drinks are decent. The crowd at the Desert Ridge location is a little older, but there is always a party here after 11pm. 

And who knows, you might just get a girlfriend out of the deal!
