I have been wondering about this place for a while and have finally had the opportunity to stop by for lunch.

The menu was nice and simple so it wasn't hard to make choices and things come out in small portions, so it's best to order several things at once if possible.

First up were the shumai: traditional (shrimp and pork), scallop (pork, bamboo, mushroom), and beef. The traditional and the scallop were good but similar in taste. The traditional had some gold leaf on top and the scallop was topped with tobiko. The beef wasn't too appetizing for me. The flavor combination of whatever was in the beef didn't work for me. 

Next up were some tacos and the Chinese street sandwich. For the tacos we had fish barbacoa, carnitas and silencio. They were all just a little better than the tacos at a traditional taco stand. The duck tongue was a nice spicy treat that you don't usually see.

Definitely something you have to try once.
