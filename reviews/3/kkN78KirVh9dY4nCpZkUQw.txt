To start, the server was less than energetic. The salsa was very plain. The chips?  where not so good and very skimpy for a family of 4.  We had to ask for more 3 times, each time it came back half full.  The beer was about 55 degrees.  I had the Cuco's burrito, very average tex-mex, better than Taco J's or the bell.  I should give them 2 stars but I'm giving them the benefit of being an "off" night for them.
