Order to go!  Definitely authentic and they don't speak much English.  But the service is friendly.  They even let me try the barbacoa when I asked what it tasted like while looking over the menu.  The flavors in their tacos really come through.  Chicken tacos are spicy all by themselves, and the guacamole is very simple, mostly avocado and lime juice.

But I will throw in a few dings for the table seating which consists of metal fold up chairs, booth seats that are all torn up, and there was even a rusty nail sticking out of the side of one of them.  But the booths are still the best way to go if you insist on dining in.  

The cuts of meat could be a lot better.  This is not going to become a regular place for me because I'm picky.  But I'll mark it down as an interesting experience and recommend it to anyone who wants to give them a go.  "You should try it, but it's not for me..."
