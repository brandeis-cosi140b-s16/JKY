Good quick fast food, without the fast food calories, many options to have full blown siesta mexican, or go light.  I went light with a salad, very good.   I ding this spot for a couple reasons, no atmosphere at all, and it seems like standard food, nothing super special.  But, its filling and good value.   Would I go back, maybe once every two year, like I do with McDonalds, sometimes I crave it, but not often.
