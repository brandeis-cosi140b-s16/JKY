I had been craving authentic tacos for awhile and decided to give this place a try since my salon is right next door.  First, I guess I should have read the reviews first because it is very similar to Robertos which is not what I wanted.  I ordered the asada taco, the carnitas taco and a pastor taco and an horchata.   The horchata was like drinking water and sugar, very little flavor.  The Carne asada and carnitas tacos were ok, but the pastor taco was not that good.  I would recommend if you want robertos but if you are looking for authentic tacos...nope not it
