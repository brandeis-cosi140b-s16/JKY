I went here BC of the reviews. 
I don't understand the 4-5 stars
When I first walked in to the simi large open and cold room there was one couple at a small table. I wanted to leave as it should have been crowded at dinner time with great reviews. It was like sitting in an enclosed patio, Zero atmosphere. We gave it a try and found the 5 start guacamole GREAT! I usually judge a mexican restaurant by the salsa. This was thin, no flavor and just spice hot. I did finish the salsa and chips though because I went for the $5 special and the two little enchiladas may have been enough for lunch but not dinner. The food was "okay" 
but nothing to rave about. The young girl that waited on us was obviously a family member which is fine and she was very nice but no training.

My opinion; "We can cook Mex food, let's open a restaurant and have all our friends and family give us 5 stars".

Very disappointed, we should have great Mex food in Las Vegas but, I'm still looking.
