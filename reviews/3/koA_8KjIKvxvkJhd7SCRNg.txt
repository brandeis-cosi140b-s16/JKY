The food is good but they close the dining room way too early. More than once we have come to eat and went across the street to KFC or McDonalds because the dining room is closed. Tonight it was locked up BEFORE 9:00. Ourselves and two other families just left and ate somewhere else. I am just going to stop coming to this Taco Bell at all.
