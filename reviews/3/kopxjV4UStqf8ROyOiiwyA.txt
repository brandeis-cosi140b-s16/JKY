This place is ok at best, I think that most of it buiness is probably generated that it's fast non chain Mexican food through a drive thru. But overall the novelty of it does not extend over the mediocre food. Been here twice and wasn't blown away either time. Worth checking out if your bored with all other "fast" but this more than likely won't be a place you go out of your way to visit.
