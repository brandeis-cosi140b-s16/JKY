Pepe's is like one of those spots you want to stop by for a late night bite to hit that late night craving.  The carne asada plate was solid, definitely got a hearty portion of meat in addition to the fixings, beans, and rice.  

As for service, I didn't have any issues with the staff.  The cashier was friendly and the food was ready in a very reasonable time with a few customers ahead of me with orders.  All in all, it hit the spot for that late night craving and would come back again.
