Before I start writing this I have to say I do not know that much about mexican food.  I know about mexican american food.  So first off, it was the middle of the afternoon when I came into this place and the waitress seated us right away and water along with drinks orders were placed immediately.  I appreciate that anywhere because sometimes you just need a glass of water.  The selection seem simple enough when looking at the menu.  I ordered cheese enchiladas and the old man ordered soft tacos which came with beans and rice.  There was a soup that came that seemed tomato based with strips of pasta in it.  It was actually flavorful.  Chips, salsa, and guacamole also came right away.  It wasn't the best but it certainly was flavorful and the bill was decent enough.  For a little hole in the wall mexican place I was impressed.  Would definitely come here again for another quiet lunch date.
