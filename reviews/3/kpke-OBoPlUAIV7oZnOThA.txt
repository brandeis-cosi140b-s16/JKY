Supermex is a pretty decent place. I know a few people who don't like it , but considering these are the people who go to fast food all the time I take their opinion with a grain of salt.

If you happen to visit there, you will find that the chips and salsa are all you can eat (Not like Tony's Mexican on Ft. Apache which charges you for refills. I am still bugged by that) 

The food is standard fare Mexican, tacos, enchiladas, burritos, nothing too exotic. The food tastes good and the portions are generous. The few times I have gone there the service was also very quick. 

From the time I ordered to the time the food arrived was less than 10 minutes. I found SuperMex's prices are very reasonable for what you get as well. Now that most the construction is done on Durango its easy to get to now
