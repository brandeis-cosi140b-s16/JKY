I'm a fan of the El Pollo Loco restaurant chain, but this location is not among my very favorites. On this day, for example, they were out of the hottest salsa at their salsa bar. A shipment tomorrow was expected. And the drive-thru was closed. The workers are very nice, but they struggle with special requests. Today, I ended up with both sour cream and guacamole that I had requested be held.

Why keep coming back? The amazingly healthy menu for a fast food joint. They've added to their under 500 calorie menu. Lots of choices (sometimes as many as 10 total) with lots of flavor. I'll definitely be back. The friendly staff will take care of me even if my order is screwed up the first try.
