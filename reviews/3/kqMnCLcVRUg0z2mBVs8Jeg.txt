Tacos Mexico is home to the most average, albeit filling, burrito in the area. 

When you order, they ask if you want 'everything' on the 'rito. I said yes, but I'm still unsure of what everything is. There was no guac. No sour cream. No cheese. Nothing but rice, beans and al pastor. Weird.  For the low price of $5.70, you will leave full, and there's something to be said about that, but unsatisfied as well. My 'rito fell apart after first pickup and was dripping steaming hot 'rito runoff onto my wrist after each bite. Lame. 

It's 24/7, so come here if you have that late night craving. Otherwise, driving 5-min in any direction will yield you a better meal for your bellay.
