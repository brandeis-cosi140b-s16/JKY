Not sure if I have ever eaten here before but I tried it yesterday and it was okay. Had a veggie bowl with white rice, black beans, veggies, salsa and sour cream. It was good but it was lacking some type of flavor like a spice. I also had their tortilla soup and i wish it actually had tortillas strips to give it the crunch but I liked that it was spicy definitely had a kick to it. Service was good, the guy who took my order and prepared it was really nice and funny. Maybe next time i go ill add extra salsa and a dash of salt.
