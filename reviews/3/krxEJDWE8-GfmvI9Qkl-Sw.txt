It's Roberto's. They have locations all over in different states and most people know Roberto's is the place to eat when it's late at night and you are desperate for food. Each location is hot or miss as far as consistency goes. This location is apart of a gas station but you walk up to the window from outside. The portion size here is great. A lot of the menu items can easily be shared. The Carne Asada Burrito is what I order with just meat and cheese. The tortilla this last time was good but the meat was grizzly. I saw a huge block of cheese just sitting out on the counter instead of being in a refrigerated space that didn't look right. I realized after this last visit that with all the other food trucks that offer great Mexican food at affordable prices, I really have no need to come to Roberto's as much.
