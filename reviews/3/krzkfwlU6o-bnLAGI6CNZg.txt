And then they figured I don't speak Spanish. So I order over the phone. They tell me 20 minutes later I show up 20 minutes later and they start when I walk in?! I then ask them how much longer the lady said in a minute... Walks back and says "chingado" telling the chef that I'm waiting and I'm impatient .... Smh I do speak Spanish fluent yet choose not to. A little disappointing BC they were talking about me as I'm waiting right there at the counter. I don't know if I'll come back to this location.
