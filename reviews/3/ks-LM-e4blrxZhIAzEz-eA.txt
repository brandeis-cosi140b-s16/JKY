Ok, I should have known that a restaurant whose full name is 'Abuelo's Mexican Food Embassy' wasn't a good place to come to eat after being in Los Angeles for ten years.   I got excited about an enchilada with shrimp and scallops.  I asked if I could get it without the guacamole and her response was "Then what do you want in it?"  

"What do I want in it?"  Granted I may have been exhausted from lack of sleep and a cramped flight, but I lost all interest in that dish.  My replacement option was ok, Chile Manzanillo with crab, shrimp and scallops, but there was too much cheese/sauce covering up the taste of the seafood.  

It does get a star for not being busy at 7PM.  Granted, I am used to having to wait with other LA diners when I eat out.  There was a lot of space.  

Also, the chips were very thin .... felt like they would break under the weight of the salsa.
