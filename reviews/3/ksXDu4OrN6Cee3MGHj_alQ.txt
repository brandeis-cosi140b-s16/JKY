Don't come to the Steel Cactus and expect to be blown away by quality of food or service. However, I do have to say that I've enjoyed my several experiences here and would recommend this restaurant as a fun place for late night drinks or a Saturday afternoon snack. The drinks that I've had from here have been good, and I've enjoyed ordering the nachos a couple of times.
