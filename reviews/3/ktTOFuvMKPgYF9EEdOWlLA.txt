Came in here for a lunch with some girlfriends. Overall good experience. I love the ambiance and the d√©cor of the place; very gothic chic. The food was alright. We ordered the guacamole... which had zero flavor. This was kind of disappointing for us, because the whole reason we came to Javier's was because we were craving chips and guacamole. Any who, the service was great, the drinks were yummy, I recommend the shrimp tacos with soft shell. Probably will come back again on our next visit.
