Got the taco combination with steak. The taco was good, a bit too much lettuce. Since the taco looked big i figured one was enough since it got rice and beans too. The beans were good i got the pinto. The rice was not, i did not like the taste, and just left it...the staff was friendly, very enthusiastic. But though i was full, i didn't feel satisfied. Overall i may give this place another shot but no rice.
Still better than choipotle.
