With the number of top-notch authentic mexican eateries surround La Hacienda, I don't remember much of my experiences here to be honest. The few times I have been here are because my friends really wanted their meat platter and I am too lazy/tired to disagree with them. 

So that said, their meat platters are good for groups. You get a tonne of meat to share amongst your friends, and it does fill you up significantly. As in most mexican restaurants you get your complimentary serving of chips and salsa upon seating, and feel free to ask for more if you so desire. 

There isn't a whole lot I have to say about them. If I am in the area or if I am looking for mexican food this is not my top choice. There is nothing bad about La Hacienda. They serve decent food, the service is good and the ambience/layout etc is cool. As a matter of fact there is just too much competition around the vicinity. Tough luck...
