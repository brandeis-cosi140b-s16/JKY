I'm an out of towner...east coast that is...so what do I know? I travel alot and rely on yelp for ideas regularly. Craving Mexican type food I found Filiberto's was highly rated and nearby.

I ordered the following:

- Carne Asada taco
- Fish taco
- Green Chile burrito

Long story short....Carne Asada was ok...I mean better then taco bell but not hot & fresh. The fish taco was a total waste of money unless you like cabbage & onions. Now, the Green chile burrito was from a different place. It was hot, fresh, saucy and tasty. Maybe a tad heavy on sodium but hit the spot. So, save your money, get the green chili burrito for $3.72 call it good.
