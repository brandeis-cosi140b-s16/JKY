Garcia's is a festive little place inside a strip mall, neutral beige color outside but an explosion of Mexican colors inside. The amber-filtered lighting in the bar/counter area and booths/tables is a cozy contrast to the adjoining patio, which exudes with sunshine and a hanging decorative bulbs in the evening. I recommend the latter for a nice outdoorsy Fall meal and that you grab a table on a Friday Happy Hour as soon as you get there. I was told the patio could be really crowded and noisy when High School kids from nearby congregate after school.

Greeters and waiters/waitresses were attentive and overall did a good service. Food is average to say the least; they get points for plate presentation but lacks a kick of Mexican flavors that i would normally find at Moreno's. Safe bet to order are the El Grande Fiesta which consists of flautas, chimis and cheese quesadillas, and the fajita quesadilla with chicken which i thought is a decent meal for a reasonable price. The house margarita is ok too but it is not unforgettable. We were there from 5-10 on a Friday and i was really pleased at the casual atmosphere on the patio. The food may not have won me over on my first visit but i'll definitely be giving it a try and be looking for a seat at the patio again.
