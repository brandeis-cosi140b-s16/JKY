Love chipotle...don't be fooled thinking their salad is healthy though. This one is also very very slow. They forget things and I've had to come back on occasion for items I've been charged for and my given. The girl one time offered my a free thing of guac. I told her I wanted a free meal coupon since she charged me and forgot it. It's one thing to not hear someone or forget about it all together, but to charge and not give something is ridiculous.
