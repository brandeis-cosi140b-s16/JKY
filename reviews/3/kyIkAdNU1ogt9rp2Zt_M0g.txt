I didnt expect much from a restaurant off the strip, but I dont think it was all that bad. There was a long wait, but I, like everyone else in the establishment, was drunk, and it didnt really matter. The bar serving drinks stripside was a nice touch and helped me keep the buzz going that would later result and the Patron bath I took later on in the evening.

The service was rather slow, but in its defense it was sickeningly busy. The had a great hot sauce that really kicked the dishes up, but I dont think it came out until someone ordered nanchos or something, I dont remember to much booze.

It is very loud, which personally I like.  It is fairly expensive, but being on the strip, you really cant get away from exorbitant prices
