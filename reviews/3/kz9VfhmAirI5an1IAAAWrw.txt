Middle of the road Mexican fare served VERY quickly.  At least at this Uptown location where the lunch line blazes along.  Middle of the road isn't a bad thing in this case, just exactly what you would expect from a semi-fast food Mexican place with these prices.

I generally stick to two things when ordering.  Crispy Tacos with shredded pork or the Nachos with seasoned ground beef.  With the tacos, eat them quickly or the crispy shells get un-crispy quickly.  For the nachos, whatever you do, don't look up the nutritional info on the website or they will be difficult to enjoy.  if you're into pain/guilt  though, go and just plug in "chips", no other ingredients, and see what the calorie counter shows. For basically any dish, you get choices of salsa (go hot!), beans, rice, queso, cilantro, sour cream, guacamole, etc, etc...

End of the day if you want to leave cube-ville Uptown, don't have much time and want to get filled up with some vaguely Mexican flavored food, Salsarita's is your go to.
