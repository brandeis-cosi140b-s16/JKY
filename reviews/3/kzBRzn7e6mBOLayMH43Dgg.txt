I consider myself truly lucky to live in Arizona, where good Mexican food is very easy to find. Their are a plethora of Mexican fast food places everywhere you look in the Valley, and most of them are miles ahead of any "Mexican" fare you could find in other parts of the country. Alfonso's is a solid choice.

Ok, you will not be wowed by the decor or the ambiance. But you will be satisfied with the food. On this visit, I went with the California burrito and was feeling particularly gluttonous so I added three rolled tacos with guacamole.

The California Burritto was spot on - a FRESH flour tortilla, succulent cuts of carne adasa, veggies, sour cream, and of course - french fries. As someone who grew up in Southern California, I can say that these are up to par with the California burritos I enjoyed in my youth. The rolled tacos were also very good, with a heaping serving of guacamole and cheese.

If I had any complaints, they would be:

1. They are a touch higher than average when it comes to price. ($3.95 for 3 rolled tacos?) With ice tea, lunch was $13. Not crazy expensive, but a bit more that what I'm used to paying for comparable fare.

2. They don't have a salsa bar. They have two varieties - green and red - which they will give you at the counter, but I like trying the different flavors and taking advantage of the jalapenos and spicy carrots that other places offer.

Not huge complaints. Service is friendly and efficient. Free iced tea refills. The food here is solid and I will probably be back.

Enjoy!!
