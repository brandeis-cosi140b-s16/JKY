DISCLAIMER: This review is based on one and only one trip to Chipotle

For literally years, I have heard great things about Chipotle. There never seems to be a Chipotle location close to my work or home though. Recently I had a lunch time appointment just  up the street from this Chipotle so I decided to give them a try.

Chipotle shares a parking lot with numerous other businesses, and the parking lot set up leaves a lot to be desired. I managed to snag the only open spot in front of the store, but can see how the parking situation here could be really aggravating. 

Walking in, I was greeted by what seemed like every employee working and half of the line of customers. The noise level was ridiculous, being a Chipotle virgin I had to respond with 'What?' to every question the employees asked about how I wanted my meal. It got annoying really quickly.

I got my meal and a coworkers meal to go. Total damage for two burrito bowls, nothing else, was over $15! My food was good, but overall I am left rather unimpressed by Chipotle. The menu seemed limited, the prices seemed to be on the high side and the ambiance of this particular location was lacking.... I wouldn't rush back.
