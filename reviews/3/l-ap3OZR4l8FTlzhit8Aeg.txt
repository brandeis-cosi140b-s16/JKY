The food at Ajo Al's is decent and very Americanized.  For those of you who are seeking authentic Mexican food this is certainly not the place.  I have eaten at this location many times over the better part of the past decade, and unfortunately I believe that the quality of the food has been in a gradual decline.  When I started coming here the portions were huge and the quality was consistently good.  More recently the portions have been smaller and the dishes have been less consistent.  In particular, I am a creature of habit so I usually get the chicken enchiladas.  Previously, the chicken enchiladas would have been dominating the plate with their overwhelming size and juicy meat.  More recently the chicken has been dry and the plate has been taken over by the rice and beans.    

The AYCE chips and salsa are a nice touch, but I would prefer paying a little bit more for slightly larger portions and better-cooked food than getting copious portions of chips.
