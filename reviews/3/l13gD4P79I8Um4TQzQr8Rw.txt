When my roommate and I walked into 1900 Mexican, I remember being taken aback by the chic design (especially the chandeliers, OMG I covet the chandeliers) and thinking that I hoped the food and the service were as excellent as the decor because if they were then this was going to be a 5 star experience.

If wishes were fishes we'd all eat well. As it was, we ate passably.

Like many mexican restaurants they started us off with chips and salsa, which came in two forms, standard red and corn. I hoped the latter would wow me, but it was pretty bland. But, hey, it was free.

The drinks, on the other hand, were most certainly not at $9 a piece. I know better than to order anything containing the ingredient "margarita mix" but i let the spirit get the best of me and ended up with a overly sweet cherry drink that may once have made the brief acquaintance of some tequila.

For our entrees, I ordered the Enchiladas Verde and he got the Fajitas de Casa. To their credit, both were so generously portioned that we ended up unable to finish. The chicken in the enchiladas was tasty, but the sauce was bland, especially when I spread the allotment of sour cream over them before realizing it was far too much (and I rarely admit such a situation exists). He enjoyed the mix of proteins in the fajitas but I tried one of the shrimp and found it unpleasant, so the seasoning is for some but not all palettes. Overall, the food wasn't bad, but it was also unremarkable.

The service did meet the standard I had originally expected, with both servers that came to our table being prompt and friendly.

I really did want to be able to write a glowing review of 1900 Mexican, but as it turned out, I won't claim to never be returning, but next time I plan on dropping decent money on Mexican, I am likely to try somewhere else.
