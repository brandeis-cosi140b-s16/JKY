Their Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays specials are still good and the prices went up from $1 to $1.29 or $2.09.  Mondays are bean burritos, Tuesdays are 3 taquitos w/ cheese, both at $1.29; and on Thursdays are cheese quesadillas at $2.09.  They have thicken the refried beans a little which is much better than bean soup.  The prices of their breakfast burritos are still overpriced.  Everything else is still expensive but some of the food is still good.
