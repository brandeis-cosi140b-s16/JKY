Went there in search of a good breakfast burrito. I found one. Food Price was decent for what i got. (Ham, potatom cheese breakfast burrito) The girl behind the counter was friendly to both myself as well as my 3 year old.

The only negative thing I have to say about the food, is the hot salsa was on the mild side, but then it could just be my taste (or lack thereof)

Opt for water, as the soda price is too steep.
