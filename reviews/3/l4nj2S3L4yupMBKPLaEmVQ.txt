The marinated pork was good. My wife had the pork stomach she liked it. The rice and beans were ok good not special.  The salsa was delicious.  The Chile relleno was  very good. The marinated goat was stronger flavored but that's what you would expect. And it was good also. The soft corn tacos that was the base was a little small about 3 big bites per taco and it was gone they were $1.99 each and they threw in some refried beans and chips, and condiments. And they are open 24 / 7)
