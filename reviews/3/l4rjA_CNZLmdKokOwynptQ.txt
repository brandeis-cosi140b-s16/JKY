Baja Fresh was a staple for me in high school, since it was just down the street and right on the way home. I always appreciated how high-quality their chicken was but always thought that the dishes were a little bland. In particular, the salsa bar offerings weren't that flavorful. Lately, it does seem like Baja Fresh is trying to take it up a notch and compete with other chains like Rubio's and La Salsa that are offering more upscale, California-esque things like portobello tacos and salad burritos. I appreciate the innovativeness, but find that despite good-quality ingredients, most of Baja Fresh's dishes haven't changed and are still bland. Oh, and their salsa is still so-so. 

We went for lunch the other day because we had a coupon (buy one new fire-grilled taco combo for $6.99 and get another for $1.99). The combo came with a tropical chicken, blackened shrimp, and a "diablo" steak taco. The shrimp taco was definitely good and the shrimp themselves were good-quality. The chicken taco was also ok, and I really liked the grilled pineapple slice that was tucked inside. The diablo steak was kind of chewy and not that spicy, as the name would suggest. As it had been on previous visits, the salsa was mediocre. We left feeling satisfied and full but not wowed by anything. Next time, I'll probably stick to tacos or burritos and avoid the new dishes.
