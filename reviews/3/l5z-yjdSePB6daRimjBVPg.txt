Qdoba is a chain of restaurants that serves fast, fresh Mexican-inspired food.  As a vegetarian, this is about as close to Mexican food as I can get.  

If you are familiar with Chipotle, then you understand the set-up here: basically, a grown-up cafeteria where you pick the fillings for your burrito or tacos and they build it for you.  There's usually a high turn-over so things stay fresh.  Also, expect large portions at affordable prices.

I hadn't been to Qdoba in a while and couldn't remember why.  After a recent visit back, it all came back to me.

The food was pretty boring.

Not a lot of flavor- not from the rice, the beans, the salsas.  Not bad, just not exciting to eat.

I think I'm going to stick to Zaba's.

Bonus points for coupons, a frequent diner program, a clean store, and friendly employees.
