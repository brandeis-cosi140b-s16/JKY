Living in the Phoenix area, there are no shortage of Mexican food options.  To stand out, you really have to be doing something interesting.  From an aesthetics standpoint, Upward Projects is definitely bringing the goods by creating a Mexican cantina/taco stand with a hip urban vibe.  As for the food?  Well, that could use some work.

Came here on a lunch date on Saturday.  The place was busy, but not totally full.  We elected to sit out on the patio on a beautiful day.  The service we received was prompt and friendly throughout.  Seeing how this is Joyride Taco House we figured we'd find out if the tacos would indeed stand out.  Each of us got the same three tacos:  The Standard (a chicken and avocado mix), Carne Asada, and Shrimp.  The shrimp was good, the carne asada was adequate (though I've had better), and the standard was kind of disappointing.  The biggest letdown for me were the tortillas.  They were very dry and stale tasting.  Did not taste fresh made at all.  My side of Joy Rice with Salsa was also pretty average.

In terms of ambience and service I was not disappointed.  The building looks great with a cool bar area and a great laid back outdoor patio.  Upward Projects has done a great rehab of this old building.  But I've had much better tacos at nearby neighborhood spots like Tacos Atoyac and Gallo Blanco.  If Joyride's tacos can eventually reach that standard or better, then they'll work out just fine.  For now, the quality has room for improvement.
