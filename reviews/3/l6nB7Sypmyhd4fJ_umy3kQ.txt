My waiter was lovely but my food left much to be desired. The food was seasoned decently but it wasn't hot. Very lukewarm. I ordered the carnitas fajitas with refried beans and rice. If it had been hot, I would've given higher ratings because it was seasoned well. But less than warm food doesn't move me.
