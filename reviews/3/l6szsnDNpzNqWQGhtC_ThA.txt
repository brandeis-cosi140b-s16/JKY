I want to give this place more than 3 stars sooooooooooooooooooo bad! Its a part of the new downtown. They have a cool name. And when I asked for some "real hot sauce" they responded with "We're Mexicans, of course we have something spicy enough for you!"
It all sounds great right? Big menu, little bit of everything from authentic to Gringo. But overall, I was majorly let down when it came to the food. 
Pricing, decent. Service, stellar. Food, bland, average and needs work.
I dined here with my boyfriend, and his kids who are 16 and 17. We got a variety of things from chicken tacos, al pastor tacos, carne asada torta, cheese enchiladas, and some chips and salsa. 
First off, chips and salsa were good and so was the side of super hot sauce. The taste lingered for hours, and I would buy it alone if I could. (wait can I?) 
Anyway, the chicken tacos were eh. The al pastor tacos can't compare to any of the tacos on the Q's taco challenge ventures. The carne meat was good, but the torta was a bit spongy. My enchiladas looked like they were about to take the cake, but again, eh. BLAND with no flavor. Stuffed full of cheese, with the potential to be bomb, and just ended up being a disappointment. 
I felt bad because everyone there was so kind and on their game. But I literally wanted to hit a drive thru on the way home. 
Maybe I eat too much Mexican food straight from LA, or maybe I am picky. Probably a bit of both, but either way- takes more than average tacos to impress me.
