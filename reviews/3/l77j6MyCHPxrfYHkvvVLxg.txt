Every time I have visited Ajo Al's (any location) my food has been served up with at least one hair in it. I don't get it?! Do they have a salon in the back? Perhaps the staff gets ready when they arrive to work? 

Anyhow, hair aside, I actually like the food here. The beans are delish, rice cooked well, chips crisp and salsa fresh. 

I also have great service every time. I like the bar at this particular location, too. The bartenders have always been friendly and it's awesome for people watching while patrons wait outside the front doors for a table. (Take note: yes, we can see you from the bar, but it's hard to see in). 

If they invested in hairnets this place would be a little more than "a-okay"! 

So keep an eye out for strays and if you manage to get your food sans the extra protein, you will certainly enjoy this place!
