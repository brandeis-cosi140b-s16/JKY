Not related to the food, but all the staff here looked like they wanted to kill themselves.  I know making burritos for hours on end is probably not very fun, but I generally don't enjoy feeling like my patronage is actually causing ANGUISH to the employees.  Come on guys, try smiling.  Also, maybe consider talking loud enough for me to actually be able to hear you.

I thought my burrito was pretty good (veggie burrito with cheese, sour cream, salsa, hot sauce, rice and black beans).  I wish there had been more rice and beans and slightly less sour cream, but generally the proportions were good.  When I saw a LADLE-full of hot sauce being put on my burrito I freaked out a little, but it turned out to be super delicious.  Veggies were tasty and I like that they mix the ingredients before wrapping the tortilla.  I wish my burrito had been hotter (temperature-wise) but I've come to recognize that luke-warm food seems to be the hallmark of places like Panchero's, Chipotle, etc.

It was a good burrito nonetheless.  I'll definitely come back.  Service was really slow and like I said, the employees looked like they would rather be ANYWHERE but behind that counter.  Still, a decent burrito.
