I enjoy the food here. Straightforward concept like Chipotle and the like. I am a big fan of the nachos here. The three cheese sauce is delicious and has a little spice. I enjoy the salsa here, always seemed fresher than competitors. The burritos are pretty standard, and always consistent. My only real concern is that on veggie nachos or veggie burritos you have to pay more for fajita veggies or rice (only on nachos). Seriously? I am already not getting meat, which means that it is already cheaper to make. Other than that, this place will stay on rotation. 
This Qdoba is always very clean, not really too busy, and the service is typically pretty decent.
