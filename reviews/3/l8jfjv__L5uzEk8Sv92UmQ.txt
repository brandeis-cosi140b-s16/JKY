I give this place a 3, just because if it was truly authentic I'd give it a 5. So it's good in my opinion. However, the dude at the drive thru has the personality of a napkin. Not that I'm expecting the best customer service, but at least pretend like you are happy to be alive. My husband loves the burritos, I love the tacos. It's good for your "typical" Mexican place!
