It's not the best Mexican restaurant I've been to but we don't have a whole lot of selection in Belmont... So it will do in a pinch if that's really what you want... Provided you don't feel like driving to Charlotte (or to Gastonia - Tequila's is good). They have your standard American/Mexican fare and a few specialties. Enchiladas, tacos, pollo con chorizo and of course chips and salsa. The prices are reasonable for what you get. The decor is lacking and the strip mall location is less than desirable. Again, it will do in a pinch but the bar is set pretty low around here.
