Cafe Rio is really good and convenient when you're in a rush- even during lunch hour. The line takes about 5-10 mins, the staff is upbeat and polite. I usually get the same thing, chicken enchiladas. The tortillas are made fresh and their chicken enchiladas are extremely good. Flavors are a little bland, portions are good. You have to remind them not to drown your enchiladas in their sauce. I'll be a regular for during the week lunch breaks. Overall good food and good service.
