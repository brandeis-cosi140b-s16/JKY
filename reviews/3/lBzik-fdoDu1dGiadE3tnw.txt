Ok, I've been to Someburro's a thousand times, and I like it...I really do...
However...the problem that 990 out of those thousand times I've had the Pollo Fundido, simply one of the best fast guilty pleasures that you can experience.  However, after eating it, I feel like I've just dug another inch closer to the grave...or shaved another couple of days off of my life.  As I age...I'm trying to eat healthier, so here I am at Someburro's trying to find something healthy that doesn't give me visions of the grim reaper, and that gives me the near orgasmic feeling that I have when down the Pollo Fundido.  

So far, I haven't found anything else on the menu that fits the bill.  I've tried the veggie burro which is probably the healthiest thing on the menu, and it's....eh....ok.  The avocado in it is great, and I haven't seen them put less than fresh avocado slices in it.  I once tried the taco salad, which was WAY less than satisfying, and actually kind of gross.  I mean, you take some actually healthy stuff and surround it in a bowl of fried whatever...

I'm also not big into shredded beef or the machaca.  The chicken quality is ok, but has a good portion of dark meat in it.  It's good because it's marinated so heavily, though I'd imagine that the marinade does not add to the health quotient.

On the bright side, this place is decent for kids.  There are inexpensive options for little ones. We get the quesadilla's for the boys, who pretty much just pick over the quesadilla waiting for the go-ahead from mom to dive into the Churros.  By the way, the Churros are no bueno, in my opinion.  The kids like 'em cause they are doused in sugar, but they aren't doughy...they are crunchy crispy and fried...fried...fried.  I feel pangs of guilt as if I'm poisoning my children when they eat those.

Some of you reading this are probably thinking...if he's trying to be healthy, perhaps he shouldn't be going to Someburro's in the first place....and you're probably right.
