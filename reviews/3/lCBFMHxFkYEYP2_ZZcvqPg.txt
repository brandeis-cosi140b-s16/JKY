Bitz-ee Mama's has obviously been around for a long time with minimal attention paid to the condition of the restaurant.  They really need some new chairs and to update the restrooms.  At least there is foamy soap.  For me, that makes everything a little better.  The atmosphere kind of feels like the Mafia Mexicana could be doing their business here after hours, but I'm always open to adventure and think it's cool.  By no means am I implying that it's not safe.  It's just the lighting and decor that made me think this way.

The service was terrible but my friend and I weren't in a hurry, so I didn't let it bother me.  I was absolutely flabbergasted by the massive serving sizes and how inexpensive the menu items are.  The cheap margaritas just call your name and I was tempted to have one at 11am.  Everything I ate was delicious and I literally took home half of my meal because it was so large.  I'd return just for the home-made chips and salsa.  

Bitz-ee Mama's is good for a low key outing.
