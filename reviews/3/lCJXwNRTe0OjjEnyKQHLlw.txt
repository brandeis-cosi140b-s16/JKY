Both times I've been here there's only a single guy running the show: taking orders, making them, and serving them. All one guy. It's a lot for one person to handle.

Fish taco is huge- one is filling, but I'd personally ask for it without pico, as theirs has a ton of jalapeno in it that just overpowered the great fish for me. Burritos are a good size for a good price (under $5!), but you have to add on extras like cheese, sour cream, or guac. Still not a bad deal.

Salsa bar has five different options, all of which were tasty in their own way. Signage suggests customers only take what they need for their current meal, which strikes me as odd seeing as how fresh salsa doesn't actually keep all that long and this place has never been busy.
