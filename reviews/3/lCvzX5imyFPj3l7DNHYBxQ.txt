Ok, I admit, I'm not the hugest fan of Chipotle.  But, from time to time, my co-workers drag me here on lunch, so instead of starve, I eat.

I usually get the same thing while here.  Shredded beef burrito, with rice, beans, and some other stuff on it.  With a drink, it usually sets me back $9.00.  Not bad, really.  

As with all the other Chipotle's, this place is always packed with a huge line.  I will say, the service here is always friendly, quick and efficient, so I will get them that.  Drinks are self serve, if you can elbow through the mass of people to get to it, and seating can be limited if you go during the rush hour like we did.  Parking can be tough since its in a strip mall next to a total wine, so be prepared to park and walk some.

I will probably go here again at the demands of my coworkers.  LOL
