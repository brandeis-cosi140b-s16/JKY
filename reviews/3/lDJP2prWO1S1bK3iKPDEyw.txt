I'm a huge Chipotle fan but this location is just so-so.  I generally order ahead via their mobile app and the last time I ordered from here the food wasn't ready by the time that I got there.  They hadn't even actually started to make it.  There was hardly anyone in the line for a Friday afternoon and they told me there would be a wait for my food.  I could've gotten into the line and had my food quicker.  I asked them to just cancel my order and give me my money back.  They obliged and that was that.  Very weird situation.  The parking situation here is awful.  Their parking lot has less than 10 spots and there are people constantly circling around the lot trying to find a spot.  It's easier to just park on the road in one of the 3 metered spots in front of the Pep Boys across the street.
