Man....I was so excited to try this place two weekends ago and we never actually made it until this past Saturday night.  I think I had much different expectations about this little spot in SouthSide.  I give 3 stars for the great service and the OK food.

First - the location & atmosphere:  It is small and on 19th street. Parking was easy to find and when we walked in Bobby had mentioned it used to be an old Thai place.  The d√©cor wasn't anything fancy- It was small and very casual.  There was a large group of maybe 8-10 people next to us using most of the tables, then maybe two other couples.  We grabbed a seat by the window.  I think this place would be better as a lunch spot rather than a Saturday night BYOB dinner spot.

The service: We had three people waiting on us. One took our drink orders and opened our wine/brought out the glasses.  A woman was taking our orders and was a server in training and had someone showing her the ropes.  Everyone was extremely friendly and attentive. They took good care of us without being overbearing or annoying which I always appreciate.

Finally, the food:  We ordered chips and pico plus guac.  The pico, per our server's suggestion, was very good.  The guac was good but lacked a little flavor (garlic? lime? salt? I don't know).  The chips were fresh and not greasy but they literally broke into a million pieces every time you took a bite! I made a mess of course.  Bobby ordered the seafood stew as his dinner and said he very much enjoyed it.  It had a lot of flavors and a lot of different types of seafood.  I ordered their special - the chicken sopes.  The chicken and toppings seemed fresh but pretty bland.  The base was dry and didn't have much flavor.  

I would go back and try this place again and then hopefully update the rating/review.  Bobby really enjoyed his and would give it 4 stars he said, so maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.
