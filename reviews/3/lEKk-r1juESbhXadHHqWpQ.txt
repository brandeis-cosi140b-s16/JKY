After all the commercials airing on TV and radio,  Taco Bell finally wore me down and I ordered a couple of their waffle tacos.   I have a soft spot for waffle based food,  being a big fan of Bruxie in OC,  and it was difficult for me not to compare the two experiences.   

First off,  the waffle.   It was more along the eggo waffle lines than somthing you would make for yourself,  made thin enough to fold without breaking.   They filled it with eggs,  cheese and sausage (or bacon), and even though the eggs are probably powered and definitely rubbery,  it auctiually works.   Pour the syrup they give you on the side over it,  and it works even better.  Also of note,  it was pretty small.   It's a good thing I ordered 2, but it makes me question if it's even worth $1.99.  

The Waffle taco is deffently worth a try,  but I'm not sure if it will be somthing I go back for on a regular basis.
