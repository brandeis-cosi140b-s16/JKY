Great food & prices.  We have eaten here a fe times with friends during our visits to Las Vegas.  My only complaint is we had a very large group of 20 (4 families) and just wanted the server to separate our check by each family and they said they weren't allowed to. It took us almost 30 minutes to figure out each family's bill and we decided this was not a place we will visit again as a group!
