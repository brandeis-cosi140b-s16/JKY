Not a bad place for lunch.  Relatively low cost, simple menu (chicken or beef - corn or flour tortillas - no other decisions needed!), and tasty food.  It's tasty, all good (don't know about best ever by a long shot).  The decor is non-existent (but who cares) - if I lived close, might be a good option for dinner take out (but I don't live close).

Problems would be lack of flexibility - things like not enough salsa to go with servings, and unwilling to provide more salsa (this was odd!), although they are willing to sell additional salsa.  I am also annoyed when places charge for refills on drinks, all of that gives it a rather stingy vibe (and the prices aren't that cheap!).

Overall, I go back every few weeks for lunch as it's tasty and reasonably priced, but it is not someplace I frequent or go to on a regular basis even though it's close to the office.
