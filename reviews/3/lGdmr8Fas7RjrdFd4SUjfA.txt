So this is a decent neighborhood Mexican joint. The food is pretty good and the price point seems about right. Have visited quite a few times with the family and the kids really likes it. 

The good:
The bean dip is yummy. They also provides two different types of salsa. The usual red, and a sweet green salsa. I like most of everything I have tried. I like the different variety of meats they offer, including lengua. I wish they had cabeza.

The bad:
Limited seating. Outside tables are bolted down, so you can't combine them if you have a larger party. Also, if you sit inside next to the patio door, the patio door slams every time a server goes in and out and it's bound to drive you nuts eventually. 

The ugly:
Ordered the crab relleno last night. I was all excited cuz Abuello's used to have this dish called crab mazanillo that's basically a fancy crab relleno. It was my favorite dish until they took it off the menu. Anyhow, so I was looking forward to trying it out at this place. Well, guess what? It's not even real crab. They stuffed it full of fake crab. So it just became a breaded and fried chile full of fake crab. I ate maybe 1/3 of it before I gave up. It just didn't taste good and it really didn't make me want to keep eating it. Honestly I would've been happy to pay a little more for real crab. And they really shouldn't lie to customers and say it's crab when it's "krab". I'm more irritated at the dishonesty than anything else because we like the place. 

In conclusion: Don't order the "crab" relleno. Everything else so far has been decent.
