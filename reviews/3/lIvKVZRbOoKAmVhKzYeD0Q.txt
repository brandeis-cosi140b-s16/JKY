The food was decent. The sopapillas are NOT Sopapillas!!!!! They were horrible and when they came to our table they weren't burnt horribly and they look nothing like what a sopapilla actually is! The service was nice enough. Wasn't impressive but decent service as well. The server we had was very kind and helpful. The lady helping with drinks wasn't very friendly or kind. She mixed up my drink and gave me a diet on the refill and when we tried to tell her what she had done, she told us "no I didn't make a mistake" we had to request a replacement drink because she said she didn't make a mistake.
