The three stars here don't represent a real review.  Oh, I had all intentions of writing a review for this place.  We set out to go here, later than most people, as usual.  We planned on taking advantage of the 9.99 fajita-with-margarita special, and wanted to make sure it was still available. 

So we get to Red Rock and I check in on Yelp.  I have to do that BEFORE we actually enter the casino, because my Yelp app won't work on my phone inside.  We go to Cabo, and here's where the stupidity ensues:  instead of just asking someone who works there, we stand in front of it looking at the illuminated billboard that has their menu.  The fajita special had just flashed by, so we waited...and waited...as the billboard s-l-o-w-l-y cranked through each page of the substantial menu.  At last, THAT page appeared, for just a second, but long enough to see that the special didn't have time constraints like "served from 5:00 - 7:00 p.m.  Great!  We walk past the bar and up to the desk, where the young woman cleaning menus says:  "Oh, we just closed!"

Foiled again!

Off to the Grand Cafe.

I will update this, now that I know that they close at 9:00 p.m., much to early for a casino restaurant, IMHO.
