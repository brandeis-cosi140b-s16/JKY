Not a bad place to stop if you're in The Hard Rock Casino. The margaritas are good but a bit over priced for the quality (same for the food). The bacon wrapped jalape√±os and corn cakes are very tasty I would get those again. I found the beef on the tacos a bit bland. It is a nice atmosphere in here and the patio is fun.
