This restaurant has a lot of potential, but hasn't quite figured out the Phoenix market is different than, say, Colorado.  On the plus side, I think the salsa and chips are excellent - a very nice hot sauce with just enough "bite".  I also found the Mexican rice to be outstanding.  I had a combo platter with a cheese enchilada and bean tostada.  The cheese enchilada didn't have any onions inside, or any sauce on top - that would be easy for management to fix - offer cheese enchiladas with or without onion, and with or without sauce.  The bean tostada was pretty bland.  The other thing to note is the prices are just a bit too high for this market.  I did enjoy the live Mariachi band.  Oh, and Happy Hour doesn't include Friday or Saturday night, and is only available at the bar or on the patio.  I think Happy Hour should be every day!
