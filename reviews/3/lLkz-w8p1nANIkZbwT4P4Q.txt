After reading the existing reviews of this place and knowing that it's Carlos Santana's restaurant, I was more than a little leery about trying it out. However, my sister chose, so off we went. 

The dining room is beautiful, and the music was audible but not overpowering at all. We were there for lunch, so there was no live music, but I can only imagine that the place gets really loud at night. 

The service was great- our server was friendly and prompt. He seemed genuinely glad to be there rather than the fake cheer some servers put on. (I hate that. It's so obvious.) 

The food was pricey- our lunch ended up being almost $40 for the 2 of us- but it was good. Really good. The salsas tasted fresh (they bring you 3 different kinds!) and actually had some heat, and our entrees were delicious. Per the recommendation from the server, I had the fish tacos. Good choice! They were delicious. The fish had a nice spice to it, and it wasn't batter-fried they way many places do. The avocado, pico de gallo, and sauce complemented the fish perfectly. My sister had the vegetarian enchiladas, which she liked, though they had a bit of a sweet flavor that caught her off-guard. 

 I love the fact that the food isn't your typical Mexican restaurant menu- they add their own touch to the dishes, enhancing the entree rather than turning it into some odd fusion meal. 

I'd go back again. Probably not for lunch, but I imagine dinner would be a great experience here. 

As a side note: My sister brought her 1 year old daughter with, and we found the restaurant to be very kid-friendly. Sure, they don't have a playground or a ball pit, but if you bring a well-behaved child, the staff is more than accommodating.
