Chad was a very pleasant waiter who checked in on us periodically and got us everything we needed.  We ordered (too much food) chips and salsa,guacamole and pork rhinds, with pomegranate seeds on top  :), the steak fajitas - cactus pieces were found in the mix, and they came with a sizzling piece of corn on the cob to our enjoyment! The tortilla soup was  just so so; it had a weird flavor and the small portion was definitely NOT worth $8!  Overall, the food was good but a bit overpriced (but hey, it's Vegas, right?!).
