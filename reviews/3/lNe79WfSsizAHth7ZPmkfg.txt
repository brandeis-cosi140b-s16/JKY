Taberna and Ninfa's are owned by the same restaurant group out of Houston.  Is it a coincidence that the FTR for Taberna is by someone who has only reviewed both of these spots and gave each five stars?  I think not.

Here's my objective review:

Taberna is in the Scottsdale Seville where Roy's used to be.  They have a large outside patio that will be great when the weather is nice.

I ate lunch at the bar and enjoyed chatting with the friendly bartender.  The menu is upscale Mexican food.  

I liked the basket of chips they brought out to start.  It came mixed with chips and plantains and two nice salsas.

I also ordered the al carbon steak enchiladas.  They were good and spicy served with what I believe was a mole sauce.

Overall the quality of the food was good but a little expensive.  I would come back, but it's not at the top of my list.
