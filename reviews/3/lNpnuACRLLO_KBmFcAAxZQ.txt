Oh, man, I really like El Pollo Loco most of the time. If I feel like eating a ton, I'll have the Ultimate Pollo Bowl with sweet potatoes and a churro. If I like being healthy, I get the salad with a ton of the guac salsa instead of dressing. That versatility is something I love about this place, especially bc most other fast food places fail in that regard. 

Having said that, this Pollo Loco has been somewhat inconsistent for me. There've been time where I've gotten food from them and it's been perfect EPL: good, moist chicken and delicious salsa. But the last two times I've been there I've gotten OK food... almost to the point of it being bad. Still, the majority of times I've been there it's been great, so I haven't written them off just yet...
