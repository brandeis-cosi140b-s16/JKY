My guy really likes this place, I guess he's been here a couple of times after early mornings at the rangle. This is just the first time I came with him to this particular establishment.

It was noon 12/21/14 and it was busy, but hey, they serve breakfast all day. So I had "Homemade tamale and eggs" 

The staff is really nice.

Chips were ok, would have been really good if they were warm, the homemade sala was pretty good but you get a very small amount for the amount of chips your given.

I asked for my eggs soft scrambled, not because I like undercooked eggs but because I don't like dry omlet like overcooked eggs. I always order them the same and I get them back correct about 5% of the time. This time my food came and my eggs looks plastic, thats how overcooked they were, and I guess that most everyone else seems ok with eggs like that and bully for them, I don't complain about my eggs though, I just assume they will be wrong and I don't eat them when they turn out the way I assume (and almost do) they will.

About 3 minutes after we were all served out food though the waitress came over and said I realized you asked for soft scrambled eggs so I had them make you some separate ones. this is unprecedented, its literally never happened to me before EVAR. AND they were perfect!!!

Small portions, especially for the prices, but I guess I'd go back, its not like you have a lot of options while out that way.

Because of the homerun on my eggs.... my guy WAY overtipped.
