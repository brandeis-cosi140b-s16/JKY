If you are looking for a chain that does not feel like a chain, then you might enjoy this place.  The decor is pretty nice and has a modern upscale casual feel.  They have a lot of seating, so even if there is a wait, it really should not be too bad.

The food is slightly above average.  I would say this is a safe place to bring out of towners or a business lunch, but it is not on my list of favorites.  The cornbread is a great addition to the meal and most of the mixed drinks are good.  The food is good, but nothing on the menu seems to be too memorable. 

Again a safe nice place if you are looking for an americanized mexican restaurant.  It has a fairly upscale casual touch to the decor.  Usually any Z is located nearly a shopping district, so I could see this as a good place to go on a shopping day or for some drinks.
