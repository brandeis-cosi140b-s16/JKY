Quite an interesting concept that I had not been privy to trying before finding it randomly on a lunch break in the heart of upper Phoenix. 

Let's get the complaint out of the way early. If this place is half Mexican, then you need to have some salsa or some Mexican sauce next to the soy sauce. Alot of food I found myself pouring soy sauce on because it lacked a bit of a punch and flavor. If they can pull that off, then things would be alot better because my veggie quesadilla was solid, but using soy sauce on that product was not the best choice. The plain fried rice was exactly what I wanted and although they only have a handful of chicken breast choices, the one I picked was good. It was with the green sauce and ginger combo and I ordered that in the combination with that quesadilla for about eight bucks. They probably don't need that sampling station in the front either, it just looks cheesy. Of course, the snickerdoodle cookie was a nice surprise and very tasty, that item may be worth buying a dozen, but maybe sneak your own hot sauce in the place if you want some extra flavor.
