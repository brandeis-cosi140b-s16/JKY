The food, service, and atmosphere are great, but for the money you can get better elsewhere.  It is a good "first date" place or anniversary meal place when you want to talk during your meal - nice and quiet.  I'll probably go back but not frequently.

Try a Tequila Flight!  Very educational and a nice way to sample several tequilas and not get plastered.

They could put just a little pizazz into this place and make it really neat - a "must do" activity.
