The three stars goes to the food. I can't say this Cafe Rio has the best version of cafe rio but it's still good. What I cannot stand about this place is the quality of service. Anytime I go in there we wait. And wait. And wait. Then usually they are out of something. Either some meat, guac, or dressing. Or all of them! Drives me crazy that a group of staff members (which they are usually looking fully staffed) can't stay up on everything. And today I even called to place an order. 30 minute wait. Even my fresh cooked Thai food and my fav restaurant is ready in 15 minutes. Anyways, the food gets the stars. Definitely not the service.
