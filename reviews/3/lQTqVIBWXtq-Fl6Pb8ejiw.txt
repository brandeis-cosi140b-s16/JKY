Decent food with a great location. The only complaint I have, is when you sit at the bar you can only choose from a Tapas menu. So if you want tacos on TT you have to sit in the dining area. Their chili rellano, street corn and quesadillas were tasty. Good speciality Margs and great HH prices. I saw many bad reviews in here for them but chose to make my own opinion. I would go bank but there is much better Mexican food places in the valley. The customer service was good, no issues with that.
