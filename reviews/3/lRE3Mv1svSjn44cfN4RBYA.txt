I went here the other night with my friend who loves Mexican food. We went on a Saturday night, and they had a mariachi band playing the entire time which is cool, but it's not fun when you're trying to talk. Right when we entered, the server immediately brought us warm chips and salsa. It was pretty good. Although, I'm in a bit of a spicy kick right now, so I wish they were spicier. My friend ordered a chicken quesadilla, ad I ordered a carne asada burrito. My burrito was decent. I prefer Chipotle a lot more, and Chipotle is half the price. My friend's quesadilla was pretty tasty. The food wasn't bad nor was it amazing. It certainly wasn't worth the $30 for the two items. I don't think I'd ever go back again.
