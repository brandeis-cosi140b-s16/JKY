So, first off I must say that I am a wimp when it comes to spicy food. Medium salsa is my limit. That being said, the steak quesadilla was really good! Everything else on the plate was too hot for me to eat. I'm from Texas... I live on good Mexican food. It doesn't have to light you up to be good. My husband loves spice and he got the steak nachos which he liked. .. unfortunately they didn't set too well. He's having some stomach issues now. That's why I only gave them 3 stars.
