Not only was I dying to check out the Cosmopolitan hotel, but when I saw the description of this restaurant, I HAD to eat here!!! I love both Asian and Latin food, so what better two to fuse together?!?'
  I was surprised when I realized it was "casual dining" because the description on the website made it sound very upscale? Either way, I wasn't disappointed!!!
  Because I was in a hurry, I sat on the barstools that oversee the kitchen so you can actually watch them make your entire meal from scratch. Spoke to the Asian guy sitting next to me who confirmed that everything was VERY authentic (I'm not familiar with some of the Asian dishes they were serving). I couldn't decide on any of the noodle dishes, so ended up with the chicken/rice/avocado soup (don't remember what they called it?) and a chicken taco with mole sauce. Both delicious!! Service was excellent as well! I thought it was a little pricey ($9 for soup and $5 for one TINY taco) but you have to expect that in Vegas! I would love to try many more things on the menu!
