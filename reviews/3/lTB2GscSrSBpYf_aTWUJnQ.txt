I came here for the fifth meet up for The Breakfast Club UYE . . . and also finally lost my UYE "V-card"; haha! It was nice to finally meet others in the Yelp community. 

This was my first time visiting the location and trying their breakfast. Have visited the Tempe location by the Arizona Grand several times for dinner / drinks.

The service was a little slow, but there were several large parties. No big deal, I was too busy enjoying all these awesome conversations and getting to know others.

Complimentary chocolate fondue fountain - Hello, pineapple and strawberries! 

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros - Nothing special - not horrible, not amazing. 

Shout out to Monica O. for organizing this event; looking forward to attending many more!
