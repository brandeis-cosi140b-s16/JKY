The wait staff was quite friendly.  However, they all looked at me like I was an alien when I asked for regular queso.  So, they brought me spinach con queso - I didn't ask for that, I wanted queso.  The salsa was ok, was mostly just sauce, no spice or extra ingredients.  The spinach con queso was probably the best I've had in the Valley - but it stopped there.  I ordered a cheese enchilada (hard to screw up) and a chile rellano.  The enchilada was very bland.  The chile rellano was "soft" and had no spice kick to it at all.  It wasn't breaded - was simply covered in sauce.  The beans were dry.  The rice was cooked nice, but didn't taste good at all.

I will not suggest this place to anyone, but if my friends chose to eat there again, I would simply eat before going.
