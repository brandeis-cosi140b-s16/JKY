The food is always pretty good, but it is a chain so consistancy is pretty easy. However 9 times out of 10 we get crappy service. First you sit down, get ignored for a while. When you get your drinks, drink slowly, you won't be getting a refill for a while. This is the only location even remotely close to our house, which sucks. If it wasn't for the food I wouldn't come back, but yet I find myself here at least once a month so me and the wife can split the Ultimate Fajitas. The margaritas are also amazing, always strong and fresh tasting. PLEASE reopen the Stapley location!
