Chevy's seems to be our go-to "large group" place for lunch at work.  They can easily accommodate a large group on little to short notice and the food is decent quality.  Yes, it's a chain, and yes there is definitely better Mexican Food in the Valley, but it works for what it is; fast, tasty, reasonably priced, and decent service.  I had a burrito and it was HUGE!  I couldn't eat it all, and then I went off and left it sitting on the table.  Silly me.  Oh well.  Parking is usually easy to find and we were in and out in less than an hour.  I think I've found another "Best Lunchtime Eats" candidate here.
