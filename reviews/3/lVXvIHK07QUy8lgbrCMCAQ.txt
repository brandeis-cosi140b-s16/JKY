Very much like Chipotle, but I'd give Chipotle higher reviews.  Guy taking orders was not very familiar with the menu and definitely was in 'training mode' but there wasn't anyone there assisting him, so that slowed our process down.  It's not very close to where I work so I wouldn't drive that far again to go eat there.
