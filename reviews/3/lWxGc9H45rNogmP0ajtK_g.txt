After not having visited Los Sombreros for a few years, my husband and I went back to celebrate his birthday. Right away we were happy with the chips and salsas, and the guacamole was fresh and tasty, but dinner proved to be a mixed experience. We both had the mole poblano, which is shredded chicken in a Puebla-style mole. The mole was fantastic, with a complex and pleasing flavor. The chicken, however, was inconsistent between our two plates. About 90 percent of my chicken was dry; my husband had more moist than dry chicken on his plate. I was disappointed, especially given the cost ($18.95), but the mole sauce helped the dryness, and then there was that lovely, fluffy rice, and the wonderfully creamy refried beans. I'm thinking the dry chicken was due to an off night, but I can't say I'm in a rush to go back. There are too many other good Mexican restaurants in metro Phoenix.
