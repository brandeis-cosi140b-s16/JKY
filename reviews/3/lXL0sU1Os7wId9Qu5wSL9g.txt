My husband and I live in San Tan Valley, and with very limited choices for Mexican restaurants we decided to try Don Pedro's. We stopped in for lunch during the week. There were only a few other tables occupied at the time. 

The waitress was very friendly and quick to take our drink orders. The menu is not extensive, so we each chose a lunch plate. I ordered the cheese enchilada and taco combo plate, and my husband ordered a burrito. The waitress informed him that the only thing that comes in the burrito is the meat. I found that to be odd as every other Mexican restaurant I have been to have at least included cheese. He was able to add sour cream and enchilada sauce for an additional charge. Both plate came with rice and beans. 

My enchiladas were very greasy. You could see the oil pooling on the plate. The rice and beans were good. The taco ended up being the best part of the meal. I ordered mine with only ground beef and cheese. The meat had a very nice flavor, and the taco shell was not greasy. My husband enjoyed his burrito.

The prices for dinners were fairly high, and for the quailty of food I received I would prefer the lunch price to be lower. Overall, I would return to Don Pedro's as it is most convenient. Next time I will only order the tacos!
