Went for dinner around 5pm on a Monday evening. The menus are small paper brochure like paper. Not a lot to choose from. I got the carne asada which was good. The pinto beans were more Refried bean texture than whole bean. The salsa was good. The waitress was very nice. No ice cream for dessert! The coffee was really good. I had 2 cups! It was a nice experience, but nothing other worldly about it.
