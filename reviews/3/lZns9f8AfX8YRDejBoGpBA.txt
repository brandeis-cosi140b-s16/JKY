Growing up in Seattle, Taco Time was a normal stop for me and my family. Since moving to LA, and now living in Vegas, I was only too happy to discover this childhood favorite right here in sin city. 

Now whether you are a first timer or a regular here, there are things that you need to know. First of all, there are two different versions of Taco Time. This one here in this review and the original that is abundant in Washington (also known as Taco Time Pacific Northwest). I call any Taco Time outside of the Pacific Northwest an "Express Taco Time" because they don't have the complete menu and most importantly, the hot sauce is in packets! In Washington, they make the hot sauce made fresh from scratch!

The good thing is that the main items that they are known for are readily available. My most favorite item is their crisp burritos which come in chicken, pinto bean, and the best of them all, beef. Allow me to describe it. Seasoned ground beef rolled up in a flower tortilla and deep fried to a golden brown. Kinda looks like a large taquito only way better! Damn, my mouth is watering right now just typing this! Get that in a combo with mexi-fries (basically tater tots) and a drink, you're all set! Dipping these items in their hot salsa is the cherry on top! Occasionally I have one of their tacos, soft burritos and taco salads, which is not bad either. Those choices are up to you. To me, the crisp beef burritos have no equal.

I gave them 3 stars because of their location and not so good service. It's in a food court in between Burger King and Subway. The food court itself is smack dab in the middle of a truck stop, which doesn't make it any more appealing. The service is below mediocre because you have one employee that handles everything from taking your order, to cooking, to calling you when it's done. 

So if you ever go to Seattle, make Taco Time as a part of your itinerary. For more info, go to their website: www.tacotime.com
