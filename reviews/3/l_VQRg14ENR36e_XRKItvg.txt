First off, the food was very good and deserves four stars. The problem was the service. The server was constantly forgetting to bring us things we had asked so we had to ask the bussers as they passed by. We understood at first since he was taking care of a large party but after they left, he only had us and still was absent!  Having been a restaurant corporate trainer for servers and managed restaurants I tend to be a little more patient than most but this went beyond my patience. I will definitely give them another try since the food was good but hopefully they redeem themselves with their service.
