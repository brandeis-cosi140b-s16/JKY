It's Taco Bell.  They have tacos.  And burritos.  *shrug*

This Bell has a super small parking lot and a turning radius into the drive-thru that you need to pay attention to, lest you swipe a vehicle or fence with your bumper.  I only go through the drive-thru as parking might mean you are there for a while, since the drive-thru line goes directly through the only row of parking.  Once you are in the lot, there is nowhere to turn around, so you had best have a game plan already in place.

Standard Taco Bell fare, I am a big fan of the $5 special boxes so I have a variety of items and I can eat what I want and throw the rest away.  It comes with 3 various menu items (usually a regular taco, some sort of burrito and some sort of specialty item like the Dorito taco or a chalupa).  The caramel apple empanadas are quite good (apple pie filling in a fried shell) and the cinnamon twists make for a light sweet treat.

My order is generally correct when going through the drive thru, the health score is consistently in the high 90's and the staff is always pleasant.  It's A-OK for drive-thru fast food for a quick lunch on a busy workday.
