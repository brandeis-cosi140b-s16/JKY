Service- no complaints. Meal served in good time
Menu- tad small, but sometimes helps in Mexican cuisine
Taste- fair.  Some of pork meat to pork taco was chewy and could not be broken down
      Open burrito was good
Beverage- had Corona light, not on the menu

Mentionables:
-as someone else said, not really any vegetarian options
-they do not give you your bill. You have to go up front to pay, and there is a tip jar up there. Suppose you could also leave cash on the table...
-chips and salsa--would have been nice to have a hotter salsa option.
