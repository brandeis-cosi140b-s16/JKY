God bless Taco Tuesdays and the genius who invented the concept. I went on a Tuesday night for that very reason because it's hard to pass up a $2.50 taco. 

Their taco menu is quite extensive so whether you love carnitas or fish or veggies, you will likely find something to tempt you. I tried the nopalitos and huitlacoche y champinon, which had mushroom and other veggies. They were pretty small tacos and I've had better nopales elsewhere but for $5 total, it's hard to complain! I particularly enjoyed the veggie taco as the earthiness of mushrooms always plays well with the queso fresco. My friend and I ordered the table side guacamole, which had pomegranate seeds throughout. The chips were pretty good- homemade, crunchy, and fresh- and they were generous on the avocado. Even with a margarita, the total bill was about $15. Not bad for a dinner out! Being from the taco capital of the US, I suppose I may be snobbier about my tacos. But hey, Barrio is a great deal with a good atmosphere and totally worth it for Taco Tuesday!
