We visit Laredo's every so often because it's fast and conveniently located.  The service is prompt and friendly.  We are able to get in and out quickly, even during busy hours.  And we like their margaritas.

The food itself is spotty.  The enchiladas are a safe choice; they are what you would expect from a midrange Mexican place.  The chips and salsa are passable, and I do like their fundido appetizer dish. 

But their fajitas are terrible.  They severely over cook the meat.  Dry, tough meat is the most obvious way to destroy a fajita dish.  Their tacos are plain and, again, dry.  The burritos are similarly plain, lacking any kind of pizzazz.  It's hard to imagine a Mexican restaurant that can't get the basics right, but there you have it.

Madison in general is a Mexican food desert, so it's not like Laredo's is the only average place around.  While I can't exactly recommend Laredo's, I also can't say you are going to find amazing options down the street.
