Have I ever shared my issues with microwaves before? I know I am a creep but I really dislike microwaved food. I almost had a meltdown when my expensive green chile burro was placed in the microwave. 

It was $11 and it's not even fresh? Is it cold? I watched you scoop it onto the tortilla, it wasn't from the fridge and if it wasn't hot to serve......does that mean it was at the perfect temperature for food born bacteria?  

Also, don't you know microwaves make tortillas all funky and weird textured? 

While it was microwaving I was able to check out the dried, crusty filth on all of the appliances: evidence of cooking and not cleaning. Yuck.  I really need to stop looking at stuff like that. 

Luckily, I was able to talk myself out of being a total nut job and I ate it. I was only able to eat  some of it because 1. it was effing huge and 2. the image of the crusty splatter kept popping into my head. regardless, It was so tasty. 

My favorite green chile burro used  to be from Espos but I have other issues with Espos.  This burro compares and while not totally clean and it being overpriced... and the fact that they microwaved it....it was really really really good. 
like good enough for me to give this place 3 stars. 

I like my green chile burros made with shredded beef, none of that weird cubed meat for me,  and they deliver on that aspect!

i honestly don't know if i'm capable of going again, but if you're more hardcore than i am and you are down with the get down, the i say munch up!
