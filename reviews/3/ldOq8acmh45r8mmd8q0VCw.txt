This place was pretty good! My husband and I got a take out order and were very happy with it. That was probably one of the best chili rellenos I've had. I was disappointed with the veggie salad, however, as it was mostly just lettuce. The black beans were pretty spicy and salty, so plan on having something to mix them with like rice or an extra tortilla. I probably wouldn't dine in if I could help it, the dining room isn't very comfy, (free wifi while you wait for your order is nice, though) but I will definitely be getting more take out! 

Oh, and: a snickerdoodle with every order! A good one, too!
