Food first- Mexican grilled cheese with chips. I am not from Mexico but the name sake of The Commissary is. I expected this grilled cheese to take me to Mexico instead I got taken to Applebee's.
FAIL
The sandwich has avocado & tomatoes but no flavor.
BUT, loved the caliente salsa with the chips. I asked for their hottest salsa & it is yummy. So are the chips! 
Disclosure: I used a $5 off deal.
I should have mirrored my friend who got rotisserie chicken & raved about it!
We had happy hour drinks too and I'd give both of mine a thumbs up- the mojito was tasty and the margarita was even better! 
I don't know where to start with the crazy multi food counters/confusing ordering process but sometimes different is not better.
