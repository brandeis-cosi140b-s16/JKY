I really am a big fan of Los Cerritos.  Good fast-Mexican food.  The last time I ate there though, I had a takaway Chimi.  Slathered in fake sour cream.  disgusting.  I had to scrape it off.  I would still eat there, the super nachos are awesome, the guacamole is always fresh, the hot sauces are hot but the sour cream is fake.  Do not order the sour cream.  In fact, tell them not to use the sour cream.  It's fake.  And disgusting.
