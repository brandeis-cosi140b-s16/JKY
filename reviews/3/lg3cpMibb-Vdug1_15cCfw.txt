We have eaten here many times in the 7 years we have lived in QC. We usually go during offpeak times, so it's not busy most of the times. The service is average, occasionally we have gotten good service here. The food has been consistently slightly above average mexican fare. It's good enough that we keep coming back every couple of months over 7 years. We like the salsas, and we almost always order the pork.
