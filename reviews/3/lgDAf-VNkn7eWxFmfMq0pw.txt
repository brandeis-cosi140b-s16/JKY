Chips, salsa, guac was delicious. Food was tasty. Portions were small. Pricey. Service was good, but a little bit slow. Not good for small children, they don't even have plastic water cups.
Overall good spot to grab a drink, or for a nice date night, when you expect to pay a little extra and eat a little less.
