Any restaurant who brings you a tequila taster before a glass of water has something special going on! I was quite excited for my margarita to arrive. It took about 10 minutes for the drink to arrive. The assured us the drinks were scratch, but boy oh boy, they weren't good. I had just come from another local restaurant that had excellent drinks and horrible chips, salsa, and guac. 

This place was the exact opposite. The food was great, and the drinks just didn't taste quite right. I sent my drink back and they brought a me a different version of the same drink, but it was still a no go. I didn't finish my margarita, and neither did my friend - that's saying something.

I'll be seeking out a hole in the wall next go around.
