I've gotta say that the food is good and I no longer eat at Taco Bell because I enjoy this so much more.  The reason why they don't get 5 starts is because their service SUCKS!  The girls in the drive thru are always miserable and awful, they never say hi or thank you.  They always mess my burrito up because I don't eat cheese and I don't think they understand so they always put so much cheese on everything.  I don't even care about that though, I just have to be very specific.  It's the customer service that gets me, I am a paying customer, put a smile on your face...
