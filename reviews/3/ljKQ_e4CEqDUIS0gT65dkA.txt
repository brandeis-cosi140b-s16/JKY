Meh, such a good concept, but I was really underimpressed with the execution. 

We had 2 apps and 4 different tacos and didn't like any of them that much, the sauce was overwelming on most, and the calamari one just tasted like fried, but not even a good fried, more styrofoamy.

First server was nice and fairly friendly, 2nd one was pretty standoff-ish although I didn't think it was anything personal towards us.

Cool decor, good spot for a drink and maybe sharing an app, but overall not likely to return unless they change up the menu or the chef.
