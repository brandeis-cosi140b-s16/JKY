Torta is good, but I was not crazy impressed by this Roberto's style taco joint. About 10 pm my girlfriend and I rolled up through the drive through. I ordered carnitas pork plate, a carne asada taco and my girl got the carne asada fries with extra quac. The portion was great, nice fulfilling meal! My issue was that most of my carnitas was pieces of fat and the amount of fat/oil in the to go box was sickening. As you can see from the picture, it was pretty fatty. The carne asada taco and fries were good and filling an the guac is great! All in all, it's a 24 hour fast Mexican joint. The food tastes good but I'm sure the cuts of meat are not great quality. If you are a healthy eater you may have issues with this place. If you don't care, or have a stupidly fast metabolism like my girl- try this place out. They give Roberto's a run for their money.
