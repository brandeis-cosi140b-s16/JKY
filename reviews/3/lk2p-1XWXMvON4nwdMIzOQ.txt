Ordered shrimp chile relleno a la carte and house guac. Guac could use some work but the relleno was surprisingly good!! However service....these guys need to communicate more. Waiters and cooks openly arguing...it was hushed but I was close to the kitchen so I don't think the whole place heard. Good music!!!
