We too rented the cellar last week - and what a great dimly-lit little nook that is with the Southwestern fireplace, wine collection and all.  Food was great, and service was OK (The server snapped at me when I questioned about the side salad.  It wasn't clear on the menu whether it came before the entree or with it.)  

Anyhow, the Santa Fe chicken was smothered in sauteed mushrooms.  The chicken was a bit too charred but still good nonetheless.  I will go back in the future, but not in a huge hurry.  I've heard of too many good Southwestern places in Phoenix to be in a big rush.
