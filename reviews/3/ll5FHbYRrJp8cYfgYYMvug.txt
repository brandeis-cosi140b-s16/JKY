No sé qué decir
Deseo era mejor
Pero I'll be back

(I tried Dos Reales with a friend the other night.  The atmosphere was pleasant enough, but I have mixed feelings about the food.  I ordered the chicken mole, with a side of chile relleno.  The mole was obviously straight out of a jar, which is never a good thing.  The chile relleno, however, was pretty good... certainly not the BEST that I've ever had, but also not the WORST either.  

Recommendation:  Give this place a try, but stay away from the mole!)
