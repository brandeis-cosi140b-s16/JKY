Nacho Daddy should've been great.  I will say our server, Megan, was fantastic.  Very attentive without lingering.

We got chips & salsa & queso to start.  I'm a big queso fan and I never complain about that, but the chips were a little greasy and not salty enough.  Problem solved by adding salt.  Moving on.

I had a salad of sorts and the dressing was CRAZY spicy.  It was pretty good but nothing amazing.  My boss had a fajita salad - again, nothing amazing.

The prices were pretty affordabe.  Their patio looked great but it was hotter than the sun so we sat inside.  Maybe I would love this place more if I got to sample their margaritas??  That usually does the trick.
