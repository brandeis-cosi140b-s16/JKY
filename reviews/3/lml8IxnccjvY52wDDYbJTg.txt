We went to Zapata's for the first time and it was good.  Laid back atmosphere with good service.  My husband and I shared the fajitas and they were great.   I would say that the salsa served with the chips was not great.  It had good flavor but was soupy.  All in all though, it was a good experience and we'll go back.
