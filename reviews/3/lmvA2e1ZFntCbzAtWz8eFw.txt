I used a $25 gift certificate I won from the restaurant and took one guest. Also was my first time visiting and I had seen some nachos online that looked good. We shared the Thai chicken nachos and the Burger nachos. Both are large portions and we both liked the Thai nachos better, and they were also quite spicy. This dish just looked so appealing too, it was plated quite nicely. 
Service was an issue from the beginning. Since we weren't ready to order, we waited way too long for our server to return to take our order. We needed plates for the nachos since we were sharing. After I asked for plates, we never got them so I went to the bar to ask for them.
For dessert we shared the churro sundae, which was very good but served on the wrong kind of plate so it was melting all over. 
It almost seemed like the place was new though it's been there for years. I wasn't impressed with the decor or the atmosphere and likely won't be going back.
