{Actual Date of Visit: 12/1/11}

My visit started off rocky.  When I drove up, the outside of the place looked desolate and nondescript.  (Eyebrow raise).  Ummmm is that the door?  As I entered, I noticed the restaurant was really dark and not in a sexy-ambiance kind of way.  ("Uh-oh" I thought).  I approached the counter and received the side-eye for what I believed was my presentation of a Groupon for $10 of 20 worth of food.  "Susie" (I assume) examined my coupon for about a minute then said "Ok".   I was like, "Sooooo, do i seat myself or...?"  She answered, "Have a seat, someone is coming."  I sat down and a waitress came to take my order.  After I ordered my food, the waitress came back to tell me the lunch special was excluded from the Groupon.  Fair enough.  So I had to start over again with not a lot of veggie options to choose from.  

I got the two cheese enchilada which was good, not amazing, but definitely good enough to order 2 more to go to finish off my Groupon,lol.  I liked the rice that came along with it.  For desert, I ordered the sopapillas.  I didn't expect so many of them!  They taste kind of like a beignet or chinese donut.  Towards the end, "Susie" warmed up to me and told me about the student 10% discount and invited me back.  I may go back to check it out with friends, but I hesitate due to the lack of options for the vegetarian.
