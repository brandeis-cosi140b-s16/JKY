Not the best Mexican food in the area (and certainly not super "authentic" Mexican but also not the worst, and Cinco de Mayo is very cheap. There is a lunch buffet everyday from 11-2:30 or 3 that only costs $9.50 and all of the entrees are super cheap as well. The service isn't bad but nothing spectacular either. Basically Cinco de Mayo is your average Mexican restaurant, nothing more and nothing less. 
The lunch buffet has some meat entrees: fajita beef, chorizo pork with onions, pork ribs, and some chicken con queso. They were all forgettable except the corizo which was very good. They have beef and chicken enchiladas, chicken taquitos, cheese quesadillas (very cheesy and very good), chicken nuggets, fries, and ground beef & chicken along with soft and hard shells to make your own tacos. Everything was average quality with nothing that really stood out. The rice and beans were not very good at all either- and it's not just the buffet quality, my girlfriend ordered the chimichanga which was okay but her rice and beans were also really mediocre. 
If you're in the area and need a Mexican fix for cheap, this is better than Taco Bell, or if you really want to chow down the buffet is all decent quality stuff and super cheap as well. If you want really good or authentic Mexican food though, I would venture out to other places in Concord/Charlotte to get your fix.
