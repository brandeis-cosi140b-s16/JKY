I had the steak burrito.  This is traditional Mexican versus the lighter and healthier CaMex - re-fried, heavy on cheese, very few greens.  The table chips and salsa includes re-fried beans.  Very friendly and courteous staff.  Seated promptly, food came out quick and hot, and no eating for refill of ice tea and check delivered promptly.  That is a lot of pluses on the service side.  4 stars if the burrito came heavier in greens and lighter on cheese and refried.
