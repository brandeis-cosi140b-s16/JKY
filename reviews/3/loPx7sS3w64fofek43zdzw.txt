The carne asada tacos are extremely good. The carne is flavorful and juicy. My one complaint is that I can clearly ask for my tacos to be made a specific way without certain add-ons, I'll even have them read my order back to me and when I get it, it's exactly how I asked them NOT to make it. I just wish the workers were actually bilingual rather than just fluent in Spanish and only understanding/speaking broken English. The language barrier is what causes the orders to get screwed up. Like, Cilantro doesn't even rhyme with Guacamole so how did you even think that I said that???? Anyway, none of that deters me from going. I love Filibertos. (The one in Chandler is the best one I've experienced so far). Nice, cheap Mexican restaurant. And I've never had to pee from my butt after eating here
