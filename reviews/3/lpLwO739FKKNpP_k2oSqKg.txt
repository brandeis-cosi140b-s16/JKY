It's Baja Fresh, what can i say? It's clean, they're fast and it's a hell of a lot better than McDonald's. I usually call in my lunch order from work and it's almost always ready and waiting when I get there to pick it up.

I do have to say that their pico de gallo is great and I could probably live on just that for the rest of my life. I get extra cups of it and eat it all by itself.
