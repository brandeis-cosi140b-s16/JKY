I feel somewhat disappointed when I come here, totally love Chipotle but this location always seems to have staff in training because my food is made differently every time; scoop sizes always vary, meat is dried out, mild salsa was very runny and odd looking, and carnitas were out again... The woman in front of me in line today had to tell the employee to stop putting more rice on her tacos... One of the fountain drinks were out of order, the tea was out and the tables inside and outside were dirty. Three stars because normally the food is really good but the last two times I've been here I've not left satisfied.

Probably will start going to other locations in the future, just a shame since this one is the closest and my husband and I truly love the food (when made correctly).
