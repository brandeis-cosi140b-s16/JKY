We wanted to try a local restaurant so we went with some friends we were visiting.  We had reservations so getting a table Friday night was easy.  The salsa is so weak.  Lacked flavor & spice.  Luckily a local we were with knew about a green sauce/paste that was kinda spicy that we mixed in with the table salsa.  Finally the manager brought be a different red salsa/sauce that had some bite.  A combo of all 3 made a semi decent salsa.  I had a chicken burrito with a delicious sour cream sauce & cheese. Really tasty.  I'd go again & order the same.  If the salsa was better I'd have given 4 stars.
