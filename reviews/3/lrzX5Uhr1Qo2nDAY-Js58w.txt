This small Salvadorian restaurant was in process of closing up so we ordered our queso spinach and queso chicken pupusas to go. These were packaged with a bag each of curtido, a spicy cabbage slaw, and a watery tomato salsa that tasted like tomato juice.  We thoroughly enjoyed our first ever pupusas in the confines of our room.
