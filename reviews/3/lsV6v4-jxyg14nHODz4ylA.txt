Charlotte University Location.  

Reading the other reviews here on Los Arcos, I'm going to believe that we visited this location on a bad evening. This was the first visit to this location of Los Arcos, and we were not as impressed as with some other local locations of the namesake restaurant.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice, actually much nicer than any other local Los Arcos location visited previously. Service was acceptable, nothing spectacular but adequate.

We both ordered the same entree, the Arroz Camerones. On the entrees arrival, we found the temperature of it to be lukewarm. It obviously had set several minutes before being picked up to be brought to our table. 

I assume their shrimp used in this dish was that of Gulf shrimp. Both orders large shrimp had a very strong iodine taste to it, as typically found in the Gulf of Mexico Brown shrimp variety. 

Unfortunately, there was a inordinate, overwhelming large amount of onions mixed in with the remaining ingredients. My companion asked the waitress if this was a normal amount of onions and about the coolness of the plate. The waitress graciously offered to take it back and have the plate remade, which we accepted.

I'm believing that we just visited on an off night and perhaps this location will be better on our next visit.
