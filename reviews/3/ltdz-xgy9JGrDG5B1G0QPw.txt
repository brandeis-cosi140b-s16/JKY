It's a chicken chain, but I prefer this grilled up chicken to KFC. It's one of those chains I'm guilty to like because it's simple and chains tend to be consistent.

Unfortunately, first few times I went here the chicken was undercooked.

Recently we tried to go early since the last few times were near to closing and this time it was cooked just right.

Hopefully it's got its consistency down, but it still averages out to 3 stars from the experiences at this branch.
