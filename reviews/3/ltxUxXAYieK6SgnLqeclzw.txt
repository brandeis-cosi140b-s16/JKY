Yet again, Phoenicians, I worry about your taste buds. Have they ever actually had amazing high-end Mexican?

The Spotted Donkey is a solid option for well-executed, if a bit odd, Mexican with a twist. For the price, I expected a table-side preparation of a giant guacamole bowl. It was fresh, and if it's you're bag, impressively smooth. The flavors meld well, but it's not spicy or particularly unique. The shrimp cocktail, done in a 'ceviche' style was certainly different. The 'ceviche' term is misappropriated - it's not ceviche, but closer to a 'campechana.' The addition of cucumber to the traditional mix of avocado, onion, tomato, cilantro, lime, and hot sauce was unique - not in a bad way, just an unexpected, unconventional note among a typical preparation.
