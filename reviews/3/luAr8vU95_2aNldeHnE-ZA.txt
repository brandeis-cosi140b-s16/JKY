Very convenient  location , nice decor , good place to watch the Sunday games , decor is nice/ naughty fit for Las Vegas , service staff is nice , however  the food lack authenticity . Thanks to their " diablo hot sauce ".  Without the sauce, the flavor is so so .... This sauce is deadly ! But I like it. 
The portions are big  and the price is  ok.
