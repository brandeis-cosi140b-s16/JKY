First, I wish I knew they did NOT have their LIQUOR license before going: maybe it's just me but an ice cold Negra Modelo or margarita go hand-in-hand with great Mexican food!

But then the food was not great so maybe that's why. Ambiance was lacking too (removing the thick plastic table coverings would help).

Tasty? Absolutely! El Herradero will do in a pinch when you're craving some south-of-the-border flavors, just know the quality is mediocre if you're a Mexican cuisine foodie.
