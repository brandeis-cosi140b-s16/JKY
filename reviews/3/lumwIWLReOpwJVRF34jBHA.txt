So what the food isn't that good and the service isn't the best... Their three dollar mimosas and bloody Mary's come in big glasses and will help you not care. My huevos rancheros looked bland and disgusting but drunk me still ate it... I would have taken more than three bites too, had the yolk in my over medium eggs not been rock hard. I didn't complain I was happy. 

Hmmmm.. Maybe next time I'll eat breakfast at home and go their for drinks :)
