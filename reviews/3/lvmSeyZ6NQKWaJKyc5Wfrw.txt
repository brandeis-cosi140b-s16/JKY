I've been back several times to Ricky's and continue to try different dishes. What is consistent is the cool bartenders/staff, and Luis as he moves around his restaurant to ensure his customer's are happy!

$2 Taco Tuesday and you can't go wrong!  I've found my favorite dish at this spot, their Barbacoa tacos!  They serve their salsas warm and I have to tell you, it's the best I've tasted! Definitely not made in New York City! :P  Best Mexican Food in the area!
