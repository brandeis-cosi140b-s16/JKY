Monterrey - the regional chain - is quite possibly the first Mexican food that I ate in Charlotte.  Whether it was or not, it is the first I remember having.  I typically eat at the location in Matthews, simply because it is closer to my house.

As has been mentioned by other reviewers, this spot is a bit funky.  While you can see it from Harris, it is almost always in a "oh, there is Monterrey" discussion, so that you are passing by going one way or the other and it is nearly always too late to figure out just how to get into the parking lot.

Should you happen to figure it out, then the food is not bad, and pretty similar to the other location in Matthews - fairly standard, perhaps skewing to the high end, Americanized Mexican fare.  While there are better stops in Charlotte for Mexican food, there are plenty that are worse as well, so try and find your way into the parking lot and give Monterrey a try!
