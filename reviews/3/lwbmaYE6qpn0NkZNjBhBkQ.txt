I love love love Mad Mex. The one in University City Philly to be exact but when we moved here life was okay because Mad Mex is here too. We've been here a few times because of how close it is to home and each time there is something that just isn't quite right. The most recent time, which is why I'm writing this review, our food took over one hour to come. We repeatedly flagged down our waitress and she kept insisting that she was "checking on it" when finally the huz had it and we were about to let the manager have it and then walk out when the manager walked over and apologized for our order never being put in. They took care of the bill but still, left a really poor impression of terrible incompetence. Our waitress never apologized and acted as though nothing happened when she came back to see how everything was. Extremely disappointed with the service. 

I'm giving the 3 stars because of my love for Mad Mex and the big azz margaritas but the Greentree location really needs to step it up.
