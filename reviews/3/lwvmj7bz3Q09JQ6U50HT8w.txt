Go here for a Rita and watch the Bellagio fountain.

Even it's a bit cool you can sit on the patio above the sidewalk and enjoy the view and do some people watching and stay warm with the patio heaters.

You will find the food and service is average at best. 

A Cabo Wabo Anejo rita will set you back $14 and served in a plastic cup.
