I ate hear for the first time since moving to Arizona.  I had a chorizo and egg burrito and it was extremely greasy.  But then again, chorizo burritos are not high on the list of low fat low carb options.  Considering it was 11pm I'm not going to complain.  Don't be upset if the drive through takes too long; they make food to order so it is going to take a bit longer than average fast food.  I also think it's always going to be a bit difficult to get that much variety that late at night.  My wife had two crunchy chicken tacos and they were well worth it.
