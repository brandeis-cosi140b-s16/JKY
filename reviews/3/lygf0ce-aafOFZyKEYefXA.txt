Taking up residence where Mandalay Noodle World used to be, Betito's serves up quick, cheap Mexican eats similar to Los Favoritos or Filibertos.  They have a good selection of breakfast items, both plated and wrapped.  We had a bean, cheese, and egg burro ($4) and some huevos Mexicanos.  The huevos Mexicanos were pretty good, and consisted of eggs scrambled with fried veggies and cheese.  It came with a side of beans and rice as well.  The bean/cheese/egg burro was very filling, a large size, and also tasted pretty good.  I also tried some horchata, which was refreshing, but very sweet.  I'd definitely like to try some non-breakfast items next time.

In addition to the bright red salsa they include in your order, there is a salsa bar which includes a green and chunkier red salsa, as well as radishes, carrots, and jalapenos.

One thing to note: They do not accept credit card yet, and the only A/C available in the restaurant is overhead ceiling fans, which is a deterrent to any that want to eat their food in the restaurant in the summer.
