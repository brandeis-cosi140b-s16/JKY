It was just OK. Its in a weird part of town, and we went on a Monday night. Only 1 other couple in the whole place, so we felt rushed through our meal. We ordered the tuna appetizer and I LOVE sushi, and it tasted as if it was pre made the day prior. It was really over priced for the quality. Unless you are going for a business meeting or something this isn't the place I would suggest.
