This is a restaurant that is easy to describe, but hard to write any length about. It's your standard thumbs up Mexican fare.  The chips and salsa come with three different types of salsa: red, green, and refried beans.  The taste is as expected.  I had the ceviche, listed as an appetizer, but enough for a meal for me, that wasn't the typical fish only, theirs included shrimps and scallops.  It's tasty, but again, as expected.  Of course, I sampled the dishes the rest of my party ordered, and the rice, the beans, the fajita - all of them were good, but as expected.  

They have a limited early bird dinner selection, which would save you  a dollar or two off ordering a similar item off the regular menu.  

All in all, a satisfying meal, and not too bad on the pocketbook. And it's conveniently located inside the Orleans casino.
