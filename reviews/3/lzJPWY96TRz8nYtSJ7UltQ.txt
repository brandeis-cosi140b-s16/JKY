We just happen to come across this place and we stopped here for lunch. We were group of 5 guys and we got some good food and it was heavy (comments from other guys). I wasn't too hungry so just grabbed some chips with queso and a fish taco. The taco was pretty good, the queso definitely wasn't good. Not worth it but the chips were pretty good.
