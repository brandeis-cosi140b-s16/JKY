We went on a Sunday. Didn't know ahead of time there was a brunch. The Server was pushing the brunch pretty hard and seemed put out that we wanted a menu.  Service was very slow in every aspect from bringing us some chips to preparing and serving our food. We don't like buffets and it seemed like they weren't prepared for folks wanting table service.
