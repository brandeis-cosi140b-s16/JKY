Service was decent.  Food was o.k.
My daughter had the kid's mexican plate with taco.  Appeared to be standard Phoenix Mexican fair.  My son had the kid nachos, cheese was a little over cooked.  My wife had the enchilada with sour cream sauce, she said it was o.k.  I had the fish tacos, cilantro lime rice, and grilled vegetables.  The vegetables and cilantro lime rice were amazing. The fish tacos were good.  I've never had fish tacos with cheese before, and I didn't really care for it.  Debated sending it back but it wasn't that big of a deal.

The placards and menus had grime on them.  That was a little alarming.  Other than that it was good.  Price was right too, $24 for a family of four-no complaints here on that.  One of those places we would go back too, but probably not be like oh le'ts go to On the Border.
