I've been here quite a few times, mostly for the $1 Margarita/$2 Taco nights on Tuesday.  They're both decent but with the price, you can't complain.  I'm a fan of the pastor and chorizo tacos personally.  I've also had the nachos and a burrito here as well before and likewise, I wouldn't say this is truly authentic Mexican cuisine but it gets the job done.

This place at night is also quite fun.  Karaoke on Saturday nights is done pretty well although get there somewhat early if you want to request a song.  Overall the drinks are alright, nothing exceptional good or bad comes to mind.

Overall, I'd say come here and take advantage of the daily deals.  For its price and location on State St. it gets the job done.

TIPS: 
- 10 dollar minimum at the bar with a credit card.
- Free 68 oz. Margarita on your birthday with purchase of food which is more than enough.
