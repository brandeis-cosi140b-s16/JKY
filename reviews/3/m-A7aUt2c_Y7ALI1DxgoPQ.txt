The place is certainly a hole in the wall joint! I ordered the paradise burger with bacon and everything else. It was a good burger that wasn't greasy or falling apart by the time I got it home. The veggies on it make it taste a little lighter, so your not feeling like a slug after you eat it. The fries that I ordered were pretty bad. It was like they dropped the whole bottle of season salt on them. I'm sure the fries would be really good with light salt on them. Overall, its a good burger joint, that didn't live up to the hype from my family. I'm sure ill try it again later on, and give it a second look.
