100x better than chipotle or the like. Tortillas are made fresh, everything tastes fresh and flavorful. I had the burrito made enchilada style with hot sauce and cheese, baked. Few downsides - it's a little pricier than competitors, the salt level is on the high side for the meat, and some of the staff can be rude. But it's totally worth it for the food that you get.
