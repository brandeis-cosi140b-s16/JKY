Pretty simple. Food is OK not good not bad but OK. The line is insane........part of the schtick of chipotle. OK I get it. Now all is well except...the first line employee you get to was sweating profusely and pushing his glasses up and touching his sweaty face without changing his gloves...YIKES !!!!. Food and line is the same at all of the Chipotles. That 1 employee ruined the experience.....ugggh.
