Totally decent, fast Mexican food. 
The salads and tacos are good, but recently I've been stuck on the chicken enchiladas. (Don't forget to order extra verde sauce to cover the rice.) The employees check in with you at regular intervals during the food prep process to make sure you want the added pico, lettuce and cheese, etc... (and you do!:))
I've never had anything but friendly service here, but I almost always end up at Zaba's instead when I'm craving a quick Mexican treat. Cafe Rio just doesn't always taste as fresh as I would hope for. But with the frequent dining card deals and the huge portions there's no denying it's filling food at a good price.
