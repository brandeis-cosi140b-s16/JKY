Went here on a Saturday mid-afternoon and were pleased to hear that buckets (6) of beer were only $20 - NOWHERE I found on the strip had buckets for less than $35 so that was a nice price break!

We had THE BEST server... very cool, conversational, fun and handsome.  We really enjoyed our time with him.  

We each ordered a chicken and a beef taco.  The flavor of the tacos was good and it was great to see a place claiming to serve Mexican food ACTUALLY USE MEXICAN CHEESE!   But $13 for two tacos was a little steep, regardless of how good they are.

Overall, my experience seems to be better than some on here...but YES it is a tourist trap.  And if I could offer a suggestion - when in Vegas - try your hardest to avoid female servers/waitresses/bartenders.  They are all so sick of drunk tourist and/or businessmen hitting on them non-stop that they all have a chip on their shoulder.  Avoid them.
