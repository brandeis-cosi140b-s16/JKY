We were bar hopping in the area while waiting to pickup our Son from a birthday party...this was our first stop.  There's a small bar on the left side of the restaurant where you can saddle up for a few drinks and some grub.  I had a couple of glasses of Wine and tried the Chips & Salsa.....not bad.

The bar is pretty small, seats about 8-10 people.  The restaurant seems cool, woud like to come back and try some food.  If we lived closer to Anthem, we would.  The bartender was pretty cool....she's from New York and had some great stories to tell.

Overall, a pretty cool spot to hangout for a few drinks.
