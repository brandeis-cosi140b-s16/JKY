Just left this business and I ordered the 12 piece with the sides. I got everything but the side salad which I ordered first. The place was a mess, the self serve area was absolutely dirty. its disgusting! I had to keep asking for condiments not available for reach instead of "do you need anything else" the girl at this location at this time was my cashier, not attentive at all. poor customer service and a lot of talking. Review your cashier and put her on more training because I dont think she can handle a simple job at your location.
