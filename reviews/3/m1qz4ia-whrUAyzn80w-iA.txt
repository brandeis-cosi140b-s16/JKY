I'm a regular at Pepe's - not by choice, but because it's my hubby's taco stand of choice. Their asada is really good - but I'm a super nacho kind of gal, and they don't use shredded cheese which I prefer. Their prices have steadily gone up over the years too, unlike Molcasalsa and Robertos. 

My personal favorite is the carne asada torta - un-freaking-believably delicious!!! The Mexican coke with the pure sugar ain't bad either! MMMMmmmmmmmmm good!
