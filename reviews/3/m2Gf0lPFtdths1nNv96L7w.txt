We arrived just at closing. I asked if we were too late. They let us in and took our order. I think the guy at the cash register taking orders was new because he had to double check everything with the cook. We were seated ad a table next to a floor fan. This was a good thing because the air conditioning was either broken or turned off. We got our food. It was very good for the price. What the ambiance lacks, the food makes up for. My advice, order take out.
