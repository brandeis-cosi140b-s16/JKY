Lured in today by the $1 burrito special with Smart Shopper Card. The staff was very friendly, the place was clean, and the food was good. I'm not sure who copied who (Panchero's or Chipotle) but for Americanized, corporate Burritos, this place is faaaaaaaaaaaarr better than Chipotle, and I like their hours.
