Now that this place is no longer Cabo, it seems like they simplified it. Menu is now 2 pages: front side is appetizers and back side is entrees. Food comes out in large portions and pricing is very reasonable and cheaper than Cabo was. The only problem I ran into here was their short staffing...we sat at the bar which only had a single bartender so drinks and food took forever to get to us including our chips and salsa. On another note, the food was great and so was the salsa so I will probably be returning in the future
