As a newly-opened establishment, Panchero's is still trying to find its groove.  Plenty of staff were manning the counters during a recent visit with my boyfriend, so our food was prepared in a timely fashion.  However, 2 different employees made our burritos, and I'd say that there was some inconsistency in technique: his was flat and floppy, mine was stout and compact.  I see the same differences at other made-to-order places (like Subway), so that might not be a fair criticism.

In terms of complaints from other Yelpers about time and efficiency, I admit that Chipotle edges out Panchero's, but the additional minute or two required to put together a burrito didn't seem unreasonable.  The time delay might be more problematic during meal crunch times; not sure that Chipotle is much better considering their lines of 20+ students when school is in session.

I can't complain about food quality, especially for fast food.  Tortillas are pressed and cooked at the time of your order, which is kind of fun to watch.  I think their rice differs from the lime-cilantro recipe, but I couldn't discern any specific flavor, either.  The grilled meats and veggies are tasty, and you are offered your choice of standard toppings: pico de gallo, corn salsa, tomato salsa, sour cream, guacamole, etc.  When I requested a little more rice or salsa, employees loaded up my burrito without complaint or extra charges.   Before wrapping up your burrito, they use small spatulas to mix together ingredients so that each bite is a "perfect" mix of everything.

For local folk who don't have the patience for the student crowds in campustown, Panchero's is a fine alternative to Chipotle.  Prices, food quality, and environment are comparable.  Their fresh-made tortillas are a nice touch, but I'm not sure they make much of a difference in terms of flavor.
