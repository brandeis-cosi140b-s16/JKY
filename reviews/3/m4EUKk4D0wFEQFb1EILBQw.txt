Wife and I went here to experience the newest Mexican restaurant in our area.  Having been a fan of Agave which had previously been at this location we surely thought they must have closed for something better, this was not the case.  The menu seemed somewhat limited, they did not have burritos on the menu and had a quesadilla listed as a main dish.  They had Mexican Hamburgers listed which are just Tortas you could get at Roberto's.  

We ordered some chips and salsa, there was nothing special about them and they showed $3.00 on menu.  The medium hot salsa was more like a paste as opposed to regular salsa.  I ordered the chicken fajitas ($14.95) and the wife had grilled mahi mahi tacos ($12.95) for three small tacos.  The waiter said there was not a creamy sauce on the tacos when in fact there was.  The service was good but staff didn't seem too knowledgable about the menu. The wait for food didn't seem very long but it was a Thursday night and they weren't the busiest.  When my fajitas came out they came with 3 small tortillas which didn't appear to be enough to fit the fajitas in so I had to ask for more.  The wife enjoyed her fish tacos and also had a skinny margarita to drink which was good but she said was a little light on the tequila.  The menu was a little lackluster with limited options.

We were under the impression the rice and beans came with both meals and when we inquired to the bus boy he said he wasn't sure because it was his first day there.  I was going to tell him it was my first day there as well.  

All in all the food was alright and the prices were a little higher than what you would expect.  The interior didn't look too much different than Agave but maybe a little more decor.  There was an outside seating area off the bar with several fire places which wouldn't be a bad place for drinks when it warmed up a little more.  If we go back it will be just for drinks.
