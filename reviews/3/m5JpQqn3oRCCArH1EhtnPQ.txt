I wanted to love this place. I had been dying to try it since it opened.

We got here early...like maybe around 6:20 or so on a Friday. It seemed pretty slow upon arrival. There were not many people inside or outside. But when we said we had two people for dinner, the host said, "do you have reservations tonight?" No...

Then she said the restaurant was full with reservations! What! I've worked in the service industry since I was 16 years old. Unless it is Mother's Day or Christmas Eve or something, I have never heard of a restaurant reserving practically the entire place out. (The night we went was not a holiday or special occasion). So, that turned me off. We got a table on the patio, which was fine, but I couldn't believe that.

The food was pretty good, which made up for the just ok mojito and the reservations full restaurant. I got a special for the night...lamb sweetbread with sweet potato tacos. The tacos were pretty bomb. The meal was served with two tacos and a side of rice and beans. The rice and beans were really good (a bit too spicy for me...I'm a spice wuss), and the tacos were filling and not skimpy on ingredients.

I was disappointed at the lack of variety on the menu. But the meals we got were good, nevertheless. My date got some kind of like rolled thing with mole sauce on top, and he said it was very good and some kind of sweet. Sounded and looked awesome. His dish came with three rolled up thingies and a side of rice and beans. I kind of wished I had ordered that until I tried my own and liked it, too.

So...hm...Verde, I'm just not sure whether to like you just yet! I would have to come back and try another menu item, as I'm not sure if I'm a fan of the menu since I only tried a daily special. I would come back.
