First time going to Moe's. I went solely based off of seeing it on Undercover Boss. Their menu is very diverse. I ended up ordering the chicken quesadilla. It was very good. A little pricey, but good. 

They were consistent with saying "welcome to Moe's" every time someone walk through the door. At times it did lack energy. But personally, if I work there I would get tired of saying it myself.

Overall good experience.
