I know there's no rule book somewhere that says Mexican food ought to be cheap and fast, but I feel like it's a given considering the ingredients... right? Add to my wild assumption living in the southwest for 6 and half years and I grew to learn that if I was going out for Mexican, it wasn't going to be a long dinner experience and I wouldn't have to shell out a lot of bucks. Haberno's holds true on both accounts. They're quick (as you essentially watch them assemble food before your eyes) they're cheap, a five spot will buy you lunch, but in my opinion they lack flavor. I'm all for loading up some tacos with salsa, but I also think meat should be seasoned so you don't need to dredge everything in pureed tomato. I'm up for giving them another shot, but others in town bring the flavor these guys lack.
