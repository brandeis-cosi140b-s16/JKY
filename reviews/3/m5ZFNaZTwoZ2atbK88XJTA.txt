the steak tacos are very flavorful, the fish tacos flavorful, the onion rings pretty good, they offer some unique salsa. straight up good food.

the waiters/severs/bartenders are hit or miss. some have great personalities and some have very poor customer service or act snobby. gorgeous women work there but some seem antisocial. 

if you are from out of town dont happen to order water be warned this place does not have decent distilled or filtered water, and usually they don't care and will push thier 4 Dollar glass bottled water. 

awesome food, but customer service is inconsistent.  4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the customer service
