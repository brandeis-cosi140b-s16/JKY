Since the line at Chipotle was almost 30 people long yesterday, I decided to check out this Moe's instead. I was surprised to be the only person in line after seeing the insanity at their Mexican food competitor across the street. 

I ordered a Chicken Taco and Queso with Chips. The Chicken Taco was dismal. The quality of ingredients was much lower than what you would get at Chipotle. I was also barely able to eat the taco since it was so overfilled. However, the queso was delicious! I have been dieting, but I couldn't stop eating the wonderfully rich and smooth while mildly spicy cheesiness. Mmmm! 

This restaurant really deserves only 2 stars, so they are lucky that their queso is so fantastico!
