Ambiance and staff are a huge part of an experience, and for a "foodie," can even make up for the lack of punch in flavor, which is very much the case here. Sol Diablo is a great new little spot #1 because their staff are friendly and attentive, we enjoyed a late Sunday dinner here and were welcomed and greeted by almost every one working. Our waitress was friendly, and quick. The decor is on-point, exactly what you'd expect from a trendy new spot near the college. The food, not so much. We had a decent size group so the manager provided us with complimentary chips and salsa  as we waited for our food. The best menu item was the Chicken Skewers, tender and flavorful, the slaw it laid on was lacking, tasted bland and unfinished. The tacos were similarly disappointing, Chicken was dry, actually made it hard to swallow, and the tortilla completely fell apart after one bite, each of us ended up using forks to eat our tacos. The Carne Asada Burrito was decent, again, just not a lot of flavor, but a good portion. "Mexican" food can be so basic meat, cheese, tortillas, beans, and rice, there really isn't much to it. The fact is you can get it on almost every corner in AZ, and you can get it for dirt cheap, my suggestion, is go to Sol for the atmosphere, not the food. Overall, I'd love to give the spot another chance, as they are still so new, I hope they find a way to step up the food.
