Average in every way, Don Pedro reminds me of a place my cousins love in Texas. It's as white-America as you can get with still having Hispanic people work at your restaurant.

Cheesy decor? Check!

Big menu with essentially 10 items rearranged? Check!

Waiter that hits on me in front of my mom and sister? Check, and GROSS!

Seriously, this place is OK but do yourself a favor and come on down to Central Ave and East Charlotte - I promise you there are 2873298362879632 places that are better, fresher, more authentic and less likely to sexually harass you.
