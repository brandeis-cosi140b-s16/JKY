Looking for something different down in Pineville, we stumbled into this place - good thing, because there is almost no way to find it unless you are really looking. There is next to no signage that will lead you to believe that there is a restaurant here, and it looks like it's abandoned.

While the inside isn't much to write home about, the service is actually quite good and very friendly. Food is brought out promptly as well. Good thing, because it doesn't give you much time to look around and run from the surroundings.

While the food may not win many contests, it is definitely hearty and gets you full, with plenty to take home. It is perhaps not authentic, but it is worth a visit if you're in the area. The chipotle crema especially was tasty on a crisp day, as it had a nice bite to it.
