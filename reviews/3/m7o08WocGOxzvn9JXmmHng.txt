grrr can't recomend this place any more....

First 2 times I whent suprisingly good. Chicken Quesedia...better than taco bell ok ambiance...

last to times....
DJ from LA ment  no room to eat or drink....fire mashall shut down packed.... 

and once had the pink tacos and wasn't as good as I remeber....

so a chain that doesn't have consistancy? may be I was drinking more on the days the food was good?
