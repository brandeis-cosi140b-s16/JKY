Great food. Not great atmosphere. But when you are with good company, that part matters less. 

Pros: 
chips, salsa, bean dip, yum 
tasty tomato base soup for free, yum 
good margaritas and they made my specialty margarita correctly! 
friendly and attentive staff 

Cons: 
odd decor - clowns....creepy 
odd floor plan 
right when you walk in you can see the nasty kitchen lights because the wall around the kitchen is low 

I had a poblano cream chicken dish with rice and beans. OMG. TDF! I couldn't stop eating. 

We will be back! I just recommend a little redesign/redecorating. Hire someone to help with that. Don't just let the wife/daughter of the owner handle it. A professional who can help make it more appealing and attractive and updated.
