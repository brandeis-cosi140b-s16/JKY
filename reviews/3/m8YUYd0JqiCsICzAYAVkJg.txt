There's a scene in the dark knight. 
I've seen it like two thousand times. 
Seriously, I've seen it a lot. 
When I was a kid I watched Star Wars over and over again. 
It was on cable and my parents liked to leave me at home alone for really long stretches. 
I watched it so much, I memorized pretty much all the dialogue and songs in the movie. 
I'm old now, though. 
So I calculate I'll need to watch this batman movie at least eight thousand more times to memorize it all. 
Anyway, the scene where the joker tries to shoot the mayor; the only glimpse we get of him without makeup. 
That was about the time I ordered. 
About two minutes later, literally, my food arrived. 
It felt like I had traveled back in time and ordered before I arrived. 
God damn I wish that was possible. 
The self I send back would always be waiting in line. 

So I got nervous. 
Like, this one meal could ruin my whole trip to Vegas. 
It still might.
I'm writing this waiting for my check. 
But the food was decent enough.
The service was friendly, and very boobalicious. 
Oh, there's was also a very fit, attractive male also. 
Vegas must grow em on trees or something. 
Good looking people, not hot guys. What?

The bottom line is, if everything else is crowded and you're so hungry you could eat a dead rat off a sewer grate, then try this joint. 
Otherwise, earl of sandwich is right around the corner.
