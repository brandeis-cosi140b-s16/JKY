I had been eating at Federico's for a while.  The food's pretty good, especially the red chicken tacos with that spicy green sauce.  They do sometimes mess up orders and take a while to get your food to you, not regularly though.  I don't really have a whole lot of complaints about the place... until now.  The service is usually good at Federico's, but not when I went there on the 12th.  

After a long time away from the place, I went back to get some of those tacos.  I ordered and gave the clerk my card.  Unfortunately, the ticket printed up as declined.  She said, "Declined!", and smirked at me like it was hilarious.  I looked at my card to see if it was the right one and asked her to try it again.  Same thing.  "Declined!"  Big smirk.  I didn't get upset or anything.  I told her I was going to the bank and I left (I found out later that a gas station put a hold on my account that wasn't released until later that night).

I don't know if that happened to anyone else, but they need to train that lady to have a better attitude when it comes to customer service.  I'm sure she came off the same way to somebody else at some point.  All she had to do was tell me my card was declined instead of nearly laughing in my face like we were at a comedy club.  Like I said, I wasn't all that upset about it, but now I'm a little more than irked and won't be going back any time soon, especially considering there's a fairly new Filiberto's down the street that's much closer to me than Federico's.  If that's the way they let their staff treat customers, then they don't deserve my business.

Sorry guys, you blew it!
