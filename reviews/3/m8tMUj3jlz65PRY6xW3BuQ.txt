I have been to Sir Veza's two times now and I am only mildly impressed. The service has been pretty good but the food is just okay. My fiance has really enjoyed the burger's here but I have not liked either of the items I have tried. On our first visit I tried the Johnny Las Vegas roll which is kind of like a sushi style roll but it's not seafood. Instead it is a mixture of chicken, cream cheese, jalapeno, chipolte sauce and maybe a couple of other items thrown in all wrapped up in a chimichanga type of wrap. I did not care for this at all. It kind of tasted like chicken salad to me which I cannot stand. If you like chicken salad, you might like this, if you hate mushy texture, you will hate it.

I did also try the La Bomba soft pretzel with strips of poblano peppers and swiss cheese and served with nacho cheese dipping sauce and mustard, I did like this a lot. On our second visit which was on New Years day I tried the Sonoran Dog. I did not care for this either. For me the hot dog itself was way too salty. The beer battered fries are however delicious. On New Years day they also had a DJ at 7:30pm who was just bumping beats the entire time we were there. It seemed like he was trying to turn the place into a night club. The music selection was terrible, with rap songs melding into country. It was extremely off putting. My fiance and I could not carry a conversation because of the mini night club situation. The DJ was the only one dancing and was clearly enjoying himself very much.

If it were up to me I probably would not come back. My fiance does love the burger here so we will probably give it another shot. If we do come back I will try the tacos on the next visit. We will also probably come early in the day on a weekday. I'm not up for the rap/country/pop mash up night club.
