I always like to say super burrito is super at 3 am but not so super the next morning.  Jokes aside... It's great for that past midnight bite to eat, but with places on 68th street like tacos Jalisco or the amp market open they fall way short.  They do give you good value and solve hunger issues but they are kind of like the last option for Mexican in south Scottsdale.
