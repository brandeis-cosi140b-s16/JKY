Tried the restaurant for dinner. Food was good and pretty authentic Mexican food. Prices were very reasonable and beer was cold. $2.50 for a draft beer is a great price. Had the fajitas and they were certainly acceptable. Limited beans, rice, guacamole and sour cream though. Worth a stop if you are in the area.
