I ate here as part of a work function.  They have amazing chips and salsa.  That was probably the best part of my meal.  I love Mexican food and could eat it literally every day - but I found this to be a very very Americanized version of Mexican food.  It was "Eh" - not bad, not great...just "Eh".
The best part of the meal were the chips, they were delicious and the salsa was amazing.  I like spicy food and the salsa delivered - but everything else was so mild and just forgetable. There were a lot of us in the group and our food kept coming out in waves.  The first batch of people served started eating and were more than half way done their meal by the time the third wave was served.  I believe our large group plus the large number of diners that were already there very likely overwhelmed the kitchen staff.  We had a reservation, perhaps they could have scheduled a few more people.  The server herself was good, she was on the spot with drinks, refills and more chips.  I don't know how much the bill was because the check was picked up by my boss, but if I were paying for dinner, I don't know that I would come back here if other options were available.
