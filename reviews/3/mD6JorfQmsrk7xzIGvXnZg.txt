Ate here last sat.  It was decent for a chain.  Had a green chili burro and it was good.  Definitely better than Taco Bell!!  Elmers and Reynosos really set the bar high for Mexican food restaurants, so it's hard for other places to compare.  Clean environment, speedy service, and service with a smile.
