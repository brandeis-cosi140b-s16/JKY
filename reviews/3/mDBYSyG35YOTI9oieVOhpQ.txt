Have always wanted to try this place and finally did. I wasn't very in impressed upon walking in especially with the hostess girls at the front they are not very friendly. My 3 friends and I decided to order...I ordered the shredded chicken tacos...the food came out kinda fast. The tacos were good and so was the rice and beans but wasn't worth the $16. I understand it's a restaurant in a hotel but it's overpriced I can get the same meal at El torito for less. Remember to use your mlife card for points.
