I moved here a year ago and have been to this place several times.  If I liked spicy spicy food, I'd probably give 4-5 stars.  I have only had one thing from there because it's not spicy, and that's the grande burrito.  The burrito is delicious, but everything else I've tried there has set my mouth on fire and I've had to hand it off to someone else.  For being one of the few sit down restaurants in Laveen, it's one of the better choices.  The service isn't all that great, and we never know who our server is (it's usually 4-5 different people dropping stuff off or taking orders throughout one meal) and we have to ask for things a lot, but all in all, it's a place I've been a repeat customer at
