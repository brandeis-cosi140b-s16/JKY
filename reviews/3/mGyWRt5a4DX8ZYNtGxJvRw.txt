The family and I decided to check this place out. Service was expedient and friendly.  Loved the hot bar and maybe my palate can handle some heat. The ones with the frownies didn't reflect the grimace.  Lol. Food was good and priced right.  The kids meals are hearty. All and all we will keep in our rotation.
