I like the Rokerij. The food is good and the atmosphere is great.

 The service is only so-so. You'd think that a place that charged in the 20-30 dollar range for a plate of food would have top level service, but they don't. It's not that it's terrible, it's just terribly mediocre. If it weren't for the great food, I'd probably not visit as often. 

I don't want to dissuade anyone from going there by any means - but I do think that you have to have your expectations in the right place before going, otherwise you may be disappointed.

Still - a solid 3 stars. Check out all of the other great reviews that this place has received.
