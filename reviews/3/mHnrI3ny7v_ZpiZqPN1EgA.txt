Another beautiful day in paradise . . . and so we decided to have an outdoor lunch today . . . and with that said, we thought we would try this place . . . we had a ball.

We were greeted promptly after we chose a table . . . and our menus and drinks followed shortly there after . . . I ordered Juan's Famous Tacos with Rice and Beans.  While the tacos were good . . . I really would have liked more chorizo in the taco, so they were a kind of bland for me.  There rice and beans were very good though.

My only problem was that the tables were tacky . . . not sure if it was from not wiping down the tables well . . . or the fact that tables we wiped down and the cleaning product just mad the table paint tacky.  I am hoping the latter.

I will be back . . . but next time . . . I will definitely try something other than the tacos . . .
