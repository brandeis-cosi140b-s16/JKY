If there are 3 1/2 stars, i would give them that. The good? - Authentic Tacos Al Pastor on the gyro spit. The bad? What the hell are they filling the tacos up with crap for??? People, let me give you a tip - 86 the guacamole 86 the 'cabbage' (cabbage? really?? wtf???) just do the meat, the cilantro and chopped onion. Put some salsa to taste, and a lime, i personally love the lime on it, but some only add a little. Pineapple (ONLY if requested) and THEN you have a REAL taco Al pastor. 

Once I requested the 'traditional' style - it was just as good as one i would get in Mexico City - albeit the meet was a little on the toasty side (turn the burner DOWN!)

Didn't eat anything else there - finally found the first al-pastor on the spit place in north America. I sense an Al pastor revolution cometh.
