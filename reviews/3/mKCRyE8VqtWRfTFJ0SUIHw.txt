Kudos to Chevy's staying open on Christmas Day.  After an afternoon movie with Mom, we drove around Mesa looking for any establishment that was open.  

Chevy's, while good, is only a few steps up from eating at Taco Bell for me.  I ordered the "Build Your Own" combo with the cheese enchilada, chicken taco, refried beans, and rice.  Again, it was good and the price wasn't bad (about $10), but the flavors were fairly bland.  I kept adding the complementary salsa onto the meal to kick-it up a bit.  

The service was great.  The place was also kind of empty... No surprise that Chevy's isn't the place to hang on Christmas Day.
