I asked if the have Flautas because I didn't see it on the menu and she said yes we order that plus some supreme asada fries extra crispy, mnd you we are in the drive thru and wasn't watching the put it together. When I got home they gave us taqitos and the fries were not well done at all and no forks or napkins. The food was OK bur not what I wanted. The lady was real nice tho. Sorry I normally don't do poor reviews but I'm a little frustrated. Might just be me having a bad day :-/
