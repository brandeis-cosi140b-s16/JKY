I have gone to this place throughout my life. The service has been on and off (especially in the restaurant section.) Waiting for a server can make you crazy. The food also varies but the prices are reasonable and I always make exceptions for locally-owned businesses. Perhaps my biggest issue, however, is their random hours of business. Never, I mean never, go there unless you called ahead of time verify they are open for business (and their hours.) Often time, in the summer, they are actually closed for months before re-opening sometime after Labor Day.
