Had an early lunch here today with a friend of mine. Chips were great as well as the salsa (salsa had a good flavor). I had the white cheese enchaladas with rice and beans, and they were really good. My friend had the "special" burrito and said that it was good as well. She did say the potatoes seemed a little dry. Service was good as well. I would have given 4 stars but I do not like the fact that if you use a card to pay they charge you an extra 50 cents. Seems a little crazy in this day and age. Other than that my experience was great. Not gormet (this is Flornce after all) but good. Will return.
