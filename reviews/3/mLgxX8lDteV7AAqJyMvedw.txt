El Pollo Loco to me is quazi healthy Mexican fast food.... Wow... was that a mouthful. What I mean by that is their chicken is grilled, not deep fried and they have a pretty healthy menu when it comes to fast food restaurants. 

Nothing to spectacular to say about this location other than it is the closest Pollo Loco to my house and I tend to go through cycles of either loving this stuff or hating it. Go figure.
