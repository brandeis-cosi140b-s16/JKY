I can't lie. I went here because of the hilarity of the place's name... and Serrano's is closed on Sundays.

Having a strong hankering for some cheap American-ized Mexican food, we went here on a Sunday afternoon is hopes that La Fonda would be a lady and put out something good. Although the interior is pretty and they have a sperate dining room and lounge area which is nice so you don't have to sit with screaming children.

I guess we just ordered the wrong dish because neither of us were exceptionally impressed. Now the salsa was kick ass but the taco salad and chimi were not. I think I picked the wrong option with putting ground beef in it.

What also was unimpressive was that the salad with gac and sour cream added was $12. Ugh. I'd honestly give La Fonda a 2 score but our waitress was very nice and pleasant.
