To sum up......fast, good, filling, and friendly.  We stop in here every so often to get a quick bite with some Mexican flare.  They have your normal staples and nothing on the menu will surprise you.  I usually will get the "Pollo Magnifico" which is your standard pollo fundido.  It's priced at 8.75 which feels a little high, but just a little.  It comes with beans and rice which are perfectly fine and taste good.  I will say the guys who work here are always friendly and do not hesitate to help you if you need something additional.  They have a small salsa bar and self serve chips which is nice.  Julio's Too is what it is and delivers right about where you'd expect it to.  It's not bad at all.
