There's this smell as soon as you walk in that is kind of unpleasant.  Bathroom-esque.  Its weird because I actually went to the bathroom and it doesn't really smell.  Its actually pretty nice in there.  They have to do something about that smell....

I'm not sure what all the excitement was over the chips and salsa.  The chips were not as greasy as some places and actually a little thicker.  The red salsa was pretty good, but wouldn't say the best in this area.  (Los Olivos takes that prize).  There's this other creamy weird looking sauce they put out as well with the chips.  Not very good at all.  They should just replace that with the verde sauce in the sauce bottle that they bring with the tacos.

I do agree that the plating's very well done here.  We got the hot wings which were solid.  Not the best but definitely not the worst.  Cooked well, not too small, good sauce and good amount of sauce.  The wings probably could have used a little seasoning to them to the next level.  The carnitas street tacos were also pretty solid.  Not sure if the grilled onions work here..  I think I would've preferred just the pico de gallo type topping on these.  They were really good though, esp with the salsa verde and the salsa rojo (we asked for more to eat the tacos with)

All in all, I think I'll go back and try an entree.  Might see another star......  but I'll probably wait for one of those mailing coupon deals.  The prices aren't crazy, but given the hh food I'd rather not gamble big on this one.  The hh prices aren't great either - about $5 for pretty much every choice, alcohol's a bit better at about $3.
