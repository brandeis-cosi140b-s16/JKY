They really need to pick a side. Are you fast food or not?  You order from the counter like fast food, and the service quality is definitely fast food, (would it kill you to smile?), but the prices are restaurant prices and the time it takes to get your food is more reminiscent of a sit down restaurant. They do bring the food to you on regular plates but the food isn't anything that wowed me.  I definitely wouldn't  say you shouldn't try it but I won't be rushing back.
