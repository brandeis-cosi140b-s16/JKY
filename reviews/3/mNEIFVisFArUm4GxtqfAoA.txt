It was better than Julioberto's (although they are basically the same thing), but I was still fairly unimpressed. The prices were also ridiculous for what you get. For what we paid we should have just gone to Chipotle, which I find to be much better. I got two burritos here and I was able to make my plate last for two meals, but the food was just OK. The drive thru also takes forever, which was irritating.
