"Sandwiches My Way"

March 16, 2012 I foot-cruised 16th Street searching for some of Phoenix' most prolific street artists.  Not taggers, gang bangers, not even illegals.  Artists expressing themselves on sanctioned walls, looking to be recognized, and maybe make a living.  

What's that got to do with Mexican sandwiches?  Breeze, Mesone, Griffin One, Stoec and I ate and rated the food.  

Actually, it has nothing to do with Tortas, since none of us had one.  We ate tacos, asada and conchinita burritos.  None of the servings were generous.  We must remember, expenses are skyrocketing at the production level so we'll get less food or higher prices.  Flavor, texture and sauce of my burrito mild and decent.  Ratings 3 - 3.5.  We also drank horchata, jamaica and ice tea.  Cost of the total meal - $47.00

Tortas El Guero itself is a clean, well decorated establishment.  It would have been great to all walk two blocks south of the new art, sit down and enjoy the surroundings, cool air and hospitaltiy of the Lom family.  Arturo Lom is a warm, friendly gentleman in a world where surliness and disrespect can kink one's day.  He made sure our take-out kit was fitted up with napkins, straws, sweet and low, and two capped salsa cups filled with sugar.  

Arturo and his wife said, "Come back for tortas, they are the BEST!"  The next Art Detour, I may make a detour to Tortas El Guero.  Maybe sooner.

BTW, the street art visionairies would like to get more into downtown.  Breeze's January work, "Phoenix Rising" in the alley between 1 N 1st and The Matador was selected from a group of proposals made to the real estate company managing or owning the building.  Personally, I'm all for roof murals to greet visitors to our fair city and provide delightful surprises to people looking at aerial photos or satellite imagery in Google and other earths.
