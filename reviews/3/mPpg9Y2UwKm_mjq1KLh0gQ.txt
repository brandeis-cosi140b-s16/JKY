I've now been to Sandbar quite a few times, mostly b/c it's cheap, especially for Ladies Night on Thursdays. It's a good place for a group to meet as there is plenty of seating. I guess it's true what they say, however, you get what you pay for. The happy hour special for drinks make the margaritas $4, which is a great price, especially since they are kind of strong ... I recommend the frozen peach margarita! And as far as the food goes, it is mediocre. I've gotten the nachos & the mini chimes before. Only three stars because overall, it's alright .. nothing special.
