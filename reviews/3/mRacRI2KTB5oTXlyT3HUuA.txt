i eat here several times a month because it is convenient.  I love that it is clean, close and consistent.   the service always rocks. they are pleasant and kind.  however...the beans are undercooked...tortillas a bit sticky.  the hot sauce is lovely and flavorful though!  i continue to lunch here ...but i wish the food was a wee bit better.
