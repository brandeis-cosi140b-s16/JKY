It's Roberto's! What's there to complain about?! Not necessarily what I call "Mexican food"  but close enough. Beats Taco  Bell?!! ha ha! 

When visiting a Robertos its usually because either A. I'm hungover or B. huge craving for Carne Asada nachos. Nobody gets down on Carne Asada Nachos like Bertos! This location is close to work so I am seen here occasionally on a Monday or Friday during lunch. The cooks are friendly and nice and usually on top of their game. The establishment is somewhat clean, but can make some improvements. Floors are kinda dirty, tables are not always clean and their salsa bar is more often than not out/low on my favorite green salsa. Also, because I'm Mexican, i love to fill up the plastic sandwich bag with cucumbers and squeeze in a few limes.....well, their cucumbers are usually yellowish in color and not looking all that great! :-( Gave up on the idea that I will ever get these at this location.
