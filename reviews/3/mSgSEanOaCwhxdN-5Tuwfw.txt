Yep, I like it.  Another place I really only come to when my mom visits as she likes it.  I ordered the tortilla soup tonight and it was really good.  I'm also a fan of the cornbread they serve in lieu of same ole' chips and salsa.  But, I really love the shrimp and guac tostada bites.  Ordered it for my entree tonight and only $4.80-who knew happy hour apps were 1/2 price here!  Maybe most people.  Maybe I need to get out more.
