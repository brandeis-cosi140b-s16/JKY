I hate to offer a poor review but the guacamole was bland, my entr√©e was warm at best, and the kitchen made my son beef instead of the chicken tacos he ordered.  The waiter was kind enough to return the two meals, but my my entree came back microwaved and mushy.  Sadly, it was my husband's birthday.  While I appreciate the comped beer, it won't bring us back.
