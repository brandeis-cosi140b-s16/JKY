Excellent margarita, chips and salsa, but wouldn't go back for the food.  Our server, Ashely was great and the manager came by when she heard we were disappointed with the food and offered us something else.  As we weren't hungry we didn't take her up on her offer but appreciated that she came by.  It's very noisy in this restaurant, but if you're just looking for a drink and chips and salsa, go here.  We will return when we stay at the Marriott again, but will not order food.
