Came to this restaurant a few years back and I was not impressed so didn't come back.  However, my friends really wanted to go here and so I came with them.  The chips and salsa were pretty good, choice of regular or hot salsa!  I had the special of the day which was one fish and one steak soft taco with black beans.  It was a more healthy choice and I was glad that is what I ordered since Mexican food tends to sit in my stomach longer.  The service was good, hostess and server were most friendly.  My friends enjoyed their dishes especially the spinach enchilada which is a good choice for vegetarians.  Not bad for a neighborhood restaurant...
