The food is good. well your typical fast mexican food. But you need to watch what you order because a combo can cost more than if you piece your order. for example the# 22 combo witch is a the meat to carne asada they charge $2 more. if you order the carne asada chimichanga by itself its only $0.81 cents difference than the beef or chicken. So just be carefull guys. the cashier gives you old we do what the customer orders excuse.!
