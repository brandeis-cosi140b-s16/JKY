I've been to Bueno Burger about 5 times since it opened.  I agree with some of the other posters that they need to figure a few things out.  I was their today and received my Sonoran Dog on a sesame seed hot dog bun.  This was indeed very disappointing as it's just not the same.  The other complaint I have is that every time I go in they prepare the Sonoran Dog differently.  The first time they asked me for every ingredient that I wanted individually.  Then when it came to me it had a few things that I did not order.  The explanation that I was given is that there are certain staple ingredient that go on every sonoran dog (beans, onions, pico de gallo, jalapeno relish, mustard, and mayo).  They remade it they way I wanted it with no problem.  So the next time I ordered I remembered the staple items and ordered mine with the onions off.  It was fine.  Then today I ordered "a sonoran dog no onions substitute the pico with fresh tomatoes", and it came with beans, sour cream, and tomatoes.  There was no jalapeno relish, mustard, or mayo.

I will continue to go because I love the food.  But getting the kinks out would definitely help business.
