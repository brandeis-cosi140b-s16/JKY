I don't get what all the fuss is about. Perhaps I expected too much? We came in on a Tuesday around 1:30pm and there was a 15 minute wait. We figured it must be good! Our waiter was friendly and interactive. We ordered two lunch specials  with a beef taco and beef flautas. Although not rave-worthy, the meat was great and stands out from other places. Unfortunately, the main reason why we won't be back is because of the hostess. She was incredibly rude! She had a "I'm too good to serve you" attitude. At one point, I thought we had left our daughters diaper bag in the lobby so I went back to check but didn't see it. The lobby was empty and the hostess was standing there looking at a piece of paper. I approached her and explained that I may have left a bag on the bench and if perhaps she had seen it. She never bothered to look up at me as I was talking until after I finished and all she said was "excuse me?" Really? You just ignored me this whole time? It sucks when the food is good but the staff is the reason why they've lost your business.
