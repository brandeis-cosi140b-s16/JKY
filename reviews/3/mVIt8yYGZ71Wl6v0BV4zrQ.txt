Very inexpensive and tasty, but very TINY tacos al pastor. I mean hobbit-baby sized. Think if White Castle made tacos.  

They were good at least. Everything else was bland; particularly the not-at-all spicy salsa. My Mexican associate gave it a 5 out of 10 for taste and authenticity. Not being Mexican, I can't speak to authenticity, but I can say I don't like boring food, no matter if it's authentic.
