Came here for the first time because thats where vegas painting parties was doing our painting. They have very limited happy hour menu, got the taquitos and they were amazing. Didnt care for drinks offered on happy hour menu, waitress recommended a yummy coconut margarita . It was delucious, yummy.  Pricey but worth it. It was so good that i took my husband back on another day JUST to try this amazing margarita. Went to the bar said i had a yummy margarita with coconut in it last time, ordered 2 girl acted like she knew exactly what i was talking about got the drinks, they didnt look the same, but tried it anyway. But wasnt the amazing drink i told my husband about. Showed the bartender the picture of the one i had last time and she said ohhhh that is not on the menu. Thats a drink i made up. And i told her well that the one i wanted. She made it and it was delicious. We were charged for all three margRitas thougb 30 bucks. Left the 2 full margaritas there and left. Very disappointing. How am i suppose to know its a drink not on the menu and how am i suppose to order it in the future?
