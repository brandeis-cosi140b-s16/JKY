Not bad at all.

We had the red chili con carne burro and mexican pizza.  The meat in the burro could have been shredded a bit more but the flavor was nice.  I also like the little bed of shredded lettuce it comes on to help with the heaviness of the plate.  The Mexi pizza could have been a little easier on cheese and sliced olives all over it would have been nice.  But it was tasty enough.

The service was very good by the helper/busboy person but the waiter was a little on the slow side.  I'd like to check out their happy hour.
