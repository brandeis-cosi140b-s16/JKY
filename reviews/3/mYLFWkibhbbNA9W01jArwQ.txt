It's OK Mexican food and the service is spotty at best. Sometimes we get attentive and personable servers, but more times we don't. 

The self-serve salsa is nice, as are a few of the dishes, but nothing stands out. Beware on the weekends or during major sporting events, the place gets crowded, rowdy and rude quick! So peek your head in and see what kind of crowd you have before you bring the kiddies. 

If you're looking for noisy, no kids, sometimes raunchy (and by raunchy I mean loud gals with the vocabulary that would make a sailor turned truck driver blush) atmosphere, decent Mexican food and are OK with spotty service since you are blending in as said loud gal or guy  - 4 stars. If you're looking for great Mexican food, consistent and NICE service where you can bring the kids - definitely 2. Thus the 3 star.
