I'm not going to lie to you, this food is nowhere near Mexican, but the enchilada suiza is delicious in it's own right (ignore the side dishes, blech!).  The margaritas are delicious, and if you go on half-price Thursdays, very reasonable.  They have a good price on their lunch menu.   I wouldn't say I recommend it necessarily if you are looking for authentic Mexican...buuut, eh, it's tasty once in a while.
