Drinks Only! 

I was recently in Vegas for a 3-day convention and stayed at the Monte Carlo. So every time I left the hotel to attend the convention I passed this place and hear good hip hop music blasting (Tribe Called Quest, EPMD, etc). My 2nd night there I'd decided to check it out after having a rough day. The menu wasn't spectacular, so I checked out the bar. Decided to get the Twisted Sister; the bartender hooked it up good because I was marinated for the rest of the night. So good that I went back the following night for another-made sure the same bartender was there. He hooked me up good again-this time I ordered chips and salsa. Chips were meh; it was served with 3 different types of salsa, which was cool. It was a slow night-no music-so I chilled at the bar and watched sports for about an hour. Highlight of the night: the bartenders were laughing at one the waitresses; she'd slipped and fell by the margarita bar. Bit the floor hard and hit her head. I told them that they were mean; they said she had it coming because prior to that she was being a bitch toward them. The broad was being over-the-top about it all, and kinda nasty at the waitresses helping her. I guess karma is a bitch, eh? 

3 stars only because the bar's cool and I heart the Twisted Sister....
