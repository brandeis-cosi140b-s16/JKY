FIrst time eating there today during lunch.  Other places were packed on Market Square so we went there.  I didn't know it existed.  Others led the way. 

There are a good amount of options on the lunch menu from $8 to $10.  The wait staff passes out menus and says "Do you want chips and salsa".  I have been to many Mexican restaurants that give it out for free.  Here they neglected to say that it is $2.50.  It was very crowded and it took 45 minutes for our meals to come out.  Everyone liked their meals in my group. I had a chicken Quesadilla.  

If you are looking for Mexican in downtown Pittsburgh, worth trying out the place.
