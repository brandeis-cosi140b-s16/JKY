I really, REALLY want to give Juan Jaime's 4 Stars. They have an extended happy hour from 4-8PM (even on the weekends) which includes $4 house margaritas. Unfortunately, the food has been inconsistent our last few visits. I would stick to HH drinks, chips and salsa! If you do that, you can't go wrong.
