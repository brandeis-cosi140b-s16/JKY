First of all, I have never had anything bad as far as food goes.  The service...not so great.  I brought a friend from out of town here for lunch(the place was almost empty), considering I had been raving about the guacamole with lump crabmeat for days.  Ordered fresh tortillas to accompany...waited, and waited, and waited.  The guacamole was finished before they ever came. I was sitting on a wall and there was a huge delivery truck parked right behind me that left the engine running almost the entire meal.  It sounded like a jackhammer going off behind my head. No one really apologized, they just said he would move soon. The music was loud.  I got a headache.  My friends lunches came, and I waited, and waited, and waited some more for my soup.  They were finished before I ever received mine.  Is the food good? yes.  Is it the best in town?  No.  I suggest cruising on your 15 minutes of fame while the going is strong, because when you aren't the new, hot restaurant anymore...it's going to be time to improve on a few things.
