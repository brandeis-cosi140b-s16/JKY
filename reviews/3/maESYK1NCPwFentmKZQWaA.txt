I went through the drive-thru at this Taco bell at around 12:50pm on 6/20/2015

I wouldn't usually rate Taco Bell. Just following through to give a formal "good job, guy" to Charles who helped me out. 

He took the time to repeat my order on the intercom, clearly, enthusiastically, and convinced me to upgrade my order.

When I pulled up to the window, he repeated my order again, took my cash, changed my difference, filled my soda, handed me my order, all while taking at least 2 other orders from people behind me. No song and dance, no contrived social interaction. Just quick, efficient service that consumers are looking for from a fast-food operation. 

Takes enthusiasm and intelligence to operate at that capacity. 

Taco bell is Taco bell. Franchises that operate so that there is uniformity as an overall brand. Differences can only be subtle from franchise to franchise. A fundamental difference being the service you receive. 

Charles provided impeccable service that if practiced throughout the Taco Bell brand, would no doubt increase overall consumer favorability over competing brands.
