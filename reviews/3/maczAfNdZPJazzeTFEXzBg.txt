It wasn't good this time. BOOOOOO! Anyways, boyfriend went to get me a chicken bowl while I stayed in the car because little man was asleep. When we got home, I opened up my chicken bowl. First thing I notice.. Um where the heck is my lettuce? I know it's nothing but still. Chipotle can be pricey! Anyways, while I was eating it. Ummm I found one uncooked chicken. Like come on guys that shouldn't even happen at all. I was just so disappointed in them. Usually there good but lately they been slacking. Next time I'll try a different location, because they been slacking for reals!
