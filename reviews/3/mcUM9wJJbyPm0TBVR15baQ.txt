Food was flavorful, but the portions are too small to justify the price on the burritos and plates. My burro had about 6 or 7 layers of tortilla before I reached the carne asada and overall there was very little meat in it. Not really what I'm looking for in a $7 burro. There are too many places around that have much bigger portions and are just as tasty. The difference between me giving a 2 star and a 3 star is for the good salsa bar - much better than most of the already packaged salsitas you get at many other places.
