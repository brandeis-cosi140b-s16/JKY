Coasta Cantina is the new name for the restaurant Don Miguel's.  You still get the three types of dip with the chips, menu seems to be the same, and the specials seem to be the same.  I had the carnitas, and it was okay; the pork could have used more flavor, but it was okay.  It's just your typical corporate owned Mexican Restaurant, nothing more, nothing less.
