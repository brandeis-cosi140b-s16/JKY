The atmosphere and decor both definitely outdo the food at Pink Taco. I have been here a handful of times and never had a superb experience, the food is always just average, service is good, but the decor and vibe of the entire restaurant is what saves it from completely sinking. 

I went there for lunch today, I split a Chicken Tostada Salad with my co-worker and we both tried the Chicken Tortilla soup. The salad was just OK, but I will give the soup some props! It was perfectly made, with the right amount of ingredients to broth. Sometimes they put so much crap in soups trying to make it better and I think it ruins it, I didn't order chili I ordered soup! Their chips are also amazing, they make them there!

Other than wishing I could have had a Margarita on my lunch break today, I would go back for lunch or dinner, but more for the experience of being at the Hard Rock Hotel and enjoying good company, not so much for the food.
