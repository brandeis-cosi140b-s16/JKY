I heard from my coworkers this place just opened so I grabbed some take out before heading home after work. Place was cool, bartender and staff were friendly--not to mention waitresses were...um...muy caliente! I ordered the carne asada tacos, and although they had good flavor, they were greasy.  Chicken tacos were decent.  Prices for Taco Tuesday are definitely worth trying. Definitely better than El Hefe's tacos! I think Ricky's would be even better if they clean up the grease.
