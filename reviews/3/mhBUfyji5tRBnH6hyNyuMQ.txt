Haven't been to the restaurant in years...last night re-visited.  
Taco salads were good.  Could definately have been much better with a bit more ground beef and charro beans, but the flavors were very good.  Next time, we will request more meat and beans be added...we will see if they charge extra for that.
Service people, although prompt and attentive, were not warm at all.
we will try this again in future.
The lobby IS outdated as is the whole place.  However,we love Friday night "Happy Hour."  There is occasionally a great band with a man who looks like Carlos Santana and plays even better!
