Jalapeno's has a fun atmosphere, good outdoor seating, good service, and pretty decent Mexican food. 

They had great fresh salsa with a mix of chips. I ordered a combo platter with a shredded beef taco and a green corn tamale. Both were very tasty. The tamale was a tad on the dry side, but still above average. The beans and rice were okay. 

They offer a variety of margaritas. Our very attentive server insisted that a margarita called "The Boss" was the best one. We ordered them and they tasted like tequila with some lime. Too strong for me, but it was popular with the guys. Much to our server's disdain, I ordered a *gasp* blended margarita. Much better and easier to enjoy. 

I wouldn't go out of the way, but if you're up north and craving Mexican food, Jalapeno's is a good bet.
