We tried LGLG&C again because I just had to know if they could make the nachos better. As before the restaurant was clean and the staff very friendly.

This time we asked for 'cheese sauce' instead of blobs of shredded cheese (to which the waiter grimaced and said, 'that's much better'...he obviously didn't like their standard nachos either).

It seemed to be a bit of a big deal as he returned to the table to say, 'it will be a minute they have to get it melted.' But they came out quickly and were delicious! 

We have been popping in for nachos as we run around town and haven't had time for a full meal, once we do I'll update my star rating.
