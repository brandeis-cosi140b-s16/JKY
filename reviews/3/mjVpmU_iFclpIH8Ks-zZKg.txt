I have to agree with another post for this location. This one is not as good as some others I frequent in surprise az. Their rice is sticky almost every time I come here.  Nothing here tastes like other chipoltes.  The prep line sucks.  They just glob your stuff on one pile so that you get one bite of pure sour cream or beans,  etc. 

Also my biggest peeve is that the food is never hot enough. 

It's not horrid by ant means but it could be better.
