I heard that Moe's was really good, however I was not thrilled with the experience. Just to give you an idea, Moe's is pretty similar to Chipotle but with a southern twist to it. The food was good but I was expecting a bit more from this food chain. The service was pretty weak and most of their employees did not know what they were doing yet! They offer nachos (they were huge), quesadillas, burritos, tostadas and tacos. I liked the fact that they have a lot of toppings you can choose from which are free of charge of course sour cream and guacamole are  usually extra.  Oh and did I mentioned that they have the Coca Cola lifestyle!! Yeee! Overall, a decent lunch/ dinner spot if you are looking for something quick! I will give them another try and hopefully their training curve will be over!
