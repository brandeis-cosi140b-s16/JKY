I wanted to try Revo Burrito because I am such a fan of Delux Burger (Same Owners). I'm not sure if it was because my expectations where so high because of Delux, but I was let down with my meal. 

Nothing really memorable about my burrito, the only thing I remember was the rice on the side (Should have just got a rice burrito). The lemonade is a big part of their concept, but it was way too sweet and very sour. 

I want to try this place again. Maybe I will try the fish tacos that people like on the reviews.
