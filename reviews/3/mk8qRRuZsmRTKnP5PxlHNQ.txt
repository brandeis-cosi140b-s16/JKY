I usually don't branch out from standard quesadillas and burritos, but I tried the fish taco's and really liked them. I did also get a quesadilla on another occasion and really liked it, especially b/c it came with sour cream and guac, which a lot of places charge extra for. Also, it was crispy and hot, unlike a lot of places which come out greasy and soggy. 

I will probably go here again with my friends who really like this place.
