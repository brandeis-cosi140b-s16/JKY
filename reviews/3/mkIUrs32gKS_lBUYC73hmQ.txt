To start I must say I am not a fan of mexican food.  With that being said, I really liked this place.  I took an out-of-town houseguest here because she likes mexican.  I was really impressed though.  They sat us right away and a drink runner/helper person came right away to bring us chips with three different dipping sauces.  The chips were extra salty, which I really enjoyed.  Our meals came with a cup of soup, a hearty helping of re-fried beans and an ample scoop of rice.  The shredded beef in my burrito seemed to melt in my mouth and the chicken in the taco was so juicy.  The whole plate came piping hot and smothered in a gooey mess of melted cheese. 

 They also have a promotion going on right now.  If you order two entrees or more, a host comes by to let you pick an envelope out of a basket.  Inside your envelope is a coupon for your next visit.  The only catch is you can't open it until you come back, so you won't know what you have won until you come back to eat there again.  I guess it doesn't matter, the food is so good I'd pay full price for it.

Don't try to come for lunch though, they are not open till about 4:30pm.  Plus they are closed Monday and Tuesday.
