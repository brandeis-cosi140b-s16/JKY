It's your standard Arizona 'Berto's type place. Big burritos. (Attn: San Diegans - This is NOT Roberto's. It has similar offerings, but you are gonna be disappointed in the salsa department. Fair warning.)

They make a pretty decent carne asada plate, but I usually go with the carnitas plate. That's pretty good.

The guacamole isn't worth the price. Skip it. The green salsa is pretty tasty, but lacks any punch whatsoever. The red is watery and also lacks punch.

If you are really hungry and LOVE fries - you can't go wrong with the Carne Asada Fries: Tons on the plate. Tasty, but expensive. Definitely enough to share with 1 or 2 friends.

No Mexican cokes.

Taco Tuesday is a good deal at 99cents though. Chicken or shredded beef.
