The food was OK.  Beef burrito as big as a baby.  Rolled chicken tacos with good filling and toppings.  Guac and sour cream.  Good prices.  Large condiment bar.  Counter help was a little sleepy.
There were 2 homeless guys in there keeping things neat and organized.  I guess they work for food?
You have to be buzzed in to use the bathroom.
