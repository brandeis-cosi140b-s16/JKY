I miss the Tommy Pastrami's that was in this location, but my Carne Asada Fries are biking distance now. So, not much of a loss. 
I notice very little deviance from the other Roberto's locations, which means this is "the" taco shop with a duplicate-able sense of business.
 
This particular location does offer green onions in the salsa bar, which is a plus, but while self-serve salsa bars seems to be a trend in Mexican cuisine, I would not trust the area with these gringos. Remember, these are the same guys that taught terrorists to fly but not land, and why Las Vegas businesses have such a false sense of security. So, if they can't police their own safety, what makes you think they can handle a salsa bar. I've posted similar concerns with U-Swirl and Yogurtland. Self serve areas in food service is a foolish idea, especially in a fast food atmosphere.

Nonetheless, I come here for machaca, chorizo, and breakfast burritos. This is also my place for quesadillas and horchata; perfect amount of cinnamon. I do wish they had tacos de cabeza. The only location I remember seeing this was at Maryland near UNLV. 

I dine out a lot over the past 30+ years, and I only got sick at Jack-in-the-box (twice) and Burger King once. So, this place is the cleanest of its kind, and the service is also really fast. 

I think I'll go there now.

Well, I just came back from there, and I was slightly peeved. 
The salsa bar was amazingly messier than any time I've ever seen it, and it was only 9:30 in the morning. 
I ordered my regular carne asada fries but I wasn't in the mood to eat a whole order, and since they only have one size, I asked them to put it into 2 separate smaller containers instead. She said they could not do that for me. But she was able to give me 2 empty small containers along with my regular order.  The adjustment is very small and would take only 10 seconds to split the ingredients into 2 smaller containers. That kind of inflexibility shows me some inexperience with the cooks.
The service was still fast, but what was once a 4 star place has dropped one whole star because they could not accommodate such a minor request.
I went home and took a spatula and split it myself. It took 5 seconds, but the ingredients did not adhere like the original prepared presentation. If they did it I would be happy. But like most businesses in the US, it's not their job to make me happy- nor is it my job to tip them.
