Wasn't really a fan. My food wasn't all that good and they said the Sierra mist machine was out and the workers husband wasn't going to be back till tomorrow so no Sierra mist for me.. That wasn't a deal breaker. The salsa was just Ok. The table side guacamole was amazing! So a job well done there. There's too many other great Mexican spots around for me to come back here.
