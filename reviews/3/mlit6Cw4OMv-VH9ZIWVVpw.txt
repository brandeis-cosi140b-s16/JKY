The commissary is a trendy Latin-fusion kitchen off of 3rd street in downtown Vegas. Walking in, a coffee bar is off to the right, a bar (fully stocked) is straight in the back, and the kitchen area is off to the left.

Upon reaching the kitchen area, the electronic (television) menus were able to be read for about 30 seconds before they turned off and you had to turn around and look at the second tv to keep perusing the menu (read: annoying). 

I ordered the fish torta. It sounded good: crispy fish, tartar sauce with poblano chiles in it, and cabbage. Approximately $12. I asked if the sandwich was spicy. The cashier didn't know, so the managing chef came out and talked to me about it which was a nice touch. The wait for the food wasn't long - maybe 5-7 minutes.

Upon receiving my food I received a sandwich-looking Torta with chips. It was a large sandwich, cut in half. Upon taking a bite I wasn't very pleased with the taste or texture. It was as bland as you could possibly get (and with fish, it can get pretty bland), and definitely was not worth my $12. Seriously, this place has potential, but they would do well to focus more on the quality and taste of their food.
