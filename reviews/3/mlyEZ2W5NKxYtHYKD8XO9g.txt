Finally a place that makes Pozole! Now I'm used to my boyfriends family's Pozole, which is perfection. This stuff came pretty close, but not quite how I like it. My boyfriend had their tacos, which were a bit dry (had to take broth from my soup to make them juicy...uht oh!) but overall he said they were pretty good. The beers we ordered were a little on the flat side it seemed, but we enjoyed them none the less. The salsa served with the chips is a little lack luster, so hopefully they change it up. The service was subpar at first (the young boy pretty much forgot about us, but then a young girl took care of us). The manager/owner came over to chat a bit, which was very nice. Will come back to try something else, and hopefully update this review!
