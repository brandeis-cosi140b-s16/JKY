I was in the area and hungry, and since I am always in the mood for Mexican I decided to give the place with the "Now Open" sign a try. The space is very clean, which is always a good sign, and the staff was very friendly. It was lunch time, and I just wanted to order some food to go and head back to my office. The hostess suggested the lunch special of a cheese enchilada, beef taco and rice/beans for $5.95, that sounded good to me, and the price was right so I went for it. 

I waited about 10 minutes for the food to be ready, and then hopped in my car for the 20 minute drive back to my office. I was starving so I grabbed a chip, well, they were warm, but they were chewy! Chewy chips mean they were not cooked long enough.....so disappointing! 

Once I got to my office I pulled out my food.....I have to say it was the weirdest presentation ever. They had taken a thick paper plate, covered it in foil then put my food on it and covered the whole thing in plastic wrap. Wouldn't if have been easier, and probably even cheaper to just buy To Go boxes (like the ones I saw customers taking home their leftovers in)? The food had shifted a bit in the car ride, and the enchilada sauce was beginning to seep out the sides.....it was not pretty. Also, what if i didn't eat it all? The plastic wrap had to be ripped off and wasn't going to cover it up again! 

The enchilada was all right, nothing special, the sauce was really mild, so good for those who don't like too much spice. The meat in the taco was pretty good, and they didn't skimp on it. My barometer of a good Mexican restaurant, the beans, hovered just at mid range, they were decent, but not crave-able. 

I wouldn't make a special trip back here, but if I was in the area I might give them another chance....but I will opt to eat in the restaurant instead!
