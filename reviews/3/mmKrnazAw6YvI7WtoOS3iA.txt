This place is good, not great. My shrimp taco platter ($8 for 3 tacos (small!) and rice and beans) was tasty. My daughter got just a taco and it was gone in 4 bites (the tacos are small!). Hubby's b/c and chicken burrito was about standard size and good (at least he didn't complain about it). It was nice that they offered black beans as well as refried. Good to have a choice.  Well I've had worse fast food Mexican, I've also had better.
