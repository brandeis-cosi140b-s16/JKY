We had planned to go to dinner at the container park on New Years Day but it was closed. La Comida was open and so we decided to give it a try. I loved the vibe there - chill, California-style restaurant. The margaritas were good and they had a large selection of tequilas. The salsa was pleasantly hot - all in the group were fans. Three of us had tacos - 2 had carne and 1 had carnitas. All were good - not great  but worth coming back for - and better than most in Vegas. Overall it was a good experience so we'll be back!
