So, tonight I forgot to plan my night out and after two attempts to visit other restaurants, and unwilling to wait for 45 minutes, I somehow convinced my wife that this was the place for us.  One would think that would not be so difficult, but after our last experience, you can see why she was hesitant.....thank goodness I was driving, or I may just have starved.

Now for the night's meal....it was so much better than our last experience so I deemed it an extra star......it is still lacking the consistency, but this time, our server was spot on! 

My wife almost placed a bet with me that the meal, and service would be a repeat of our last visit.  I should have taken the bet. We requested the mild salsa and we actually received it. We requested sweet and water and also received them in a timely manner.  ( It is Sad that a highlight of the meal was that you actually received your drinks correctly).

The meals were very prompt, very tasty, and the server was very attentive even though we were located in the back of the restaurant due to the crowd. She even refilled our drinks, prior to them getting half empty.

This was a redeeming visit for this location and as usual, I will continue to follow up on our visits.

I have given three stars, as I mentioned earlier, it just isn't consistent enough to receive 4 stars.
