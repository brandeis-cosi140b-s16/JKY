My visit to Carlos' n Charlie's was a pop-in so I'm not sure if a review is really stating the establishment's true colors.  I sat at the bar at 11:30AM and there were only a small handful of people lunch dining.
     I ordered chips and salsa along with fish tacos.  The chip came in a To Go bag and it was a plentiful lot of chips... warm.  The salsa was mediocre but a large portion.  I liked the idea of a bag of chips as people visiting Vegas always need some snacks for later, in their room.
     The fish tacos came out quickly to be expected given the small number of people there.  There were three and each was loaded with a healthy amount of what I would call chipotle coleslaw and breaded fish.  I think I wanted more fish but as I ate my way through the first two tacos I realized I was eating some pretty good food.  The tacos came with three small bowls each having a sauce (hot oily sauce, ranch and tartar sauce).  I dipped into all three throughout my meal and liked the oily hot sauce best).  My drink order was club soda with lime - no way that gets screwed up.
     So what can I say but give an A-OK rating.  The food was served hot, tasty, quick and I had the place all to myself.  My bar keeper was a lovely tattoo'd specimen with a friendly smile - charming gal really.  Life was good for 45 minutes at least for me during my visit to Carlos' n Charlie's in FLAMINGO Vegas.
