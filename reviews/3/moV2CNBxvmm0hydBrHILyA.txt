I will give the review three stars because our food was crazy good. Our server was awful. Like unbelievably horrible. I get that they were a bit busy, but she was not even friendly. It took FOREVER to get a drink. FOREVER to order our food. After eating, it took FOREVER to get our check. We gave up paying with my debit card and pooled our cash together so that we didn't have to keep waiting for her. It was disappointing to say the least.
