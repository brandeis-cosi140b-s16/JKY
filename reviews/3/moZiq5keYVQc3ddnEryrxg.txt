Your typical del taco... Cheap food. Fast service. Clean tables. I love that they serve cherry coke at Del Taco. Goes perfect with the cheese quesadilla (no green sauce) and some fries. The parking lot here is a bit of a nightmare. Came on a Saturday and the drive thru was clogging up everything. Once inside it was pretty quick though.
