The server was great about accommodating my gluten free diet(I'm have celiac disease), and the chips & salsa were a delicious start. My husband ordered the beef taco & chicken enchilada combo, and per the server's recommendation I had the pescado del dia which was halibut with sautéed veggies and black beans. My husband was satisfied with his meal, because it tasted like El Cholo back in LA, which is our favorite mexican there. However, this was more pricey than El Cholo, and we expected more from Javier's. 
My fish was overcooked, and under seasoned. Halibut should never taste fishy, but it did. My homemade black beans are way better seasoned, and the veggies were hardly sautéed. Supposedly they came with a light cream sauce but if it was there, it didn't add anything. My husband wanted to send it back but I was so hungry I just doused it in salsa and it was edible, but not worth anywhere near $40. I should've gone with the enchiladas despite the servers fish recommendation.

I wish I could recommend it because it was our first date night out just the 2 of us since we're here filming a movie and his parents are only in town for a couple days to babysit ;-( At least they didn't gluten poison me
