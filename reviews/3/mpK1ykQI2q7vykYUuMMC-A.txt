I had a lay-over at Phoenix, AZ on my way to San Diego, CA (wierd lay-over right?!) and this joint caught my eyes.

I chose their Signature Big Blue Burrito with carne asada. Of course, since this place is inside the airport, pricing wise was expensive ($8). I think I was just really hungry when I landed so it tasted pretty good to me. It came with guacamole, sour cream, rice, beans, and cheese.

Overall, I think I had better burrito in the Bay Area for cheaper price.
