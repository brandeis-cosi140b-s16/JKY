Stopped by here for an early dinner the other day.  I live around the corner and have never tried it.  Since Eddie D's is two doors down, I always get distracted.  However, this particular day I wanted Mexican Food and was determined to try it out.

I ordered a Carne Asada Burrito ($4.75) and an Al Pastor Taco ($2.40).  The restaurant is casual and has 15 or so tables, plenty of seating.  There's a small Salsa Bar (see pics) and a soda fountain.

The food came out after a short wait.   The Burrito was smoking hot....I could barely hold on to it, so I waited a few minutes while it cooled off a bit.  After cooling down a bit, I dove right in.  I was disappointed to discover that it's exactly like Roberto's Taco Shop.....damn.  The Carne Asada Burrito was just ok.....I think a bunch of Roberto's former employees must have went around town opening Taco Shops.  I don't think you would be able to distinguish between the two.

The Al Pastor Taco was a disappointment too.  It lacked the flavor that I expect from Al Pastor.....the smoky, marinated flavor.  It was bland.

Overall, it was disappointing, but filling and OK.

Will I return?  Probably not.
