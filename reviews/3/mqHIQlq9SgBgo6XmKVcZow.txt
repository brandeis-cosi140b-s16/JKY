Went in for a happy hour wasn't super impressed.  I was left wanting to give this place another try however.  Many interesting dishes were on the menu but I was in for happy hour and taking full advantage of that.  We tried all the tacos and they were good, none made it through the massacre but one with the pickled habaneros had some left overs.  Service was great, margaritas were tasty, d√©cor is top notch.  I rate restaurants on food so it gets 3 on what I had I will update when I return.
