I came for lunch. I had to wait for a table and the place was literally less than 1/3 full (I can't help it, I counted seats - I'm anal that way).  Funny, I heard one server walking by saying it was a slow day.
  Once seated, my server (Sasha I think) was friendly and quick to take my order.
  The decor/environment was nice. Very trendy - hip latin - exposed ceiling, raw wood, oranges, advocado. and yellows.
