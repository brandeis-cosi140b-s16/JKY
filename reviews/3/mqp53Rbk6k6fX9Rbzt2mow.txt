I had heard many good things about the quality and overall experience @mexquite Being a native Californian I can be a bit particular regarding Mexican/American Taco Burrito Joints. I come from a Mexican American family I married a Mexican American woman and we have Mexican American Children. We know our Burritos, Tacos , Rellanos, Enchiladas etc.... We are resided to the fact that if we want authentic Mexican food We must travel home to Southern California and Baja  California. This being said we find Mexquite to be superior to Quedoba , Chipotle and any other QSR Burrito, Taco joint we have experienced in South Charlotte. I give it three stars for it's salsa hot sauce selection. The hot was good but could probably stand to go hotter. Our experience was nice carnitas were tasty the quesadillas were average what I call "white guy Mexican" (b4) you call me racist!). I am a White Mexican!! The Nachos!! ( which no body should order anywhere) my son ordered and you guessed it :-P 
Probably will not go back often but nice to know it's there.
