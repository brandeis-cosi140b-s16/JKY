Went here Friday (I think opening night) with a group of six. We did show up a little late at 9:30 but were surprised there was no one there but us. The guacamole was good, as we're the appetizers. We had the steak quesadilla and the chorizo cheese dip and we all really loved the flavor of the steak. Unfortunately overall taste of our entrees were charred and bitter. I will say the service was good but I don't think we will come back unless they make some changes to the food. It's a great concept and nice looking restaurant but the food needs an upgrade.
