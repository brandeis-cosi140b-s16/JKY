Someone told me that Roberto's is the best Mexican restaurant around here so I gave it a try.  I cannot say I agree with that opinion. It's not that the food is bad, but I wouldn't call it the best at all.  To be fair, the only outright terrible item I had there was the guacamole - it was the consistency of SOUP- horrid!!  

Now, I also had a bad experience when the cashier charged me more than was stated on the menu and didn't speak enough English to resolve the problem. She had to call the manager and have me speak to her before I could get a refund. The problem was that they changed their prices in the register without updating their menu.  I was so annoyed that I swore to myself I'd never go back, but then I decided to try again. I  mean, mistakes do happen.  

This time there a woman working in the kitchen who I recognized from before.  She said to the cashier that I was the woman who cheated them last time! Hey- hablo espanol, mujer!   You better believe I watched her closely to make sure she didn't spit in my order, 'cause she sure was giving me the evil eye. I've never gone back there- too disappointed.  But don't let my little adventure stop YOU!  If you don't mind runny guacamole and don't make the people in the kitchen angry, you should be all right.  ;-)
