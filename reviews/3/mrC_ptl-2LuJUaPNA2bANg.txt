Good hotdogs. Super busy today (Thursday night) and super slow service. 40 minutes for 3 hotdogs...maybe they should have more people working because there were only 2 and that included the cashier. Other times i've been there its pretty quick service so i probably just went on one of their busy nights. I also had a "caramelo" which was sooo good! The carne asada is tasty there. I think next time i'll get carne asada tacos.
