I have to say, the food is excellent BUT the service is AWFUL!  I can't say it's the waitstaff fault, but rather, the kitchen is SO SLOW!  When the restaurant opened at 8am for breakfast, it took a table of 6 (with nobody else in the restaurant) 45 minutes to get items like:  oatmeal, fruit and granola, 2 eggs over easy.  That is absurd!
I did order one of the specialty breakfast and though I was antsy waiting for it, when it arrived, it did not disappoint.  The Rancheros with asparagus and tomatoes was excellent!
For lunch, it was the same predicament!  They have an excellent guacamole and the street tacos are almost worth waiting for.  Almost. But not forever!

I hope this place cleans up their act in the kitchen, because they cook some good food.
