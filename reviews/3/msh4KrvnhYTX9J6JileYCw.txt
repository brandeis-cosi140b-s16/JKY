Pros:  good food, frequent/reward card/daily specials

Cons:  sometimes I find the employees less than friendly -- mainly the females - and speak poor English...never overly friendly, that's for sure.  There always seems to be a couple of extra employees just standing around at the cash register area -- weird!  I hate to say it, but the female employees are the worst - I've never had one of the males be rude, indifferent or have the "whatever" attitude.

The women's bathroom was "closed" the last time I've been at this restaurant - I believe it was Jan. 16 and 4 times during the past month - either they are too lazy to clean it or there is a problem...either way, clean the men's restroom - more than once/day...another reader below said they were there on 1/20 and the women's restroom was out of order, too...

Been there when they have been out of knives or when the fountain machine was broken...how do you run out of knives at 4:30 pm and not be able to get more in for the evening dinner rush???

They place all their utensils with handles down, so you get to touch all the utensils while you take one for yourself - gross!   This can't be health code!  Tonight I was in the restaurant and the girl was restocking - she didn't have gloves on - and was  grabbing a bunch of the utensils at once (not by the handles) and sticking them in the box...handle down...C'mon management - fix this!  

Also, they keep the cups right by the pay area/register - feel free to sneeze all over them.   LOL!  They should really keep their cups away from the register and the people moving through checking out... 


Prefer the other locations - cleaner and friendlier employees.
