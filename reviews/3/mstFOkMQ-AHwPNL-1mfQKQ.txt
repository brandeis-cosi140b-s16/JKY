Ive reviewed the other Robertos near my work,  and i am just as happy with this location.  I dont usually go in the middle of the day,  I usually come to this location in the middle of the night to get my carne asada fix.  The carne asada burrito has to be made by the book because it never fails to satisfy my meat tooth.  Good value for the money.  

The space is always clean, except maybe the vegetable/side items area can get a little bit messy at times, the staff is always cleaning something every time I drive by or come in. All in all a pretty clean location compared to some of the other one's I've been too. For the price, the food can't be beat. 

Cheers!
