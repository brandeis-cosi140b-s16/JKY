I was here last month, mostly since I was driving by to somewhere else. To be honest, I don't remember exactly what I had, but it was probably a taco/tostada or similar. The food was good, plenty of it but it did seem heavily spicy (duh, it's Mexican food) and WAY too many onions as a filler in the meat combo.

I ended up removing lots of onions and there was still lots of food. I was meeting friends at a movie out on Boulder Hiway and all the way through the movie, I tasted the food that I had here and meant to ask my friends if my breath was bad, but didn't get around to it.

It was good but I won't make a special effort to go back, only because there are so many Mexican places similar to it.
