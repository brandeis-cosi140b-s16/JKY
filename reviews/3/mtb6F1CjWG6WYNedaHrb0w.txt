Stopped in here for lunch last week and it was just fine!  It is located right at the Met and has parking in the horrible parking garage across the street - be careful - it is so crowded!  

There is outdoor seating as well as a HUGE dining room.  I ordered the taco salad and was surprised when the waitress asked 'what dressing'.  That's the first time I have been to a mexican restaurant where they wanted to give me dressing with a taco salad.  So I declined the dressing and the rest is as you would expect.  It was a good price for a TON of food.  

Everyone else really liked their meals and I loved the old La Paz's guac so I am sure I would love it here but didn't try it this time.

Service was really fast and friendly.  Would be back - especially to sit outside in the summer!!
