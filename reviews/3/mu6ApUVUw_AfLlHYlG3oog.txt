So, after being extremely excited to try Maki Taco, I was a bit let down last night for my first experience. Don't get me wrong, I love the concept, the choices & the price; however, maybe this is a case of: "it's not you, it's me".  

I had the shrimp, crunchy taco with cucumbers, scallions & shrimp sauce. The presentation, time to wait, price & the taco shell itself ranks high, but here are my issues: shrimp were very small, the cabbage was too much, there weren't enough scallions, I hardly tasted any cucumber, & the shrimp sauce was very light. I was pretty hungry, so I did eat all three tacos, but I had quite a pile of the cabbage mixture left.

I will definitely give them another try, but next time I want to try the hibachi (which ironically, I initially was going to order it).

Grant seems to be very open to feedback & is great in the social media world - he is an avid user of twitter, always posting where they will be & responds to follower's questions / comments.  

They're definitely filling a void in the food truck offerings in Charlotte, so kudos to them for that!
