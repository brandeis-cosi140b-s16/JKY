If you moved to Phoenix as a youthful person, rather than as a retiree, an important rite of passage is to find yourself, some time between midnight and 4 a.m., in the drive-through of a taco shop with a name ending in -berto's. This is a perfectly good -berto's for that purpose, being reasonably convenient to both the Crescent Ballroom (if you tanked up on Honey Badgers there but didn't weight them down with the in-house burritos) or the Rhythm Room.

The chimichanga is large enough for two meals, as is pretty much anything else. Avoid any dish swimming in red sauce if your coordination is impaired or if you're just plain klutzy. The food is both better and cheaper than Chipotle, plus there's a considerably more varied menu. Also: heats up well the next day.

Try not to fall asleep in the drive-through, though, as it really does take forever.
