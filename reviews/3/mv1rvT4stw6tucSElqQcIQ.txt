I went here with an open mind because i've never been a real fan of Chipotle in the past. (especially when McDonalds used to own them) 

I ordered the burrito bowl with brown rice, black beans, chicken, lettuce and salsa. Im not sure what the big deal is about Chipotle. Everyone I know goes crazy over this place. I pretty much had to douse my burrito bowl in salsa because everything was so bland. Like always the chips are overly salted and seasoned and has a weird aftertaste (not sure what that is, been like that at every location i've been to.)

For a quick bite to eat in the area, i'd personally choose Rubios over there. I will say it was very clean, very quick and the employees were all young but did a good job.
