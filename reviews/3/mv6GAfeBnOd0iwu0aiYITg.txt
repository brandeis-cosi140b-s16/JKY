The food here is actually good! I would definitely come back again. The reason for the 3 stars is because the service lacks quality. Takes awhile to get your food plus the waiters are not very attentive. Also the decor of the restaurant could use a makeover! Tables and chairs in the restaurant don't even match, there are rips in the chairs. Overall it's OK
