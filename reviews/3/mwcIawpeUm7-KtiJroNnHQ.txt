We've been to Taxco three or four times now and we've never been disappointed.  The restaurant is located in a dingy strip mall and doesn't look the most appealing from the outside but the inside has an open feel with a decent-sized dining area and a small bar area and it's decked out in the usual Mexican decor.  

My favorite thing about Taxco is its consistency.  We always know what kind of food and service we'll get here.  The wait staff is pleasant and the food is always fresh and tasty.  Like every Mexican restaurant they serve chips and salsa while you're waiting on your food.  The chips aren't the best quality but I always enjoy the salsa, it has just the right amount of hotness to it.  I always go with one of the enchilada meals with a beef, chicken, and cheese enchilada that comes with rice and refried beans.  Their food always hits the spot when I need a Mexican fix.
