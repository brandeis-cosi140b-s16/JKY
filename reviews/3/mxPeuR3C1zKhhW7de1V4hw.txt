This place is your run of the mill Mexican resturaunt, with great prices and inconsistent service. 

I have dined at both Salsa's location in Charlotte, with this location being the lesser of the two.

Lows-
Service- had a fajita order butchered (how is that even possible?) with pretty bad customer service from the manager. Last visit was plesant albeit nothing to write home about. 
No real ambiance here either. But who goes to a spot like this for that anyway.

Highs- 
Food. Pretty good and comes out pretty quick. Their combos are really good if you love to sample a variety of things at once. Fried ice cream here is delish.
Prices. Most things under 8 bucks and deserts are all under 3....score!

Overall....if your looking for a step above taco bell with cheap margs and low food prices...go here. You may get the worst service but the food is pretty good.
