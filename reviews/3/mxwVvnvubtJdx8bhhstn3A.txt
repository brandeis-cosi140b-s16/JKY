This is a pretty off-beat and laid back place. There is outdoor seating only (maybe 1 or 2 two-person spots inside the very busy one-room place that it is), which has lots of bugs and birds around. I recommend getting take-out only. The staff members were helpful. The prices are quite low and this is an affordable place to get decent fast Mexican food. They also have different food and drink specials advertised daily.

The food is pretty good. I especially liked the chips and salsa. The chips were crispy and thin, while the salsa had a nice spicy flavor. I also tried a steak quesadilla. The meat had a great flavor, but the pieces were very tiny and there needs to be more. There was a little too much guacamole on it. However, the flavors were good. 

I would visit again when in a hurry and looking for an inexpensive Mexican meal.
