Nice addition to downtown Gilbert. The restaurant is small, but there's a nice outdoor seating area if you're willing to wait. Service varies from good to kind of slow, but I think the food speaks for itself as it's tasty and well made. I definitely recommend a (spiked!) agua fresca.The lolo grain salad is an excellent choice if you're trying to go meatless. I think there's better tacos in the valley, but they're solid and will fill you up for a decent price. Don't skip dessert! Get an order of churros and let your taste buds walk through fried cinnamon heaven.
