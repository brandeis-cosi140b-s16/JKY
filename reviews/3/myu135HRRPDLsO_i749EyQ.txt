I don't like chain restaurants, they lack personality and it isn't as good as if the owner was nearby, ensuring each item is served with a little slice of love.  With that said, this place just opened near me and it is pretty ok.  I won't be going daily for lunch, however it is open till 10pm and if I am late getting home or need dinner quick and on the fairly cheap this is a good choice.
