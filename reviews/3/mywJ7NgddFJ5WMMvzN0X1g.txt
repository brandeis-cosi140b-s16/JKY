Mi Amigo Ricardo is an authentic Mexican restaurant in Casa Grande that any local will tell is worth a go at least once, and being a resident of Eloy I will tell you no different.

One of the few restaurants in town still  family owned and operated, entering Ricardo's you feel a sense of hominess. The employees are very  friendly, and the service is very quick and  accommodating. I have been to this restaurant during its lunch and dinner rushes, and while it does get packed often, I still found my order arriving in the same amount of time that it would had I come when it was empty.  While the food may not be the best Mexican food you'll ever have, it has a home cooked look and taste that you simply cannot get from, say, Macayo's. Prices are very affordable when compared to other restaurants, and the average price of a plate of food and a drink can be as low as about 10 dollars, and if their combination plates don't appeal to you, they also have variety of foods that you can order a le cart. But be warned, ordering in this fashion is where it can become a bit pricey. Each meal comes with a glass of water, nasty tasting tap, never ending bowl of chips, and salsa, more of a semi spicy tomato sauce. This is great if you don't make the mistake of filling up on chips before your order has arrived. 

It is for these reasons that Ricardo's remains a local favorite. It may not be the absolute perfect restaurant, but it is one that I have been coming to for many years, and one I will continue going to for many more
