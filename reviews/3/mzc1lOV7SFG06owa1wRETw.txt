Mexican franchise type restaurants are usually pretty average.  I don't know on what order of franchise Serrano's is, they have a handfull of locations around the valley.  My test is the kiddo's.  I recently found out that my duaghter likes refried beans ... WHAT!!  And the only reason I found out was because Serrano's serves an awesome refried bean dip with their chips and salsa prior to your meal.  I'm picky when it comes to those too so if I'll eat them they are pretty good.  This location has it's own take out area, similar to chilis, outback and most of the big chain restaurants so you aren't waiting in the mix of all of the other orders, which is nice.  I guess hands down my favorite thing is their peppermint ice cream for dessert.  YUMMY!!
