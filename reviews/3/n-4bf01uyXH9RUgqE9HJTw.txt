Passing through the area on a road trip and chose this place due to the number of stars on yelp. 

I quickly learned this restaurant and area is home to older folks, but the food was overall alright. Only choices of meat was ground beef, shredded beef, or shredded chicken. The chicken burrito enchilada style only had chicken in it. Basically the same thing as the chicken enchilada; the only difference being one used a flour tortilla and the other used corn tortillas. 

The service was good, the food was edible, and the environment is very nice and quiet. 

4 stars? Maybe for this area, but not compared to all the other restaurants I've been to.
