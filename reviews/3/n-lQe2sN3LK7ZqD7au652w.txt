Taco trucks are hard to find in Henderson, which means that great, fast and simple Mexican food is hard to find in Henderson.  Residents are left with the dregs -- Roberto's burnt, rubbery carne asada, Taco Hell and the corporate chains.  

In the field of chain Mexican food (Qdoba, Chipotle, Rubio's, Baja Fresh), Rubio's stands apart.  The service is great and particularly friendly at the branch on Green Valley Pkwy.  And the food is fresh and tasty (well, tasty enough).  The burritos are fairly standard for a chain place (i.e. not too bad, not too good) with a good black bean seasoning and good (not great, but good) quality steak or chicken.  So two stars on the burritos in general.

But Rubio's is really known for it's fish tacos--based on the classic San Diego fish taco.  And that's where Rubio's scores five stars--best chain store fish tacos served outside of California.  Crispy and tasty with fresh cabbage.  So if you visit, expect the food in general to be decent and the fish tacos to be excellent.  Overall, the menu evens out to 3 stars.
