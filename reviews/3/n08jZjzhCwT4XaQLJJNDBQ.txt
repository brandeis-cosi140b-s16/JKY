Service is really good at this restaurant but be careful when you order sides.  Every little side of guacamole or sour cream or extra lettuce and tomato will cost you.  I ordered the burrito lunch special which was $5.99.  The server asked me if I wanted guacamole and sour cream.  I said yes. When the bill came, I had been charged a dollar extra for each item.  My cheap burrito wasn't as cheap as I wanted it to be.  A dollar for a dollop of sour cream???  Give me a break...

One of my coworkers ordered extra lettuce and tomato, got charged 50 cents!  Iced tea was pricey too, $2.50.  We also got the cheese fundido.  $8.00 for a little skillet with melted cheese and jalapenos.  The food was good but I think that a little warning of if you want extras, be prepared to pay extra $$$.

There were three of us and we each paid $17.00 for lunch!  That's a bit much, Arriba Mexican Grill...
