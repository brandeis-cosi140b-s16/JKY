Ok. Yea this place is ok. Had it about a week ago. Hard to really see why it has so many 5 star reviews. I mean yes for sure we are all searching for the delicious Mexican food place and this one can do for a quick fix, but it's not the end of the search. I ordered a lot of food. It's what I usually do when I want to get an idea of what the place has to offer. I tried all of the highly recommended dishes on yelp reviews, and as soon as my fam and I tried them all I forgot what they were called. I probably dropped about $50 so you know there was variety. I can remember that I had the mole enchiladas. Yea ok they were ok. I wasn't turned on or off by the flavor or the look. Carne asada tacos. Ok. Different pork dishes, again just ok. I didn't see anything that made me think there was some extra secret craft or Mexican regional delicacy involved. Yes I could see it is different, but I like different when different is good. Yea it's different than robertos but who says just because it's different it's amazing? Not trying to take a dig at this place, but it was just ok.
