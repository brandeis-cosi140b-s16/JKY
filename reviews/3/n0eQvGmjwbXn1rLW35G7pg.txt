NIce place, my burrito was full of steak and quite large. Very good. Chips and salsa not so much. Chips were without question the most salty I've ever experienced, salsa was ok. Prices were reasonable, most everything was around $10. Took a little longer than average for our meal to show up but a good experience overall
