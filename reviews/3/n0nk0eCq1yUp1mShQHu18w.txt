Having come back a couple of times, I think 3 stars is a better fit. The food is a little inconsistent and some of the dishes aren't conceptualized or prepared well. I think this is a much better pub than restaurant, overall. I love the decor, and the service is usually very friendly. The margaritas are terrific, and the atmosphere makes it a nice place to meet with friends, so I am glad it is a part of the downtown scene. That said, the food either needs to be a little more affordable or be prepared with more care and attention. 

Parking is a general nightmare.
