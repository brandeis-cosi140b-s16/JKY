Have not had much reason to enter the Del taco world and since they have no white meat chicken that doesn't help their cause. Desperation as I was in a food deadzone led me here for a quick lunch. 
The 99 cent tacos were loaded with decent meat and all the fixings right to the top of the taco.
The medium Del Scorco sauce is not that hot
The min-quesadilla is a good deal at 59 cents
The $1.00 strawberry lemonade has frozen strawberries inside and is refreshing.
