I can't speak for the food, but I went on a Saturday and it was PACKED. There were some cool things in the midst of the chaos, like a photo booth and a confetti stream every so often. It's not necessarily their fault that the place gets so busy, but even elevating the bar a bit and adding some separation from the dance floor could be beneficial. It took me like 10 minutes to get to the bar from the center of the room, like another 10 just to flag down a bartender, and then I had to wait another 10 just for my drink to come. It's not unheard of, but if I can go anywhere else on Mill, walk up to the bar and order my drink in like 5 minutes, then 30 seems counter-intuitive to having a good time there.
