Cheap, Korean/Mexican fusion eats....

Small, hole in the wall, no frills joint located in a small strip mall about 10 minutes west of the northern part of the strip (parking is kinda limited).   I love places like this because it means the food will probably be awesome.  Expect a wait since it is a popular place.  While the hubs and I didn't walk away from here all amazed we were full and it did the job.  Service was ok, since the place was full it took awhile for our server to take our order and he didn't check on us after he did.  But we did get our food quickly.

Complimentary chips and guac- good

Bulgogi fries - fries were think and crispy, yum but bulgogi not that flavorful

Fusion burrito with bulgogi- a-ok.  I've had better from the food trucks here in Cali.  Again, bulgogi not that flavorful.

Overall, good place to check out if your'e in the area, I looked around at other people's dishes and they looked good.  But I prob wouldn't make the drive all the way here again next time I'm in sin city.
