Came here for dinner and everything was good. The pollo fundido came out hot and fresh, the tortilla soup was better than expected, and the chips and salsa did not disappoint. The only problem was that the chiles rellenos came out soggy and actually overstuffed with cheese(I know, usually a good problem). Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and our waitress was attentive and friendly, so I'll definitely be back.
