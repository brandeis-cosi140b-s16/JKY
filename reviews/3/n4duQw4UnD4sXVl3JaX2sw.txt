The band had a show in Scottsdale and we were jonesing for some late night food that wasn't Denny's.  We needed some mexican food!

Betito's is a friendly little family operation serving decent dirty mexican food reminiscent of taco shops I grew up with in San Diego.  Open late, good salsas, and a tasty horchata.  Just what we needed after a mid-week rock show!
