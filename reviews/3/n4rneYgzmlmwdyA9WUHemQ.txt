There is an overly crowded menu and so with that many choices you can order.  The drinks are extra and they charge for refills unless its from a separate combo menu.  The service is quick, but not outstanding or friendly.  The cheese enchilada plate I had not hot, cheesy, or gooey as I would have expected.  There is a very small condiment section for salsa limes and carrots n jalape√±os.  It was not enough bang for my buck!
