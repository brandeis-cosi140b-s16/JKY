Usually pretty good. However, I went there tonight because I had to work late and wanted to reward myself...but I was rewarded with two burritos that were wrapped like a child did it, and the tortilla shells used were HUGE. I was basically eating tortilla shells. My quesadilla's cheese wasn't melted, and i got hot instead of fire sauce.  Yes, I did eat that much - i was binge eating.
