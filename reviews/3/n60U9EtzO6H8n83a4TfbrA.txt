Decent prices and medicore food. I had a scallop and shrimp enchilada with black beans and rice which wasn't bad by any means but you know that full feeling that sticks around even hours after you have had your meal?? Yep, that was this. I took the leftovers back to my hotel but couldn't bring myself to eat them because I didn't want to feel that way again.

The mojito, while essentially flavorless (I kinda like to taste the mint that is supposed to be muddled into my drink) was still pretty strong. 

The atmosphere is warm and it's odd but it seemed almost southern 
in its decor with the whittled wooden chairs and tables coupled with tropical leaved plants and adobe-esque colors. Hunh. Not a place I would run to, but I wouldn't run from it either.
