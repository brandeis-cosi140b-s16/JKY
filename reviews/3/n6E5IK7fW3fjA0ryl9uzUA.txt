Very clean, I've been here a few times in hope my problems with the food would be resolved but every time it's the same greasy food. One time I ordered a chicken burrito, simple right? When I bit into it, grease spilt out everywhere. It was like someone turned on a faucet of grease, I've never seen anything like it. Usually when I go now I just get tacks, still drips grease though, not pleasing
