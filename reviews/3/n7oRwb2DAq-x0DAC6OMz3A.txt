Solid food and a cozy atmosphere. 

I love Mexican food, but can't stand how it typically comes in only two styles. Dirty and cheap. Or fancy and way overpriced. Ajo's Al's is that much needed middle ground. Delivering some quality food, but doesn't try to be upscale. 

We went on Saturday night at 7:30. The place was pretty busy, but we were still seated right away and water and chips and Salsa were on the table just seconds later (which was great because I was starving). The waitress was really friendly, and she did something I really appreciate. When I ordered the Relleno Chicken Dinner, she warned me that it was covered in a very spicy sauce. I happen to love spicy food, but warning customers about something that's not written on the menu is what a good server should do. 

The Relleno was excellent. It was wonderful to have a chicken and cheese stuffed pepper that wasn't deep fried. And she wasn't kidding about the sauce! With Rice and Beans, and the chips and salsa, I was more than set for the night. My girlfriend tried the Ono Fajitas. I applaud the effort of trying to cook a fish fajita, but it didn't work out so well. The fish was a little over cooked, and it's probably a result of sitting in the skillet. It wasn't too bad, but I tried a piece and wouldn't recommend it. 

The restaurant itself is very casual. It's pretty much on par with the set up of any Mexican family restaurant chain. I really enjoyed dining here on a random Saturday night.
