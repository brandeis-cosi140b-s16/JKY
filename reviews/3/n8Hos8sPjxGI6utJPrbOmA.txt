Chipotle is my "fast food". I eat here at least twice a week. The night crew and day crew are like night and day! No pun intended. I avoid this location during the day because the staff is immature and the management is TERRIBLE. It's like eating at two different restaurants. I stood in line along with two other customers as employees chatted behind the counter and ate hot cheetos.
