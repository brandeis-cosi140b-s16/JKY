Good place for some decent Mexican food.  It may be better, but I Mexican food seems to have a glass ceiling on how good it can be.  I ordered the Taco Salad (aka: the not healthy salad), and it was very good.  I also tried the fried ice cream, it was good, but somewhat disappointing.  I will say the service was excellent.
