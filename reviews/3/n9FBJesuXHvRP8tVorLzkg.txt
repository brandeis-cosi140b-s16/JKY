I'm only giving three stars because of the salsa bar and the social aspect of this place. I came to visit this area and found that they have a poker night on Tuesdays. it is a fun place to hang out if you're way the heck over in this side of the valley, but the food is nothing to go crazy over.

I'm certain that they could go authentic if they wanted to do so, but it appears that they are catering to the middle aged white folk who like the super tamed down versions of Mexican cuisine.

The Salsa Bar is good and has some good Salsa's, but most things that I have tried, would be considered more of a bar food style dish that gets the job done while enjoying a Margarita or beverage and chatting with some locals.

The staff is super nice, and most people seem to know each other. The atmosphere is simple, fun, down to earth, and social.

Stop in to play poker on a Tuesday night or to grab a quick meal during the week, but don't go in expecting an authentic Mexican experience.

In a nutshell, this is a neighborhood joint that has conformed to it's clientele, which seems to have low expectations and are more appreciative of a friendly, and social atmosphere.

Cheers! =)
