This place was delicious but delivery took FOREVER. The driver did call to tell me he was going to be ten minutes late but he ended up being an hour late. Frustrating. Would have been much more tolerable if he'd just been honest to begin with. When he finally showed up (2 hours after we placed the order) he said he'd had to do a delivery downtown and gave us a card for 10% off next time. Seriously?  10%?  That's why restaurants have a "delivery area". Why are they delivering to downtown from North Vegas?  They need to either hire more drivers or limit their delivery area. Such a shame because the food really was tasty.
