I love this place. I love everything about it. Food is good. Chicken is tasty and hot (temperature, not spice). Its healthier than regular fast food depending on what you order. Prices are cheap. The salsa bar offers variety. The unlimited amount of onions, my favorite part!! Anyone who has been to one knows that it's delish. 

So why only 3 stars? For some reason, I don't know what it is, my order ALWAYS, let me repeat, ALWAYS, is wrong. I order a 3 piece meal, I get a 2 piece. I order a side salad, there's no dressing. I want rice as a side, I get fries. I go through the drive though, they forget my utensils. Something has always been wrong with my order. The employees there, friendly and fast. But seriously, get it together please. I love this place a lot, and it's not going to stop me from eating here, but please make sure the order is correct before handing it over to me. That is all.
