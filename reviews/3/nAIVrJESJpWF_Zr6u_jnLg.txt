Food was good, drinks were good, service was really slow. We had a party of 8. It took probably 10+ minutes to get out first drinks. Then some appetizers get delivered to our table... We didn't order anything yet, so waitress takes them away to find correct table. After that we put in our appetizer orders and continued to wait. Finally the apps came out. Had to wait more on additional drinks. Once we're got to the main meal everything lolled and tested good. Not sure if I will go back based on the slow service.

Don't get me wrong I like not being pestered by waitstaff, but this was more of just not being around.
