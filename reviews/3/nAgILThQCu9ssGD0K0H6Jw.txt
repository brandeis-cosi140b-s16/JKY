My wife and I really enjoyed coming here. I had always drove past but never stopped in. This place is a simple and fast mexican food joint. I had the Fajitas and they were really good for being fast food. My wife had the carnitas and she really like them as well. If you are looking for some good mexican fast food without the typical greasy feeling, this place is worth a try!
