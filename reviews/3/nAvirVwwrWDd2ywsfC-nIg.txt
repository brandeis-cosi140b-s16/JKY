Just like every other location: walk in, select your protein and your dish, and watch the crew make it to your specifications. Relatively cheap option in the area for lunch, and can be as healthy or unhealthy as you make it. 

I'm not particularly clear on the difference between the salads and the bowls, given that neither has too much lettuce, but either one is way healthier than their burritos- though to be fair, I've never tried their tacos.

Staff here mostly seems to be college students themselves, as are most of their customers- not a bad thing, just an observation. Bummed that this location doesn't have margaritas the way some others do, but that probably again goes back to their primary customer base being at a college.

Got a salad today for my dinner: brown rice, black beans, chicken and fajita veggies, with pico and corn salsas. Hefty portion for a not-so-hefty price: total was under $7, not bad at all.

Only criticism is that the chicken was on the dry side, though I did show up shortly before closing time on a Sunday, which I reckon is a slow day for this location.
