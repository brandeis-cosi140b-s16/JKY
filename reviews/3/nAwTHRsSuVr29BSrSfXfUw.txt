For a Chipotle it's on par.  The food is ok but inconsistent in portion size.  I have been here multiple times and I rarely get a consistent amount of food even though I usually order the same thing.  They have online ordering which is nice, BUT, it is rarely ready when I go to pick it up.  You still save time because they will make it while you are standing there avoiding the stares from everyone in line who has to wait.  I wish they would expand the menu a bit to include some of the soup items like QDoba has.
