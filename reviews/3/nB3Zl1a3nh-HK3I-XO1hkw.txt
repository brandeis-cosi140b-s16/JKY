I'm not very familiar with authentic Mexican food and from the other Yelp reviews it appears that this place is fairly on target with providing authentic Mex fare.  I ordered a shredded chicken taco and a fish taco (fish was pollock).  

I will say that I enjoyed the fish taco a lot more and while the shredded chicken taco wasn't bad, it just paled in comparison to my fish taco.  I especially liked that the tacos had a really limey taste to them - I like that tangy flavor to complement the savoriness of the fish and chicken.    

We shared some chips, guac and salsa as well and the chips were fantastic but the gauc wasn't doing anything for me.  It was creamier than I like and not much flavor to it - it kinda seems like it's store bought, rather than freshly made.

The salsa was good, but it also reminded me of the bottled Chi-Chi's brand mild salsa.  So I'm not dissing it - I really like bottled Chi Chi's salsa I was expecting something more at this place.

I think this place would do great in town and I'm not sure how well it will do in this location.  It seems so random and that they may have problems attracting and keeping a customer base.  But who knows - it looks like lots of people like it here and are willing to travel a bit.  

If I was in the area and in the mood for some Mexican food, I'd stop by, but I'm not convinced that I'd go out of my way.
