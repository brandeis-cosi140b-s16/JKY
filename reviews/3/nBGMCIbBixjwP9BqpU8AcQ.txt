It was pretty much your run of the mill fast food Mexican joint minus the drive through. A bit better than filibertos but they charge you for everything. 

The beans are vegan safe which is a plus and the burrito was a good size. 

The red sauce had virtually no flavor, as a matter of fact it was sort of bitter like maybe it had gone bad? 

Probably a bit over rated in my opinion but I would come back again.
