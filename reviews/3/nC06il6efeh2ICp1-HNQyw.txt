Not a bad little joint, and quite comparable to Filiberto's. I mainly get chorizo or carne asada burritos and both have been pretty good. On the weekends, I'll get their red menudo, which tastes fine, but is a bit heavy on the tripe and light on the hominy. The employees are pretty friendly, as well. A place worth returning to for a quick, cheap bite.
