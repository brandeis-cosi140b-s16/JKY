In my family, Pancho's is a definition of a specific style of Mexican food. Nope, it's not good, +but it's acceptable, cheap and overflowing food.
There are times that My Bride will specifically say she wants Pancho's Mexican. Other times we want Real Mexican, other times Tex-Mex, and rarely Del-taco/Taco bell Mexican.

Pancho's is steps above Taco Bell, a distant relative to (bad)Tex-Mex  and they have almost nothing to do with real Mexican.  
As the other reviewers stated, all you can eat, fun flag to raise for refills (kids love it) sopapeas are quite wonderful and fresh, like a beignet sort of.  The specific food choices dont matter in a place like this much like a cafeteria, food is food.  But if it's nearby, and you have a few kids to pay for, this is a fine way to please everyone who isn't expecting great food. $6 a person to eat out? And you dont have to eat in a car? Expectations should be set at that level, and you will be happy.

I admit that I enjoy it, but it's like admitting you like the McRib. Is that a real rib? Don ask, and bask in the wretchedness of awesome. 

It's a 5 star place, because it invented it's own definition of food, I just cant click on more stars and consider myself a trustworthy eating human. It's a 1 star joint, unless it's your poison of choice, then it's 4 stars of embarrassing guilty pleasure.

Enjoy or avoid, hope this helped in some way.
