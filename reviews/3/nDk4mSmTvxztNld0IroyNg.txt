It's hard to go wrong with chipotle. The food always tastes great. Don't let them skimp you. Everything except meat and guac you can ask for more and there's no extra charge, so there's that tip. Anyway, the lines are always long but you usually get through it fairly quickly so I don't mind. Chipotle is always busy no matter the location. The service is kind of inconsistent. Sometimes, I'll deal with fantastic employees and other times not so good at all. Don't order online, because 2/3 times that I have they hadn't even started making it yet when I went at the pick up time and there were no apologies of the sort given. Also, sometimes the rice is severely undercooked and crunchy. Three stars for flavor, but that's pretty much it.
