We decided to come here on a Satirday night to check it out. The ambiance was really nice and the live music was nice - a little too loud but it was solid. The waiter was on point answering our questions and the tres amigos was a great appetizer choice. The red sangria was nice and sweet and the ultimate tequila was awesome! Unfortunately, the place is a little too pricey for being what it is - a tex mex bar and sports lounge. Nonetheless, we were pretty satisfied. Next time, I'm getting that Cuatro Leches.
