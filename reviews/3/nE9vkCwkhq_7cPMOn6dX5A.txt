Tucked away in a little row of shops.... they park the hippie van near the street to serve as a sign.  Stop in for lunch or to grab a bite on the way home from work.  It's worth it.  The cost is low and the quality is good.  I like the hot dogs and hamburgers, but a friend swears by the buritto.  Last time I stopped in, I tried a taco, and wasn't disappointed.

I won't say this is the BEST burger, because it isn't, but when I apply my little formula of priorities which includes cost, convenience, quality, friendliness and service.... this place comes up a winner.  There are better burgers in town at 2 or 3 times the price, but when I eat here, in addition to having a decent meal at a good price in a friendly environment....I feel good for supporting a family owned business.
