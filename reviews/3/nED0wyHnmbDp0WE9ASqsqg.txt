This Qdoba location was one of our go-to lunch spots in downtown. The staff is nice, and efficient enough to get you out of the place faster than you'll assume when you encounter long lines. The space gets packed during lunch, as expected, but the turnover is fast, so tables open up pretty quickly. Like many downtown establishments, the rush will leave the space feeling a bit dirty (but honestly, most Qdoba's I go to aren't winning clean restaurant awards any time soon). 

The burritos aren't anything special, but where Qdoba always got our business is a) the rewards that help you earn free burritos, b) the shorter lines compared to Chipotle, and c) the free guac. Who doesn't love free guac?!?! Oh, and the burrito-only line that opens for lunch isn't a bad idea either!
