Just had a great trip to Phx and got to knock a lot of places off the ol' bookmark list. 
Mucho Macho is kinda dive-y and not super Mexican-y. As Taric says, "it's got a real stoner, SoCal vibe."
We came in on a Thursday at lunch time, and had to wait in line to order. The restaurant is tiny and packed. It probably has room to seat about 12, but they've packed in tables and chairs for 20. Seriously, when people are sitting all around you, the chairs are back to back. There's no way to get out (or to the soda machine) unless people scoot their chairs to the side for you.
Between the 5 of us we tried a variety of tacos, the hot dog, and the kids plate. I think the best deal is the 4 crispy tacos for $4. The kids plate is pretty awesome with meat, beans, rice, and a tortilla for $3, too.
While service is friendly and pretty quick, they gave me chicken tacos instead of al pastor, forgot the tortillas for the kids plate, and forgot to leave the chiles off my daughter's hot dog (which made it way too spicy for her). 
Overall, I would go back if somebody requested it, but I'd rather hit up Otro Caf√© if in the area.
