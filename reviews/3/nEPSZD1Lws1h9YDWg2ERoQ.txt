Cute little restaurant with decent food.  I ordered  a single fish taco and it came with enough fish to make two tacos which was a pleasant surprise.  Satisfied with the food however the staff could have been more friendly.  Left there thinking the staff must really dislike their jobs.  Glad I tried it but more than likely won't be going back anytime soon.
