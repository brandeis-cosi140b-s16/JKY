It's a bit deceiving when you see the misspelled banner on the building, but the food is decent. Upon sitting, we were immediately served with chips and salsa. It wasn't bad, but I've had better. The fajitas were mighty tasty. I didn't even try the beans, but the rice was mediocre. Worth going back but not going out of my way....
