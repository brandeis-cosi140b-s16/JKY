Its a nice taco place. some of the meat fillings stand out as excellent (barbacoa, tinga). most of the carne guisados (meat stews) are are tasty. but real tacos should not have lettuce and tomato on it. cheese, usually not also. real authentic tacos should not have any of that taco bell/chipotle crap on them. the tortillas are mediocre quality also. this place is OK overall, but in no way deserves a 5-star rating.
