I was shocked when I only spent $7 here, and got a huge burrito, drink, and chips with red and green salsa. Move over Taco Bell. Reminds me of food that abuelita would make really quick in the kitchen. The only thing that ruins it for me here is the service. Whether it is the drive thru- or stopping inside to eat. They just seem angry that you are giving them money. This is definitely the best fast food/mexican in the east valley, but don't expect to be greeted with a friendly smile all the time. Just remember, the food is good and take it at that.
