Get beyond the name and they may have something here. It's a great play off of the build to order service ie Chipotle etc, but instead of burritos it's enchiladas. I love the idea, but was a little disappointed by the descriptions of ingredients, ambiance and service. I think there should be a little more info on the sauces/salsa's. Might be a little helpful for those going for the first time. The place itself is a little stark or cold feeling. Maybe somewhat picky, but me and gf both thought the place felt weird. The service was sub par. The soup that was ordered was forgotten about and instead of reheating it because it sat on the counter they just served it to us cold. 

The upside is that this place is a great idea and good food here. The flour/corn tortillas are delicious and meat is tender and seasoned well. We will give another shot and update the review.
