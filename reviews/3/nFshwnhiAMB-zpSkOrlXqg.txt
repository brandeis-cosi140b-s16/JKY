We love the food from here! But why I gave them only 3 stars is because they don't give the tips to the employees. But instead give them to charity. If this was the employees choice it would be one thing, but it's the owners. When I tip it's because I appreciate the service and think my server deserves it. I just think that's a bad owner for you and does not encourage servers to do their best.
