I met friends here on their opening night. I will go back and try again assuming that's why there was some confusion. Also hoping they mix their drinks a little better. Had the house margarita and it was good, not great just good. We also ordered the Chinitas Sampler. It has several tastes of their dishes so we thought this would be a great way to try lots at once. The cheese nacho con chorizo was regular cheese nachos, didn't find any chorizo. I did really like the avocado rolls and would order them again. Chicken flautas could have come out of the Costco freezer, the same with the wings. 
I would really like to see them step up their salsa. I can handle (love too actually) spicy but this tasted like it came out of a bottle. When I asked for something hotter what I got really wasn't much better. In a town so full of Mexican places I know its hard to make yourself stand out. Just try a little harder guys. You will get there.
