We stumbled upon Fajita Grill while just walking around. We seen people sitting outside and figured we'd give it a try. I liked the outdoor seating and thought the food was very good but a bit overpriced. 

The chips and salsa were tasty. Someone had mentioned in a review that the chips seems store bought, I really can't say for sure, but either way they were good and and fair quality. I do believe the salsa was definitely homemade and enjoyed it a lot. 

I feel the authenticity of the food is just about on par. I had eaten there with my boyfriend and a friend who found the burritos to be the best they ever had. I had the enchilada, which I enjoyed very much. It's close to one of the tastiest I've had (but I've lived in Arizona and traveled to Mexico which is where I've truly had the best) The portion size was awesome. I was stuffed for rest of the night! The service was decent. Not super friendly, but certainly not bad by any means. I would certainly go back and just be bit a bit more prepared for the price next time. 

Pro: Nice location, good food and portion size

Cons: A bit overpriced and semi-friendly service
