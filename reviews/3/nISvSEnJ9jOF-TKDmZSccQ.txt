Their homemade burrito shells set them apart. The food is better than average for a fast food place. This place is usually busy anytime. There will be times when the order is wrong, Eg like you pay to add cheese and beans to your carniasada burrito and there is one missing. At that that point- dealing with customer service sucks. You may be argued with. If you have to drive back that really sucks they will in no way act like they care or that your time is valuable. But the food is delicious, you will like it. There's an opportunity for better customer service!
