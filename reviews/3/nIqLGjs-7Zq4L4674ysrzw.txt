Food can be hit or miss, but there are some real gems in their menu, you just have to find them.  I pretty much always stick to the steak and eggs burrito (there are not any eggs in it) which is a great, though very rich, combination of steak, cheese, and hollandaise sauce.  The cranberry salsa is seriously good and the chocolate bread pudding is addicting.  Seriously, there are nights I order dinner from them just to get the bread pudding.  The chips and salsa are good, but overpriced for how much you get and the fish and tacos are bland.  I'd recommend trying some of the more unusual flavor combinations as that's where Burrito Drive shines.
