This place wasn't busy at all on a Friday night around 7 PM so the group I was with got in very quickly. There are meals over $15, but most were around $10-11. 

Service was great up until we got our checks because they were taking forever.But, we did order 4 separate checks.

My food tasted good; I had the "Chicken Pueblo". But, as far as portions go, my boyfriend was quite disappointed. 

I would go back if I was in the Suncoast, but would prefer the TGI Fridays near the theater.
