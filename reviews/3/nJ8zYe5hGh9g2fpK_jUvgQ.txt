I've been going to Chipotle for quite some time now, and I always get the same burrito. Well the first time I went to this location, something tasted odd with my burrito, the carnitas weren't prepared correctly. The second and third didn't taste like my normal burrito either, and this location is not very clean or organized. I may not come back.
