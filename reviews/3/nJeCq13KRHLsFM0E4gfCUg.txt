Cucos is my favorite Mexican restaurant so far on the west side of town.  Having just moved to the area, there's a lot still to explore, but it's hard when I already like Cucos so much and is right down the road! 
Pros:  Staff is very friendly; fairly inexpensive menu; margaritas are a steal; salsa is very good and fresh guac is outstanding; never have to wait for a table
Cons:  The interior decor is something to be desired, but I think they must have taken over another bar/business; wish they had a larger outdoor patio that didn't overlook the parking lot

It's unfortunate for some of the negative reviews.  I'm somewhat of a foodie and have been eating Mexican all my life.  I think the food has been good!  Not great, but you're not paying for great either.  It's all relative.

Update:  Since my initial review, I noticed some changes in the menu.  They must have switched chefs or food suppliers because there is a difference in the quality now.  The salsa doesn't seem as fresh, and some of the menu items are just different.  As a result, I dropped it 1 star.
