Not the worst burger, but absolutely not the best. Place is a little joint. Staff is great. We came at "rush hour" around lunch time. Line was out the door! I was impressed at the professionalism of the staff... The crowd didn't faze them! (good idea to call your order ahead of time) Nothing good or bad to say about what I had, just wasn't my taste.  With the crowd I thought I'd be phenomenal. With that being said, I was disappointed.  Paid $18.00 for two burgers and two fries which wasn't that good. Doubt I'll be back.
