Am I the only person who thinks a restaurant that has SOUP in the name of the place, should offer more than 2 choices??? I was very disappointed not to have more soups to choose from.
That said, an enchilada with the option of a Poblana pepper in place of a tortilla was an unexpected delight! It was getting busy when I was there and I felt rushed, but I will go back another time and try something different.
