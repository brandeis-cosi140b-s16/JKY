Kind of did a breeze in and out, I rarely eat at Chipotle, so the one time I did want it there was one right down the street where I was at! It wasn't busy at all inside, I mean it's located at West Gate and there's a ton of eateries around there, depends what you're up for!

But I was up for Chipotle that day (12/12/14) and the staff was super nice, me with my bad hearing I had to ask the gals to repeat it to me twice - I'm still young! This shouldn't be happening to me! But they were patient haha, the food was good too, a nice warm burrito for a chilly day!

I think I will stop here again, and just ask for a little less red salsa since it ended up being too hot for me!
