Made the mistake of going here right at the stroke of 12PM... lines around the block. At first I thought they were giving away free stuff... but no such luck on my part.

If you have ever eaten at a Chipotle before, this is going to be no great surprise when I tell you... Its the same as every other place!

If you have never eaten here before...
The burritos are HUGE! The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. And the food was fresh and hot.

I had a burrito bowl with 1/2 carnitas and 1/2 barbacoa beef. Yum.

This location does have outdoor seating which was nice today. 

I also enjoy reading the cutsie messages they put on their cups.
