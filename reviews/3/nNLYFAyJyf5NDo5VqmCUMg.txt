I have been meaning to come to Shayside for some drinks for a while decided why not Steel Cactus. Mind you this was about 1:00PM but still I was vising some friends and we wanted to check it out. We get lead to the up stairs bar where the three of us hung out. Total must have been 6 other people on the upstairs patio not including the bartender. Drinks where moderately cheap but my scotch whiskey was very flat. My friend also got some food and wasn't impressed by it either, just meh. Place is ok but I bet their are better places to go.
