Update: with new management and the one-year re-opening celebration in early October this year comes a completely different happy hour menu.

Overall, I give the new happy hour 3/5 whereas their old set-up was a clear 5/5. They have raised their house margarita prices by $0.75 and none of their tequilas are half-off anymore (REALLY DISAPPOINTING!). They also now only have 3 or 4 featured tequilas that will apparently change up every once and awhile that are all priced at $4 a shot.

Also, they have their tacos individually priced on the HH menu, but you must order three at a time and you can't mix and match them either.  They also changed the recipes on the pork tacos (pray they did not change the fried fish ones, OR ELSE!) Not only that, but the tacos are not even discounted for happy hour. What. The. Hell. Whoever is running this place now obviously does not know what they are doing, because the poor waitresses have to explain the happy hour menu to every customer, new or old. 

The ONLY positive would be the fact that the waitresses no longer have to dress in all-white outfits that looked a bit trashy. I always hated them. The new shirts are awesome, though, and I definitely want to buy one! It has that cool Dia de los Muertos sugar skull design they use on the side and the shirt itself is black. 

This is no longer the best happy hour in Tempe. I don't even know what to do with myself anymore because this place USED to be my favorite. I still like it a lot, but change is not always good.
