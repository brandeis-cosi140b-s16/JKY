Three stars mostly because its added to the very short list of places my kids(gluten sensitivity) can eat....otherwise probably wouldn't be my first or second choice for fast food. The chicken was way too dry but I also noticed that we came in at the end of the "lunch chicken" laying on the grill. As soon as we were leaving they started a fresh batch! Bad timing I guess.
