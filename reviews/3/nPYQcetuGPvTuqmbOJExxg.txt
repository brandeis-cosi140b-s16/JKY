Habanero's is a small storefront with about six tables inside and another five on a patio.  You order at a counter and the food is brought to your table.  We've all done that before - no problem.  

The menu is pretty standard Mexican, with tacos, burritos, a few platters that include rice and beans, chips and salsa, and guacamole.  

There's no sense commenting on the service because there basically isn't any.  Ditto ambiance.  You just come here to satisfy your hunger.

So it all comes down to the food, and at Habanero's it's not bad, but it's not really good either.  Better than Taco Bell but not as good as a dozen sitdown Mexican restaurants in the area, and really not much cheaper.  Why go here?
