The Taco Shop serves pretty legit Mexican food, but it's nothing special. Since the bar isn't set so high for Mexican food in Madison, this place makes for a worthwhile stop whenever you're craving it. Most of the food here tastes like stuff you could make at home. But saving myself a couple hours of preparing meat and chopping vegetables makes this place seem worth the money.

Sometimes this home-made taste is good, sometimes it's bad. The burrito, for example, is tasty for this exact reason. Combine that with how huge it is, and it makes for a great mainstay. On the other hand, some things like the tortilla chips and salsas thoroughly disappoint. The chips taste like Tostitos, and the salsa also resembles something you'd get from the discount aisle at the grocery store. This lack of creativity in places where it really matters leaves you wondering why they even bother in the first place. Any good Mexican restaurant will go to great lengths to perfect its own salsa.

One exception to the home-made taste is the chimichanga. It is a delicious fried burrito smothered in all kinds of different sauces, making for a big flavorful mess. But at 8 to 9 dollars, you'll feel like you're kind of overpaying for it. It's not THAT good. However, they at least make up for it by making it so huge that it's impossible to finish in one sitting. 

All in all, the Taco Shop earns a solid 3 stars. It's good Mexican food. It's not great Mexican food.
