Dinner on the El Segundo patio includes complementary entertainment by watching the parade of people walking Las Vegas Blvd. Our server Jesse was friendly, helpful and attentive by following up and keeping the water glasses filled from the bottle provided to the table.
For starters the Guacamole was tasty and not spicy since we ordered medium. The chips and salsa were plentiful and served with charred tomato salsa, roasted tomatillo salsa and pico de gallo. The margarita's were a little on the sweet side but refreshing.
Our choice of entrees were the grilled Chicken Tacos served with cilantro rice, black beans, pico de gallo, sour cream and large corn or flour tortillas. The dish could be improved as the chicken was overcooked and dry. 
The grilled Achiote Shrimp is made with a serrano and garlic marinade. This fajita platter is served with grilled bell peppers, onions, corn on the cobb and asparagus along with cilantro rice, black beans, sour cream, pico de gallo, salsa and warm tortillas, mini corn or flour. As with the chicken the shrimp was cooked too long and dry. Overall the food was plentiful and service was great. I would award 4 stars if the chicken and shrimp were not overcooked.
