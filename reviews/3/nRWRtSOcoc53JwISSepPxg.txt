Pretty good veggie burrito
I prefer Chipotle because theirs feels larger and watching it being made makes it more appetizing.
Nonetheless this tasted good and the lady at the counter was pretty nice.
I did a takeout cos the seating did not look particularly welcoming.. high stools and tables.
This place has got the food right, but needs to work on quantity and ambience.. and also have a printed menu which clearly marks out the vegetarian items.
