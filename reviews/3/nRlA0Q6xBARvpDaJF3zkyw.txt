Worth a stop for quick refreshment & meal. Solid restaurant with easy access from the 60 vic Gold Canyon. Entrees sit around $11 +\- $2 with complete selection of Mexican beer to complement.
What's notable - shrimp (taco, burrito or fried). Fajita's also score high. Flavorful salsa
What's not - flan. If your expecting a small delicate dome shaped custard with carmel sauce you be disappointed ... Served like pie with crust and whipped cream.
