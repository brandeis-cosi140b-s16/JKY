Incredibly mediocre Mexican food at high prices. Strike one,  one they close at 9 PM, even on Friday & Saturday, what kind of a successful restaurant closes at 9 PM? Also, they are not open on Sundays. We were there at 8:30 pm  on a Saturday and there was a steady flow of customers, they could probably capitalize on being open until 10 or 11.
     The dining room is clean and inviting but a bit too bright(no ambiance), they do have several televisions with a variety of sports on. I got the Chicken burrito which was bland and not very flavorful, I ordered the Grande size which was not very grande , the small size which my son got was absurd, he ended up having to get a second one. The only reason I got a Chicken Burrito is a steak burrito was twice as much($4.99 for chicken, $9.99 for steak). The guacamole & salsa was flavorless, the salsa may as well be ketchup. The chips are too thin and too little salt variety.
    Their prices are way to high for a self serve restaurant, this alone will keep me from returning.
The Horchata was tasty and they did have bottles of Negra Modelo which is nice.
  Three stars, not memorable but not horrible, Might stop in again but certainly won't be one of my regular stops.
