It's official I can probably eat Mexican food every day.  Either for lunch or for dinner.  What else could explain two nights in a row?  

After a little pre-vacation shopping the husband and I were hungry.  Manuel's was right in front of us and we decided to go on in.  The weather was nice so we sat outside.  The seating here is very back yard with a pool seating.  Tables made out of rod iron.  Uncomfortable chairs that are angled weirdly.  Not the most comfortable.  Our waiter came over immediately (he was the also the bartender) to take our drink order, our chips and salsa came out shortly after.  I do have to agree with the other Yelpers.  What is with the small bowl of chips?  It would behoove Manuels to get a bigger bowl so they dont have to go back and forth 20 times for more chips.  My husband dislikes onions but also likes things a little spicier.  He ordered the hot sauce and it came in even a smaller dish.  He said it tasted like "spicy ketchup".  He still liked it.  

I ordered the Fiesta Platter.  A bunch of different things for $11.50.  It was good.  Their beans were delish.  I think that might have been my favorite thing.  The star in this dish was probably the mini pollo especial.  Several different things come out on one plate.  The pollo especial has a sauce tht they absolutely covered.  Inside is plenty of chicken.  You can see all of the big chunks left.  That was good.  It was a tad bit salty but it was good.  

My hubby ordered the # 1 combo dinner.  Red chili burro, cheese enchilada, beans.  He liked it.  If he's not talking during dinner he's into the meal.  Either that or he's just super hungry.  Our meal was good.  The wait staff was super attentive.  In a pinch it did just fine.
