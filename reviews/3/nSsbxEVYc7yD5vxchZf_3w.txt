I went to this Serrano's location after a hard days work on home improvements with my dad. I got the taco salad, which was disappointing. I think you get more food in the taco salad from Taco Bell and it's half the price and even tastes a little better. Our waitress was great though, she was really nice and attentive. 

To sum it up, the food was disappointing, but feed me and the service was great. That's all she wrote.
