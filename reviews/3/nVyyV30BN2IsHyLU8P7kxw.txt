Chipotle has the best food of any major chain.  This location is always clean, and the food is always fresh.  I go to this location probably 2-4 times a month.  My problem is the service is usually not so great.  I mean I am a regular see the same people, order the same thing and except for a few of the girls they all seem to be more interested in talking to each other than serving the customer.  There is one guy who wears glasses who always works the register.  I would fire that guy, he has the worst customer service of everyone in that place.
