The only reason I ended up here was because I was hoping to go to Roy's for some ono.

But, OH, NO! Roy's is gone and Taberna is now in its place (note for those who use google maps).

I liked the chips and salsa, which were plantain, blue corn and yucca chips with green & red salsa. I also liked the sangria. I thought the grilled shrimp salad was amazing.

I didn't like that the salad was $16. Knock it down to twelve bucks for my 5 shrimp and greens and bacon and it's more reasonable.

(it was a damn good salad, and there was a lot of it, but I can't justify $16 for a salad with 5 medium sized shrimp on it)
