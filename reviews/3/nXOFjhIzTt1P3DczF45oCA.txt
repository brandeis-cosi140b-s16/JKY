Typical Qdoba location, set up is almost exactly the same as other location.  What set this one apart from the other locations is that it was able to handle the influx flow of customers that seemed to form a line to the door.

They worked efficiently to make the food as fast as they could.  The guy in the kitchen area was what really made them go so fast.  It was like he knew what was going to be going out soon and had it sitting there waiting for them when they were about to turn around.  The lady at the head of the line made it a smooth process too.  She had everything set up and was on to the next person.

One of the major things that I don't like is that it seems that the portion sizes have gone down since my last endeavor to a Qdoba.  I got a naked burrito and the bowl it was in seems to have shrunk.  I was still kind of hungry afterwards.
