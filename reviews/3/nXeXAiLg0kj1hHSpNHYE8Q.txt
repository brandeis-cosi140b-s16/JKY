Ok, wasn't impressed. Came for happy hour and did small plates.

First sign things were amiss..
1. our almond horchata, we saw the waiter pour some almond breeze milk into the drink. we politely called him out on it when he brought it over, and he admited, "they don't get enough orders to make it worth it, so they cheat." if that's the case than don't put it on your menu!  
2. guacamole - they are smart, its served on this bed of cabbage in a bowl giving it the impression of quantity but it's not.

on to the main meal.. we did small plates.
tried their chorizo steamed mussels, duck taquitos, and green chile pork stew.

everything was super salty and a bit too rich for my taste buds. But prices weren't too bad for happy hour, i think I would have been even more annoyed if I had to pay full price.

happy hour (going off of memory here): 4-6pm, $1 off small plates, guac for $5 (normally $7)
