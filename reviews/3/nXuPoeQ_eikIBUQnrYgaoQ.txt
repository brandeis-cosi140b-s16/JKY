Love the food, hate the frantic pace of ordering and preparing it! 
It's always busy when I'm here and it's so loud they can't hear people order. 
Time for a new ordering system. Chipotle seems innovative, maybe they can improve upon it!
All that aside, the food is very good and I dare to say I like the tacos better than Rubio's, for the most part. But their salsa isn't fantastic. I get 2 or 3 of ranging intensity and that makes a better tasting taco, especially the carnitas! 
Chips don't come with the meals, which is kind of lame.
