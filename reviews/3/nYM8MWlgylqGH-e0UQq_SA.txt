This Chipotle is located in the Tempe Marketplace and for those of you who have ventured here well you know it can be a beast to get to it. The food and service is typical of any other chipotle but the parking and the crowds make this location a real challenge. So if you just have to have chipotle this one is as good as any other...but again be warned this one may not be worth your time due to all the parking and crowd issues. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
