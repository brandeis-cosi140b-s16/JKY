One of the older Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, it definitely has that divey feel nailed down. Service was spectacular, the ambiance so-so, and the food above average. For example, I loved the various unusual tacos (both soft shell and hard shell) that you won't find in your run-of-the-mill TexMex place, but did not care for the salsa at all, with almost a bell-pepper taste. The margaritas were great and all-around, 3 of us finished a pitcher of margaritas shared an appetizer and ate meals that filled us to the gills, for $100 including a generous tip because our waiter was so attentive and pleasant. I'd recommend if you are looking for a no-frills place with good food. The outside patio has a smoking area that did drift over into the non-smoking area, so depending on whether you're a smoker or not, that may or may not be a benefit or detriment. Also: Bring cash!
