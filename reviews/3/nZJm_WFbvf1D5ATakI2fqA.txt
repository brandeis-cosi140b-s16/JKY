Went on a wednesday night for dinner at 7pm and there was one other party eating. Not a good sign to start off but i was not going to let that change my mind after the good reviews. There was only one waiter and a hostess working and you could hear a pin drop in this place. i ordered a cadillac marg. to start which was pretty good and the carna asada tacos which was brought out in a nice display. it had high quality meat and unbelivable flavor. Sabor is a little over priced for mexican food though
