Came here with a large party with proclivities towards shenanigans, and they were up to the challenge.  Great chips / guacamole.  You have the option for BIG margaritas, which inevitably led to some problems later on.  The server was cheerful but the entrees took forever.  We ended up taking everything to go and eating it up in the room, and they were incredibly accommodating.  The beef burrito tasted like the whole thing was thrown in a deep fryer (think egg roll).  The enchiladas were tasty.  Nothing was particularly outstanding.  I definitely wouldn't go out of the way for this place.
