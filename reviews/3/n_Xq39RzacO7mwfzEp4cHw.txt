I thought the food here was fine. I want to start by saying that. It all looked/smelled good, and I would go back to explore if I had friends that really liked the place. For a taco place, they have a good selection of beers.

But, I would also say it's a very hipster place trafficking in food that's "elevated," which I think just means "more eloquently described and expensive." Vegetarians will have the option of two salads, a pepper-and-hummus taco and standard sides (beans, queso and rice, my veggie ppl). If you're there for tacos and down for the meats, there are a few "new school" tacos that might pique your interest, but breaking $5 for a street taco is something I just can't get behind, even if they are created by self-initiated taco guildsmen creating flavors "worthy of the masters."

Real talk, I'll probably go for the "all you can eat tacos" on Sundays at some point. It's got a good vibe for hanging out, I can eat a lot of tacos, and there's a church altar stocked with booze. But I cannot overlook that this place makes me laugh out loud. It is a parody of itself - the hipster gastropub where an exclusive guild of prodigy taqueros fulfill their destiny of re-inventing the street taco into something more perfect not ere discovered, perfectly situated next to the Starbucks and Buffalo Exchange, across the street from the place where a starry-eyed young man fell back in love with the enchilada by redefining it. (Seriously, you can't make this stuff up. It's like they forgot we turn it into poop.)
