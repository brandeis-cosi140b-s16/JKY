This is a small hole in the wall type of place. It was clean and well kept. The prices are decent. I had the torta with everything on it and it was pretty good! Nice size, and will definitely fill you up. Plus I liked the way they made it- not sloppy at all. The guacamole was so tasty too. I had to try the horchata, but I was disappointed as it wasn't very sweet and they didn't mixed it very well, Roberto's horchata is way better. Overall, this is a good place for a quick bite :)
