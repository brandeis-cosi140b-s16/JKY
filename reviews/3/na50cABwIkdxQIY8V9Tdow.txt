Not too crazy about this place... I ordered a margarita straight up, no salt... the bartender/server looked at me like I was ordering a burrito martini??? so he poured me a warm margarita mix in a rocks glass... it wasn't that bad actually but I was hoping for a nice chilled margarita in a martini glass... I think it was too much to ask...we ordered some tacos and there were okay...not great... the place looks neat and very clean that is a plus but I'm not sure if I'll go back... Sorry San Gabriel :(
