I LOVE Chipotle. I'd give most Chipotles at least 4 stars (probably five).

Food-wise this Chipotle is no different than any other location (solid & 5-star worthy).

However, I've been to this location one time. In addition to my burrito bowl & mom's 3 soft tacos we ordered chips and salsa. Got home, opened the bag, no chips & salsa (granted, I probably should have paid attention to make sure they were placed in the bag...they were on the receipt). First impressions are everything, and this oversight left me cold to this Chipotle :(
