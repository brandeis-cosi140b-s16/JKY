Eh, not bad, not great! Not a fan of Mexican food anyway unless it is authentic and I am at Gallo Blanco, Frank and Lupe's, or Barrio Cafe. However, that said, this place is not so bad. Cheap and lots of food. When in Scottsdale and you are desperate for a late dinner after visiting the bar scene check it out. I liked their sit down restaurant once upon a time but they closed their doors. This is what's left. It reminds me of a school lunch cafeteria in a way. lol! Hey I ate here last night with my guy and you know what? I actually really liked the Chili Rellenos and their sauces. I am very picky about salsas and sauces from all the Mexican restaurants I worked at over the years. Their hot sauce is really good.
