$1 margaritas, $1 tacos, $2 tequila shots and $2 draft beers, can't go wrong with prices like that! For those prices you're not getting gourmet food but the tacos aren't bad either. The chips & salsa is $3 and is bottomless, the waitress actually offered to box the leftover chips for us to take with us too. 

I wouldn't make a special trip to go here but if you're near Bally's it's a place to get some decent CHEAP food and drinks!
