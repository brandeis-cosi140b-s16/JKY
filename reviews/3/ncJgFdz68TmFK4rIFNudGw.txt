For being in a part of town with very limited options, Cocomo Joe's isn't a bad choice.  It also doesn't hurt that it's one of the few places to grab a drink in this area that's open past midnight and isn't a long drive home.  The bar has an unnecessarily over the top tiki theme, but I wouldn't say that it it's tacky enough to keep anyone away.  It's just very corny, but at least they picked a theme and stuck with it.  The younger crowd won't have any reason to hang out at Joe's, but anyone over 30 just looking for a night out and nothing crazy will enjoy the place.

The restaurant is massive with plenty of TV's playing whatever big game is on, and a stage for live music.  Service is very friendly.  The beer selection is pretty good.  The food isn't the greatest that you will eat, but it isn't awful, and the portions are huge.
