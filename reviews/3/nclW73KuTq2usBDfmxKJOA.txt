Stopped here for some tacos before a night of drinking across the way at the Red Hawk Tavern..."authentic" maybe not, but the meat had flavor, something not every "Mexican" restaurant can achieve, I was pleasantly surprised by the portions and the service was quick and easy.

Three steak tacos with every thing on them, good food and even better prices!

If I ever move back to Las Vegas I would for sure visit this place again.
