I have never eaten at a Rubio's before so have nothing to compare it to. I had their shrimp tacos and thought they were pretty good. The chips that came with them were kind of thick and not very tasty and the little bowl of beans that came with was not so hot either. The soda machine had Vanilla Coke, which was awesome :) I guess my biggest complaint was about the salsa bar. Four different kinds of salsa and with all of them they had the heat but no flavor. We have all tasted good salsa before...this wasn't it. A small redeeming factor was the pickled peppers at the bar, which were excellent and a nice touch.
