I gotta admit, I'm having trouble with this review.  It was a night of averages.  We sat down pretty quick, waitress took our drink order fairly quickly (she didn't seem to know their own beer selection). I ordered the Tio's Pollo Con Queso, which was decent, but certainly nothing to rave about.   I do have to compliment the pricing, which was very reasonable ($10-$15).  I think it's an improvement over the previous place, especially with decor, but it's not somewhere I would go to on a regular basis, but good enough if you live nearby and don't feel like driving.
