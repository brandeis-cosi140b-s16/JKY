The truth is that I love Mexican food. I could eat it daily - more than once a day, even.

Tijuana Flats serves Mexican food. It was definitely Mexican food. But just how good?

My Norrito ("No + burrito") bowl with chicken had all one expects to find in such a bowl: chicken, rice, beans, pico de gallo, and guacemole. 

It wasn't quite as warm as desired. I would prefer the rice, beans and meat be hot enough that mixing with cold guac & pico won't cool it completely.

And I don't like red onions. The pico de gallo is laden with red onions. Kudos to the manager who suggested getting no pico, but asking for tomatoes and extra cilantro.

The salsa was hearty and rich, although nothing too exciting. The tortilla chips were fine, not as good as numerous other restaurants.

What differs this place from other slightly-fast Mexican places:

-You order at a counter like others, BUT then a waitstaff takes over every step of your dining experience.
-The hot sauce bar is extensive.

Me, I prefer a salsa bar to a hot sauce bar.

Conclusion After One Visit: 
It's only minorly different than Moe's/Qdoba/Salsarita's/Chipotle, mainly in that they bring the food to you and continue to wait on you once you've ordered.
