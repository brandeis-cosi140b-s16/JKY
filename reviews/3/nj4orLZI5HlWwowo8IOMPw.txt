After moving here from LA and living there for 30 years I think I have a sense of a good Mexican spot and this place isn't on top of the list but it isn't the worst. I ordered 10 tacos here. A mixture of all the meats they had available. I was surprised it came out to almost $30 and it was on a Tuesday,. Where's the taco Tuesday love, Don? The tacos were pretty big and I understand why they were almost $3 each. But It was difficult to eat because the tortilla kept coming apart. Usually tacos use double tortilla and these were a single tortilla so I just gave up and ate it with a spoon.
 I love their sauce bar filled with 2 different sauces (red and green salsa verde), cucumbers, green onions, limes, raddish onions and jalapenos. My opinion is anyone can make and sell tacos but the thing that will separate yourself from the competition is the house sauce. If you can make a great sauce I will be forever loyal to you. Their sauce was average, nothing that popped in my opinion. I wanted a kick. A sauce that made your eyes wide open when you poured it on your food and take that first bite while nodding your head in agreement that the sauce has taken you hostage to it's flavor. The good thing is that it's open 24 hours, so if I need a hangover remedy at 3 a.m. I know where to go.
