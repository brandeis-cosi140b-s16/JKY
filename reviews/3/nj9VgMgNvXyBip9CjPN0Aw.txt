Finally went today after living in Phoenix over 5 months now. (Hooray for being here 5 months!) I went for lunch with a friend/co-worker. The line was super long, but they placed a female employee in the line who took orders and swiped your credit card even before you made it to the counter. I'm sure this helps moves things along during their lunch and dinner rushes. The employee in line and the counter gals were not overly friendly. Actually, you could tell they pretty much hate their jobs. 

Now on to the food. I had the "naked" chicken burrito. I'm sure they call it something else at Chipolte, but I don't remember what. The price was right, but lacked the extras I get at Qdoba. Less toppings- no free chips, less salsa choices, and no extra sauces. And $1.80 extra for guac?! Yikes. Overall I prefer Qdoba in flavor, selection, and overall experience. I should not complain as I did not pay for my lunch. I am ready to try Baja Fresh next....or just head to Qdoba.
