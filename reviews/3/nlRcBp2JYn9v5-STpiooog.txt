I can Give you the best review for this place because I live a block away and have eattin there on a number of occasions... I really only go there for there for their red chili burros or menudo which is my option rate pretty darn good most of the time. I've ordered their hard tacos they absolutely suck! they are all lettuce and cheese, I'm sorry but wheres the meat??? this is a hit or miss kind of place and all depends what day you go on and what you order. my recommendation's are burros red and green, menudo weekends only, the machaca plate or to all together hit up azteca or la torteca witch are better and in the same area... eat good!
