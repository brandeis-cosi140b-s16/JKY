**Summary**
       - Lunch Special - They have a lunch special for $8.95 Wednesday through Sunday. It's a really good deal and includes a drink (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg?select=1m4c2eotnlfsD3whZLohoA).
       - Chips and Dips - You're given a chips with beans, salsa, and guacamole (all house made) when you're seated. You can see the chunks of avocado in the guac. It's delicious (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg?select=qP5qEupOH8WAHq0wXYHgdw).
       - Fideo soup - You receive fideo soup with almost every order. It's a salty tomato based soup with angel hair pasta in it (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg?select=c_Fo6l5F1uAeLg0MWAWbDQ).
**Ordered**
       - $14.95 Rib-eye Skillet - The steak was juicy but had a tomato flavor that I didn't believe steak should have (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg?select=w3lbn27Wn_UTSDAlGJiRQw).
       - $12.95 Carne Asada - Skirt steak was a bit thin. It had a charcoal flavor that was pretty tasty (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg?select=th7JTCiLmeIyUF9F9oxgQg).
**Recommendations**
       - The chips and dip you get at the beginning of your meal is half the reason I go here. I don't care too much for the soup and the Mexican food is decent.
