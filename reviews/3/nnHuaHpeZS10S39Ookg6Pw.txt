I tried Del Taco over 20 years ago. I had thought it so bad I have never eaten it since. 

Driving towards home after showing some homes I was about to pass a Del Taco. I thought what the hell time to give it another try. 

Nice clean store, alert employee, no wait. 

The food was fine, nothing special really, but fine if you happen to be hungry and it is there to be had. 

The price can not be beat for what I ate. $3 plus tax. 

I suspect I might be back with less time in between.
