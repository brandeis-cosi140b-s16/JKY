This place is weird because when you walk up, it's a bright yellow building with Mexican decor and music playing...then you walk inside, and it's an old Ruby Tuesday's or something.  The TVs were all playing Univision...guess that counts for some authenticity points!

The service was friendly and quick.  Chips and salsa are free (and unlimited), but that was my favorite part of the meal.  The food is okay but rather bland, and required a dousing of the four kinds of hot sauce set out on the table.

I would come back with friends for drinks (and chips and salsa), but that's it.  Although it's not saying much, there are better Mexican places in the 'burgh.
