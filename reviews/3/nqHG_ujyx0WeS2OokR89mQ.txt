I really enjoy Chipotle...enough for 5 stars. Giving this location 3 Stars bc the service was bad. Not even one employee cracked a half smile when we were in there. I left feeling disappointed, didn't order my usual drink and chips with guac. I was glad to be out of this one...I just don't think the employees like it at this location. :(
