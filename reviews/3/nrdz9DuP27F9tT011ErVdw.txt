Typical pseudo "Mexican" food that I would expect to find in the middle of a Vegas hotel. When I asked the waiter which was better of the choices I was looking at, he jumped on the pork with such conviction that I was really looking forward to it. What I got was pretty close to Texas style BBQ pulled pork. It was ok, but I am not a BBQ pulled pork fan and I was really hoping for something more like carnitas. Judging from everyone's dishes, it looks like the theme is the same...severely Americanized Mexican food.
