For a while now I saw these two hippie joints popping up all over. I decided to give one a try. We went for lunch. 

I ordered the 3 taco pack for $5 and a hot dog and fries for $4. I really enjoyed the hot dog and the tacos were... ok. The tacos are typical street style tacos on flour tortillas. Beware the lime slice that they throw in every taco, it was a awful surprise i wasn't expecting.. The beans that they threw in the taco were slightly under cooked so they were a little hard. 

The hot dog was on a toasted bun which was good, the all beef hot dog had great flavor and they pilled the cheese and bacon on the top of it (I ordered the bacon, cheese and tomato hot dog). 

I would go back but I will probably stay away from the tacos and just go with the hot dog. 

My search for great tacos continues... 

Hot dog, maybe not...
