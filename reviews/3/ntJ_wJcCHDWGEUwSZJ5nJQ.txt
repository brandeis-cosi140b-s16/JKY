So i read all the glowing reviews of this place, and knowing the history of the joint, i was excited to try out the new place. 

As Richard Attenborough would say, they "spared no expense" in the remodel. They've transformed a generic Joey's of Chicago into a classy, snappy decor, with a twist on the unisex bathrooms. The patio outside is very welcoming when the weather permits and they did throw in a couple of TVs to catch the game.  They've added the prerequisite in Arcadia, dual garage door that opens the bar onto the patio. Should be a nice touch in a few months. 

We were greeted promptly and found a nice hi-top in the bar area. The wine and beer list is extensive. We were informed of the happy hour specials and decided that would be our focus for this visit. 

We started with their Dulce Camarones---small lightly battered fried shrimp with slice veggie garnish on a bed of lettuce with aioli. This dish was disappointing, the shrimp was small and had a very mild taste. The aioli was the strongest flavor by far, and that was muted. Then we tried the Carne Tacos and the pork tacos. The carne was moist, and delicious, the pork was mediocre. Each order came with three tacos, which were 2-3 bites each. 

We finished off with  Alitas (Grilled Wings) coated with Habanero glaze. These had a pleasant yet mild flavor, but not as spicy as I had hoped

So why the three stars? Well I'd give them 2.5 if I could. Maybe my expectations were too high based upon the previous reviews. We spent 34 dollars including tip, and didn't order any drinks. Meh, I expected and wanted more from my visit.
