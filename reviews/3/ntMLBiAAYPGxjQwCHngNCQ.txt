On the Border is OK.Not bad but not great either. I was there last night meeting up with some friends and I discovered something pretty cool about them. If you order guacamole as an appetizer they come out with a bunch of ingredients including a lot of avocado obviously and make your own customized guacamole just the way you want it! I don't even like guacamole, but that's awesome! They should start doing it for salsa too!
