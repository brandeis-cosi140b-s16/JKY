An experience like no other. Great fillings make for great enchiladas and tacos. Love the build your own concept especially the fried egg! I've been here a few times and had the opportunity trying the modelo braised bison that usually finishes around noon. It's good I think it lacked a bit in flavor but what do I know lol. Tried the soup and was just not impressed. Left it after three or four spoonfuls. The enchis keep me coming back!
