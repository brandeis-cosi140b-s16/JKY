Its a 4 star for the food but had to take off a point for service.

The menu was a bit difficult to navigate as most of it was in Spanish.  OK, I can deal with that but this IS the US and MOST of us DO speak English so maybe the next time (if it happens) they can update the menu a bit.  At least write the same stuff in the same font size.

Anyway, beer selection was great and the waitress brought out the appetizer right away and it was very good.  We didn't have a huge appetite so ordered some burritos and sat back and enjoyed the beer and chips.  And sat back, and back, ordered another beer and waited.  Other tables who came after us were getting served.  We sat back and had more of our beer and waited.  Come on!!! How long does it take to make a burrito??  Apparently 50 minutes!  All the time we saw the wait staff and kitchen staff standing around and yakking.  

When we finally got our food, it was VERY good.  But it was not a VERY GOOD experience.
