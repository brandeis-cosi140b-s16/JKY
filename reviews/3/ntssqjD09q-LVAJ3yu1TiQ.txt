Tucked away inside Fabulous Freddy's, this Roberto's has some of the best customer service Roberto's has to offer. It doesn't hurt that you can play a little video poker while waiting for your chow. I was a little taken back by the "B" rating left by the Health Department. I guess that could pretty much be from anything, right? What am I complaining about, though. Back in school I would have given my left testicle for a "B". The food and the service is always good. So I will be back. B'a are fine. I just don't want to see any one legged A's.
