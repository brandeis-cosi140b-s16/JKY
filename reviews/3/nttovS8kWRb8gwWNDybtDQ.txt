OK- this is really your typical "hole in the wall" so if your looking for ambience this isn't the place- FYI the newer location up the road on Main just after Stapley is a little nicer and has better seating. BUT if you are looking for some place with cheap, decent food, open 24 hours, that's way better than a Filiberto's or a bunch of other "berto's" -stop in.  The tortillas are homemade and they will customize your order ie. combining the sauces for the camarones al diablo (shrimp devil-style/spicy) and the camarones al ajo (shrimp w/garlic). I also really like that everything comes with grilled onions that are the bomb! For a cheap lunch I'll order their street tacos ($1.25) and I'll get a cabeza taco and a carne asada taco and combine the two and add the grilled onions. The cabeza can be kind of fatty but I haven't found any place here where it isn't. More FYI- sometimes they forget about the grilled onions so you have to ask plus the Stapley n Main location has complimentary homemade Charro beans next to the salsa bar. I'm personally not a big bean eater, but I've tried them and they are pretty good depending on the day.
