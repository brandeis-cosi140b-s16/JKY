Los 7 Compadres has a variety (20) of combination platters for about 7 bucks.  Between my wife and I we had 7 items on our combination platters, which we shared.  7 has been a recurring number for us starting with the OYE at Malee's.  Including the rice and beans, the sour cream and the guacamole this gave us an astounding number of possible combinations for each bite.

Play this out again with the burrito, cheese enchilada, tamale, beef enchilada, bean enchilada, etcetera.  All of the food was good.  Portions were generally large.  I found the tamales to be the least satisfying item.  They were a bit dry and the dominant flavor was just the spice of jalapeno.

Note-even the mild here has a real bite.  Overall I'd give them 3.5 stars.  Good enough for a return trip.
