Fresh made tortillas!! I LOVE the sweet pork!!!! The salad is DELISH, with the house dressing.  My son loves the pork quesadillas, and my husband, the grilled tacos.  They come with rice and beans, which to me are just okay, usually a bit dry and not so flavorful.  The customer service is pretty inconsistant.  They try to be fast fast fast, and with too fast you tend to screw up! One time I asked for my son's quesadilla to be sliced, and the guy, in a demeaning tone, informed me that they had plastic knives on the counter, and after my death glare, he decided that he could slice it for me.
