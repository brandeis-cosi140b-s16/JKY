Meh.

This place is all the rage is NoDa, but it's never done anything for me. I guess it's just not my bag, baby. There are several other places in the area where I'd rather eat and hang out. You should definitely check it out for yourself, as again, most people LOVE it. I've just never had a meal I was crazy about, and the service doesn't stand out either.
