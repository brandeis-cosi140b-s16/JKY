We came to Cozymel's when some family was in town for the weekend. I was really in the mood for some good mexican food, so i was excited to go here simply because it had outdoor seating and looked festive (ha!). The food was pretty good - definitely not authentic mexican, but what I expected from a chain mexican restaurant. Our waiter was extremely enthusiastic and happy to be serving us, so I was decently impressed with the service. Although, we were attacked by some employee towards the end of our dinner, trying to sell us a souvenir picture of our table, which was annoying. But - there was something even weirder about this place. It was a very busy weekend in Vegas - it was a Saturday night - and the place was DEAD. I found this really weird, as we were at Bahama Breeze the week before, and waited for about a half hour even when we had a reservation. Therefore, I assumed this place would probably be the same situation. I was wrong! I usually wouldn't notice something like this, but considering there were only about 3 tables occupied including ours, it made me skeptical of the place...just a thought! However, I would recommend this place if you're just looking for a quiet, decent, quick meal.
