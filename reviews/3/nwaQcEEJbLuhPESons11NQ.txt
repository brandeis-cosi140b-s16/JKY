Take a look at El Penasco's logo.  The man and woman are not happy being together.  There's something about the disinterest in their eyes and their lack of passion that saddens my heart.  They were in love once and the love has faded.  In a way, that may be a metaphor for the food itself.

When this place first opened, it used to be a lot better.  I remember the food then was really awesome and it was nice to have a container filled with warm tortillas and salsa at your table.  Going back, relatively recently, the food just wasn't the same.  It's certainly not the worst that's around by any standards, but there's certainly a love of the craft of food that's long gone.
