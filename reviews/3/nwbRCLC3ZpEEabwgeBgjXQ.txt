Have been coming here on and off for years.  Border Shakers are among the best margarita's I have had (particularly for on the rocks margaritas), pricey but very good with fresh ingredients, like the lime juice.

I have found the food hit and miss here - some very good things like the tamales and cochinita pibil, and some very big misses like the tortilla soup and traditional flat layered enchiladas.

All in all a decent place, but inconsistent in terms of some good items, and others that miss the mark, and one never knows if what they order will be one or the other, unless you only stick to tried and true items.
