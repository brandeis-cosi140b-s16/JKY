OK...but why are people flocking in here like it's the best Mexican they have ever had?  Maybe it is for them, but I've surely had better.  
Ordered the fajitas.  That was an experience:  I don't think I've ever had meat cut into different sizes like that before when I ordered fajitas.
They were ok, tho.
The hard sour cream that sat in a clump (what happened to soft, creamy sour cream?), the watery guacamole, the sloppy cut fajita meat that needed more spicing and definitely needed a better grade of skirt steak all added up to a big, fat meh from me.
Meh.
