I want to like this place, I really do.  Although the first visit left me with mixed feelings I plan to return for another visit soon--real soon.

We went and were greeting by the delicious smell of grilling meats.  We ordered tacos, carne asada, chicken, and cabeza.  We also added a carne asada quesadilla.

We were given a number and sat down.  Our number was passed up and after a while we discovered someone else was served our meal!  Oops.  The mistake was quickly corrected and our food was served.  However, no cabteza tacos...  They were ordered but left off the ticket.  

The food was okay and excellent.  The chicken was dry and bland.  The carne asada was excellent and beyond.  That is why I'm going back despite the mistakes,  It is that good.

There is a small salsa back with a variety of salsas including avocado.  Plus a few surprises like sliced cucumbers and pickled red onions.

I am forgiving the miscsues for now.  It is a starting business with a few issue to correct.  I want to support local as much as possible.  I hope my next visit is better--I'm sure it will be.
