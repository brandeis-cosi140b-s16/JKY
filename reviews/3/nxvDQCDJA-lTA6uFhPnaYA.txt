I love Chipotle, but I've had one really bad experience here.
A few weeks ago, I found a 12 inch black hair twirled in my burrito... NASTY!! When I took my burrito back up to the counter and asked for a new one, the woman working rolled her eyes at me and hesitantly made me another one free of charge. 
Other than that one time, this place is usually decent. Sometimes you have to wait for the meat you want because they frequently run out. 
I prefer to go to the 92nd/Shea location to get my Chipotle fix. It's better.
