This is not really an Asian Fushion joint.  They have Chinese dishes and they have Mexican dishes.  Food is pretty good.  If you are used to big portions turn back around.  Small portions here and a bit pricey.  That is expected being that it is on the strip and inside of a major hotel.

In other words if you want a snack the food tastes pretty good.
