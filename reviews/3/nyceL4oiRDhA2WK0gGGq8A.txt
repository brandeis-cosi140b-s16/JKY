Maybe it was just us, but my friend and I came here expecting food that compared to The Normal diner's food (the sister restaurant) and were very disappointed. The tacos were drowned in sauce and the tortillas were soaked through with it as well. The chips and salsa came with two tiny cups of salsa, and to top it off the lemon and cilantro in the street rice was overpowering. Defintely more like bar food to have whilst drinking. I wouldn't recommend going for just the food.
