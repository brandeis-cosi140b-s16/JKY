I have visited Maverick Rock Taco for brunch, lunch, and dinner. I will start off by saying their food is awesome.  Very inventive tacos, good guac, and great margaritas.  So it's ashame when food is this good, that the service is so inconsistent.  
When this place isn't busy, the service is fine.  Saturday night for dinner was not good however. They were about 75% full and had a few larger parties in the room we were sitting in... we were seated and waited at least 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged.  A waitress took our drink order (turns out she wasn't even our waitress) and then it was at least another 10 minutes before our actual waitress visited.  She brought us waters and took our dinner order.  A very unpleasant individual then brought us chips and salsa and didn't even acknowledge us when we thanked him.
Our food came out in a timely manner so the kitchen was obviously well staffed and running well.  But still no margaritas... they arrived about 10 minutes into us eating our dinner... the waitress told us the bar was backed up... probably something to mention when taking drink orders, not delivering them 20-25 minutes after they were ordered.  We overheard other tables asking where their drinks were and one table asked how much longer it would be before they could get their check.  So it wasn't just us... 
I'm sure we'll go back since we like the food... but lunch time is probably better since they're not busy and can handle the lower volume of diners.
