Busy Busy Busy!  Seems like everytime I go there is a line out the door.  Our entrees were good as usual, and I don't mind the wait.

If  you don't like to wait in line to order your food, you might want to consider calling ahead to order and pick up your food.

The location is usually very clean, loud either from the music or people talking, but there's also an outdoor area you can eat at.

They have very good guacamole for a fast food place, and the tortilla chips have a lime-salt flavor that accompanies the guacamole really well.
