While this place is in a shopping center, it's a whole lot bigger than you'd expect, & the food is pretty good as well. While I do have the perception that Mexican food is really tough to screw up, Don Pedro's is above average in the taste department. I think the only negative is the price, when you can get just as good Mexican at some lesser known places for cheaper.

There's plenty of seating, so the lunch crowd usually moves through pretty quickly. The seating area is also pretty wide open so you can take quite a bit of people along with you. They also have a separate bar area as well as outdoor patio seating. 

They serve the typical mexican dishes & everything is pretty tasty but won't blow you away. They have free chips & salsa which is always a plus & two types of salsa as well. I like their pico salsa better than their runny stuff, but both are fine considering their price. 

Don Pedro's is good if you're with a large lunch group during work, the food will satisfy you, and you'll get in & out pretty quickly.
