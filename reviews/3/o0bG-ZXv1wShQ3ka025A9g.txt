first impression? the couch in the waiting area is filthy and there's no hostess to be found. 

we sat down and received chips and two salsa. we also received two cups and a pitcher of water and then the nice lady walked away. i guess we pour our own water? ok.  not gonna lie, it was kinda messy. we pretty much sucked at trying to pour water. haha

everything on the menu was around $15 which was a bit shocking considering the no greeting, the self serve water and the dirty couch in the lobby.  i guess the feeling i got from the place i was expecting it would be closer to $10 menu items? 

our waiter came out quickly and he was the only waiter on the floor. he did surprisingly well. i never felt like we were lacking when it came to needing something. 

my steak fajitas were super tasty-  they let the veggies get crispy and there's nothing worse than soggy veggies. the tortillas were amazing. and overall i was happy with my dinner. it was huge so that $15 plate did stretch for a few meals and it really was worth it because the quality is there for sure (i'm leaving out my complaint about the brownish quac and pale pico de gallo bc i didn't eat them and the fajitas were great on their own)

it was definitely a good choice for dinner. it was a decent family owned restaurant.

i just wish the rest of the experience was relevant to the price of the food. the food is worth the price but the rest was a bit off for me. 

in the end- after tip it ended up being about $20 per person. i would probably go again if i was in the area and needing some good mexican food. other than that, probably not. it was a-ok and if they upped the rest of the experience i would most definitely be a fan!
