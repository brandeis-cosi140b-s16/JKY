Overall, it's a pretty decent place if you're really hungry for Mexican food. The prices are surprisingly low considering the amount of food you get per order. The cashiers are friendly and professional. But the condiment  area is almost always lacking in fresh items. 

This place is good if you want want good Mexican food and lots of it for a low price. But don't expect this location to have fresh condiments available.
