My daughter and I went in there on a Sunday night.  We were driving by and I have always wanted to try Serranos.  The restaurant was pretty full, but we got seated within 5 minutes.  Service was very good and friendly, place was clean and inviting.  Food was pretty much gringo Mexican food, a 3 star restaurant definitely.    I had a red burrito and my daughter had a enchilada and a taco. It was ok, nothing spectacular.  They are all over the valley so gringos must like this place.  I wouldn't go back unless I was invited by someone, I definitely prefer more authentic mexican food.
