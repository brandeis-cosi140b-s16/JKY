For the area, the food is good-- not the best Mexican/Latin food that I have had, but definitely better than the standard El Toro/ Mas Amigos food. It is more Latin-American fusion than anything. Great tequila list. 

In terms of mixed drinks, wish they had more margarita options like prickly pear, grapefruit, or tamarindo. But I will say that their standard lime margarita, which I judge all tequila bars/ Mexican restaurants against, was pretty good. Just too bad they use orange juice in the mix. 

All in all I would go back again.
