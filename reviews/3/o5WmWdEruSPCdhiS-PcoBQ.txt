We recently moved to the area and this is the closest restaurant from our new house. We drive by almost everyday and every time we saw this restaurant in the evening, it's packed with lots of people, no matter it's a weekday or weekend. We assumed this is a good place to eat so decided to give a try.

Well....I know we had a kind of high expectation about this restaurant but still, I only can give them 3 stars top. 

Their service is good enough. I think their food is just average and over priced. The pork was dry and  way too salty and not tender at all. I felt a bit odd to have french fries with tacos and again, they were so salty. The shrimp tacos tasted okay but too much liquid inside, which I guess is water from shrimps, not from sauce. 

If I ate lots of fast food Mexican food for a while, I would appreciate their food. I think they make effort to make their food "look" good or "sound" good but it's missing the x-factor to me and it's just average. There are other Mexican restaurants with better and/or more reasonably priced food. 

Conclusion, I do not recommend this place and we would not go there again although this is the closest restaurant from our house. I don't say this restaurant is bad but it's not good either, just as 3 stars explain, "A-OK".
