Not in our typical neck of the woods, but we decided to go out to eat on our way to a show, and this is one of the places that came up as a possible option.

The location was a bit of a challenge to find, since you have to get into the parking lot, then double back a bit, but it is not all that bad.  Once inside, the staff is friendly and quick to fill the chips and drinks.

Menu items are fairly typical for your Mexican restaurant, and the plates are well-filled.  Food is similar to many of the other restaurants of this caliber around town - not your authentic variety, but it will certainly do in a pinch.
