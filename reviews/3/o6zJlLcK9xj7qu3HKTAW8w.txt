Aliberto's. As I was reading the review before me, I recalled the many who came to me and told me the exact same thing. That there used to be two other taco shop franchise that came before Aliberto's. So I wondered if the merely renamed the place? Or they simply switched franchise. But I thought i'd give it a try.

I got myself a Arizona burrito to go. And I will honestly say, I did not quite enjoy it.

It was A-OK. Considering, it did make my stomach satisfyingly full. However, the burrito itself felt really dry. The burrito wrap, didn't feel like it was even grilled because it was still starchy. I know the reason behind it, but I don't think that clumps of powder is justifiable. I kind of had to wipe it off, before I continued to eat it.

The meat was good, and had some flavor, but it got ruined because of the potatoes. You can taste more of the potato skins than the actual potatoes. And the burrito barely had any traces of cheese.

I would maybe suggest, that they use french fries instead. It might give their burrito some crisp.

I can go on and on about how this burrito didn't make me happy, but that would be unfair. Because in a sense it did fulfill my needs, and that was to make me full.

All in all, it is still too early to give my final marks on the establishment, so I will continue to update my opinion as I come more often and try other things.

So far, this place is a great value for your dollars. The food will get you full, for not a whole lot of money.

So good luck to you Aliberto's. And congratulations on your opening.
