Rio Rico's is our every Monday hangout for softball.  I grew up in Tucson, and definitely know what good Mexican food is.  Rio Rico is not the best that I have ever had, but it is definitely good!  
It is always nice to see the people that run the restaurant taking personal interest in how their food is.   I say give it a shot, Maria is always willing to bring you a cold one!
