Had a quick dinner the other night with my Son.  We had Big Fat Chicken Tacos ($2.29), Veggie Works Burrito ($2.49), Carne Asada Taco ($1.79), Pollo Asada Taco ($1.79), and a Classic Taco ($.99).  The food was fresh and tasted good....although I'd skip their Carne Asada and Pollo Asada Tacos....it's their attempt to be like a real taco shop....and it's not even close.

It's a typical Del Taco, not much else to say about it.

Will I return?  I probably will.
