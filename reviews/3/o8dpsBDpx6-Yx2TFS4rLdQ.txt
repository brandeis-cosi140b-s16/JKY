Decent Mexican food in San Tan Valley...I've had both the carnitas plate and the carnitas torta and both were pretty good.  They have a salsa bar, which is nice and means that whatever your taste, they probably will have a salsa that you will enjoy.  The service has always been good as well.  The only downside is that the building is a bit run down and happy hour in the bar can get a bit rowdy.  However, if you're looking for decent Mexican food, live in the area, and don't want to drive too far, Don Pedro's is a pretty good option.
