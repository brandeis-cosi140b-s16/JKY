There are huge portions for a good price here, and I thought the salsa and pickled Jalape√±o bar were both spot on. The tostada was good as were the beans. My issue here was that the food should have been hotter (temperature). The cheese was put on but never put in a broiler or something to melt, leaving me with a lot of unmelted cheddar in and on top of the enchilada. Given the options in this town, it's a solid place to go, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here.
