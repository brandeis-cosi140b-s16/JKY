The food here is good, they have a large menu with a lot to choose from. I was only here once on a Friday night as part of a larger party. We had to wait a long time to be seated despite having a reservation in advance. The parking situation isn't the best if you come at prime dinnertime. You'll end up having to park across the street (there are No Parking signs on the same side as Lindo that no one seemed to observe). Really nice view of town though!
