Soooo, my son, my sister, my cousin and his girl, and I went to this restaurant because the Circus Buffet was overcrowded (the line was out into the casino. The food here was decent. We could not agree on what to order. So, we all ended up with nachos. My son had chips with grounded beef and nachos. My little sister had nachos loaded with all tops such as cheese, salsa, ground beef, sour cream, and much more EXCEPT guacamole. My cousin had nachos fully loaded. His girl had the mexi pizza which was basically nachos on top of some pizza dough. And I had the Italian nachos that was nachos, jalpenos, and all the basics to making a nacho. The food was good, yet the atmosphere was perfect. It wasn't crowded and no one screaming or crying. The waitress was awesome. Big thanks to all of our family for their support for Lil Man's grad day. Afterwards, we walked around in the Adventure Dome and then went on the rides.
