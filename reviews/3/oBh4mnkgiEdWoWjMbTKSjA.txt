I like Z'Tejas and I frequent the location in Scottsdale Fashion Square a lot.  This location just opened by my house and have been five or six times.  

The food has always been the same great food I'm used to at the Scottsdale location.

The service has been great on the bar side so far.  Last night, the dinning room service was sub-par.  I'm pretty sure our server was trained and just thrown out to wolves!  The management needs to do a better job of training their team before giving them a table of seven on a busy Friday!

Hope the service improves!
