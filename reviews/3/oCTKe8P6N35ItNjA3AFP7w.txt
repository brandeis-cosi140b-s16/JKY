Came here on a Friday night. It was packed. I would say make reservations, which my group did, but that didn't help us any because we were still seated about 45 mins after our reservation time.

The chips, salsa and guacamole were all really good. Chips were perfectly cooked and warm when served. Seasoned nicely. I got the fish tacos which were delicious. Everyone else seemed to like what they got too:  steamed buns, chicken tacos, noodles.
