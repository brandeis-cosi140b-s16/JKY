It is truly sick that my boyfriend knows where all the Macayo's are located in the valley and has visited all but one. 

Before I started dating him, I had visited the Depot Cantina in 1997 (yes I remember the year, it was a traumatic event) and HATED the food. I ordered tacos (how can you go wrong, oh you can) and they tasted horrible. I vowed to never visit Macayo's again. I had stayed true to my promise for a good 10 years before my boyfriend informed me that this was one of his favorite restaurants (I think he was testing our relationship) and invited me to dinner here. Well I came back and it wasn't as bad as I remembered it. I pretty much always order the shredded beef Baja Chimi, the sauce give it just a small kick. I can't take much. Sometimes I'll get the mini chimi appetizer plate and that's good too. I can't remember if it comes with 6 or 8 chimis. With their Chimi Fiesta going on I get the mini chimi sampler which comes with 6 chimis . There are 2 of three different kinds: chicken, beef, and pork each with it's own sauce on top. And it's only $6! The margaritas here are also pretty good. My favorite it the frozen strawberry. It hits the spot on a warm (ok scorching hot) AZ day. 

I've never sat in the restaurant area in this location. The bar has plenty of booths and the servers know us now and are always on top of our order. 

I do like patio at the Dobson and Baseline location better because it's "lakeview" dining. :p But the service at the Ahwatukee location can't be beat.
