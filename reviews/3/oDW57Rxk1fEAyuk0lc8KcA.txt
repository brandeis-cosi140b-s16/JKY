Serrano's is an average Mexican place.  Very Americanized.  But the food is fine.  The chips are fine, the salsa is fine.  I had the chimi, and it was fine also.  Nothing special, but not bad.

They're comparable to Garcia's and few other such places.  They can't touch La Tolteca, though.  But if La Tolteca is too far, and you're near this place, it's fine.
