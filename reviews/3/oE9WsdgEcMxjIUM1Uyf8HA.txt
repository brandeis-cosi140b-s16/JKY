Went here recently with a family member who was back in town and used to go to BBG all the time.  I've been here plenty of times over the years, and I do have to say that it is sad to see the contraction that they have experienced...I remember when they had at least five locations in the Valley.   Based on their restaurant list, it does seem if they have found a niche in food court/airport type settings, so maybe that will work out better for them.

I got the chicken tacos in corn tortillas.  They were OK, nothing interesting, nothing bad about them.  Should have stuck with the usual, black bean and cheese burrito with steak or chicken...I'll know for next time.  A strong benefit of BBG is the unlimited free chips they have out, usually nice and fresh.
