The Skinny: some pretty great entrees, some not so good... skip the bread pudding (3) service: slow service - took a while to place our orders(1.5), value: remains to be seen (2).

After the great experience the last time, we brought all our friends to feel the love that is Mundo. But the love just wasn't there tonight.

It took a while for us to order our dishes and to hear even what the specials were tonight. It basically took at least 15 minutes to wait for our waiter to come around and take our order.

I got the roasted chicken dish with tamales which was excellent - great flavours. Paired with the sweet tamales, and I was in heaven. My husband ordered the filet which was only alright. The side of mushroom didn't appear to be "wild" at all - yup! $8 for a small side of plain old button mushrooms. Would definitely not recommend this side.

Another member of the table ordered the tortilla soup and taquitos which she said were both good.

Unfortunately, the carnitas was a rather poor compared to the other dishes on the table. Like a previous reviewer noted - some appeared dry. 

We did order the bread pudding which was fair at best. Nothing special. Would probably not order again.

Service, as I mentioned, was slow tonight and the timing of the dishes were poor.

Overall, a significantly less pleasant experience than the last time. I'm downgrading this place to a 3 instead of a 4.
