Very interesting concept!  You would never think Chinese and Mexican food don't go well together, but man... wait till you try sweet and sour chicken burrito... or  pork fried rice with re-fried beans.... it's legit!   The pork fried rice is also very addictive,  the food is actually not too oily... I was very afraid my food would tastes super oily and contains a ton of MSG.  

This is a very unique experience, don't expect authentic Mexican or Chinese food... but definitely worth a try!  The pork jerk fried rice is my favorite!  it has a kick!
