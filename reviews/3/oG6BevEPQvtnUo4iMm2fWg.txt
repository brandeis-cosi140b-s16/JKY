bf and i ate here when we had a couple hours to kill before we headed home... i got a taco salad w/shredded beef and my bf got the machaca burrito both items came with chips and salsa... this was by no means what id really consider good Mexican food.. same caliber as baja fresh/ Chipotle. but the food wasn't bad at all. our total w/ two sodas tax and tip came out to around 30bucks. friendly waitress was quick and always refilled our drinks and even brought us drinks in to-go cups @ the end so we wouldn't have to go out n pay for another drink.

i dunno if they have full bar but they do have margaritas :)

i'd come back if  i ever had a long layover or time to kill before a flight...
