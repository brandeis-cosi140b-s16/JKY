I think someone else said, "Solid, cheap Mexican food..." and I can go with that too. Mind, that's a compliment in Madison, where bad or indifferent Mexican that's toned down for the locals abounds. 

I'd go back to el Pastor for one main reason: the rice and beans were good. If you can get this right with me, you will do ok. El Pastor delivers with rice that is lightly seasoned and dry on the plate and beans that have a little texture rather tahn a pasty mess. Good job guys.

I had the "Taste of Mexico" combination with a chile relleno, a pork taco, and a tamale (chicken, though they don't specify on the menu). The chile relleno was good and cooked nicely, but was not topped with ranchero salsa. This was unusual but still good, and allowed me to use that salsa they provide for your tortilla chips and that proved a better combination. The tamale was fat and heavy with meat which was a high point. However, the taco was a little boring and I was unimpressed -- too much fat and not enough spice.

They have Pacifico both in bottles and on tap, which is a nice bonus. The menu is priced fairly and service was good; I just wish the food had a little more oomph...I'll go back and try some other items, such as the enchiladas mole. Until then, el Pastor is a fine stop if you're hungry but I wouldn't make it a destination.
