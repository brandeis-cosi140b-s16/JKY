Went in for Happy Hour and some 99 cent margaritas.  They weren't great, but hey...they were 99 cents! 

The girls at the hostess stand greeted us with smiles on their faces and seated us in the bar as we requested.  Once seated, service was prompt and everyone was very friendly.  Our server came to check on us several times to see how we were doing.

Within seconds of sitting down, we had our chips, salsa and a bowl of a chorizo and bean dip at our table.  Our margaritas were brought to our table by another server because ours was helping another table.  She was also very friendly and asked if we needed anything.  

We shared a Hatch green chile burger and it was very tasty.  

I have read in previous reviews how service has been horrible at this location.  I am thinking they may have read these reviews and made some changes, because we experienced quite the opposite today.  

I am a firm believer in giving places a second chance and I'm glad I gave this place theirs.  The food may not be what it is like back home in New Mexico, but for Happy Hour...I'll be back!
