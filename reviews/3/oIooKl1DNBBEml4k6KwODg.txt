Sol Mexican Cocina just opened this week, so I'll take that into Consideration. Beautiful place, but give this place time to get there Act together. Checked in with the Hostess and was told 55 Minute Wait. Ok, found 2 Seats at the Bar and that was a very Positive Experience. Stacey our Bartender. was Terrific, she did everything perfect & the Drinks were Great. We ordered Guacamole and it was the Best I Have ever had in a Restaurant. Was followed by a Carne Burritto which came Cold & Was Comped.After sitting at the Bar for over an Hour we were never Told a Table was ready. The Hostesses are very Weak and need Much More training. My Suggestion is hire Older More Skilled, Expereinced Girls. who Know how to Manage the Crowd.The Place was Extremely Busy and Should do well and will Definitely give it another Try.
