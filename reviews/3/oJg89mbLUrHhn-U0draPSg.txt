It's hard for me to differentiate Chipotle from Salsarita's a lot of times. They are tasty, yes. Being all organic, PETA approved, etc etc is not the biggest concern for me, but that's nice, too. I just have a hard time with this Southwestern cuisine - I'd rather have Mexican, and Chipotle doesn't seem to change my mind.

I do like the food, though. And the staff here is super friendly. It can be a little loud for me, especially with the music up. And their corner of the parking lot is not my favorite navigational experience.

I think my review has circled itself without making a real point. But that's my point exactly - I'm not a fan, but I don't dislike them either.
