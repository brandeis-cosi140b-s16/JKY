This place was really busy when I was at the airport.  I needed a quick bite to eat before flying home and their menu had a good variety of items especially because I was on a diet.

I ordered a shrimp burrito with veggies, it was actually pretty good.  Ingredients were freshly cooked, which took a bit longer than I expected but it was worth the wait.

Prices are reasonable for the airport.  Service was okay.  It did take them 20 minutes however to get customers napkins!
