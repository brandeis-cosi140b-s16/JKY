Cool spot.  Was craving something after a day of shopping and I saw that this was close by.  I wish I was still a pescatarian because they have so many dishes with fish or seafood!  I ordered the Grilled Gourmet Portobello & Poblano (no bacon) Tacos with Rice & Beans to go.  I loved that the tacos had lots of pieces of avocado in them (Caribbean girl alert!)  The food had a nice flavor, but I asked the girl to substitute flour tortillas instead of corn and she forgot.  Rice was also a bit mushy.  I'll try the chips next time.  Portions are small for the price.
