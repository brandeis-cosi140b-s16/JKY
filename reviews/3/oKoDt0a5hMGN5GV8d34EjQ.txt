So, i went today for the lunch buffet and unfortunately, i've got to take away a star. The beef just wasn't good today. Tasted almost uncooked, but still in a grease tub. Also the rice was pretty blah too. The rest of the stuff was good enough for a cheap Mexican buffet (beans, cheese, lettuce, shells). 
Overall, i still think it's worth 6 bucks.  
 

The service was top notch, even for a buffet, the server was like a mind reader. Constantly topping my drink off when low. i thought to myself, i need a napkin and sure as shit, there he was with napkins...before i asked.
