Scenario:  Leaving the Venetian to go home after our booze-filled rampage, the driver wants chilaquiles.  I go to trusty yelp mobile, and decide on Blueberry Hill.  Halfway there after heavy traffic on the strip, it is said that that place stinks.  OK, Plan B.  We make it 2 blocks on Plan B until we decide to stop at La Cantina and cross our fingers that it has chilaquiles.  

The casino smelt like our weekend, but once we hit the restaurant, it smelt wonderful.  They ended up having chilaquiles, and once seated we received 2 different salsas and a bean dip for each side of the table.  Granted we only had a party of 4, so there was no reaching over the table.  The beans were like a bean dip, it was intoxicating and warm.  We  each got the chilaquiles, mine with the green sauce.  The plates arrived after the salsa got old, and it was pretty darn good.  The chips were chewy like I remembered, and it put me in an immediate food coma.  

The food was really cheap, but service could have been bumped up a notch.  We never got the sopes we ordered to start with, but it was probably a good thing, as our breakfasts were larger than we imagined.  I would definitely come again, perfect hangover food!
