I was looking forward to eating here and it was A-okay. It was good but not blown away by it...maybe because I'm spoiled by really fresh, seasonal Mexican food in my neighborhood.

- Easy reservations.
- Wait staff was a bit flaky. Had to remind wait staff of orders. 
- Food was well seasoned and tasty
- I liked it but is it worth the price? Eh, for the price I would go elsewhere.
