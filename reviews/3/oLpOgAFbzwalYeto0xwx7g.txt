Good space here.  Love the fact that the outdoor patio had little heat lamps...ya know, for the frigid 50s that Phoenix hits on winter nights (sense of midwestern, we just got another frickin' foot of snow last night. sarcasm here!!).  Great patio lounging area, and the inside (where we chose to dine) is wide-open and airy.

I think I ate three whole avocados here the night I had dinner.  First, the guacamole, which was delish (and the chips were stellar enough for me to break my carb-free diet for a few!)  Then my ceviche (shrimp and crab), which was more of a slaw than a ceviche, but very good nonetheless...avocado in there.  Then my salad with goat cheese, pistachios, and yes, more avocado.  (Told ya, I ate three avocados!)

Service was friendly.  I dig the striped shirts they ahd going on there, however, as my ever-so-smart pal pointed out, "They would never last in Chicago" (ya know, the whole we hate striped shirts, and "we're annoyed by former frat boys named Chad" deal we have going on here.)

Not bad...perhaps I should've tried a margarita!  Oh, and basked in the glow of the heat lamp in a comfy chair on the patio.  Perhaps another day.
