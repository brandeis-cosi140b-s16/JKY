My husband I were starving and needed to eat asap so we pulled into El Torito since it looked as if it was going to be the only place in Scottsdale on a Friday where we didn't need reservations.   Its more traditional than what you find in Boston but certainly not "authentic" nor amazing - more "generic".  It was good for sure, but good like Chilis or TGIFridays is good - good for a decent, consistent, casual meal.
