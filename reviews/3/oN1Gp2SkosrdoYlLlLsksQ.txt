I like the complex this restaurant is located in which makes for good outdoor patio seating, weather permitting. I cant review the entrees as I went for a happy hour in a large group so tried only a couple of finger foods. The guac was good and salsa flavorful. However, no way was the spice level  anywhere close to what the restaurant name suggests, a relief for the faint of heart , might be disappointing for those looking for the kick.
