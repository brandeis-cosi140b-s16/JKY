I tried this place out for the very first time on the friday of memorial day weekend. For having to be in front of the treasure island casino and on a holiday weekend it was relatively empty during prime time vegas hours. 

I believe the reason for this was because they were charging $10 at the door. The music was mediocre and the bar tending service was okay. Drinks were served ok but they just lack a certain element to be considered somewhere fun to go in las Vegas. After I found out that there was no restroom and drinks were expensive I was glad to have been there only for a relatively short time. Try going somewhere is my suggestion to you.
