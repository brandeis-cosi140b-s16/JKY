I typically visit the Shadyside location, but when I'm in Oakland and need a cheap meal, I'll go to this location. It's Chipotle, so the food is pretty much all the same, but this location is way more hectic than any other. It's almost always very loud and crowded, and it's not as clean as the one I frequent the most. 

The staff is typically pretty tired, too. I understand why they are, so I'm not criticizing that aspect. I just feel like they are probably overworked and underpaid. Not surprising, though.

In short, this spot serves its purpose, but if you want a quieter experience, go somewhere else.
