This was my first time in this restaurant. The decor is a bit odd inside and has some sort of neon glow. We stood in line and waited our turn to order. It's very similar to moes/chipotle. My fiancée and I both got the Tijuana burrito mine with steak and his with chicken. There is a decent little sauce bar with all sorts of hot sauces ranging from mild to insanely hot. I enjoyed that part! I didn't see any salsa and am not sure if that is included but we ordered a little side of queso. Halfway through the meal fiancée realized he was missing chicken in his burrito. When we alerted the manager she quickly corrected it and mad a new burrito. Overall this is decent but not really comparable to chipotle in my opinion. The food is pretty good though if your on this side of town.
