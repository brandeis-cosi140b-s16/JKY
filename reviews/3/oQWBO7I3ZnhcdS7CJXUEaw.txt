There are only two places I go for fast food... here is one of them. For around $8 bucks you can get a fish taco and enchilada that are really good and complimented by your choice of beans(blk or cajun) and rice(white or brown) and a tiny salad.Get a side of Mr. Lee's hot sauce for a $1 and heat it all up! Tried the wet baja lada tacos and they were a little to wet for my liking. Stick with the fish and it hits the spot at a very decent price.
