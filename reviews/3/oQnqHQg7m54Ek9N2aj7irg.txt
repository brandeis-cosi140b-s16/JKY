This location gets three stars and the original location on Central Ave. gets five stars.

This place just seemed like a normal "mom and pop" Mexican restaurant.  Salsas were not what I remember them to be.  Food was fine, the red chili pork was not the best i had ever had. The flautas were just  "eh".  

Just a regular ol'mexican restaurant in my book.  I go back to the Central location next time and not this one.
