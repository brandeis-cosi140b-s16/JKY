The food is good but don't come when they open.

On two occasions I came to pick up breakfast burritos for the office.  They open at 6:00 A.M. But when I arrived at 6:20 to pickup food, the cook/counter person told he didn't have any food ready and motioned to the grill (I inferred the grill was heating up).  

The sign should read the staff arrives at 6:00 A.M. And food will be ready when it's ready.
