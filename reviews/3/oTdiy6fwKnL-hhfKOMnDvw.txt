During a random Sunday morning drive from their new house, my dad and I were hungry for breakfast- lacking many options, we found old Puebla, which judging from all the cars was either the best food ever...or the only joint in town. Turns out- it's just about both! 

The menu was as expected, complete with tex/Mex breakfast favourites like chicken fried steak, dumplings and huevos rancheros. My tamales and eggs were tasty, clearly homemade by someone's grandmother! But not amazing. A typical greasy spoon, but strong coffee and extremely friendly service makes this place a solid choice for breakfast...especially given the lack of options in the area!
