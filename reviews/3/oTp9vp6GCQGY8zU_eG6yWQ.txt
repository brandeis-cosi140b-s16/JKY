Generally I'd give Cafe Rio solid two stars, decent enough for what it is.  For the most part I feel that their tacos and burritos are kind of on the bland side, but a friend introduced me to the tuesday special of coconut shrimp, and hot damn, I'm a fan!  The shrimp are big and golden fried and it comes with a fantastic mango chutney, lots of cilantro, and lots of flavor!  The coconut shrimp bump the rating up a full point, but if not for the special, I'd skamper on over to Yayo Taco for a little more flavor.
