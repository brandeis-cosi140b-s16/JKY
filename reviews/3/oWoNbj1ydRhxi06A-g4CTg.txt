I really, really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, when I got there at about 4pm, the empanadas had been picked over and there were few left to choose from. We only liked the sweet empanadas, none of the savory ones. The gentleman behind the counter was nice, but flustered and clueless on how to run my debit card thru the reader on the iPad to pay. Due to not so great food and uninviting, tiny space, I'll probably not be going back.
