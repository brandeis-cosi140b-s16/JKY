Read the reviews, as well as verbal recommendations, we decided to try it.

Very small location, specials listed on the board as you walk in.

We were very surprised at how small the menu itself was. Very limited. Chips and salsa were very good.

My husband ordered off the special list, he had the tortilla soup with quesadilla wedges. The soup was very good, but very different than any other he has had. It was creamy rather than a broth. The bowl was very small, and the quesadilla he received was 2 small slices. I ordered 3 cheese enchiladas, with beans. You have to choose between rice and beans. The enchiladas were very good and the red sauce was excellent.

Service was very good.

Prices were a bit high for what you got, but the food was pretty tasty.
