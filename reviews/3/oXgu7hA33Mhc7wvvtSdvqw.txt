The house salad was very good actually. I liked the mix of greens and the dressing, the whole thing tasted fresh. I had a carnitas burrito which was good, bismati rice and sweet potato in side was a good flavor. I didn't really like the green salsa, it was more sweet than savory. I'd defiantly order this again but try a different salsa next time.
