I'm spoiled by the Cardenas franchise in the Coachella Valley so this is just an okay Mexican market. A lot of the fruit was cheap but overly ripe (avocados, kiwi, etc). The corn tortillas are cheap, a fresh packet of 70 is only 2.99. Also got good deals on herbs (cilantro & parsley). I would not buy meat here. The couple in front of me bought ground beef & the plastic had come off of the top on the conveyor built. Neither they nor the cashier seemed pertubed by that!
