I've tried Cabo's bar area a couple times while waiting for my friends to arrive for a movie or dinner at another restaurant, so I'm not really familiar with their full menu.  Their margaritas are rather potent, and they're kind enough to Chip & Dip you if you're just sitting at the bar.  I can't imagine what their 45 oz. margarita would do to a person, but they have the option to destroy yourself with it there.  

I was treated to a smash-up of their drink menu the other day in smaller form, and their strawberry mojito is the best thing I've had from Cabo!  Next time I'll have to order that to cool off from the 108* we're all roasting at.
