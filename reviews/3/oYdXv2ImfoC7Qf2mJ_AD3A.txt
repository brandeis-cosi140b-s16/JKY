Chuy's was pretty good.  Seems like all of their locations are pretty similar.  I think they'd be best known for their cheap margaritas... $2 pints, $4 small pitchers.  They aren't too strong and come from a mediocre mix, but if you're looking for something sweet and cheap its a good bet.

Free serve-yourself chips and salsa are pretty good.  

As for food... pretty decent prices and okay to good food.  I wouldn't say its authentic Mexican, actually I think the menu is a bit confused.  But the food is good overall.  It's a place we'll go to every month or so.
