Weird combo of Mexican and Chinese menu. Place is in the Cosmo, prices are decent. I had a Chicken Milanesa Torta (just so-so) and a Al Pastor Taco, which was good but not at all like a normal al pastor taco- was more like a piece of bacon with pineapple on top of it. Service was good. Overall, not bad but not a must-visit either.
