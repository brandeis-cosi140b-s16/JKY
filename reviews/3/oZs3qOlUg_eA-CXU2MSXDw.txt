i really do love salty, especially when its nice out, but damn i would not touch this location with a ten foot pole on the weekends. motocross bro-tards and affliction wearing thirty five year olds is not my idea of fun, not too mention waiting forever for drinks and being crammed into a high scool reuinion for all of the west valleys finest. 

after a spring training game or on a weeknight this place is great. the food actually is really good and tijuanna tuesday ($1 tacos and $5 buckets of beer) is worth it for sure. volleyball, horseshoes and bags make it and essential day drinking spot when the weather permits.

ya the monastery was really cool, salty is just trying for a younger vibe. so as long as you avoid the god awful weekend nights then you are golden.
