Before a trip to the mall on Saturday we decided to grab a quick lunch here.  I have only ever been to the Providence Rd location and its usually pretty good.  It was slow here but we still waited a bit for a server to come by and we were so thirsty, I hate that.  Once we finally get drinks I noticed my Diet Coke tastes grossly similar to root beer, bleh!!  Have to wait a while again to find out server so I can get a replacement.

For food you get the unlimited chips and salsa.  Chips were good, salsa was a little spicier than I like.  For lunch I had the little borderito w/steak off the lunch menu, it also came w/a salad.  It was okay I needed lettuce and tomato in it or something, it was just a lot of steak and rice.  The side salad was not good, straight from a bag and I kept picking out brown pieces.

Honestly I usually enjoy On the Border, perhaps I need to stick w/fajitas.  Oh they did advertise a blood orange margarita which looked delish, so that is something to go back for!
