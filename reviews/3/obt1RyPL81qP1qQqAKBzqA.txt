Fantastic greasy and authentic Mexican food. 

Perfect hangover food. I tend to favor bringing it home after a night is drinking to "settle the demons" 

That being said... Their food does not translate well to sober eating. 

My husband and I stopped by one afternoon recalling its awesomeness after a night of drinking and were less than impressed.

The store was pretty dirty and I can only imagine what the kitchen looked like.
