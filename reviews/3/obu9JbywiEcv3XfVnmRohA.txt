Don't let the mexican music and decor fool you. Place has no passion in its food.  Waitress was nice just doing her job. But food and presentation sub-par.

Food I ordered:

Salsa and chips: salsa was good but chips were a little stale. Use to getting warm fresh chips.

Shrimp Ceviche: Wow. Nothing close to what i grew up eating. I know people make it differently. I'm use to eating it with like a tomato juice and have a sweet tangy taste to it. This was more like a pico de gallo with shrimp, and avocados didn't look to fresh. Overall alright just because I like pico de gallo. But I did not order pico de gallo it was to be ceviche.

Torta with carne asada: Tried ordering the milanese meat(breaded steak). They did not have it and it was on the menu. How do you not have milanese at mex restaurant and it looked really slow that night. So I ordered it with carne asada. It was good just not up there on the top list of best tortas I've ever had. Lol. Not alot of savor(flavor) or passion. I will try other hispanic joints. Gracias.
