Have gone here 2x. First time was during the week at 2:00. Taken right to a table. Love the salsa. Just right amount of flavor. Also really liked my chicken enchiladas. Red sauce is yummy. But on 2nd visit at 1:00 on a Sunday, had a 2 minute wait which they said would be 10 minutes, and the restaurant wasn't even half full. Maybe short handed? We could tell a couple waitresses were rushed and not very happy. Took a bit to get our chips and salsa even. Food finally came, didn't like the fajita burrito as much as my first meal. Same good red sauce, but had dark meat chicken and I only like white meat. A couple at a table by us got up and left because they were tired of waiting. Not sure if I will return myself. Seems like it might be hit and miss with this place.
