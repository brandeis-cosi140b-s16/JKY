it could be that I was extra hungry but I thought the food here was okay.  the price of the meals is a little high so split between 2 people and after chips and salsa, it should be plenty.  it's not my favorite mexican (far from it) but it's a cute place with a kick back atmosphere (the bar area).  they should have a happy hour to lower some prices on beers and appetizers.  oh and pass on the guacamole dip (not good).
