El burro is OK. Feel like they skimp on meat in burritos, give me too much rice, and dont even include sour cream or cheese. The fried "taquito" esque creations are OK as well. Prefer the strip or taco truck. This place seemed so great at first, but it lacks in flavor and bang for my buck. Taco truck might be pricey but at least their tacos have flavor, for example. And i pay about $10 for a burrito here when I could get a better tasting one with more meat at Chipotle. Sorry dudes. Im sad to say it too. Maybe you can switch up your flavor game and save the burro.
