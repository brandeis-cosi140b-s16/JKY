I echo much of  what has been said. The shredded beef burro was very tasty and the beans and rice were just right. My preference would be for more spice - I liked the hot sauce well enough. Four of us ate lunch for under $30 including a couple of sides. They were out of the lemonade, but the iced tea was a good second choice.
