Okay, so I lived in Vegas for a total of 5 years. Coming from San Diego (where I now live again), Roberto's is a staple taco shop. A great place to get your 24 hour Mexican food munchie on! But I also know that there's alot of "imitators" out there with taco shops. I just called whose "-bertos" because it's usually just some other prefix with the "berto" name attached (Alberto's, Filberto's, Juanberto's). Anyway, when I saw a "Roberto's" down the block from where I lived, I figured it to be just a knock off of the ones in San Diego. 

I pull up to the drive-through to be greeted by the same broken English that I get at other places, "Mah, I help tu?" I play it safe and order a bean and cheese burrito. My order is repeated and confirmed. When I pull up to the window, sure enough there's a customer service sign with none other than Jose Roberto's phone number and address. Complete with 619 area code and Chula Vista zip code. I was stoked that this was an actual Roberto's!

The food I got resembled what I got in San Diego. It's as authentic as your going to get for a taco shop in Vegas. My only disappointment is that I didn't realize how many there were in Vegas. Man, have I been missing out!!! 

The food was great and I ate there many times during my stay in Vegas. It was a nice little reminder of San Diego and good food when your drunk and need something to fill your stomach.

Could have gave this place a Four Star. But let's face it, it's a taco shop. You know what you're going into when you get there.
