Food was pretty good. I been to se√±or taco a several times. I had the fish tacos and shrimp quesadilla (my favorite) and some rolled tacos. The only thing I didn't like about this place is that there is a looooong wait. If you don't mind waiting then there's nothing wrong. 
Great food....long wait.
