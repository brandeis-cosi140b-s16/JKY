Patron is pretty decent. Their service can be a little slow at times but not too bad. The only issue I had at Patron was when one time me and my friend went to one of their $1 taco nights on Mondays and they said that there would be a 45 minute wait to get a table even though the restaurant was half-empty. Other than that, every time I have gone has been lovely. The staff is super friendly and helpful. I especially like their $1 tacos and $3 margaritas on Mondays!
