I didn't really see anything extra special here, but it was a decent meal. I went with a simple lunch of a couple tacos and rice.

First, the salsa with the chips was pretty decent, I don't know if there's anything unique about it, but it was tasty. The rice was exactly what you'd expect.

I got one carne asada and one carnitas taco, and both meats were reasonably good. There was a little gristle, but the tacos were otherwise fine.

I'm sure I'll be back, but there are plenty of places in the area that I'd try first.
