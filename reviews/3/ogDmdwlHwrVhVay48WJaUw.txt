In short: I'd go back.

Went out last night with some friends for the gut-wrenching $1 margarita/$2 taco night.

Had 3 tacos: Carnitas, pastor, chorizo.

Had 2 margaritas.

They really try to do the whole "authentic" thing with the double corn tortillas, onions and cilantro, etc. Pickled red onions on my chorizo were a nice touch but had no place being there because of authenticity.

Tacos were a bit greasy but otherwise totally nommable. A really good deal at $2 and definitely winning the label of "tasty." Chorizo was probably my favorite, except for the aforementioned grease.

Margaritas were lime, frozen, and sickly sweetening. But hey, they were $1 and had over a shot's worth of tequila in them, so how can that be anything but a bargain?!

Total with a 22%-ish tip for all of that was $10. How the hell can I possibly complain?!

Great deal for going out on a Tuesday night. And, like I said? I'll definitely be back.
