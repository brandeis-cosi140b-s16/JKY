Definitely a real Filibertos. The food was pretty good; what I expect when I go to any Filibertos location. I got the chicken tacos (as I usually do), and they were pretty good. I will say, though, that I had some pretty nasty, kind of painful indigestion the next day... so I'm not sure what to think of that. Could be because I haven't been eating much processed food lately. Careful, though.
