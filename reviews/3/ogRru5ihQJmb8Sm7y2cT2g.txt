The food is really good I love the tacos but the beans are all water and also each time I ask for corn tortillas they give me flour and I have to ask them to fix it. It's happened the last three times I've gone. Also the staff really rushes you through the line and I always have to ask the person at the end to add in my salsa and other stuff because the people are trying to push you down the line so fast. Other than that the food is really good and I would recommend
