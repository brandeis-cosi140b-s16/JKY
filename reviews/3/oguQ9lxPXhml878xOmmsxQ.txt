The food was very plain. 
The hostess barely said hello.
The waiter was less than attentive.
He forgot our drinks even after we reminded him.
Slow service. Took about 20-40minutes for my food to come out. 

The only reason I'm not giving 2 stars is because it at least looked clean and even though it wasnt the best costumer service, I've had much worse.
