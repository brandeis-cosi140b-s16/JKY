I was hoping to like Taco Guild more than I actually did. The decor is truly awesome - converting an old mission-style church into a taco gastropub is genius. However, the concept is a bit poorly executed.
The music selections were odd and clashing. Our server was nervous and redundant. For example, when I ordered a water: "Would you like a straw? Or lemon? Or both?" It was just an awkward way of asking. 
The bathrooms are not clearly marked. I watched as several men walked into the women's restroom without knowing it.
All of this would have been fine if the food were good, which unfortunately, it wasn't. My chicken taco had cold kidney beans on it, which were highly unappetizing. My husband ordered 3 small tacos, each of which left him underwhelmed.
I'm not trying to be overly critical of a new restaurant, in fact, I badly want them to succeed! But right now, Gadzooks is the better Mexican place on that block (Osborn/7th).
