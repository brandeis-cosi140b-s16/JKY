The run down above average Mexican-inspired food priced above average. Taco platters are 3 mini tacos with a scoop of rice and beans. However, I will say, I got the braised pork tacos and they were quite delicious despite their size. Service was just about adequate; servers didn't seem to enjoy working or do anything past bare minimum to prevent managers from yelling at them. Seating was comfortable and there was charging stations.
