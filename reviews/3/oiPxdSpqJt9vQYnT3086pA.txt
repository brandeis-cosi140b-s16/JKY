Good Mexican food (including fresh tortillas), they are trying real hard, but their process is jacked up. This process issue creates two main problems for the customer: as your order moves down the line, each separate employee has no idea what you told the last person, so you have to constantly repeat yourself, and then to add to the confusion, once during the process your order disappears to be baked and you as the customer have to be watching to "claim" your order to continue the process. This process issue also creates their second main problem which is their long, slow line.
