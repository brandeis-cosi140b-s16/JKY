So I made it down to Vitamin T and it was not bad.  I had the Caramelos which I found out was not just a candy bar.  They come with Chihuahua cheese (the state in Mexico not from the dog silly), grilled onion, jalapenos and queso fresco and your choice of meat.  I got the Barbacoa which had great flavor and at $5 you get two little street taco sized ones.  So for the price and flavor well worth it.  

My only knocks are there is like no seating and it is very small.  The menu is very limited but hopefully that's cause they just do things they do well.  I will have to go back for the taco's and torta's and update my review.  As of now it's A-OK so if your not in the area it's probably not worth the trip.
