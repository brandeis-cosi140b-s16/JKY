I was a dedicated Iguana Grill fan back in the day (like 8-9 years ago), so to my delight, my friends took me to the "newer" Mexican place at the same location. Arriving there on a Saturday around 8p we were rudely greeted before stepping in from out of the cold, and were informed there was "no room" for the three of us, even though our two friends were already inside with our name on the list for a table. It was no shock to me that Ms. Grumpy is the EXACT same mean woman from Iguana Grill. Why on earth does she work in the customer service industry? She's terrible even all these years later! Luckily, other than some glares she threw after we saw 4 people leave and come in, we didn't have to interact with her further. 

Service at the bar and at our table were completely fine. The margaritas, jalape√±o cornbread, and tacos were all pretty good. If I was guaranteed not to experience Ms. Grumpy, I would definitely visit again.
