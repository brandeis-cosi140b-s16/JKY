Pico de Gallo is really,really good. Extremely fresh and flavorful.
I have only eating their chicken and steak fajitas and they both were seasoned awesomely. 

However, I do not care for the rice or beans. I wish they would give you the option to cheese black beans and they wouldn't use peas, beans and carrots in their rice. It doesn't taste authentic at all. I think they puree the beans and I am not a fan of the consistency. I am also sure they have pork in them which I do not eat.

It's a quick place to grab a taco. If you have a taste for Mexican, it does the job but I have tasted better.
