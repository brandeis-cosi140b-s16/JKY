My husband and I went here last night around 9 and asked to sit on the patio since the weather was nice and were told that it was all open seating. We sat down right outside the door and it took almost 10 min for the patio waitress to approach us to take our drink orders and bring us menus. I ordered the black chile margarita because it was on the happy hour drink list and I was pleasantly surprised. For my meal I ordered the chicken and poblano cheese crisp as it was also on the happy hour menu and I fancy myself a frugal individual, haha. It was really good once I picked off the chunks of raw onion and black olives that were scattered on top, I suppose it was my bad for assuming that it would only have chicken and poblanos, as that is the title of the dish. The cream sauce that was drizzled on was delicious. For my husband, who is less frugal, he ordered the chicken skewers for his appetizer and they were amazing! They were so juicy and the glaze was sweet and mildly spicy. Then for his 'entree' he ordered the salmon salad. It was highly disappointing for a 15 dollar salad. It was a mix of fresh greens, a handful of avocado, and a burnt fillet of salmon resting on top. I think that he would have been happier if he had ordered a second helping of the chicken skewers. I would revisit this place again, as long as I wasn't in a rush. Good margaritas and chicken skewers are good enough for me. I can't say the same for my husband.
