Place is still ok...the lights were turned up this time and I saw the restaurant in its full glory. It's clean, but a little dusty here and there. Service was fast and friendly and I forgot they served Pepsi...and none of these 8oz glasses of pepsi, either. We're talking, plastic cup, chug a lug cuz you're thirsty kind of big - I was looking the glass and was thinking, "Is this a 40 oz diet pepsi goodness?!"

The food was so-so. It hit the mexican food craving since Rosa's was closed on a Sunday. Damn you, Rosa's!

This is still an ok place for me to eat, but I won't deliberately go there unless all other mexican food options are exhausted -- and I will choose Rosita's over Serrano's any day.

ps
Did I mention they have big glasses of Pepsi?!
Oh yea, the no windows thing still freaks me out.  :D
