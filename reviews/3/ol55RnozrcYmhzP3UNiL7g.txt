I will give them one more chance, for sure... 
NIce letter, I am happy Kay has declded to take some time off.  I have worked in the restaurant biz myself and I know exactly how she felt that day.  I can respect that.  Thank you for your offer for a free lunch.  When I get the spirit to leave the building I'll come in and order the fish tacos, till then, adios! 

Ayren,
 
First I would like to apologize for taking so long to respond to your message.  It can take a while for messages to corporate to make it back to us at the store.  
 
Second, I'm sorry that you had a bad experience! The woman you refer to in your letter is named Kay. She is a sweet old woman and the mother of the owner.  She is heavily invested in the business and has not given herself a day off since we opened nearly 3 years ago.  This experience has finally convinced her to take days off! 
 
We take painstaking strides to make sure that our patrons have a good experience and want to come back.  Even though we are franchise, our store is privately owned by a local family.  We try to win our customers one at a time and we would hate to lose you over this experience. If you would please give us another chance, I would be glad to give you and a friend lunch on us!
