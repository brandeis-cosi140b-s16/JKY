This used to be my local haunt for a decent and fast carne asada burrito for an insanely good price. Well, I went in a couple days ago and everything was all good until I saw the cook microwave the tortilla for my burrito! I'm sorry but anyone with a stitch of cooking knowledge knows that if you microwave a tortilla to heat it up it becomes almost instantly stale. How much effort does it take to throw it on the plancha and heat it up for 10 seconds?!?! That made me so mad. The carne asada has gone downhill a bit from where it used to be and is on the dry side, but still had OKAY flavor. The pico was nearly all onion which doesn't bother me since I love onions. With all this being said, This place used to be decent for being your typical phoenix mexican fast food joint but I think those days may have vanished. Unfortunate, I really hope they pick up their game again.
