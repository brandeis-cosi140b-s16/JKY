Went there for dinner a few nights ago -  The margaritas are the only factor that brought this review up to 3 stars.  Compared to a place down the street these margaritas were outstanding.

The food was nothing extraordinary.  The guacamole was WAY overpriced for what you get.  Yea, it's cool that they make it tableside but the portion is very small for $10.50 and it wasn't that flavorful.  Also, it took a significant amount of time for it to come to our table.  So much time, that our entrees were served within minutes, which is one thing I hate.  Who wants their dinner experience to be rushed?

I ordered the baked seafood enchiliadas, which sounded amazing on the menu.  Very disappointing.  It definitely wasn't an enchilada...just two small tortillas stacked on top of each other with mostly a spinach filling. Not much seafood at all and they completely forgot to include any shrimp on.  When I asked for the shrimp, the waiter brought out 2 small very overcooked shrimp.  I substituted the beans for vegetables which were very bland and wilted (green beans and corn).   My boyfriend ordered the barbacoaa enchiliadas...again nothing special.  Sounded better on paper. 

I would maybe only go back for the happy hour margaritas.  Disappointed.
