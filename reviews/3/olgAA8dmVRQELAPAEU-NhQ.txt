Te food is just that "A-OK!" It'll do you after a long trek at the Adventuredome. Don't expect fancy or disgusting greasy food as its far from both of those. Nor is it authentic or honest Mexican Food. Its Fast Food with a slight "Gourmet" Atmosphere and Flavor. I liked it. I got a simple bean burrito. I thought it prices were fairly decent for being in Las Vegas. The place was so busy, but they got the food out pretty quickly
