I love me some Pollo Loco, but this location is S.L.O.W! I came here around 1:45 thinking the lunch rush would be over by then but the line for the drive-thru still looked quite daunting. I decided to wait it out anyway since I was craving some of their spicy avocado salsa. 

I waited in the line a good 15 minutes before I got my food and was on my way back to work. Not horrible, but still a little longer than you would expect from a fast food drive thru during off hours. Service was still friendly and efficient once I actually got to the window.
