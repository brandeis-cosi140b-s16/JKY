This place was not bad at all with it being inside a mall. It was super crowded but I'm glad I was able to get a seat since the place was pretty small. There were tables outside as well but were also taken.

If you're looking for a cheap place to eat in Vegas, I guess this will be one of them! Looks like the prices are not raised and so it's a good option. And the food is consistent as well.

I recommend here for a under $10 lunch. Just beware of the huge crowds.
