HOT TIP: You can dance on the bar at DC Ranch hot spot San Felipe's Cantina and you won't get kicked out. Heck, it's even encouraged. That's part of the draw to this hot cantina, which has a sister location in Flagstaff that opened several years ago. Patrons can shake it like there's no tomorrow and let go of their inhibitions after downing a few shots of Patron.

Although the bar serves food and attracts more of a family scene during the lunch time hour, I don't recommend ordering off the menu. Most of the food I've had including the enchiladas and tacos are ho-hum at best. The margaritas are delicious however so I encourage you to stick to day drinking or hopping on the bar at night to "Party Like a Rockstar."

ASU students can start dancing on the bar Sept. 20 when the new San Felipe's Cantina opens in Tempe Marketplace.
