Bought a Groupon and came here for lunch using my $12 worth of food for $7 with a drink I paid nothing extra.  I walked into the place on Durango just before 12pm & it was empty.  Then, folks just started coming in.  The interior is nice with plenty of tables and chairs and they play current Hawaii music, like listening to Island 98.5 Fm for those from the islands. 

I had the bowl with brown rice with seaweed, Kailua pork, and Huli Huli chicken.  Tried the fish, not a fan. Then , it was topped with grilled veggies, cabbage, and romaine. I had the charred pineapple verde salsa b/c the other salsas and salad dressings were too spicy hot for me. 
My verdict.  I liked the charred pineapple verde salsa, Huli Huli chicken, and kalua pork.  However, next time I will just stick with one meat in the bowl.  The rice was not warm enough It seemed cold. Portion size ok but not filling.  I may come back.  The way they serve the food reminded me of Cafe Rio. And there you have it! Have a good day folks!
