Just had lunch here today... place was pretty empty so we sat in the sun on the patio.  chips and salsa were pretty good... salsa was somewhat lacking in flavor, but probably perfectly seasoned for the occasional Mexican food consumer... ordered their half ass burrito with the 'spicy' red chili carnitas, very tasty burrito, not to hot.  I would defiantly go back and try some other offerings. great value!
