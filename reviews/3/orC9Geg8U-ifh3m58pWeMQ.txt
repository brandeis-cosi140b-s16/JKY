I found a rock in my food. A rock. 
The woman said it came from the beans and gave me my money back. She was very kind about it and she said it came from the beans.
The food was alright otherwise. The breakfast burrito potatoes were not good but on the other hand the tortillas were deeeelicious! 
I might be back one drunken night but the rock kind of killed it for me.
