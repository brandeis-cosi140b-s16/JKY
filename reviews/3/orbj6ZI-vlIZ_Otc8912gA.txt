This place is average at best. Very friendly atmosphere and very friendly staff make up for the lack of imagination when it comes to the food. Like another reviewer stated this is a spin off of chipotle. Being from Texas I am a Mexican food snob and this place does not hold up. I would come here if I were in the area but it's not good enough to make a trip especially for here. In the end, it will make a turd.
