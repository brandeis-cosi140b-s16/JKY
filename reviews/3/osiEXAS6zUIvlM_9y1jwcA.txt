If you've ever played "Cafe World" you will recognize this place as the first level if they had a Mexican version. One very cute petite lady running around, and taking everyone's orders, and then running in the back to cook it up....then she comes back out poised and collected, serves you calmly, and then runs back in the kitchen to cook someone else's order, only to come back in time to clear your dishes, etc...

What really endeared me to this place was the obvious pride in non-franchised ownership. The clear plastic tablecloths over the handmade lace ones...the server/cook/owner's propriety when she brought Hubs an iced tea with an actual iced tea spoon ( I hadn't seen one in years!) It all reminded me of my little Sicilian aunts and the way I imagine they ran their tiny little speakeasies (yes, I have mafia in my blood!) back in the day....

If the food had been incredible, I would've jumped on the table and danced the Macarena.....but alas, they put the "meh" in Mexican. I had the chile rellenos, and it came with a side of beans and rice...all fine, but forgettable.

I imagine I would LOVE this place if they had a liquor license ;)
