The beans aren't that great.  The only thing I get here which I think is great is the pollo fundido.  I have also had the tortilla soup which was quite tasty as well, and on a surprising note, their fries are awesome, but the burgers only so so.....pollo fundido with fries....hmmmm.  I go here about once a  year.
