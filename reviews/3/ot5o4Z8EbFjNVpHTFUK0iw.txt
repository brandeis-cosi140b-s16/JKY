I've eaten here many, many times because it is close to my work and there are very few options within walking distance. Usually I get breakfast on days when I need to get breakfast, because at lunch I have time to drive someplace else. 

The food is usually pretty good and the service OK, too. But I've gotten sick to my stomach on a few occasions as well. If I didn't work close to here, I probably wouldn't return, but as I said options are limited.
