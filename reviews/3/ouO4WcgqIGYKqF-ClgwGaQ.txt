Ordered dinner to go. I went with two beef tacos and the #12, which is two double wrapped beef enchiladas, with rice and beans. My order was ready when they said it would be. The food was decent. I have a feeling that if I ate in, that the food may be better. I will definitely be giving it another shot.
