Ok Super Burrito, you were chosen randomly to be the first Mexican food I had since moving here a few weeks ago. Our relationship is not set in stone yet but our first date was so brief I hardly had time to get to know you. 

Let's start with the food, pretty tasty though I could've done without the guacamole and sour cream on my carne asada fries. I did not know what came on the fries beyond the description in the name itself and the guy taking my order didn't offer to say. Moving on...they were tasty and I was not too disappointed in letting you be my first "Arizonian Mexican Food". 

On to the service, I was greeted in Spanish so I ordered in Spanish. However I am quickly realizing that the Spanish I speak is what they call Castilian and it happens to be a different dialect than what most people here speak. So I did my best to keep it short and so did you. Anyways while the food was cooking I was explaining your menu to my husband and came across the part about you cooking brains and tongues. Well I decided to ask if you knew where I could find anticuchos, which are marinated chunks of beef heart roasted over an open flame, and you looked at me very very strangely and said you didn't know what I was talking about. I suppose Mexican cooks stopped just short of using it after cooking up the brains, tongue, and intestinal walls. I laughed and said it was a Peruvian thing and not to worry about. 

...And so concluded my awkward entrance into the world of Mexican dining in Arizona!
