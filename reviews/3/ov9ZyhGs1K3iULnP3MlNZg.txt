We like this place better than the rest of the chain, boring, mediocre Mexican food joints such as El Torito, Macayo's, Manuel's, Gardunos, or Garcias. The portions are generous, the food seems fresher and more colorful than these other "Americanised" Mexican places. Good service too. The chicken quesadilla is great, and their nachos are served as individual chips piled with meat and cheese on them, sort of unique. Like I said, this is the best of the chains, but its not authentic Mexican food at all!
