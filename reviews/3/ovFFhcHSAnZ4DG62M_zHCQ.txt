Still another american-taco place, that won't ever resemble mexican style tacos. My friends claim their burritos are better than the ones at Chipotle. Wouldn't be able to help with that, as I refuse to try any one more of those yada yada things.

I had carnitas quesadilla...which the moment it has meat or something else, also can't be a quesadilla anymore. More like a gringa. Even though the use as many other places flour tortillas, the whole thing is not bad served, good wacamole and salsa (not spicy at all). 

For all you fake taco lovers, another place to dream you are eating so called "mexican" food!
