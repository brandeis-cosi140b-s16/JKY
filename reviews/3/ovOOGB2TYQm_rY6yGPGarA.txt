Had a quick lunch here as I often do after a Home Depot run or when I'm craving chips and salsa.  I have to agree with everyone else's review as far as the price goes; I know it's located in Scottsdale but $4+ for a single taco (and it's funny because that specifically caught my eye when I went yesterday) is stupid, I don't care how much garnish you put on the plate.  I do love when they have their "margarita sales" though!  

I go here for a few reasons:  it's close.  The salsa is good.  The service is good.  I think the same servers have been there for years and although they never seem to acknowledge that I'm back again (hey, I'm a regular, give me some love please!) they still treat me well.  They're not stingy on the chips and salsa (can you tell this is a major prerequisite for me in judging a Mexican food place?) and the food is decent.  So, I give it an "A-OK" as the local Mexican place. Also never crazy busy so there's no wait, and the food is never too spicy so rookie out-of-towners can enjoy their meal too.

If the management is reading this:  your food is pretty good and your waitstaff is very nice, but in general, you're nothing too out of the ordinary and you're scaring away clients with your Scottsdale prices. Take it down a notch and you'll get more neighborhood support. There's WAY too many Mexican places nearby to choose from so do something to make us want to come around more often.
