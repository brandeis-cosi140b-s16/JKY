Loved it when I first started going but now it seems to be very salty. I always stick w/ Jerk Quesadilla, Machaca Quesidilla, black re-fried, and CFR . Not sure what happened to me or the restaurant.

You will love it on your first trip. I recommend this place in moderation. It is also a fun place to take people from out of town. I also recommend Heart attack bar and grill for outsiders. Shitty food but good decent scenery.
