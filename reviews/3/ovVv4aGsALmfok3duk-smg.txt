I am giving this place 3.5 star based on the fish tacos.  They were yummy.  The staff was very friendly and gave us the low down on how it all operates at Guedo's.  We had a beer with each taco and it seemed pricey for what is essentially no service fast food.  I did enjoy it but with how competitive this market is, it just isn't worth it for me to drive to Chandler and pay double at a cash only place.
