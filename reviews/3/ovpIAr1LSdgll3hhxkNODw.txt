This place is okay, not fantastic. Especially when there are sooo many A+ places to eat in Vegas. I would maybe eat here again becuase there aren't many nice mexican food places in Vegas. The food was good, but very americanized. I prefer traditional mexican food, and this was not it. I will say the margarona was great. It is a margarita with a corona... It is worth trying!! If your just looking for drinks and appetizers then this place is a good spot.
