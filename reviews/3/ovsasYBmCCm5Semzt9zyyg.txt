I always test Mexican restaurants by their guacamole. I'm happy to say that Mucho Gusto passed that test. It's delectable guacamole came topped with a Grand Marnier jalapeno reduction... delicious!

I ordered a chicken kabob-type dish (sorry, friends, I can't remember the official title). It was good. Not amazing.

Our waitress wasn't very attentive as our water glasses were never refilled.

All in all. The food was good, but I wasn't impressed by the service.
