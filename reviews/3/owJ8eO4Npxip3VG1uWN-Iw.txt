Stopped in with the family and friends for dinner here last night.  Not a big fan of chains, so not sure what to expect.  Really enjoyed the xx beer battered tacos.  Came because we heard kids eat free with adult meal, and have to save a buck when we can.  Found out after getting here you needed a coupon.  Manager suggested we register for their "Club Cantina" offers online, but said we could work it out without the coupon.   We registered, but the coupon never came, but they still gave is the deal.   Have to love great customer service.
