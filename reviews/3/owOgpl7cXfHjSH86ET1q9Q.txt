After updating my driver's license photo on a Friday morning (because that's how I spice up my vacation week), I wanted to eat somewhere outside of my general dining zone. By chance, I happened upon El Mesquite and was pleased with my breakfast. My server brought out chips and salsa; man, their salsa kicks ass! Great flavor and fantastic heat. That held me over while I was waiting on the chilaquiles. As others have stated, the beans are on the runny side. But mixing them with rice fixes that.

The staff here was super nice, too. And for the prices, I'll definately be back when i find myself on the south side.
