We came to San Felipe's Cantina on a Thursday night and they were offering some great drink specials. ALL drinks were half off - can't beat that! We wouldn't have known if they didn't tell us so I think they need to have some more advertising out front. 

The food was okay - our group ordered some chips & salsa and also an order of quesadillas. The salsa was alright - definitely fresh but I wasn't a fan of the pieces of corn in it but that's just a personal thing. The quesadilla was also pretty good but I felt like it was something I could make at home.

Service was great - the bartenders always made sure that we were doing okay and asked if we needed more drinks. 

This is a solid spot for HH and it gets pretty packed late at night. There's also tons of tv's so you can catch a game!
