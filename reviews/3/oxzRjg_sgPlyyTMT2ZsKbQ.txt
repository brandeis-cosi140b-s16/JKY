I was excited to see an enchilada and soup shop open.  Soup... not soups... they only serve one kind. The food is flavorful but the process is difficult. The staff appear grungy and have no sense of urgency. It's concerning they don't wear hair nets. One of the employee's pants had grease stains and the t shirts on the gals were grossly form fitting. Just not what I expect when someone is making my food.   I've been twice. Once when they opened and again a few weeks ago.  Both times they were out of something on the menu.  The concept of a string tying machine is interesting but completely a waste. It almost seems as though they rushed to open and skipped on important details. I truly hope the owner reads these reviews because the food is good and the place has such potential. It seems like there are too many employees on shift which makes for a complete social hour.  I drive by every day and am starting to see an empty parking lot. I hope the owner acts on just a few of these issues. It would be a shame to see this place close needlessly.  PS... It appears another taco shop is opening up across the street. Please take action and make it easier for patrons to support local business.
