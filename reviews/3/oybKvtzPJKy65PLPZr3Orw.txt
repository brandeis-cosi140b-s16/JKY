Met my bf and his parents at Pascuale's for dinner on Friday evening.  If you're not from Madison and have never been to Pascuale's before, the lack of signage indicating if you should hop a sit at an available table or wait in line-should you encounter one, was a little confusing.  Despite the 2 minute aimless walk-around while we figured it out, we took a seat and then went up to the counter to order our food.  The delivery was prompt, with each entr√©e enclosed and delivered with a cover to ensure the arrival of warm food.  I ordered the chicken fajita taco dinner which was good, but not worth elaborating on.  How can you mess up a chicken dish anyways????  To wash it all down, I had one of their "known-for" margaritas, but may I suggest to anyone or everyone else, please deviate from the orange-flavored margarita.  Orange flavor needs to stick with cough drops and screwdrivers.   

When it's all said and done, go outside, step to the crosswalk and participate in the crosswalk flag system and cross on over the Michaels's Frozen Custard for a root beer float.
