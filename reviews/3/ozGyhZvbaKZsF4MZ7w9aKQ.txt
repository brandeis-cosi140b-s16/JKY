Ordered four burrito bowls at Chipotle yesterday: two with double-meat and two with gluten allergies. 

After opening them up side by side, we couldn't tell which ones were double meat. A bit frustrating since it's $2.30 extra for double meat (x 2 bowls).

On the plus side, they took our gluten situation seriously. Even tho there were 3-4 in line behind me, Chipotle swapped out all the utensils to avoid cross contamination. Good job there! 

I've had the steak, the carnitas and the barbacoa. All good but the barbacoa is the juiciest. 

I will address the double meat with them upon my next visit cuz, hey, Chipotle puts out some good meals otherwise. A bit pricey, but tasty.
