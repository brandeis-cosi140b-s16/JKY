It's like the cliche Mexican grill. Large tables.  Cheesy decor.  Beer promos everywhere.  At least at Las Glorias, the food actually tasted good.  

They bring you liquidy salsa and chips to start.  I had a burrito with rice and beans.  This place is a solid 3 stars, but since this is AZ Las Glorias Grill is 3.5 stars.  It really is hard to find decent Mex place there.
