Although I know that there are Mexican establishments across the city that serve better fare, I have a special place for Tacos Mexicos strictly because of its' connection to my hometown...Friday nights in high school always ended up at Tacos Mexicos in Hacienda Heights for Carne Asada Tacos!

I HAD to yelp this particular Tacos Mexicos because it stands head and shoulders above the other locations in town...the food is cooked to order and always fresh compared to some of the mess you can find at the seedier locations throughout Vegas...

To boot, Miercoles is 60 cent taco night! Reminiscent of my days back in high school!!!
