Came here to get my usual burrito bowl and everything started out ok until the girl at the second half of the assembly line went in the back. A guy In the kitchen area maybe the sup told her to come back out ASAP she came back out from behind the door and proceeded to cry as she added my ingredients wasn't sure what to do but I didn't want to make it worse so I just looked at her like honey you need to take a break or something and glared at the guy like I know saw her crying. Anyway I felt like I was eating a bowl of tears and I am 85% sure a couple of hers were inside of it. Food here it good but I still think about it when I see her
