Wanted to see what all the rage was about with this place since I've heard good things and seen some of their reviews. The only time I am in the plaza they are located in, I'm usually grabbing a shawarma laffa from next door at Shawarma Vegas which never lets me down btw. I tried the chilaquiles and my boyfriend got the california burrito. His burrito looked and smelled delicious, but it seemed a bit small. He scarfed it down in seconds. My chilaquiles were decent. The two fried eggs were cooked just how I like em. I appreciated the flavor of the overall dish, but the chips were overly soggy. My beans also came with a present from the chef.. a nice, curly hair on top. Kinda made me lose my appetite and also disappoint me for not going to my normal go to spot which is shawarma Vegas.  Lesson learned lol. I think next time I'll try their tacos.
