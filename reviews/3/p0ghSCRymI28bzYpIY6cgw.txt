So-so. This place is ok. Chips were decent.  The green salsa was not good, very salty, possibly store bought.  The fire roasted was decent, almost like a soup though.  The hot salsa really didn't have much flavor. Had the #4 with 1 chicken & 1 beef taco. The tacos were good. Had a Quesadilla and it was good and large.
The decor is very Caucasian/strip mall-ish. Looks like it might have been an Asian place at one point. Don't sit under the ceiling fans, they're on high and the staff can't adjust them :(
On the upside, they sell shots of "Fireball".
All-in-all  they are ok. I may try again to have the Fish Tacos.
