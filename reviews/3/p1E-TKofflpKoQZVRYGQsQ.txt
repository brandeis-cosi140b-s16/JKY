Ok Mexican like everywhere else. I completely agree with the previous reviewer, "when is the authentic one coming to this town?" The menu cover page says it's authentic, but the men items themselves looked little more tex-mex ish. I had a fajita plate while my friend had a chicken dish (I forgot what it was called). My fajita arrived on a sizzling hot plate (that's takes care of the "fun part" regardless of the quality), and it was pretty good. The portion was huge, so I had to take ha;f of my plate to go, and the take out became the perfect left-over dinner next day.
