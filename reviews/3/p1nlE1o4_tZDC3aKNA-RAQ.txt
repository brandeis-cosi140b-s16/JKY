Nice atmosphere and great service.  They had live music for Mother's Day which added to the experience.  Even though the restaurant was very busy, all the staff seemed to be in a great mood.  I came here expecting a great experience all together, but I can't say I did and it's only because of the fish I got.  The drink I got was a bit strong as well, but I'm not one to complain about that!  I do hope to return and give this place a second chance because I do like the Michoac√°n in Centennial Hills.

Just don't get the garlic fish.
