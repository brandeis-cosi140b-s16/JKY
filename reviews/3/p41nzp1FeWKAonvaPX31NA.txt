This place is very unauthentic Mexican food.  However, it's not that bad, and generally OK.  It's also a BYOB.  Though, it is pricy for what you get.  

First off, the salsa tasted like it came from a jar or can.  The guacamole was the same.  I had the chicken fajita, which was quite tasty, but it was only chicken on a bed of lettuce with a few spices.  I'm allergic to sweet peppers, so they didn't serve me any. No beans and rice accompanied this though.  

Overall, the place is very accommodating.  It's a great little location and the atmosphere is nice inside.  They do have some outdoor seating as well.  Nonetheless, I don't think I'll be back even though I think it's OK, b/c I prefer authentic Mexican to Americanized, OK quality mexicanish food.
