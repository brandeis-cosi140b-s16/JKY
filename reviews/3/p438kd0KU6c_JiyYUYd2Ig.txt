Two and a half stars. 

Macayo's is the bastard child of a well intentioned tex-mex kitchen with a TGI Friday's.

I've never really been a fan of tex-mex in comparison with the genuine article, but even for tex-mex standards Macayo's falls somewhere between "blah" and "ew." 

The only forgivable reason I can conjure up to spend a significant amount of time here would be in a large group, maybe with your whole softball team, to kick back and eat brightly colored chips with bland salsa and sip on reasonably priced margaritas. 

Outside of that, I wouldn't recommend it.
