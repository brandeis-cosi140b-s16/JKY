We eat here often, good rolled tacos with lotsa cheese, not too greasy.  We like the chimichangas but the beef ones always have lots of onions and peppers and not too much meat.  I just tried the chicken chimi and this time it was all meat, some beans and no onions or peppers, I'm confused?!?  Oh well, it was good but needed salt.  My husband had the chile rellenos and he said they had too much egg breading but were pretty good nonetheless, not stellar.  The guac has lots of large onion chunks but it's got a good flavor.  

Check your order, it's been wrong a couple of times.
