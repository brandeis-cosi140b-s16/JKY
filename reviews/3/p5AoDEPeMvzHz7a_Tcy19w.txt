So far so good. Their first day open today. The Chile Verde was very flavorful, beans were good! Green and red sauce were thick and tasty. The marinated carrots are a nice bonus. Can't wait to try more of the menu, I'll keep you posted.


This appears to be a whole new operation;
This is the former location of two other taco shops, Mi Casita and then the same Owner changed it to Pepe's taco shop, they don't appear to be apart of this new operation.

UPDATE: As time has gone on they have had some personnel issue, they are not as on top of service and the food quality has slipped a bit. YOU ALWAY LOOSE IN THE LONG RUN WHEN YOU COMPROMISE QUALITY TO SAVE A FEW BUCKS!
