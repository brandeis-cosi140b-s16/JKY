Atmosphere inside is dark and has an old school feel. I had the guacamole tosada and it was ok.  I'll probably get something different if we go back though.  My boyfriend and my dad got the chimichanga and they loved them.  The service could have been better.  I didn't ever get a refill on my drink and I don't know about you, but when I pay $2 for a soda, I'd like to get a refill.
