On their cup it says something about how they won't nickel and dime you for sides (ie: guacamole, sour cream, beans, Pico de gallo, ect). On the day I was there that seems to be all they were doing. I asked for a few sides and the man behind the counter said 'that will be 90Â¢ per item.' Uh isn't that exactly what you said you weren't going to do. The other chipotle locations throughout the valley don't charge you like this.
