I finally got to try Tradiciones today. This one has intrigued me for awhile because it is consistently rated as one of the best Mexican places in Phoenix by the Arizona Republic, yet Yelp reviews are mixed. I kind of get that now. 

First of all, when you walk in they have meat cooking over a wood fire, which is a really nice touch. Even as I write this, I still have a slight campfire smell on my shirt. The d√©cor is more or less your typical American Disney-like Mexican restaurant ambience, maybe a step above the norm. I was on my lunch at work so I could not drink, but I noticed Dos Equis on tap, which is always a plus in my book. The place is pretty large, so it would be a good destination for a group. 

Service was very good and friendly. The prices were pretty decent for lunch, at least; I did not see the dinner menu. I had the carne asada platter with chilaquiles ($10.95) and my co-worker had a burro. The food was good. It was not super great, certainly not one of the best in town as AZ Republic suggests, but certainly a step up from Macayos and other chains. I think this would be a good place to impress out-of-town relatives that are not ready for super-authentic Mexican food. I'm not saying there is not authentic stuff on the menu, it's just that there is plenty of the stuff people would be used to seeing at a place like Garcia's. 

I would almost bump it up to four stars just because of the nice smell, the good service, and most of all, the proximity to the Ranch Market--the most wonderful supermarket chain in Phoenix.
