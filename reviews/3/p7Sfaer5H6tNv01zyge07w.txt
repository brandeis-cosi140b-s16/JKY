I've eating here a few times with mixed results - anywhere from "meh" to "excellent".  

My last visit here brought a lunch burrito to my table.  I went with the steak because it sounded good and I was feeling beefy.  No ground beef option, so steak was it.  I'd say it was just "okay".  Not a great flavor like I'm used to from El Pastor.  I expected it to pop more, but it was pretty bland.  My lunchmate had a quesadilla and she didn't finish it, so I'm assuming it wasn't great either.  

Past visits provided me with better food - more of the authentic Mexican food that I was expecting this time around.

I'll eat here again, but I won't be as excited as I was before this last visit.
