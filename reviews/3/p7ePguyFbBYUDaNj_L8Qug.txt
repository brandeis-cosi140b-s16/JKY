I find it interesting that the different locations of this chain of restaurants have different numbers of stars, and I'm wondering if I would like another location more.

One thing that I appreciate about this place is the hours.  The dining room is open until midnight and the drive-thru is 24 hours.  Not too many places in this neighborhood are open that late, so it's nice if you want a late night bite.

The food was OK.  I probably should've tried one or more of the many salsas from the salsa bar, but I like to first try food on its own before adding anything to it, and then I was just feeling to lazy to get up and get some salsas.

I had the two chicken tacos meal.  For some reason, I found the first taco to be more flavorful than the second.  That actually worked out to my benefit because it stopped me from stuffing myself silly.  The rice was pretty standard Mexican rice and the beans were as well, but they were served with a lot of shredded cheese on top... and lots of cheese will make just about anything taste good.

This is the kind of place that I might visit again when I'm feeling like Mexican food, don't feel like traveling too far for it, and don't feel like spending too much on it.  Also a great late night option.
