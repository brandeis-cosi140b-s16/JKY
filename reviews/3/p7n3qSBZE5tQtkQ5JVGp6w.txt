When the Fuentes brothers want real Mexican food... they go to Maize!

The food is OK.  But claiming to be "the spirit of Mexico" means more  have a large selection of tequila.  For one, change the salsa and merenge music for Mariachi and Norten~as.  Second, salsa should be served automatically with any tacos order.  

Pros: the food and drinks were well priced.
