I don't like paying for chips and salsa!!  Just give us the darn things and charge for refills.  The chips were indeed good, but I don't know about the $4 price tag, maybe even lower the price.  Happy hour has great deals, if you are into high-end tequilas!  All tequilas and appetizers are 50% off.  I have only had the app Carnitas en Chile Verde because it is so delicious (bowl of yummy melt in your mouth pork with cheese etc. with homemade chips to scoop it up)!  The patio and atmosphere are decent.  My service always seems to be alright here, not horrible, yet not great either.  Not sure I would go out of my way to come here aside from the happy hours :)
