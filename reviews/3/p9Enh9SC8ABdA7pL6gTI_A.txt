After a weekend of St. Patrick's Day fare - decided that we wanted to go to Garduno's for their brunch.  We get to the restaurant and it's a totally different name.  What is this?  Shrimps?  Fish?  :)  We walked in half expecting EVERYTHING to be different.  It wasn't.  Everything is the same.  The brunch is still offered.  The only thing that's changed is the name.  It's been at least two months according to the hostess.  The menu according to her has changed just a little bit.  Today's visit didn't allow for us to review what possibly could have changed.  We were there for brunch.  

For the most part service is still there.  I think wait staff tends to let us do our thing because it is brunch.  Never an empty water glass.  Refill on chips came right away.  Our waitress even offered to stay with an infant while the g-ma went up and got a plate.
