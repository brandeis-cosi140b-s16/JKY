El Pollo Loco is one of my favorite fast food lunch spots. Well it's only them and in-n-out that I frequent. The food is good but the drive through was designed way before cars were invented..yea I know it doesn't  make sense. You place an order and have to make a 90 degree turn to the window. Better off going inside and play it safe. I didn't hit the curb but 2 cars in front of me did.
