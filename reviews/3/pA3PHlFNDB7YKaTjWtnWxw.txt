I find it odd that its smack-dab in the middle of a retail center consisting of furniture stores. Anyway, Fausto's is a decent Mexican restaurant in Henderson, which is pretty rare to find in the short time I stayed out there. It has to be pretty decent if its open until midnight on daily basis. Kinda rare to find a place like that in Henderson that's open this late, well except for the casinos, fast food joints, and maybe a Denny's. 

3 stars for being open late and for carrying carne asada fries. The burritos aren't too expensive, but adding beans and rice are extra. Stock up on salsa at the salsa bar while you wait for your food. Other than that, I don't have too much to add. Yessir.
