Found this place from Yelp... so thank you... place is VERY small and very easy to miss... right across the street from the Henderson detention center!

Food is good... not as big of portions as Robertos but better quality is seems.  The California burrito is awesome... the super nachos aren't my fav... Robertos were better in my mind.... still good little place!
