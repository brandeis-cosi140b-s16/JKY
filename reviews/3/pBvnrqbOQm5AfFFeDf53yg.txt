I went to this restaurant to have lunch with a coworker.  The people were very polite.  The guacamole cart was wonderful, and the guacamole was so fresh.  I had the grilled talapia tacos and was pleased with the flavor.  I suspect the chips were not made in house.  

I think I will probably go back.
