Always delicious food and come often. Wait staff and servers were very nice. However, tried to use a Deal Chicken, which states no holidays to use it on, the day before Memorial Day and was told that it included no use for the whole holiday weekend. Also, a manager was not present to talk about the issue. We were told to come back on Tuesday. So any future users of Deal Chicken, Groupon, etc., please check with servers before having to pay way more than expected. La Perla needs to remedy this by clarifying with these sites.
