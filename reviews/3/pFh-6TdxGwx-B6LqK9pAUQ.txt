The food here is always excellent, they have a mound of nachos that's like $6. However last time we went my son ordered chicken nuggets and they were raw; they told me their freezer had broke the night before so everything un-thawed and they couldn't get it to fry properly. Why they served it to me after it un-thawed I don't know. They replaced it with a quesadilla. The kids working were very nice about it, and when I say kids I mean kids. Couldn't have been out of their teens. The place had a ton of flys and the salsa bar needed some tlc.
