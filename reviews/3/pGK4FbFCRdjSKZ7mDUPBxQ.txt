I have been here twice. The first time rocked.. Was for lunch had a perfect bean tip and chips.. the bean dip was amazing. It had cooked pork mixed in it and was a nice surprise. The chicken Fajitas were tasty and I was onto the best new place in Vegas for Mexican (according to me). 

Then the second trip.. not so good. Dip was flavorless and wasn't anyhting like the last time. The tacos were basic and weren't as good as Putters Taco Basket. So.. thrid time will be the tie breakers.. Let u know..
