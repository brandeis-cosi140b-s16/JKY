At $3.25 per hot dog, these aren't the best hot dogs I've had. When you ask for everything, it comes with pico de gallo (tomatoe and onions), sausage, mayo, bacon, and beans. It was good but it was missing flavor. I had to put 2 types of hot sauces to give it extra flavor. Don't think of putting ketchup on these as it is not customary to do so in Sonora (Nogales is city that borders Sonora and Arizona). Make sure you always, I repeat, ALWAYS accompany with a bottled coke.
