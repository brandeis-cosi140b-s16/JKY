This place is very good to eat at but it drives me crazy that 9 times out of 10 when I order for pick up on my app my food is never ready or even started for that matter and I purposely get there 15-20 minutes after pick up time. I stopped eating at that location for a year so I tried again and still my food isn't ready.  I wish they'd get it together because I'd eat there 2-3 times a week because it's on my way to work.
