I came in tonight an I sure I would have received great customer service but it was a night mare an I ended up going home hungry! I worked later and thought I'd run in a grab a bit to eat ! The line was moving great but when it came to the people in front of me it seemed they didn't know much about chipotle or there food so they took a very long time to figure out what they wanted I waited 15min. If the worker would have recommend food item it prolly would have been a five star experience. Although I live close by I'm not sure if I'd be returning only because I believed the employee didn't help or give there all since it was close to closing. It was more like the customers helping the customer instead of the employees helping the customer.
