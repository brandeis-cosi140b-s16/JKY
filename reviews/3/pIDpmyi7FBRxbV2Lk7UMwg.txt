Tried some "modern" Mexican on a New Year's Day lunch here and the place was not crowded and in fact had only one of their Behihana style cooking stations open, so there was no way we could see the chef cooking our food as they promise. The other complaint would be the vast difference of one dish at lunch compared to dinner and I'm not talking about the price. The famous Brisket enchilada's were good, but at lunch they don't put it in a skillet and cover it with cheese. I'm not sure whether that whole process is worth 8 bucks more at dinner either. The lunch serving just has a few lonely enchilada's on the plate looking quite in need of a cheese bath. Everything else was pleasant enough including good free chips and a nice server. The brisket is nice and crumbly, but show your food some respect at lunch also - too many places are nickle and diming customers. It is just cheese people!
