I came here after seeing Komex on multiple lists for foods to try in Vegas.  I don't see what the big deal is...

I'm half Korean so want to notice the Korean flavor in their dish.  The Korean aspect is very subtle and won't please a person coming here for comfort food satisfaction.  Koreans are a proud people!  We want the Korean side to be accentuated!

Komex does have its endearing qualities: they cook everything fresh and to order.  There is a sign that warns you that our order may take time so Komex manages your expectations on speed.  

To bide your time, Komex offers you complimentary chips and salsa.  The corn chips were crisp and delicious by themselves.  The salsa and the guacamole only enhances the chips.  I am not sure what is homemade--the chips or the salsa--but I loved it.

Service is excellent here from the server to the cashier (manager ??).  Their demeanor relays to you that they want you to enjoy your experience at Komex.

Regretfully, I couldn't connect with the chimichanga.  I'm very skeptical whenever I try Korean or Japanese food on the mainland, and here is no exception.  The bulgogi was added sparily, it seemed.  Looking to notice the bulgogi, I didn't find it in most bitefuls.

But remove the Korean fusion, rating on the Mexican influence solely, the entr√©e failed to pass my taste test.

My Korean counterpart also thought Komex was OK....

As much as I wanted Komex to meet my expectations, I cannot recommend this as a must-try to my foodie friends from Hawaii that visit Vegas... Mi ahn hae...
