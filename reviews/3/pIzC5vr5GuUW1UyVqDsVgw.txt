Drive thru is very narrow and I drive a small car, cannot imagine what it would be like in a truck or suv. I ordered a carne asada burrito which was good and nice sized. Line was long for only one car in front of me but the food was very fresh and worth the wait. Reasonably priced. Authentic. I would come back, the woman was nice and helpful and patience as my friend and I had two seperate orders in the same car.
