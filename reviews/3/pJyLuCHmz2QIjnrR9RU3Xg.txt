I was initially excited about having a mexican place next door, a dream i had in orange county with alejandro's. The moment of truth came as the semester wound down and i had to inject as many calories into my body as i could in as small of a space and time as possible. The bacon burrito seemed to fit the bill. While hefty and filled with egg, cheese, and bacon goodness, the price was reminiscent of orange county, about five bucks. Now anybody willing to work at two in the morning in front of a stove deserves a medal, I found it interesting that the honorable chef was none other than somebody who i will refer to as toothless jose. Suffice it to say that the name is apt and while he wraps a damn good burrito, it seems that the toothpick he had in place for his forlorn teeth made its way into the eggs and I now had a bacon, egg, cheese, and oak special. Fortunately, the stabby end was parallel to my gums and I did not end up with wood coming out of my nose. Ive now been there twice and it seems that ive had the same batch of jamaica each time. I love sopes, so i had to try, the shell was hard and stale, but the shredded beef saved the day. At least it's 24 hours, not an act without courage in this town.
