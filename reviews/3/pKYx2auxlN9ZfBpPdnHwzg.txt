Expensive by mexican food standards, average price by Las Vegas Standards.  Our $10 margaritas were way too small, but were pretty tasty.  I had a chicken burrito that was tasty, and my girlfriend had some seared tuna tacos that were also good.  My biggest complaint was the price and the so-so service.
