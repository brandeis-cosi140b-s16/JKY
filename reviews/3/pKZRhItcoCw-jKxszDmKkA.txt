The birria was ok, hits the spot.  The waiter was nice and attentive.  The chivo (goat) birria plate is 13.95, I like the fact that the bowl is shallow, because it comes with plenty of "consome", however there just wasn't enough meat served.  I saw a picture of their birria bowl in display on their wall, you can see the meat floating on top of the plate.  On our bowl we couldn't see any meat whatsoever on the top.  Another issue, during our meal we were approached by 2 solicitors selling jewelry and perfume, the perfume guy was super rude.  

Overall I think I would go again because the birria was alright, but I'll probably take it to go
