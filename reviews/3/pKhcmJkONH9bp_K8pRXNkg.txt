They have good food...depending on who's cooking. However, customer service is lacking with our last visit. Husband and I have been patrons for a while and used to live close by. Now, not as close, but will still make the trip. Tonight, hubby and I come in, order to-go (which we usually do), and head back home. We pop in a movie, I grab my shredded beef tacos that are usually meaty inside of crispy taco shell with cheese and lettuce and they are burned to a crisp (way beyond what they should be), split and falling apart with hardly anything inside. Yep, I'm upset, but hey, I have a fish burrito too, so I'll just eat that and be fine. Wrong, fish was entirely overcooked too, inedible. I call, there is a bit of a language barrier, but I think we get it all squared away. I go back down there (about 8 miles one way) thinking that maybe they'd have my order ready, but no, another wait. I've worked in restaurants, has always been customary if a patron wasn't happy with their food, we'd either comp that meal or give them a future meal free, their choice. Of course we'd apologize and replace their food in addition, and definitely making it known they are valuable to our business and that we appreciate them. Mr Leno did replace my food, but it was an upsetting inconvenience to my evening. And I didn't leave feeling like a valued customer.
