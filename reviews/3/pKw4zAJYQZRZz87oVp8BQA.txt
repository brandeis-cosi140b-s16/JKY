I went to this restaurant with fond memories of the past meals I had eaten there. When all was served and done I was tragically disappointed. The waitress had a bad attitude from the start. This was odd because my party came into the restaurant in a great and friendly mood. Throughout the meal her presence was nearly non- existent. She sat and talked with a local at the bar instead of addressing our needs. Despite the poor service all could have been forgiven if the food was as I remembered it.
The menu is quite extensive with fish and meat dishes, but once I saw that there was MOLE sauce, I couldn't entertain any other option.
Chips--light and salty, just the way I like them.
Salsa--served a homemade pica de gallo salsa and another spicier one with roasted tomatoes and chilis. Another complaint I've had about many of the restaurants is how thin the salsa is. This salsa was thick with chunks of veggies and herbs. The flavor was complex with an after-kick of spiciness. Hands down the best salsa I've had ANYWHERE. I could have drank it down like gazpacho.
