Service is great the waiter was wonderful heart an appetizer it was way to pepper hot to eat they should warn people is going to burn their mouth off could not is anything afterwards I'm sure it is good to some people however they should warn you that's going to be absolutely pepper hot could not even eat the dish because of the heat index manager was kind enough to give me my money back however I thought the place was overpriced for the quality of the food
