The tortillas that they use for their chips and tacos are fantastic and some of the best I have ever had.  The rice is good with a perfect amount of cumin.  If you go when the weather is nice you can sit outside right by the lake, and if the kiddos are at home it makes for a romantic night out.  I have been here three times, and although it's not "wow gotta have" it's a safe bet that the food is consistently good.
