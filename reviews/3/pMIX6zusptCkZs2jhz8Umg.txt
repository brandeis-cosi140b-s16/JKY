Two people, two entrees, two appetizers,  and two drinks= $107
Come on now. I don't have any problem with paying this kind of money for dinner other than for "Latin"  don't get me wrong, the food was very good. Just wish I've could've made out the menu. It was so dark you'd think you were in a bat cave.
FOOD- good not great. Weak guacamole very, very far from authentic  Ordered spicy should've ordered xxxxspicy. I make better for only $4.00
Service- great
PRICE- WAY over priced for yuppie ass Mexican food. But it is Scottsdale.
