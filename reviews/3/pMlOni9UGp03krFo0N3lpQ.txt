I had the opportunity to come out for a large dinner and here is a break down of that experience:
1 star for the location, it has great outdoor seating and a really comfortable patio
1 star for the food, it was a large self serve style because we had a special group event, but it was delicious
1 star for the service, kind of sort of, some of the servers were great and some were not so great
