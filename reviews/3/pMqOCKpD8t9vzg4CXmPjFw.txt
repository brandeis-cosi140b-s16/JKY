I've put off reviewing Cantina 1511 for a while. It's one of those upscale Mexican places where a plate of tacos can put you back $20, and I'm just not sure it's worth it. Yes, the tableside guacamole is good, as it always is, but is it any better than what I make at home? If you try to go whenever people like to go out for dinner, there can be a wait and valet parking, which is always a pain. So, I guess what I'm saying is, it's good, but it's not as good as it thinks it is.

But you know when I love going to Cantina? When I've got a hungry crowd to feed. The family style option is a fun way to experience a lot of different things on the menu for not a ton of cash.

PS Get the barbacoa. You're welcome.
