Honestly, this place isn't anything exceptionally special. I expected it to be a bit more upscale for the Arizona Center, but it reminded me of your run-of-the-mill Mexican places you can find everywhere. 
Now don't get me wrong, it was delicious for a lunchtime choice and I'm glad I went because it was tasty but I just wouldn't go back.
For one, the salsa was very chunky. Chunky in a way that it was all tomato, cilantro, onions, etc. But the chips served with were interesting in the fact that they were always hot out of the oven and were long tomale-like shapes rather than poured out of a bag.
I got the Lunch Special #18 and my friends got #20 and #22. Whichever is the chulopa, get that one! Mine was just an enchilada with rice and beans and although it was the cheaper option on the menu, it wasn't exciting. 
I would recommend this place is you're craving just some basic Mexican food and don't have a long lunch hour. I would ALSO suggest this place for HH. I didn't get to drink but they're specials looked bomb!
