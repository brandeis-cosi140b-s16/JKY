Me and my husband live about a mile down the street from this place, no one was in there when we went in, but the people that worked there were very nice! I had 2 cheese enchiladas and my husband had 2 chicken enchiladas, it was nice to get sour cream/guacomole/salad on the side with it. I thought it was pretty good, I mean it wasn't amazing like a 5 star restaurant, but it wasn't bad either, I'd go here again.
