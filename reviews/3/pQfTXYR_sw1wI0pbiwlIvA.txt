First time trying sushi burrito and I wasn't too impressed. Having been raised in Japan, I grew up eating something similar but under a different name. It is called temakizushi (手巻き寿司), a Japanese customized hand-roll. In my opinion, sushi burrito is just more creative name for a customized hand-roll. 

SERVICE
Their "assembly line" was disorganized and inefficient. I understand they just opened last week but I saw one guy grabbing something over another guy's arm. Then a new hire looking through recipe getting in the way of another guy. They should take some notes from Subway and learn to run the line smoothly. 3 people in front of me and I waited over 20 mins to order. Meh.

FOOD
I ordered Mission ($8.95) which comes with salmon, sushi ebi, cream cheese, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, romaine lettuce, yuzu guacamole and tomatillo shiso sauce. Took out the pico de gallo since I can't handle any heat. 

There's definitely some texture, but it had absolutely no flavor. Tortilla strips gave some nice crunch and I liked how they are generous with salmon and ebi. However, even with their yuzu guacamole and tomatillo shiso sauce, a quick dip in soy sauce was necessary. Odd that I only tasted yuzu guacamole on one half of my sushi burrito. Put more sauce please. 

You can totally customize your own in bowl, burrito or nachos. Choose your toppings, protein and sauces. Will try this next time.

CONCLUSION
I paid around $10 (tax and tip included) for a burrito that wasn't filling. Maybe I would've enjoyed my experience more if I didn't wait for so long. I will give another chance in the future but 3 stars for now.
