Food was ok. Portions size were ok for the entrees, wing order not. 6 wings for seven dollars, they should add two more at least for that price. Service was terrible I must say. Don't think I will be back for sure. Slow on drinks, restaurant was not even busy, server not even attentive to our table. They lost out on at least one to two more rounds of drinks from our table, due to lack of service.
