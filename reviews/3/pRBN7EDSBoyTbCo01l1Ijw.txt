The fourth and final stop on the New South BBQ Tour took us to Cocina Latina - and if you've been reading my reviews for any time, you know I've been here more than once.  That means out of four stops, I've eaten at the actual restaurants three times, and in the space occupied by those restaurants all four times.  Crap!

In any case, Cocina Latina is a pretty decent Mexican restaurant, so it wasn't a bad thing that we ended our tour here (actually we ended back uptown, but we stopped eating here).

The serving at this stop was two tacos - one barbacoa (lamb) and one al pastor (pork).  The lamb wasn't bad, especially seeing as I don't really care for lamb, and the pork wasn't really bad either, seeing as I was getting full from all this eating.

What really did it in was that the typical good service at Cocina Latina was overwhelmed right then, trying to keep our chips full, and handle their normal crowd.  That, and the typical drinks they served - whatever they were - weren't really sitting well on everyone's stomach after all the others we had had, so they wanted water, which kept the staff jumping!
