After recieving some coupons in the mail = .99 Fish Taco's, my interest was peeked & I decided to make it my destination on my walk. I got there at lunch time and there was a line halfway into the seating area but it wasnt a long wait to order, maybe 5 min.

I had previously looked at some reviews here and because of THAT, I ordered a small bowl of Chicken Tortilla soup ($2.99) and the before mentioned fish taco (Reg $1.99...wt coupon .99). The Total wt tax came to $4.30.

This is a few steps up from Taco Bell and the plates I saw being served looked really good & healthy. My taco was very small and not a good value at the reduced fare of .99. It was good but the Fish Taco's for .99 at Long John Silvers are way better & bigger. Now when it comes to soup, I am spoiled rotten, as I worked at a condo and the Chef there was a Pro and in fact was once Tommy Lasorda's personal Chef, and the soup this guy made was the MOST AWESOME EVER!!

The Tortilla soup was NOT as good as reviewers made it out to be. First off the portion didnt match the price of $3. I have had Campbell's Chunky Mexican Chk Soup ($1.50) that is a bigger portion for less and packs more overall flavor. It was "OK" at best and did have some nice chunks of chicken but not worth $3.

I'm not writing this place off by any means and will probably go back using it again as a destination on a walk one day and try the Chicken Tortilla Salad. But for value's sake, I could have paid another dollar & gone to lunch at Buffet @ Asia (see previous review here) & had more of a choice of dishes & all you can eat.

Way better than Taco Bell or Del Taco thats for sure!!
