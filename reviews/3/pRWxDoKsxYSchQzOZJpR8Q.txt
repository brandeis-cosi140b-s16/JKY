Coming to a US Taco Bell is always an interesting experience.

First-off, there's no fries in US TB's. I learned that years ago when a group I was with apparently offended an employee by asking for fries supreme. It was like we were attacking a sacred family recipe by wanting ground beef and cheese on fries instead of nachos.

Second, the combos come with a taco, not with a side like you would get in Canada. If you want nachos supreme you have to make a special request.

Third, it's so much cheaper here. This is pretty standard across all fast food in the States. $5 for a Gordita combo here. Over $6 in Canada.

For this restaurant in particular, the service was good and the food came up quite fast. They have a choice of three different Doritos tacos. Hopefully they bring that choice to Canada soon.

Good call by the person who left the tip to swap a Doritos taco into a gordita. Delicious.
