A little late in posting, but I kinda forgot about it.  While waiting for our Dolly Steamboat Cruise, we decided to stop in for a quick bite.  I'd wanted to try the fish tacos, but they weren't able to serve them without cilantro....so scratch that.  Ordered the shrimp instead and it was ok.  It was just fried frozen shrimp.  I didn't care for the fries.  

The service was good and the atmosphere was kinda fun/quirky but next time maybe I'll just pack a lunch.
