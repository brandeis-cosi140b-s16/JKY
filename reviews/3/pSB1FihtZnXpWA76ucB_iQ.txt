4 stars if you want a greasy heart attack. I often do, so I get the grilled pork chimichanga, I think it only has 7,000 calories. 
Patio is awesome as long as you don't let ducks bully you into feeding them your delicious chips. (Beer doesn't help this).
Down to 3 stars because the Sangria sucks, should be called a fruit juice meltdown, blech.
