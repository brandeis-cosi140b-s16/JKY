excellent food excellent server "Ozzie" always empty though fast service, good Margaritas from next dooe, One particular menu note that doesnt make any sense at all and for no reason at all--- some dinner plates come with 3 tacos. (BUT ONLY IF YOU GET FLOUR TORTILLAS) iF YOU ask for crispy shells then they only give you  (2) what kinda crap is that???????? been to thousands of Mexican restaurants and never seen that silly rule......
