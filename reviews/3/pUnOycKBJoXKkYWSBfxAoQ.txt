Okay, I'm not going to be as harsh this time.

I have been here several times since the my barfing incident below.  I strongly suggest that you go during the day if you want Mexi-food.  After dark, the night crew does not put as much care into cooking or service.  Didn't feel so good after the late night meal either. . .

The day crew ain't half bad at all--taco meat is greasy as hell though no matter what time of day you go here.  Nonetheless, if you go here while the sun is up, you're likely to get a satisfying meal for your money.
