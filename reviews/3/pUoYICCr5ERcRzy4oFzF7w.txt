I wish they had their hours written on their front door. Their website says they close at 2:00am on Thursdays, but it's a blatant lie. By 11, they were closing up shop and subtly telling us to get out. 

Besides that, I gotta say that their tortas are quite delicious. I also had a spicy mango margarita. I couldn't taste the mango, but it tasted exactly like alcoholic low-viscous hot sauce.
