The food is excellent; great flavor (Aztec tinga chicken taco, Tlaloc cactus taco, La Sanitsima specialties taco with chicken). The salsa bar was great. The ambiance was fun. The waitstaff were friendly and helpful. The chairs scraping on the floor were annoying. The pink mold in the water container was vomitus. 

I would give the food 4.5-5 stars. Because of the water issue I am bumping it down. That is just gross. 

If you are gluten free, be careful: they use soy sauce in their cactus tacos. (Our waitress was apologetic and made me something else.)

All-in-all, we would come back and just order something bottled and skip the water.
