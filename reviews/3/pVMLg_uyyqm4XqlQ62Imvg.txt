10 years ago I thought very highly of Cabo, but now I feel their food and service is average at best.  I've continued to try this place, always hoping that my experience will trump my previous visit and I've finally decided to give up.  The food is not great.  It's not bad, and it's a cool place to visit since it's a Charlotte staple.  Service here is also not a priority.  I'm learning to appreciate the places that train their staff to always be polite and professional.  This staff really doesn't care about your experience.  Common niceties are uncommon for many of the staff that just want to get you in and out and on to the next.  There are better fish tacos in Charlotte.
