So, Coyote's is your basic Mexican restaurant.  It is certainly nothing special, but I have never had food that I didn't enjoy. I generally ONLY come here because my sister LOVES the place.  With that said....

Two good things about Coyote's:

1 - they serve both salsa and bean dip with your chips (something not every place does).

2 - they have a brand new happy hour menu with roughly 10 cheap appetizer options.   I believe this new happy hour goes from 2 - 5pm.
