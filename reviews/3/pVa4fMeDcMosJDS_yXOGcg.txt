The food is both good and cheap.  Special requests like "hold the onions" or "no cheese" are hit or miss although they will correct it if they bring it out wrong.  Our waitress was great and that's what she did.

The chips are homemade and come out of the kitchen warm and crispy.  Two salsas, one is diced tomatoes and not a lot else but it's refreshing.  The other is a traditional style red salsa with cilantro and a spicy kick.

Ground beef tacos are tangy and the chicken tacos a little runny but taste great.  The real winner however was the steak tacos.  I've asked for soft corn tortillas twice and gotten white flour both times so the kitchen can be a little random.  For the price it's worth a trip, just keep your expectations aligned with the value.  How much can you really complain about $2 tacos...
