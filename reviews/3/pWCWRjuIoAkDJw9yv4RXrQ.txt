We have a teenage relationship of one of us hanging up the phone and then either/or waiting by the lockers to apologize the next day. 

 I order the salad to dissuade the guilt of how frequently I partake.  Salad, beans, double chicken, pico, hot sauce = happy tummy.  They are pretty skimp on the protein for the cost. I order double and get what should be the regular portion.

Then again...maybe my idea of a normal portion is jacked. TBD
