Raul and Theresa's is good, especially if you are looking for a Mexican place that isn't a chain in Avondale/Goodyear. 

The inside is a bit stark and not very warm. Mostly tables and a few booths. It is very popular though. 
I had the pozole to start and rolled tacos for my entree. The pozole was fabulous. It's a huge serving and tons of meat. They serve all the fixings on the side. 

The rolled tacos were good, but needed the guacamole they were served with. I probably wouldn't order them again. 

I will return though to try some other things. 

Be aware, the original location on MC85 is no longer owned by the same family. They sold MC85 and brought the recipes to this location. 
That's right, the "better" "I prefer the original" "I always go to MC85 location" is no longer the same family! 

Enjoy!
