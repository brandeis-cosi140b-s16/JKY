Even at 1$ a taco, the tacos at tres pesos is pretty mediocre. The Tortillas are hard and chewy, and the meat, with perhaps the exception of the pastor is fairly bland.

Our two sides though were pretty solid, the pupusa revuelta was pretty solid with a good crisp skin and the elote tamale was falvorful.
