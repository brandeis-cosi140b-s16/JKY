The food here is mediocre at best. The frozen margaritas on happy hour won't even give you a slight buzz. I had the avocado chicken soup with sour cream. Sour cream was lumpy and smelled bad. Chicken tasted undercooked. The dos Equis was the best part about this place.. Oh and the waiter was super friendly and attentive. If I had to rate him alone I would give him 5 stars. 2 stars for the food and margaritas. 5 stars for the cold beer and waiter! Makes it a 3 star..
