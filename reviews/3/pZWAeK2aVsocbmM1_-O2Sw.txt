I would give 2 stars, but the lady at the drive thru window was super nice.  I had never been here before and thought I'd try it out. I ordered a bean & cheese burrito with sour cream, which is my staple for any bertos type place. I was really disappointed. It seemed like they made a bean burrito then poured milk into it. Burrito soup wrapped in a tortilla. I would expect sour cream and the beans to be thick enough to not be liquid. I dono, maybe they have meat dishes that are good, but I'm vegetarian so this was the only thing I would try here and will not be back. I'll keep Riva's as my go to mexican restaurant. Also, there was no speaker on the drive thru menu, so you just drive up to the window and order there.
