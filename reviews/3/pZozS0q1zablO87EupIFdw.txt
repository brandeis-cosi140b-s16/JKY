Fun atmosphere here for sure. Lots of tequila choices and some good beers as well. Chips and salsa were ok and I loved the tacos fundidos with steak. The fresh guac was excellent. They didn't come around too often on the rounds of drinks as we would have had another brew or three had they been sighted near our table. The cast of Banshee was hanging here and seemed to be regulars.
