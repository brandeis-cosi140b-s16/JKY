We went here on Friday for my birthday and thought the ordering process would be pretty simple, everyone in our group wanted to order an entree but then it got complicated.  We were told this was "tapas style" ordering and that instead of entrees they recommended 2-3 plates PER PERSON. What? We each ended up ordering one thing and sharing it and that was more than enough for the whole table.  I can't imagine if we each got 2-3 THINGS.  It took us probably 30-45 mins just to figure out how to order.  The food was pretty good, spicy but seemed to cool down quickly once left on the table.  They don't bring you many tortillas either for your items. My biggest gripe is that they were out of churros for dessert.  How can you be out of churros?  We settled for the El Fuerte which wasn't as satisfying as a crispy cinnamon sugar churro.
