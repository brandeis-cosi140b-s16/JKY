Like a cleaned up version of Raul and Theresas. Clean and colorful. Food is decent and reasonably priced. Our waiter was polite and efficient but not overly friendly. Try smiling. Also never came back to check on us after serving.

Ample parking. Cute outdoor bar with dance music. 

We like Chevy's or Macayo's better.
