Brightly lit and clean. Good selection but I think they are too pricey for what you get.
I had 2 taco combo with rice and beans. One taco was barbacoa and the other was adobaba(sp?) chicken. The chicken was absolutely awesome....the barbacoa, not so much. The meat looked like a turd. Sorry but that's just what it looked like and the flavor was not there.
The salsa bar and all you can eat chips is great. I loved the salsa verde and the avocado salsas. My GF and daughter both loved the pico. 
So I may be back if I'm in the area but still think they need to check their pricing.
