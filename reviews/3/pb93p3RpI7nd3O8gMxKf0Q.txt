I give this location 3 out of 5 stars for the following reasons:

1.  The owner/manager is a fun person, always friendly and comes out and greets you while you are eating, asks how everything is, and at no other Qdoba have I seen this.  This alone would have earned it 4 stars.

2.  The food is 90% of the time delicious (the other 10% only subpar, and never because the food isn't good, but mostly because it's due to going there during their busiest times, meaning the food is thrown together in a rush, that is all), and they do have good options for vegetarians such as myself and my husband (except I do get irritated when they ASSUME we want meat AFTER we tell them we want a vegetarian burrito or a veggie quesodilla).  This alone would have gotten them 3 stars.

3.  The location of this particular Qdoba, quite honestly, sucks.  The parking lot is small, you can only turn out of it one way (almost always the way we DON'T want to be going haha), but there is a back way out.  However, this back way leads to what looks like a one way street (only 1 car can fit, the parking stalls are all slanted one way) but people always try to turn down it when you are trying to make your own way through, causing traffic backups.  All in all, I still go here, but NEVER during the typical lunch hour (so not between noon and 1:30ish) or typical dinner hour (not as bad as the lunch one, though!).  If you do, you probably won't get a parking spot, and you'll either have to park way on the other side on the street and walk there or find somewhere else to eat a quick lunch.  When it isn't packed, this location is quite convenient and has a overall friendly atmosphere. This alone gets the location 2 stars.

All in all, I love this Qdoba more than the rest; the manager I mentioned always recognizes us and goes out of his way to treat us well, but the location needs to be much better.
