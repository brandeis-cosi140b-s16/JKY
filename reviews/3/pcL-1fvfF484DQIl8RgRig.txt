Former La Taqueria Hispana
Food was okay. It was not the best l've ever had. serving size is 5 star; however chicken brrito was $10. So, for the price I say it was about right. I would rather go to Chipotle in the next block and pay 75% less for 75% less amount of food. There is not a possible way I can eat the whole thing anyway.
Chicken was stewed not grilled. I prefer grilled. My other dislike was the ingredients are really not distibuted evenly, so one end had mostly rice then other end was mostly chicken. 
My husband had tacos and he said pastor was bit dry but okay. Carne asada was good.
