The food was really great (if you got your full order) BUT If your in a hurry, or even on a time schedule this is not the place for you. It took about an hour for them to make 10 to go orders that I emailed and confirmed 30 minutes before I arrived. AND three of my guys didn't get their full order. A real bummer because the food itself was great. Just disappointed it took so long and my guys went without. 
=( 
I would return for a lazy afternoon lunch but not for work. They aren't staffed for it and there was zero sense of urgency. I was not happy that they kept cutting other orders ahead of ours too, so while I was waiting they kept taking and processing new orders ahead of ours.
