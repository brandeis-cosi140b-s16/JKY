I was really really hoping to like this place (reviews that start out this way are never good). It is in a great location for us and I do like the shopping center that it's in. But once you walk through the doors you have to be careful not to get a concussion from the low hanging, steel stairs that you must walk under to access the dining room. The prices are reasonable but the food is not. The waitress was very nice and the chips and salsa were very good. I had two tacos and a burrito and they were not good. My wife had chili reano and the enchilada and both were pretty terrible. Our daughter had a steak Quesadilla but it was nothing worth writing more about. You may want to try it if you're close, hungry and have a Groupon. Otherwise places like La Unica have nothing to worry about.
