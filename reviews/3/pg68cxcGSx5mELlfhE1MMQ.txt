This was my first time going to this restaurant.  It is pretty easy to get to with plenty of parking and pretty cool Hispanic decorations. It was fairly busy and they had several large groups seated. It was not overwhelmingly crowded.  They have a very very large menu, but they were fairly nasty dirty.  It made me want to use a Clorox wipe to clean them.  The people were friendly, not very pushy with the "hurry up and order so we can get you out of here" attitude.  Although,  we kept running out of chips and salsa because our order took forever to come out. (Remember several large groups were there st the same time)  we were told updates and apologized to a couple of times for our delay in the order.  But they should have kept up on the chips and salsa. The food was pretty good. Not overwhelmingly spicy or bland. They do have pretty good flan. I would try it again but maybe during the week.
