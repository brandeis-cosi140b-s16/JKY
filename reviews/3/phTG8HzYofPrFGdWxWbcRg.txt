I am not a fan of Tex Mex food in general. The Mexican food I do like is limited and I am very picky about how it is prepared. It is never by a chain or Tex-Mex place. I never leave a Mexican place and say, "Wow, that was so delish!"(Unless it is by a four or five diamond chef. I know, food snob here) I adore Otro Cafe, Barrio Cafe, and Frank and Lupes and that is about it. My guess it is a dairy and or pork thing. Well, I decided to try this place since it is very close to my new home and I needed sinus cleaning spicy one night. I have to admit I did not hate it. Ha!

The experience did not start well since no one greeted me for over five minutes. Awkward standing there for that long for sure! To kill time I used the bathroom. Weird though that I still waited afterwards for like two minutes after returning from the Restroom. They need a hostess here. Thankfully, things went better after that and the service was great. The waitress was very nice! I had to knock off a star for that though because of first impressions and all and the fact a guest should never wait that long. ( Especially since another worker saw me and did not offer to help me.) 

Now onto the food. The menu here is huge. They have all types of meals and food even some Gringa foods and breakfast. They have homemade pancakes on the menu. I will have to come back to try breakfast. I was shocked to realize I really liked their Chips and Salsa. I am super picky about salsa and I found theirs to be Delish! The Guac was just typical and nothing to write home about, and my Chile Relleno was good but again nothing ground breaking. Still a good find in the neighborhood when the rare occasion Mexican Food craving hits me. 

I liked the colorful,coolly painted and tiled decor.  They also did not have on loud music when I was there which I really appreciated.

To conclude, I am still shocked that I kind of liked this place.
