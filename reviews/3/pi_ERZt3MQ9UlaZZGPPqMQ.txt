Seems to be a lot of pretty brutal reviews on here, I honestly don't think it's that bad of a place.  I mean, it's fast food Mexican.  I've been here a number of times, and although I prefer Qdoba or Chipotle, this place really isn't that bad.  My wife, daughter, and I went again last night.  I had a chicken burrito, my wife had a chicken quesadilla, and my daughter had the Tot Quesadilla.

My burrito was hot and tasted good.  I thought it was a good size, no different than the previously mentioned alternatives.  I do like how they mix everything up before rolling up the burrito.  At the other places, it seems that you get splotches of ingredients as you make your way through the burrito.  I was also pretty excited that they had a tot quesadilla.  Essentially a small quesadilla for $2.25.  Worked perfect and my 2 year old loved it.

Don't go here expected gourmet, hit Qdoba or Chipotle if they are nearby.  But don't be afraid to try Panchero's the next time you're looking for a quick burrito.
