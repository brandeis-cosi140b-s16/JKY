Since my last check in here, I have been here almost every other weekend for lunch dates with friends and family. Although the quality of the food is great, I really wish that they would let people know ahead of time that the Al Pastor won't be ready until a certain time. Especially since their Wednesday special consists of an Al Pastor burrito. You can't just expect people to come in and not ask for it if it is advertised, or at least clearly stated that it won't be ready until an hour or so after opening. Isn't this something you could be preparing before you open in the morning? It is a delicious item, and my favorite at that, just wish preparation and timing was a tad bit different.
