The filling was super tasty. I love the crunchy kim chee and bit of spice. The filling could have been more uh...full.
The tortilla was kind of dried out.
The sweet dough was tasty.
I'd go back again, but I'm not head over heels.

Update: I've been back...several times. The owner is passionate about what he does and follows yelp closely. He remembered me and asked about the dry tortilla. Apparently some like them more crispy.

I'm not sure if he is doing anything different, but my tortillas have been moist. (For me? No clue. Or maybe I'm hitting more freshly opened packages.)

Anyway, good guy. Good food. I'm now a regular. :-)
