I like Roberto's Taco Shops a lot. I look forward to Wednesday nights when I can get a couple of $0.99 chicken tacos. And an order of three rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese. Those are a little more but oh so worth it. This has become a Wednesday night tradition for me. This past Wednesday was no different. What was different about this latest visit was the location. I came to the shop on Russel Road at Boulder Highway as I was in the area. I got my usual order as outlined above and eagerly awaited my mid week treat. The shop was busy this night as is often the case on cheap taco night so it took a few minutes to get my food. I was never disappointed with what I ate though there were some differences from what I am used to. The rolled tacos with guacamole were fine. Crispy and all. The guacamole seemed thin and bland compared to other Roberto's locations. The cheese was pleantiful but not at all melted. The tacos had more chicken than what I get at other shops. That was nice. They were actually pretty solid. What I did not care for as much is the amount of black pepper in the chicken. It was a little heavy handed for me. Regardless, I still enjoyed my meal. My reasoning for a 3-star rating is for the restaurant itself. It seemed dark. Dimly lit if you will. With the area it is in and some of the scary looking people around, I felt a little uncomfortable. Also, when I was ordering, I saw young girl of about 4 or 5 running around the back of the kitchen barefoot. I'm pretty sure she was the child of one of the workers. Perhaps the manager even. But I also fairly certain it is not OK. A child should not be roaming a restaurant at all. Let alone doing it barefoot. Surel there was an office she could have sat in if they had no place else for her. I don't know. That just bothered me. Had I not been hungry and this not been the most convenient Roberto's at the time I would have left.
