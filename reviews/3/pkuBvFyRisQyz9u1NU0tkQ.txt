La Fonda serves up no surprises, which is for some, exactly what they want in a Mexican restaurant. They have your standard array of chimichangas, fajitas, enchiladas, burros, and tacos, just to name a few, in your basic meats with a smattering of vegetarian options. Flavors aren't particularly bold, spicy, or stand out in my mind, but the food itself tastes decent. 

We started off with the obligatory chips and salsa. The chips were freshly made, light and crispy. There were 2 different salsas to dip your chips in, which I appreciated. There was a chunky mild salsa, and a more uniform blend of spicy salsa. Out of the two, the chunky salsa had more flavor for me. As for entrees, I tried some of the chicken chimichanga and had the spinach enchiladas. The chicken chimichanga was what you'd expect in your typical chimi: shredded marinated chicken, crispy, deep fried outer tortilla. The chicken was juicy, and it was served with guacamole, beans, cheese, and rice. The spinach enchilada was OK. It had a good amount of spinach with sauteed onion, with your choice of enchilada sauce (Red, green, or fundido). I had it with the red sauce. I didn't see much of the sauce, and perhaps the kitchen was compensating for this by using a ton of cheese in my plate. In addition to the cheese on top of the enchilada, there seemed to be an equal amount of cheese to beans and rice in my sides! For the dairy-inclined, you would be in paradise!

Our server was attentive and friendly. Drinks were refilled as needed.

The decor was probably the most distinctive element of the restaurant. Remembering how it used to look back when this building housed Chuy's, La Fonda's improvements have turned what used to be a divey, beachy, beer-guzzling bar into a warm welcoming Southwestern atmosphere. 

So if you're looking for a "safe" but not particularly inventive cuisine, in a cute scenic atmosphere, La Fonda is your place.
