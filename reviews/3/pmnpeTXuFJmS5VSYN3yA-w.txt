Quite good. Reasonable prices. Near Stratosphere.

You couldn't perform any kind of surgery in this place.....it's kinda grimy (root word being grim).....so get take-out. 
No one's wearing latex gloves or anything. 
(Hmmm, operating-room-motif is emerging, but then again, most kitchens have become like operating rooms.)

Tacos are a little over $1. 
(Tacos el Gordo take a hint!!!!  $2 is too much for a damn taco!!!!!)
They have exotic meats like tongue and belly and head and others fleshy parts. Food is tasty no question.

Would I go back? Unlikely.
If I was tired and didn't want to travel too far? Probably.
Would I admit that I even went there? Not likely.

So forget you read this review.
