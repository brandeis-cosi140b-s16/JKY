Working my way through my Phoenix trip, my next dinner out was to meet yet another "old" friend from high school. This one, I hadn't seen in almost 21 years and thanks to FB we got reconnected. 

MacAyo's is another local Mexican chain restaurant. This location is the newest probably open about 8 or 9 years now. Long ago, the location on Central Avenue was all the rage, but like any chain, sometimes growth does not necessarily equate to great.

My friend and I shared a cheese crisp. I like the one here better than the one at Garcia's. I also had a shredded beef taco and black beans and rice. The taco had much better flavor than Garcia's and the beans were good. We each had a house margarita and I only drank half. Not because I was getting sauced, but because it was kind of nasty. 

All in all decent, but not blow me away good. Might come back but there are several other great Mexican food restaurants in the Valley that I will have to visit next time. Sadly with mom living in Sun City West, the schlep to get to some of these places is a bit too great.

The waiter again was nice and accommodating. My friend and I had such a great time getting reconnected we also closed down this restaurant and then sat in front chatting till around midnight. This became the second night I did the tip toe walk through my mom's house hoping not to wake anyone up...
