this is a review for my take out order.
I ordered 2 chicken tacos,2 steak tacos and 2 fish tacos.
they have a salsa bar but I guess I was not aware that they are NOT a Mexican taco place, because all the salsas they offer were like tomato based salsas for chips.
I was expecting salsas like the one you get from authentic Mexican taquerias,oh well.
alright ,both the chicken and steak tacos were okay,not bad but just ok.
however the fish tacos were great ! i like the mango salsa they put on top,it has a hint of sweet from the mango and a kick from the jalapeno! yum!!
