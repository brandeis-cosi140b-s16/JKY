Pasquals newest location is predictable. It's the Pasquals formula - if you like the Hilldale location, you will be happy with the E. Washington location. It's classic American TexMex, not Mexican not Texas BBQ. 

It seems like they are still working out some service kinks. You have to see the hostess to sit in the bar...'but when you do, the bar tender is also your waiter?  The waiter/bartender wasn't familiar with the menu. 

I had the huevos rancheros and they were protectively serviceable. Dining companion ordered a chicken quesadilla, it was stuffed with shredded chicken and looked good. 

I'm not thrilled that much of the menu requires extra up-charging. The waiter will ask if you want chips and salsa... You'll get charged for that. You want sour cream... You'll get charged for that. 

Pasquals is. Welcome establishment to the near E. Wash corridor. Nothing special but decent and welcomed.
