I go to this place every so often. It's on Mill Avenue. Mill Avenue sucks. Go there expecting to be surrounded by abnoxious douchebags, revving crotch rockets, and whack no talent street performers. Every time I go down Mill I find something to be angry about. But that's not the point. I'm not reviewing Mill here. I'm reviewing this taco shop. 

The tacos here are bomb. The fish tacos are particularly fresh and tasty. The ground beef tacos are rediculously good. It's so hard to find a good ground beef taco. It's like, since Taco Bell invented the 69 cent ground beef taco all the sudden the more sophisticated taco shops started acting like they were too good for ground beef. They act like ground beef is plebeian or something. Well, ground beef is not plebeian. It's delish. Shredded beef is gross. It's dry and chewy and has no flavor. Thank you, Hippie's Cove, for having ground beef tacos. 

Sure, Hippie's Cove has a horrible location. If they just picked a cool off Mill location somewhere quiet and out of the way I'd probably get tacos there twice a week. 4 stars.
