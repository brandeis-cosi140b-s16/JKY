The 3 stars is for the food! I love Chipotle and eat here often, different locations, but se great food. We order salads, quesadillas, and burritos. 
I'm giving this review 3 stars for the location. The location was clean and served the same good food to be expected at any Chipotle location but.... The service here was rude on our visit yesterday. My brother in law went in with 6 orders and the employees rolled their  eyes and complained to him. The orders were not complicated. I just think it really puts a bad taste in your mouth when the employees are rude to your face.
