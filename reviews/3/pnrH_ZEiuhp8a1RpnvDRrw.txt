Matador Restaurant was not great but the food was good.  I ordered the beef enchilada dinner.  Before my entree arrived I was given the standard chips & salsa.  Before I could get the bottom of the chip bowl my dinner was already on it's way over.  Service was prompt and fast.

The enchilada dinner left much to be desired for the price I paid (nearly $12).  It was no better than your local hole in the wall joint where the same meal will be much cheaper.

The restaurant itself was pleasantly odd.  It looks kind of like a Mexican themed diner with a bar attached at the other end.

Matador is not a place I would go out of my way to visit and would not top my list of places to take friends and family but if you're already downtown and want to hang with friends and family go ahead and give Matador a shot.  Just expect to pay a bit more than your local place.
