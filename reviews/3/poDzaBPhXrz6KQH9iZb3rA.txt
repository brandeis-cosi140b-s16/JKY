Pretty under-whelmed by this place and surprised by the reviews.  Ordered the fish tacos and a combo plate with .  Both dishes were pretty overpriced, in our opinion.  

The fish in the fish taco was pretty dinky sized and mostly fried breading.  You can't really mess up fish tacos though, so taste wise it was fine.  Shredded cabbage and a lot of sauce.

Combo plate again was on the small side and just ok.

Chips were pretty good, but I wasn't a fan of the salsa.  It was pretty thin and a little bit tangy/sweet?  I couldn't quite place the taste, but i wasn't a huge fan.

It wasn't horrible.  It was just kind of disappointing and kind of overpriced.  Perhaps we ordered wrong.  If we ever give it another try, I think we'll go with the Carne Asada fries and burrito.
