Part of what I enjoy most when traveling is trying new food. I had wanted to try Dicks Hideaway for a few years and finally got there tonight. My husband are light eaters...especially at dinner. We had intended on just ordering the Carne Adovada. However, when we got there and grabbed the tiny two top facing the wall(the place is small), I noticed the menu noted "ABSOLUTELY no split plates". Did they mean they won't split a plate in the kitchen or we couldn't share a dish? When I asked the server, I was told that they would charge us $5 if we chose to share. Some restaurants charge for split plates because soup or salad come with the main course. That certainly was not the case here. So, we chose to order the Skewers to avoid the ridiculous sharing charge. The portions are insane. And because we are staying at a resort, it's not like we can take leftovers for tomorrow. In hindsight, we should've paid the $5 fee, shared the one dish. The Carne Adovada was tasty. The skewers were terribly boring, bland, and the poor shrimp were over cooked. There's plenty of better food in Phoenix/Scottsdale so I'm a bit confused over their high yelp rating. For me, it was an OK meal but not even close to mind-blowingly good or worth the price.
