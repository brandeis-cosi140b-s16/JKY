Update 3/12/15 
I bring every visitor who comes to town here. Last night was the first night I did not feel welcomed: 

2 of us walked in about 6pm, and the hostess asked if we had a reservation. "No....do we need one for 2 people?" (looking around at the half-empty restaurant.)

 "Uh, yeah kinda," she snottily retorts. "I guess you can sit at the bar or one of the high tables." 

Then she reluctantly seated us at one of the many empty high tables. in a very exposed, uncomfortable spot where we got rustled and bumped every time someone came by.

During the entire hour plus we were there, the booths never did fill up nor did the other high tables. I expect better, more accommodating service. "No reservation? No problem!" would have been a better answer. She left a bad taste in my mouth.

I almost don't want to write a review, so that I can keep this my own secret place. Loved everything. Fantastic service, starting in the parking lot and ending with a personal visit from the chef. They made the guac and margaritas at the table fresh for us. All organic and gmo free. Great flavors, great prices. I've never had flan that I liked before, until we tried the chef's grandmother's recipe. Yum! A little hard to find, just go to the north valet parking lot entrance of the strip club...open 24 hours. I will be back! 


(The only thing I wish was that the TVs not be in the dining room...bar is understandable,  but they distract from the lovely red silk wallpaper and ambiance of the dining room)
