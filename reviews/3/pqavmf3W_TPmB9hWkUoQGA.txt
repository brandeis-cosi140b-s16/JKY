Pasqual's is reasonably priced, well prepared tex-mex fare. The burritos are well seasoned and ingredients are distributed throughout (so you're not just getting the "sour cream" bite, then the "bean bite", etc).

Their tortilla chips are great, thin and crispy, though perhaps a little on the salty side. Their salsa -- however, is a little bit watery for my tastes.

Having been there a few times -- I can say there is some variation in their cooking staff depending on when you come in. On two occasions my food would be a '4', but on another it was a '2' in quality. 

Weekend brunch seems to be when their best chefs are in house so if you are going to try to catch them at their best, that'd be the time to do it!
