I do like the whole "Welcome to Moe's" thing said loudly whenever you walk into one of their restaurant locations. It is a nice differentiating aspect of the place. Though I do think Coldstone or is it Marble Slab provides a similar loud greeting upon entering one of their stores too.  Hey, hit both places and feel important for the rest of the day! 

Atmosphere - Narrow, dark, friendly. 

Food - I had a burrito bowl.  I am not sure what the official name is for this dish here but I know for sure it's not 'Joey Bag of Bowls'.  The dish is basically a burrito w/out a shell.  The one I had this day was okay but not spectacular like say Qdoba...but all right. To me, Moe's is not as fresh tasting as the Q or even Chipotle for that matter...but it fits the bill. 

Service - From the greeting received when you arrive to the interaction during the ordering process, Moe's always feels friendly. 

Price - A burrito bowl and drink comes in at just above $8. Not too bad for a filling lunch. Don't forget the drink refills are free. 

Overall - Moe's does the job of satisfying you when you are looking for a decent burrito and friendly service.
