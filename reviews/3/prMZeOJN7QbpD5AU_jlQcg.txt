Not bad. Not amazing or anything but not bad. 
The good: 
very friendly service
fish tacos!
tortilla chicken soup was pretty awesome
They have vanilla coke!
The not so good:
My chicken burrito.. I can't remember which one I ended up going with, had tons of quac in it.. I like guac, but I couldn't taste anything else in the burrito. So meh.
Wasn't really impressed with the salsa. I love spicy salsa, but I also want it to have more flavor than JUST the pepper.
Probably will return for more of that tasty soup and taco. :)
