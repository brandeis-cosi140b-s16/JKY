Pretty good for airport food! I had fish tacos and they were definitely fresh and tasted good. There was also a decent amount of fish in the tacos. I wish it came with guacamole though, that would have made them a lot better. Also, they're are a bit on the smaller side so if you're really hungry, one order may not suffice. Luckily, I only needed a light lunch, and these tacos hit the spot. I think the tacos have the least bang for your buck compared to the burritos or the bowls (I could get a lot more food at Chipotle for the cost of the two tacos I got), but I was really craving tacos so I went for it. However, I would come back if I was ever in Phoenix again.
