It's odd like others have said. The food used to be amazing and they used to be really generous with the meat. Last 2 times I have gone the food quality wasnt the same (compared to the last 5 years I've been going here)

We told the manager what she thought of the meat portion (really small for a bowl) and she said rudely "that will be $2 extra for double meat". Double meat? 

Anyways, used to be better. The old Chipotle would have been 10 stars!
