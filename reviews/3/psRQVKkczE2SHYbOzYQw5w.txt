Wasn't impressed but not bad. I understand I'm paying premium for the grain free. They were out of fries so ended up with chips and salsa. The salsa was good flavorful with some heat.   Ive been twice and had the salted dulce de leche shake the first time and horchata the 2nd time. Shake was really good burger was ok (extra for caramelized onions and Niman ranch bacon but in n out is cheaper and tastes almost the same.... The horchata was good very heavy ice.

If I go again I want to try the mexican dishes.
