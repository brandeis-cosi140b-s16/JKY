Nice clean place in a strip mall with quick and friendly service. I came for some fry bread and ordered the setvers favorite with beans and beef red chili. It was served in lightning speed and looked perfect with a nice topping of lettuce and cheese. Wow, was all I.could think after my first bite as it was a soggy mess and very hard to find any beef. The beans were like soup and the red chili was tasty but also like soup which in turn turned the fry bread to a sticky mush, not an appetising meal. With all the good ratings along with the flavor of the chili I will be back to try again. I hope it was just a bad day and will be great next time.
