A friend and I had a hankering for some good Mexican food, and, after consulting Yelp, we ended up at Los Compadres. This place was not really what I was imagining when entering a Mexican restaurant. This place is very casual, walk up to the counter to order, seat yourself kind of place. I felt like the prices were a little higher than what I would expect for a place like this, but they weren't ridiculous. I ordered a machaca enchilada and a cheese crisp. I was delivered a cheese enchilada and cheese crisp. I told the people up front and they brought me the one I ordered. The cheese enchilada was actually better than the machaca, which was kind of tough and nothing special. The cheese crisp was a bit on the small size (not your typical pizza pan affair) and was overly crisp... almost burnt. It was alright, but nothing special. My friend didn't love her food either. It wasn't bad, but I probably wouldn't return.
