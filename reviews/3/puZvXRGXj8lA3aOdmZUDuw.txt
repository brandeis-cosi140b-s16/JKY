So, I went over to the place which is in my neighborhood - figuring even mediocre mexican food is still pretty good.  And that is pretty much what I got.

The food that I had was decent, not great not horrible, but very serviceable.  The chips with salsa were quite good, and they even broke out the spicy green salsa which was a good bit spicier but not as flavorful.  The tacos al pastor (marinated pork) were fine, but as is the case often with those tacos, a bit dry.  The sides of rice and beans gave me plenty to eat.  The beer was fine, and if I had known the dos equis was only 3 dollars a bottle I would have stuck with that rather than the negra modelo.

In terms of service, I sat at the bar and was well served by my waitress amoung others.  Everyone was quite friendly and helpful.  That said, the meal did take a loooong time to come out, especially from a not quite full restaurant.  They kept me happy with chips, salsa, beer and conversation so Im not complaining too much.  I really liked the casual but friendly vibe.

The prices are fine, but I didnt find them to be ridiculously cheap as another poster said.  I am new to charlotte but would pay the same type of price in any taqueria in brooklyn.

So, overall it wasnt a memorable experience, but even still it was alright and Ill probably be back to try some other plates since it is in the neighborhood.
