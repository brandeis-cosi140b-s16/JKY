I've eaten here many many times. I love Mexican food. Garcia's has a reputation slightly ahead of let's say, Manuel's or Pancho's, right? I love that they give you bean dip with your nachos and chunky salsa. I love that you can sit by the window and people watch while you eat. It IS loud in here, only because the mall is right outside. You can order a la carte and it's super cheap. So why am I giving it three stars? The last time I went with my husband and family and for some reason, I'm the only one in the group who got a minor case of food poisoning. When I get food poisoning, I'm gonna yelp about it. I was the only one who had chicken tortilla soup. I had to sit down on the bench outside the restaurant for ten minutes for fear it would come up. My skin felt like it was on fire. That's the only time it happened but since I've eaten there before just fine and love the atmosphere, I'm willing to return.
