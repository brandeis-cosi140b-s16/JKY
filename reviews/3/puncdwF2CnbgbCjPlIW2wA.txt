ate here saturday night.  food was pretty good.  we were greated promptly by a very friendly server who set up a table for our party of 8.  baskets of chips and dishes of salsa were delivered and we were given time to check out menu, as it was first visit for most of us, and server very helpful when I asked her to describe the different tortas on menu.  boyfriend and his brother got the cubana which had ham, cheese and pork, looked good and he had jamaica agua fresca.  i ordered the trevy which was grilled chicken breast, ham, cheese, pineapple, avocado, lettuce, tomato, very good along with aguas frescas de limon, which was blended with ice so it was like a slush, the best ever.  boyfriend's mother ordered the chiles rellenos plate which came with generous sides of rice and beans.  the kids really enjoyed the chips and salsa and their cheese quesadillas.  boyfriend's sister in law and her sister got bean burros which actually looked like the beans were homemade, nice combination of creaminess and whole beans.  will definitely go back.
