Pretty standard Chipotle. 

What put this particular location on edge is that they USED to give a free drink to students (with student ID) who purchased $5 or more (pretty much all purchases since the price of a burrito starts at $5.85). I tried this a few weeks ago and they no longer honor it. Honestly, as a poor college student attending UNLV, when I would be on campus deciding where to eat, the free drink pushed me to eat here. Now that it's gone, they might be seeing less business, well from me at least.
