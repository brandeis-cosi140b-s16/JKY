Went in specifically for the 5.99 taco deal advertised online.  Went in and they would not honor it...said it was wrong and deal was now 6.99.  I pulled up "their" website and showed it to them...still, no remedy.  The food was good and price was decent, but I think they should have honored the price advertised and change it later.  That would have been good customer service.  Other than that, no other major complaints.  I was though, reminded that they were closing in half an hour when I told them I would be dining in.
