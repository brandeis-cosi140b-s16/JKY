Had never eaten at this particular Del Taco location before. Got my usual: the Del Combo Burrito with fries. The food tasted as it should, although if I'm being picky I would like the cheese inside the burrito to be melted... it was just kind of a clump of cold, shredded cheese. Some of the fries were a little on the crunchy side, but most were still soft inside and still good. You get a lot of fries in the medium! Some of the tables needed to be wiped. It was a pretty good lunch though.
