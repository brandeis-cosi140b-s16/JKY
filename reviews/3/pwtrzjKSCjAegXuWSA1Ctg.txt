The place was clean and the guy who took my order was friendly.  

I really liked the salsa bar.  They had a decent selection of salsas that were very different from the typical "Bertos" restaurant salsas.  I mixed the hot and the medium which was really good.  The salsa were definately made fresh.  

I ordered the bean and cheese burrito and shredded beef taco.  The burrito was a good size and hot.   The beans were okay, if I didn't use the salsa with every bite I would say they would have been a little bland.  The taco was great!  Their taco shells are exactly the way I like them, crispy but thin.  

This place reminded me a lot of Senor Taco.  The salsa was similar and they also used the white Monterey jack cheese.   

My only complaint is the prices are slightly high if you order a la carte but I would eat here again and recommend it to a friend.
