I have been a loyal Some Burros customer for at least 20 years.  My kids don't know that other mexican food exists.
We recently moved closer to where the San Tan location is located and we dine there often.
Over the years, we have noticed changes, small ones, but we have noticed.  We have noticed that the portions seem to be getting smaller and the prices seem to be going up.

Tonight, we dined at the San Tan location and really noticed these changes.  Ordering the same thing we always do, we noticed that we received less food and paid about $4 more than we have in the past.  

We ordered a cheese crisp and it was significantly smaller than in the past and there was hardly any cheese on it.  The side of refried beans was smaller than in the past as well.  I swear the burros are shrinking, too.  

While it is great that they are offering breakfast and alcohol for those that want it, are the rest of us paying the price for the new offerings?  And the "real" plates and flatware as well?  Losing the waste of the styrofoam plates is a plus for the environment, but I think that the increased cost of using the real stuff is being passed on to the consumer.  I also think that it takes away from the fast food nature of the place.  

Don't get me wrong, I love Some Burros and I won't stop going there.  But honestly, it is going to be less frequent if I get less and have to pay more.
