On our Vegas trip we decided to check out the Hard Rock Hotel. It's supposed to be a real cool place to hang.

There were a bunch of clubs to go to but there were expensive. We had some cocktails and found the Pink Taco for a meal. Can't believe that name.

Well it was so so Mexican food, there are better places in Portland but it hit the spot as we were really hungry. We both had chicken fajitas and while it was good, there was too much food to eat. Service was really good.
