Serious mixed feelings on Diego's, almost gave it 4 stars but since I personally don't feel like the food is very authentic I have to give it three. They have good specials, Monday and Thursday is half priced house margaritas (house includes a bunch of flavors including mango, guava, coconut, raspberry and more, not just lime - woohoo!!). Tuesdays they do 99 cent house margs and discounted tacos. The food is decent and the menu has all of there gluten free options labeled. I went with a bunch of girlfriends and we split the queso fundido, empanadas (gluten free), and nachos with chicken (gluten free). The apps were good, I would pass on the guacamole though as it tastes kind of fake. Basically, go and get some margs and free chips and salsa Monday, Tuesday, or Thursday and you won't be unsatisfied.
