This place was ok.  Very basic, bare bones, authentic type Mexican restaurant.  Good chips and salsa.  We each had two margaritas.  The first ones took a long time to get to us, but they were good.  The second ones were soooooo stong!  We could hardly drink them....tasted like pure tequila!  I like me a strong margarita, but wow!  I had the Chili Relleno.  Good but extra greasy.  BF got the steak fajitas which he loved!  Our server was really friendly though and the prices are very reasonable.  I'm sure we'll go back.
