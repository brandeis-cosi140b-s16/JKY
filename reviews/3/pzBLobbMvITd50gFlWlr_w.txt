I'm feeling bad about the reviews that came before mine, but my honest review is that this place is just 'meh.'

I was there last night (which was a Tuesday) for a meeting - we had some drinks and I ordered dinner... service was decent; not great.  Food was the same - I had a bean burrito with a side of guac - it was fine.  Some of the others at the table took advantage of their 'dollar taco' menu.  I think it's part of happy hour that you can get your choice of chicken or steak tacos for 1 buck each - not bad!

I didn't start with the chips and salsa because when I do that I can never stop, but from experience, i know their chips and salsa are pretty good.  

Go for drinks, especially if you're craving Corona with some chips and salsa - the atmosphere is fine, and it works for small groups too.  It's a decent chain restaurant that is pretty consistent in giving you standard Mexican fare.  Go with just 'meh' expectations and you'll be fine.
