I think Maria Maria is getting some bad reviews because it is still working out the kinks. It is a newer restaurant with a chain type feel yet my wife and I have enjoyed it the few times we have eaten here. 

It definitely has a cooler feel than most chain type restaurants with good music (not only on mix but also some good live contemporary mariachi bands). The food is OK, this is what I mean about working out the kinks. We have had overall good food but twice have had cold food and once, after 40 minutes, they came to the table saying they realized they were out of what we ordered. 

I am sort of picky but for a luxury Mexican food place they could do a better job in the kitchen. With that being said I will eat here again because they have some excellent dishes (steak fajitas) and GREAT margaritas (the problem is they are 10 bucks each).
