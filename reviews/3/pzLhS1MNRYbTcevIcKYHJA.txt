This wasn't the greatest place to get food at but it had your typical touristy fare that satisfies the majority. Good location right outside of PH to people watch and to see the fountains. They have misting machines at every table outside which is kind of a pain if you're a girl with frizzy hair(I am). The inside and outside was so extremely loud so talking to your friends that you're there with is next to impossible.
