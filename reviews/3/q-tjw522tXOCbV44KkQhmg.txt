I have been at this location 10 times or more and normally would give 5 stars but their service hasn't been very good the past few visits.  On this visit my food sat on the counter for more than 10 mins as I watched an employee walk by it several times making no attempt to bag it.  It took me saying something to get them moving.   Food was cold when I got it.  Hopefully they fix the service issue because I love Rubios
