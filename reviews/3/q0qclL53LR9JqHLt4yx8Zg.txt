Oops. Not a good visit this time. Like I said in my past reviews, I eat here every week and sometimes twice in a week. Today I got an employee that didn't fit the mold set the many employees before this one. 

Not only was she not concerned about taking my order correctly, running my credit card correctly, she simply didn't care about fulfilling orders correctly. Sorry to change my stars.
