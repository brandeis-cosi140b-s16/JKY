Tamales... without attitude! 

Not an easy place to find, I drove by several times... keep your eyes open or bring a friend. The "store" is just that... small area with a chalk board menu that ( based on the amount on dust on the sill ) changes allot. I was greeted by a genuinely attractive and extremely pleasant woman that was eager to help. 

Their menu includes many different types of Tamales.....7 different types of Meat combinations, 4 Types of Vegetarian, 4 Types of Vegan and 3 types of "Dessert" Tamales. Each tamale is $2.00 6 for $11.00 or 12 for $22.00. Frozen & ready to heat and eat! 

** NOTE: as of my writing, no debit or credit cards accepted! 

I opted for the Chicken with green chile, Green corn and cream cheese, Beef red and pork red. For dinner tonight I had the Chicken Green Chile and the Green Corn and cream cheese..

First let me say,, the masa is AMAZING.. fluffy, lots of flavor.. the best I've ever eaten.. the chicken filling however... not to my liking.. the dark meat chicken filling reminded me of a pot pie filling... OK... just not great. 

The green corn and cheese... was a different story. Fantastic, tons of corn, chiles and cream cheese. I LOVED it... the whole tamale was a big fluffy yummy tamale!!! I didn't even use the salsa I made.. the favors alone were enuf. 

I look forward to trying the rest of my purchases, but right now... I recommend that you at least stop by, pick up a few and try them... I'm sure that you'll find something you really enjoy.
