I had been here once before, and today after walking to Chipotle and seeing a line out the door, I thought I'd venture here again to give it another try, and support a local business.

Well, service both visits is OK. You kind of have to walk all the way into the restaurant to talk to somebody and get seated. While I understand that they're a small operation, I'd kind of expect that somebody gets up and comes to me when I walk in the door, not make me hunt around trying to figure out who to talk to.

This time, I got 2 tacos - both vegetarian. I do appreciate their decent number of vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. One was Soyrizo, and the other was Rajas con Papas (peppers and potatoes). Sadly, the tacos didn't come with much more than that. 

The corn tortillas were great, slightly moist, and warm - and properly doubled up for structural stability like a proper Mexican restaurant would do. The ingredients were cooked just right. But, the mouth-feel and complexity were lacking. Overall, the tacos were quite dry, which I recall being an issue in my previous visit with both dishes we got, and kind of overly simple and limited in ingredients.

I finished one taco, then asked for salsa for the soyrizo to see if it would make a difference. It certainly helped, but I don't think it was the right sauce for the taco. It could use something more - a bit more garlic, a bit more cream, perhaps some cheese (as an option, for non-vegans). I don't want it to be dripping, but I want there to be something to counter-act the dryness and blandness. I want a properly-paired salsa to come on them by default, not as me having to ask for it and picking the wrong type. I want some kick!

I made my suggestions to the server, and I'm making them here as well. I think this place has great potential, and is still way better than Patron across the street. But, it certainly has room for improvement as well.
