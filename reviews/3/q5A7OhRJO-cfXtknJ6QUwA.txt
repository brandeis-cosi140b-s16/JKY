Tee Pee used to be one of the best Mexican restaurants in the city, but upon recently revisiting, they're no longer a stand out. Expect traditional, Sonoran-style Mexican food that's good but not great. If you're in the area craving some Mex, I wouldn't tell you to avoid it, but I won't be rushing back here any time soon...they're not much better than some Mexican restaurant chains.
