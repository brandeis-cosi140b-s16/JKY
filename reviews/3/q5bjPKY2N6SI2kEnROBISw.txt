I order chipotle 2-4 times a week for the office and have very few complaints for this location. Today when I put in the order the lady told me they were out of sliced jalapeños but she could give me a whole one that I could chop up (at work??) Who has knives at their office??? It was so much fun using a plastic knife to dice up a jalapeño for my boss. Also, my burrito was cold and soggy. Next time the guys want chipotle I'm gonna take a pass and go somewhere else.
