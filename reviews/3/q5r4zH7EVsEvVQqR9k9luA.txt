Definitely nothing wrong with this location per se. 

Standard Chipotle decor, food and quality of food. I've never had a bad experience coming here and I have to admit I frequent Chipotle quite often. (We don't have this chain in Hawaii and there's just something about it that keeps me coming back for more.)

I'm a fan of the chicken burrito bowl with brown rice (with my tortilla on the side sometimes) with extra lettuce and corn salsa yummm!

My only gripe is the parking lot. It takes quite a few twists and turns to get into the parking lot from Sunset and once in the lot, it's a little narrow so I usually like parking further away and walking those few extra steps.
