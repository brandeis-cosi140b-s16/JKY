The Matador must be a Phoenix landmark for a reason. My guess is location, location, location. They've been serving better-than-average Mexican classics to hungry bankers, construction workers and sports fans for over 25 years. We've been here after games twice and I can say there is definitely better Mexican food out there. But the food was tasty -- especially the chips and hot salsa. On the down side, service is poor and the highlight of the dark, 70's decor is the kitschy matador mural on the wall.
