went in before going to see le reve @ the wynn. came right when happy hour started (which is only in the bar area).

favorite part - they give you a huge bottle of water for the table! (downside - the water wasnt cold).

anyway...we ordered a pitcher of their white sangria, 2 of each taco and chips and salsa. after we ordered we noticed their guacamole bar (they make guacamole fresh to order, and to your degree of spicy). it was a little too late to order since we already got chips and salsa.

coming from LA, i thought the tacos were ok. very tasty, but not the kind of "street tacos" im used to. the salsas were all really good, and the sangria was pretty tasty. keep in mind they are street tacos. we ended up ordering another round of tacos.

i like that they have a bar area, dining area, and "street taco" stand. definitely a place i enjoyed, and will probably go back to. definitely curious about their fajitas (we overheard one of the servers telling their guests that the fajitas are their house specialty, along with the guacamole, and the order is big enough to share).

service wasnt that great, although it was happy hour and lets be honest - happy hour service isnt always perfect. all in all, a great experience, and perfect for a quick bite before a show.
