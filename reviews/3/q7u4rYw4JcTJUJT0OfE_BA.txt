Well, they've only been open two weeks, so I'll cut them some slack and let them work the bugs out. First of all, the entrees were quite good. The food seems fresh and well prepared. Also, the value for the price seems good. Here are a couple of things that need improvement: 1) Tap water. Really? Also, it doesn't come automatically and we had the chips and (quite spicy) salsa for a long time before the water (which we had to ask for) arrived. 2) The salsa. Mexican places live and die on their chips and salsa and this restaurant can do better. The chips are a mix of flour and corn (why not just corn? that's what most people prefer, in my opinion) and the salsa is not chunky at all, but is instead, not that flavorful, pureed and overly hot. Doesn't fit the majority of people, for sure. Service was pretty slow and food seemed to be coming to the wrong tables (someone tried to deliver to us while we still had menus in front of us, no drinks, clearly had not ordered yet. All that said, we will try them again and hope the kinks are worked out!
