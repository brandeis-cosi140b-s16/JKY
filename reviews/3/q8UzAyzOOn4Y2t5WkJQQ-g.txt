I'm on a search in the area for Fish tacos and came across this place via Yelp. I think I was here maybe 5+ years ago and if it is the place I'm thinking of, they had good cerviche. But on this trip I ordered 2 fish tacos and 1 shrimp taco (my M.O.) to see how they were prepared. There was a good freshness to the cabbage, tomato and avocado on the tacos. I liked that they gave me the crema sauce on the side instead of plopping it on there. The fish tacos were better than the shrimp in my opinion. Both were fried but the shrimp were on the small side. There was a nice saltiness to the batter to give the tacos extra flavor. Without even asking I got extra limes which I appreciate.
