Diablo's Cantina never fails to remind me of the times my friends and I would go to Rosarito for an underage weekend of craziness. 

The bar is located upstairs on the second floor of the restaurant. It is half outdoors and half indoors. The walls are red, there is red lighting, as well as a large bar, tables on one side and a stage and dance area on the other. The waitresses are dressed in hoochie, cabaret-esque attire and have bottles of vodka strapped to their thighs. For a good monetary tip, they will pour this vodka down your throat in a very sexy fashion (If you want a drink from the bar, be prepared to get a strong drink, but in a plastic cup). They have both live bands, as well as a dj playing (what in my opinion was pretty good) music. And the crowd is very diverse (aka: all ethnicities, all kinds of wild).  

Both times that I have been here I have managed to have a good time. However, both times that I have been here I have also been the only girl in a group of about 6 guys. Being that this bar is a taste of Rosarito in Vegas, it all kind of makes sense. 

Bottom line: If you are looking for a crazy, non posh, non-nonsense night of fun, (and a throat full of vodka), check out Diablo's.
