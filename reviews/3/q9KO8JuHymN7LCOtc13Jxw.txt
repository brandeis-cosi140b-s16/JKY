We decided to check this place out due to the yelp stars. We got a table for 4 inside by the window right away. The server was rushing around. Well we soon realized she was the only server for inside, outside and was also the bartender. It was soooo crazy. We started with ordering guacamole and the bean dip. She brought us the chips and dips, no salsa. The dips were just ok. The bean dip not impressive at all. The chips lacked flavor and needed salt. We all enjoyed our meals but the service was literally 1 star. Why do they only have one server to run the entire restaurant on a Thursday night??? We felt like we could not ask for anything...all we wanted was some chips and salsa and she gave a look like she could not believe we were asking her. Oh and when the meal came we asked for napkins and when she delivered them she threw them in the middle on top of our chips. Service this horrible makes for a bad night out. It really ruined our experience and it is a bummer too because we were really looking forward to this place. The main meals were good but just not enjoyable with the overall experience. Very disappointed.
