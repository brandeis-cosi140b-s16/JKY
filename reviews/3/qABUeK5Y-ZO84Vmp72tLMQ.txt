Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of Mexican food.  I was disappointed when I moved to Pittsburgh 5 years ago at the lack of options in the city.  Luckily that has improved over the years.  Emilianos is a place I knew existed, but for some reason I never actually made the trip to the South Side to try it out until last night.

Many of the other reviews on this site are spot on.  The one critique I saw in other reviews that I didn't experience was poor service.  We were visiting on a cold Wednesday night, so perhaps the fact that it was a slower time affected this.  Regardless, our service was excellent, if not overbearing at times.  I think our server visited our table at least 5 times during the course of our meal.  Perhaps they have read their reviews and focused on this.

The meal started promising enough.  I was happy to see free unlimited chips and salsa.  That is becoming rare these days.  In addition, the margaritas were quite good as well.  My girlfriend had the Sangria Margarita, and it bordered on too sour at times, but it was acceptable.  The food was just 'ok'.  That's the best way to put it.  I had the steak fajitas and my girlfriend had the steak fajita quesadilla.  My fajitas were fine.  Nothing spectacular, but perfectly acceptable for a fajita.  The quesadilla was another story.  First of all, it wasn't even cut, which was bizarre.  It arrived at the table as a complete folded over tortilla.  Second, one of the main components of a quesadilla is cheese, and the cheese that was in her dish was odd to say the least.  I would put it somewhere between a queso sauce and the pump cheese you get on your nachos at a ballpark.  I would have expected a melted shredded cheese of some sort.

I didn't hate my meal, but for the price (45 dollars for 2 entrees and 2 margaritas), I would probably take my service elsewhere the next time I get a craving for Mexican cuisine.
