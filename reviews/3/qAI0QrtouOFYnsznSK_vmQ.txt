When im downtown and want Mexican food i usually come here.  I usually get the carnitas tacos, i have also tried they're Chile Relleno which was different than I'm used too. I won't try it again,  I'll stick to my tacos. I normally go by myself so I'll sit at the bar and eat there or go next door to their take out section which has 2 tables if you want to eat on the go
