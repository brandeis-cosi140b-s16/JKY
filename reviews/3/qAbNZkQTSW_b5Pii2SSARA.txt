We ate here over the weekend while visiting AZ for a wedding.  I don't like spicy food and don't know what "good Mexican" food is so I don't have much background, but here goes:

The chips, salsa, and bean dip are very good, especially the bean dip.  They all keep coming to the table as fast as you can eat them - always a PLUS.

We went on a Friday and the MARG special was prickly pear.  It was so so tasty, although I don't think there was much alcohol in it at all.  I asked for a carnitas enchilada and my 4 friends and I waited for quite some time for our food so we were stuffed from the chips, salsa, and bean dip.  When my food finally came it was basically an overcooked, cubed pork chop in a burrito - dry and yucky!
