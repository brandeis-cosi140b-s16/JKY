This is a chain restaurant.  Nothing terribly special.  But not bad either.

The chips came out hot.  The salsa was tasty.

We opted for the special all you can eat enchiladas.  They were fine.  Not great.  Not bad.  The consistency of the tortillas was a bit odd.  Not sure how to describe it.  But it was odd.

The black beans are very nice.  In my opinion, better than the refried (but I seldom like refried beans).  The rice had a mild seasoning, but also was nice.

This place is no match for La Tolteca, or a few other places, but it seems to be reliable.  We've eaten at a few other On The Border restaurants over the years, and they have been consistent.  If you have a coupon, there is a special, or something similar, it is fine.
