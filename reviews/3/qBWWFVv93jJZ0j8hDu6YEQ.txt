This was my first time in fiesta maya thought of trying Mexican food. It was very quite on Sunday 7:30pm when I went and only a couple of tables are filled. It's a clean restaurant. The chips was not good as I expected(may be because I recently came from Texas). Reading the reviews I thought of trying  hot sauce but I didn't like it much. The server was punctual and our food was served in time. My Fajita was served hot and enough for me to take home and eat the next day. :) . The taste of food was ok and that's why 3 star but we enjoyed the nice and calm place.
