Great looking place. Neat location. Food was basic fare.  Chips and salsa were really good. Margaritas were not strong at all. Tried a variety of foods. Chile verde was bland at a comfort food level. Carnitas were nice and greasy as they should be. Tacos, well, were tacos. Be cool if the flavors popped a bit more. Good stand by place.
