Came back here recently and it is getting better.  The cashier was super nice and accommodating on more than one occasion and they finally got the order right!  But, the lines are pretty long and it takes a long time to get some grub here.  The green sauce tasted kind of weird the first time I started coming around and it still hasn't changed.  Plus side is that this location has a soda/juice fountain unlike the one by my house.
