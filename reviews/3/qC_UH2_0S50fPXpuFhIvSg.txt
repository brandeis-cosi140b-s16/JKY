Though "taco" is not exactly a traditional Spanish (or even Mexican) word, the phrase "El Taco Veloz" appears to be designed to indicate "The Speedy Taco", if the cartoonish character on the door is any indication.  Unfortunately, speedy is not really a part of the vocabulary here.  Luckily, the staff is friendly, it would just be nice if you saw more of them - for anything.  More chips (any chips, in fact), more drinks, silverware, your check, just about any service at all at times.  The server we had did speak very good English, which was nice.

Like Laura G. - and in fact, at her suggestion - we had a restaurant.com coupon, so we ordered like we had been on a desert island, since the prices were so cheap.  We in fact have a refrigerator full of leftovers, there was so much (and we picked up a cheese dip, drinks and dessert and still were not sure we would meet the required threshold to trigger our coupon).

Aside from the prices, the food is actually quite tasty.  No bland Americanized food here - the only problem we ran into is that much of the meat was overcooked.  In fact, much of the food was overcooked - even the churros were chewy.  Good flavor, just could have been taken off a bit earlier is all.  And the pupusas were excellent, if you are looking for another place that serves them.

Sweet Tea Report: Actually quite decent.  The only downfall here was getting more of it, as mentioned.  An interesting "twist" was that it was served with a slice of lime.  I can't recall having seen that anywhere before.  I do not know that I would request it again, but it was not bad.
