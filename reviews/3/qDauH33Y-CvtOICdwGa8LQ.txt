Rubio's = runny beans. I am not a fan, much rather go to a baja fresh. Rubio's beans are so runny they will make any burrito fall apart regardless of the other fillings. Their chips are too salty, the shrimp (that you pay extra for) is more friend breading than actual shrimp, their chicken has a weird taste to it.. Almost alien.. Weird. The only thing that saves them from a 2 star review is the salsa bar. They have some pretty delicious salsas, oh yea and they serve beers.
