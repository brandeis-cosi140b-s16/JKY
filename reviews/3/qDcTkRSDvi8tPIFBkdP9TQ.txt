outside, i was greeted by two of the pushiest cologne salesmen of all time. i escaped and entered the restaurant. everyone eating looked up and appeared disgusted at the sight of me, i must really look like an asshole because i get this a lot. i ordered a california burrito, grabbed some salsas from the bar, took my seat and watched some soccer. my food was out quick. the burrito came wrapped in foil with chips on the side. the first bite was all fries and carne asada, hell yeah. the meat was really flavorful and juicy, not watery or greasy. the fries were crispy. the tortilla was grilled. there was lots of sour cream and cheese. the guacamole wasn't that good but i didn't mind, there wasn't much of it in there anyway. overall, it was a great burrito. i liked the red salsa. this place was awesome and i'll be back. this review is hard to read.
