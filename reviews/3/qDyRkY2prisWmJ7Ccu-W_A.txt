There aren't many good restaurants in the area, so I'm giving this a 3 knowing I would have given it a 2 in another location (and in fact, I give the Plaza Midwood location a 1). At lunch during the week, this place is empty, and the service is friendly and prompt enough for a mid-workday meal. They have good lunch specials; I like the Mexican Chopped Chicken salad just fine, it's pretty loaded down and the fried jalapenos are a nice added touch. The torta is also pretty good, and big, if you're in the mood for that.

I can't speak to the dinner, but the other lunchtime meals look fine too. When you're looking for a place to get away from the office, it's an option, but don't go there looking for your new favorite restaurant.
