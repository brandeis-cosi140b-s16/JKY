It was fine. Tacos were too small, but flavorful. Cooked fresh. Guacamole in squeeze bottle was weird.  I don't like guacamole, so I can't comment on how it tasted (my wife didn't like it). Al pastor was unique and tasty.

Not bad for a food court place, though a bit pricey for tiny tacos.  Next time I may try a burrito (it looked bigger from what I could see, but also cost more).
