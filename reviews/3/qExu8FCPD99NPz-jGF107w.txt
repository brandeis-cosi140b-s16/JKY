It wasn't bad. Pastor was very good...best ive had out here so far...which doesn't mean much as I've only been here less than a year. But hey it was good. Chili rellano and cheese enchilada had really good sauce, pepper was not too tasty tho. Cook and cahsier were odd and a tad creepy, Kept staring at us. They gave me a quesadilla and I ordered an enchilada, the guy tried arguing it with me.....I know what I  ordered, and I eventually got it. 

All in all not bad...will prob visit again.
