Chico's Tacos is hidden away in a strip mall right off the corner of 7th Street and McDowell. You can get a burrito, get your taxes done, cash a check, grab a bagel and an espresso before grocery shopping. Neat! 

Chico's food has always been hit or miss with me. The fresh salsa bar is the stand-out feature, with salsas in varying degrees of intensity (I tend to go for the pico de gallo as, I am sure my friends will attest to, I am a wuss). Menu items include the standard tacos, burritos, chimichangas, quesadillas and nachos. There is also your choice of soda, beer, iced tea and margaritas.

I think I had just missed the lunch rush as it was still fairly busy when I went in. The food was prepared quickly, which was good as I was on my way to work and in a time crunch. The chicken chimichanga I ordered was fairly tasty, but a bit on the bland side. The only thing wrapped up in the tortilla (which was swimming in grease inside my to-go container) was cheese and grilled chicken. The side of sour cream helped and the addition of pico de gallo made it much better.

Chico's works well as a lunch spot during the work week because of its central location. However, the parking situation leaves a lot to be desired as it's right next to one of the busier intersections in Phoenix.
