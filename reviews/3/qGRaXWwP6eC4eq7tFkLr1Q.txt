This is just your typical fast food Mexican joint, no big deal! I have had Federico's at other locations. Never been that impressed! After eating lunch here with my wife, my opinion still hasn't changed! We shared a cheese enchilada, beef tacos, with rice . A week later! I am still burping it up!! I knew I was going to feel this way about it, But I still had to give it a chance. I am not saying this is a real bad place, because a great thing about it is when I go to work @ 3:30am! It is open!!!!!!!!
