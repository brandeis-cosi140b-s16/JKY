This place has a pretty cool atmosphere.  I am not one for Mexican food simply because I try to stay away from carbs as much as I can, so coming here is kind of dumb for me, but I lost the majority vote when we went out to lunch.  I did find myself a very good shrimp cocktail soup thing.  It was pretty price though, but I will admit it was delicious.  I want to come here once I am 21 to have a margarita at the bar!  AY YA AYYAYA AY (Mexican screaming).
