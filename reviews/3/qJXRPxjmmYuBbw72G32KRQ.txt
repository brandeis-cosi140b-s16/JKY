While I prefer the Monroe Pasqual's to the one at Hilldale, it's still just OK. 

Maybe it's irrational but I just can't get over having to pay for chips and salsa, especially when the salsa comes in a tiny to-go container. I mean if I have to pay $3 for what is normally free, it should at least come in a decorative bowl, right?

The burritos were all right. I got the commuter so I could try two smaller burritos (they were still huge). I'd recommend getting the "cowboy" burrito so you can get some chili sauce on top. It gives the somewhat bland food a bit of a kick. 

I agree with some of the other reviewers that counter service would be a better value here than table service. I'm not sure we'll go back - but it was worth trying.
