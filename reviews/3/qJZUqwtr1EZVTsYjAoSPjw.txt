Everybody giving this place an above average rating has a seriously down syndrome poverty palate.

Ughs Smh their rice is just awful, no spice, just an old oil flavor and unwanted corn and peas mixed in.
Guac is spread thin and watered down to the point it's runny and might as well be tomatillo sauce.

Beans are liquefied brown sauce. But hey it's cheap and at least the staff was nice. 
This place also really needs to serve beer. 

Blah I hope I don't trick myself into coming here again.
