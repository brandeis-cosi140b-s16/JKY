This was my first time at this place. My friends, who are from Charlotte, have been coming to this location for over 15 years, under different names. I ordered the skinny margarita, which was large and tasty. For my entree I had the veggie platter which cam with a bean burrito, cheese enchilada and veggie tostado. It also came with a large portion of grilled veggies which needless to say, I never got around to eating because it was all too much to eat. It would have been plenty for two people, especially after indulging on the chips and salsa. This is a basic Mexican restaurant. The menu is very large with lots of options. The other people at my table ordered the chicken soup with fish tacos, fajitas, and taco salad. All large portions and cooked just as you would expect. Good choice for a large crowd looking for "typical" Mexican food.
