After reading the reviews, I couldn't wait to eat there last night.  But I have to say, I just wasn't that impressed.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  I thought it was pretty good food, but nothing great.

After reading the food can be pretty hot, I ordered the red chile chimi which is milder.  I wish I had ordered the green.  The red had no heat whatsoever and it needed a little more flavor, but it wasn't bad.  I thought the beans were okay, consistency of homemade, but the seasoning reminded me of canned beans.  The guacamole seemed a little over processed to me, not bad, but not to die for.

Overall, it was good enough that I would give it another chance and try something different next time.
