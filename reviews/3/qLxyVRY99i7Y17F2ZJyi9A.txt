Was in the mood for some quick Mexican food, didn't want Taco Bell, or Del Taco! Didn't have the time for the very good restaurant across the street! (Hint: L.P.) I order their taquitos lunch special, @ $5.99 you get three taquitos, beans, rice, with some guac, and salsa. It's actually a very good deal, taquitos were very good and not on the cheap size. They give you a nice size portion for the price. Now I had this to go, thought I could get chips with this. They wanted to add another $2.75 for a bag of chips!!! That's almost half the price for the meal!! Overall, it was a good place to stop off, might come back when I have more time. To get 5-stars, you really have to blow me away!!! It lost one star for the price of the chips and the rice wasn't the best!!
