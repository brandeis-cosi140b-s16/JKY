This is one of those restaurants where you are paying more for the nice ambiance and a lot for decent tasting food that you can obviously get somewhere else for a lot less.  But hey, it's nice to go out to fancy shmancy places sometimes...

We were seated right away since we had reservations.  The mission was packed on a Saturday night, ambiance is dark and I guess you could say sexy (as I heard the table next to us saying).  Our waitress was attentive and made recommendations as we requested.  

Guacamole- this is made fresh and right next to your table.  I thought this was good and full of flavor, different than other guacs I'm used to bc this one had a bunch of stuff mixed into it.  My hubby though thought this was ok since he prefers simple guac of just the avocado, cilantro, lime and onions.  So just depends on your preference.

Almejas al vapor- some sort of clam and shrimp stew.  We ordered this bc it was recommended.  I love salty food and this was waaaay too salty, not even good salty.  Our waitress was nice about it and took it back, later she said the chef agreed it was too salty and apologized.  What was even classy of them is they took it off our tab and gave us a free dessert.  I don't remember the name of the dessert but it was yummy, the best thing we ate here besides the corn.

Grilled street corn- ok I don't know why we ordered this when you can get this for a buck at a swapmeet.  But it was deelish, nice and buttery.

Grilled chicken tacos- we were warned these were tiny and yup they're tiny, smaller than street tacos! 

We wanted to order the short rib entree but they were sold out that night :-(  

So overall, this place isn't horrible.  Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes but we just weren't impressed and prob wouldn't go back if we were in town again.
