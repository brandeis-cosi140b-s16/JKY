I like Cabo but since they aren't consistent between the Station Casinos they are hit and miss. They were not busy and service was good. The decor is different depending on the Cabo you are at and I did like the blue lights they have at this one. 

Chips, salsa and bean dip were brought to us. The chips and bean dip were decent but the salsa needs a lot of work. I always like to start with the "Con Queso Dip".  At this Cabo it is priced at $5.99 and was delicious. For my meal I ordered "Cheese Enchiladas" made with flour tortillas. I asked for very light sauce and when my meal was brought out the enchiladas were covered in sauce. I mentioned it to the server who said she told them to put very little. She then walked away and I figured I would see if I liked what was brought. Well, I didn't. The sauce tastes like it maybe comes from a can and is just nasty. The server must have seen I wasn't eating it I don't know but she brought me 2 more enchiladas with light sauce. I did appreciate the gesture. The food is just A-OK and nothing spectacular.  The rice is kinda dry. Hubby had "Beef Fajitas" and said they were good. 

There is a happy hour if you sit in the bar. They have tv's. Currently they don't open until 4 pm daily. With your players card they sometimes have monthly meal promotions.
