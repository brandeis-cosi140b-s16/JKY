On the one hand, 1900 is a pretty cool space. In fact, it is almost too much space. It's freaking huge, a fact that is especially noticeable when there is no one else inside. Not having been there before, I really had no idea if this was regular or not, but it felt more than a little creepy.

The good news is that service was solid - something that some other places can have a problem with when the restaurant is nearly empty. Definitely not an issue here though.

Tableside guacamole was definitely a nice surprise - seems like more and more folks are doing it, and it makes for a fresh treat. But after that, the rest of the food was nothing memorable. There are better places around town for a run to the border.
