All things considered, this location gave us some really ridiculously greasy tacos, but did make it right on our next visit. The whole order that we complained about was just disappointingly bad--slippery softshells and soggy hardshells--and something has to be done. See my previous revisions for more details.
The staff is friendly, and I would say mostly (key word: "mostly") proficient at their job. The manager saw to it that we were taken care of and on our two visits where our food was not patently awful, it was actually good. So if I'm in the neighborhood, and want a taco, I'll probably stop in.
Actually, I'll go through the drive-through, because the place still smelled like there was a sewer problem after a week, with no sign posted to apologize or indication they were working on it. So it's not a place I'd ever actually linger whilst eating.
