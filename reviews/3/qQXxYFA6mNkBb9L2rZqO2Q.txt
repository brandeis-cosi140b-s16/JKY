It was too loud, too expensive and not very memorable food-wise.

We were staying at the Monte Carlos and Diablo's devilish storefront and the call of margaritas and Mexican where calling our names when rolled into town.  We got seated right away - at a pub table - not comfy, but we were hungry so no biggie.  The server was prompt and got us our pitcher of Mango Margs quickly, plus gave us lots of tips on what the best of the best was on the menu.  

We started with the potato skins, which where good, but nothing special.  Then had the chicken quesidilla for my entree.  It was big and the chicken was spiced well, but again, nothing extraordinary.  The margs were extremely good, but my hubby and I shared a pitcher and I didn't taste a bit of alcohol and $39/pitcher I would expect a lot more out of my marg!  

The atmosphere is fun and lively, but seriously why is it so loud.  I had to scream at my husband who was 6 inches away to talk and I missed most of what our server said.  Seriously, just turn down the music a bit!  

So we tried, it worked for a hungry pair and we don't ever need to go back.
