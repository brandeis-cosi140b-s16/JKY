Solid 3 stars for Mexican food that is infinitely more authentic than Sun Prairie's Taco Bell and Burracho's Grill on the other end of town.  The prices are reasonable.  The dining area is teeny tiny, somewhere in the neighborhood of about 7 tables.  Around dinner time there is a line out the door.  The place is pretty popular.  Take out is available and good, but I suspect that the food would actually be a bit better if one were to dine in instead.  

I wish I had something funny and witty to say at this point that is somewhat relevant to this restaurant but I don't.  So I'll leave you with this quote from Lord Byron:

"Nothing can confound a wise man more than laughter from a dunce."
