While we did think the food was better than many local Mexican restaurants that doesn't make the food good.  Anyone who thinks this is authentic cuisine has probably never had authentic Mexican food. At best this was American Mexican.

We had the trio fajitas and he shrimp was very tasty, the steak and chicken were fair.  The beans and rice were bland.  

For a place called Chips and Salsa those two things were only adequate and we can get better by buying those things at Cardenas market.  We would say the house margarita was nice and strong.

So while better than most local Mexican places in LV, really not memorable at all.  So we will keep looking.
