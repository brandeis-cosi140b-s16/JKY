If you're looking for a basic chain Mexican restaurant, this is your place.  It's certainly an upgrade from somewhere like On The Border in terms of style and quality but it's still usually always located in a strip mall and I'm pretty sure both of our servers on two separate occasions were stoned.  The good things: awesome happy hour, awesome guacamole, really great green chili served with tortillas and the chicken pecan salad. The bad things: everything else. Every other salad was terrible. The catfish tacos - really terrible. The corn bread they serve up free of charge is ok, but anything free of charge is considered ok in my book.  Overall, it's not bad, really. If you just want a well priced margarita with your buddies on a nice patio, this is your place.  But if you're looking for somewhere special to go with people in town or on a date, look elsewhere.
