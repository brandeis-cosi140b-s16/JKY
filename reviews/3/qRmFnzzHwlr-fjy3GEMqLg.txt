Got a burrito this time ($5.25) for meat, salsa, beans and rice in it. Came with a small amount of chips.

It wasn't a big burrito or loaded like say a Roberto's, but it tasted alright. It had about half meat and half everything else so for the all meat burrito fans, maybe this isn't the spot. 

If you are a bit meek on spice and say no to them asking if you want hot sauce and ask for "mild", mind you it isn't mild. Hot is hot and a red sauce, mild is still fairly spicy of a green salsa. Just sayin' might want to stick to the pico because I like spicy and it crept up pretty good on me.

Even though I work in the area nearly everyday I haven't eaten here except one other time...I guess that says a lot.
