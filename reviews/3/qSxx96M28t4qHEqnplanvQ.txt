So I gave Komex 2 chances. The first
time I loved the nachos! My husband ESP loved it for their "fluffy airy" chips but the flavors were pretty delicious. The pork burrito was good but it was too spicy for this wuss. The chow fettuccine was yuck in my opinion. I like more noodles than veggies/meat and the ratio of meat and veggies was about 2:1 noodles. The noodles were all broken and I noticed in other pictures that's just the way it's made? I decided I would go back though after that...

My second visit we got the nachos again and I wanted to try the musubi and shrimp taco. Musubi was just your average musubi. The shrimp taco was soggy but that's what happens when you get it to go. Maybe if I had asked for the pico on the side it would have helped but I wasn't impressed this go around. 

I had some qualms about fusion food as other fusion places I didn't care for either. I like that it's fairly quick, but maybe I'm just too old school for the fusioness scene.
