It is so so so so good! For $8, all you can eat mexican buffet? Heck yeah! They bring you warm chips and salsa and then you can attack the yummy buffet! There are premade items like mini chimichangas, taquitos, quesadilla, enchiladas etc, then there are entrees like creamed chicken, pork, shrimp etc. And then the taco bar!!!!!!! With beef, cheese, sour cream, fresh guacamole, pico de gallo and other toppings. They also have fresh fruit and a couple of sweet items like rice pudding and fried plantains. What's not to like? It's so great! This is my new favorite lunch place! It's not gourmet, just really good mexican lunch food and I am in love!

Update: ok it's not as good as I remembered the first time. The food is low quality. After eating here a few times I have had my fill and get sick at the thought of going back.
