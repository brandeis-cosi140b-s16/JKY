Great, I apparently visited the worst filibertos in the area.  What can i say it was late and we were starving.  The food was alright but nothing special.  Kind of overpriced, but the portions are pretty big. Staff was a dud except for the cook in the back who kept smiling at me and telling me to come back again. I like their little condiment bar but it was not very well kept and very dirty. 

I definitely wanna go back just not this location.
