Food was good, nothing to write home about. They have a ton of different salsas at their salsa bar, only about 3 are tasty & worth eating. However, their house margaritas are amazing. Staff is friendly. Only real complaint was their A/C was not cold enough which made it uncomfortably warm in the restaurant, especially when the temperature outside is 110+.
