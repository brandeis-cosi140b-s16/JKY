This used to be a favorite, but portions, quality, and service have been declining. :( The entertainment is wonderful, but you pay for that in menu prices these days. Tonight, we had watered down margaritas, fajitas without onion, a chicken taco with  basically just a  fried tortilla, and service that required us to pay through the hostess. I know our server was spread thin, but there is no excuse for the decline in food and price! One last try, Lindo! I want  to want you! (;
