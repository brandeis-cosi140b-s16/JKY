What a nice new find! Hey it is a fast food type establishment but it tasted pretty good and it was on the "for real cheap". You can dine inside or they have a drive-thru. 

The menu board is easy to read. They have your basic options like tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos etc. I ordered the "Hard Taco Platter". It was supposed to be $3.99 but I only got charged $1.39! Score! I already thought the original price was cheap. This came with 2 tacos, beans and rice. For the tacos I ordered the ground beef and the shredded beef. The ground beef had no flavor. The shredded beef on the other hand was real tasty. The crunchy taco shells were good, but generic. The rice was okay and the beans were good. My hubby had the "Footlong Shredded Beef Burrito". This only costs $4.99 and adding anything else is $1. Again, the shredded beef was tasty. The burrito was double wrapped with 1 huge tortillas. For the price and taste you can't go wrong. 

The service was good. They have fresh sides of salsa free with purchase. Try it! Just don't expect authentic Mexican food.
