The food was fine - just as good as every other Del Taco (maybe better?).  The drive-thru service was very fast, HOWEVER I only received three pieces of an item that was supposed to be four pieces.  I would rather my order be filled properly than get to me quickly, hence the reason I am taking the time to review a fast food place.
