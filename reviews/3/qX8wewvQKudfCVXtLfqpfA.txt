Usually this place is OK. Don't try to ask any questions, there won't be any meaningful answers. Food is Great. My favorite thing is the diversity of options compared to other mexican places. This location usually is filled with business casual people. And, is completely packed at lunch

Now do not get the Tortilla soup to go. it is $3, comes in an small cup, and leaves the worst taste in your mouth. 

Stick with the burritos.
