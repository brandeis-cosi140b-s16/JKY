Good but could improve. This is my go to spot for my el pollo fix. Staff is usually nice and pretty prompt. Where this place kinda lacks is keeping up on things in the eating area. Sometimes i will go in and it will be nearly empty however the dinning area is pretty messy. I know in a rush it is hard to maintain it but in n out does it all day everyday. Little things like wiping down the table and chairs, condiments, salsa bar, soda machine , straws and lids. There is one manager who is always on her game, wish they would find another like her.
