Given the location, you might not expect much, but will be pleasantly surprised upon entry. The atmosphere puts off a real authentic vibe. The food is decent and the prices are in line with similiar establishments. I chose the beef chimichanga from the list of lunch specials. If I remember correctly, the price was $6.95 plus a beverage. The lunch specials are offered with rice and beans. I opted for all beans and no rice. I think all the waitress heard was "no rice." I received it as ordered. No rice and No extra beans. Next time I'll order "no arroz. doble frijoles."  The chimichanga was actually quite tasty, but not very large. The service was fast and friendly enough, complete with plenty of chips and salsa. The salsa was great, however, the chips were cold. Good, but cold. This wasn't some place I would drive out of the way for, but would visit again. Overall, it was ok. Nothing to prompt an extra star, but also nothing to be too disappointed about either.
