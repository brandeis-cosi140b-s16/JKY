Salsitas is a HUGE step up from the disgusting and poorly managed KFC that was here before it, and while I couldn't be more happy to have a new Mexican joint near my house, there's really nothing amazing about it. The carne asada is about on par with most of the "bertos" around town, the portions are a little smaller than Filibertos, and the prices are about what you would expect. The only above average thing is their hot sauce, it's smokey and wonderful. I'll certainly be back, I like to spread my Mexican food love around the town, but they opened right next to a Filibertos, a bold move and all, but I just like Filis more.
