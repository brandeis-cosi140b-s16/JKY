I have yet to have a 5 star experience here to date.  Can't believe this place is rated this highly.  I've been trying to give them a chance to impress me since they first opened their doors but so far it's nothing but very average Mexican food.  Before writing this review I thought I'd visit them one more time since it had been awhile. Maybe somethings changed I thought.  Nope...still extremely average and not worth driving cross town for but if you're in the area and hungry then go for it.  Yesterdays choice was a carnitas burro and a order of super nachos.   My biggest problem with my two choices yesterday and with every visit I've ever made here is there is just not much flavor to the food.  In my opinion you can usually judge a Mexican food place by the salsa that arrives with your chips before you order. If they can't make a good salsa you can pretty much be assured the rest of your experience will match the salsa experience.  That being said this place has the most flavorless salsa I've ever tasted.
