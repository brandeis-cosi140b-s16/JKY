Decent, gringoized Mexican fare served in a clean establishment. Perfectly edible, but for my money, I prefer to go to a real Mexican joint, of which there are many around here. This is the place to take your midwestern parents who think they like Mexican food but really don't have a clue. Last time I tried the place they had discontinued the non-fried fish tacos, which had IMO been the best food in the place.  Too bad.
