So glad to see that Edgar's has moved into the old California Taco location. Now I won't have to go all the way down to the Strip District to get my favorite tacos. The restaurant was clean, the service prompt, and both my chorizo taco and fish taco were fresh, hot, and delicious.  At the last
minute I ordered a flan to go, and unfortunately it was not the creamy, silken goodness that I was expecting, but a grainy kind of chunky mess that had good flavor, but the texture was all
wrong. 
I will definitely visit Edgar's often for the wonderful tacos, and maybe give them a second chance on the flan too. Then I can bump them up to the four stars that they deserve.
