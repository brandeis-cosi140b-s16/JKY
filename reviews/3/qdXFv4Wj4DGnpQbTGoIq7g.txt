I love Chipotle, but this one gave me FOOD POISONING. Whoever it was I talked to at their corporate wasn't quite helpful, although the manager at this Chipotle was very accommodating when I reported the food poising. They're  nice, but the quality they make when it comes to burrito is not great. It would spill or the burrito wouldn't be wrapped properly. I prefer going to other Chipotles than this one.
