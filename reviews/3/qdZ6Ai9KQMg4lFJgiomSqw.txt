THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING BREAKFAST BURRITO -- The chorizo breakfast burrito is one of my "treats" I allow myself occasionally and I have enjoyed them for years at this location. Unfortunately over the last year or so, this amazingly sinful wrap of goodness has deteriorated into an OK breakfast burrito. Less cheese, less egg, less chorizo (more potatoes) and probably 30% smaller than before. I understand everybody's gotta make a buck, but I probably won't be spending mine there anymore.
