Decent.  I came with a family member who has a fish-allergy, yet I ordered fish tacos for myself.  He ordered beef tacos with rice and beans (while all I wanted was a la cart fish tacos).  I got home and found the two single tacos I had received were beef, and had to rush to make sure the fish ones were not eaten.  Luckily they weren't.

The fish tacos left much to be desired, while the beef tacos looked quite good - asada which looked quite delicious.  The fish looked like little onion rings, breaded and fried - ehhhhh.  My tacos were quite spicy, even without salsa, which is fine for me, but I personally wasn't expecting or assuming anything that spicy without the addition of salsa.  I added the green salsa to my second taco - no added spiciness really.

Decent food.  Good beans.  High prices considering it's in a low cost area and the like.  I might go again if it was late and other places were closed and I didn't feel like cooking.  I probably wouldn't make this go-to place though.
