This is your classical americanized Mexican food.  Nothing too spectacular but if you want a burrito the size of your head for about 7 bucks, this is the place.  I ordered the spicy chicken burrito, it was good but was nothing like the picture.  It was basically fried chicken nuggets tossed with buffalo wing sauce inside an americanized burrito with cold cheese.  Not exactly "Mexican" food, but tasty none the less.  We also got the "house special" which is chicken enchiladas in a green sauce.  Tasty, but once again cold, the cheese was not melted on either one of ours.  But so much food for $15 and they have a salsa bar with some really good salsas.  We didn't get the habanero salsa because we were slightly worried about the heat level, but after trying the other salsas we will definitely ask for some next time.  

I would go back, but don't expect anything close to authentic.  I just wish everything had been a bit warmer.
