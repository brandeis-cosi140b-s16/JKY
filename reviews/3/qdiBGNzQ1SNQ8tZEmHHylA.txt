OK place.  They seem to trim the meat or at least cook it enough that there's no fat...which is great for me since nothing turns me off more than getting a mouthful of fat.  Ick!  Anyways, tried several different tacos and I would definitely go back for the ground beef taco which was pretty good. Some tacos are fried and others are not..kind of weird that they don't let you know which..the carne asada and carnitas are soft tacos and included guacamole that was more of a blended sauce..but decently thick sauce and include tomatoes.  The ground beef and chicken are fried and do not include guacamole or tomatoes.  The chicken was good but mega salty.  Although, it did have green peppers and onions in it which was a nice touch.  Maybe it would be good in a burrito to soak up all that salt.  The pork was very rich..too rich for me.  The carne asada was good but it had a very beefy flavor if you know what I mean..kind of like cheap beef has.  So, I would definitely go back in a pinch when I'm desparate and hugry.  Better than taco bell and filibertos but not the best place.  My favorite mexican fast food place at the moment is in the food court at fiesta mall.  Oh, also the drive through is located on the side street next to Discount Tire.  Just turn there and go a little farther down the block till you see the gap in the wall for the drive thru past the entrance to the strip mall--the drive thru wasn't marked that I could see.
