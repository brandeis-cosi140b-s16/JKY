So I'm in the D concourse 3 hours early for my flight and really hungry. As I look around at my seriously scare food options that include Wendy's, a CNBC gift shop, and some sort of overpriced bar & grill I see a small mexican beacon of hope with El Bravo.  

I walked up to the counter and was surprisingly impressed by the array of options I had. After taking a minute I decided to play it safe with a Vegetarian Burrito w/ guacamole (because I can never say no to guacamole even when they charge me an extra dollar for it). 

The best part of the  experience by far was the cashier (named Devin look out for him on the next season of American Idol) who sang all responses to you. This is no exaggeration he in fact sang everything from "Next in line" to "Have a wonderful day".  He made such an fantastical impression on me that I literally booked it to my gate so I could Yelp this experience.

I wish I could say that the food made such as great of an impression on me but sadly it was pretty forgettable. It was a mediocre burrito that was definitely nothing to call home about. Also there were only 3 small tables for El bravo so I had to do play the eat on my lap at the gate game (not my favorite). 

Overall it was a decently priced (that is for the airport) mediocre place that you should only really make a point to stop at if you see that a man named Devin is working the counter
