This place is definitely just starting out. You can tell they're still working out some of the kinks, including menus (they don't have a drink menu which made it like difficult to order drinks) and service (the waiter seemed new and not super familiar with the menu items), but the food is delicious. We got guacamole and the classic chicken and waffles. The guacamole was very good, but the chips just seemed to be cheap tortilla chips from the grocery store. However, the chicken and waffles were a delicious Belgian waffle and crispy fried chicken which had a bit of a spice. The combo of sweet and spicy was great. 

On Friday night they had a guy playing live reggae music which was a little too loud and obnoxious. Not sure what demographic there trying to reach since the decor is jazz albums and the food is a mix of Southern and Mexican. If you can get over the restaurant's growing stage, it's worth it for the food. I  hope they get things together and don't go out of business because I'd like to continue going here.
