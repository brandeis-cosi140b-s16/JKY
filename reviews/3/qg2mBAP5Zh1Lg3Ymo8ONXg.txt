Lived in SoCal for 14 yrs btwn LA & SD.  This reminds me of an upscale Tijuana joint w blasting Tenants music & Univision on the TV.  Great remodel - difficult to get into if you are going north on South Blvd.  Funniest thing - I've never seen a sign that says if you are wearing a mask or hoodie don't come in.  Stale chips. I had the CA Fajita burrito - large but something just wasn't tasty maybe the peppers & onions which had no color.  My better half had the juice steak & really enjoyed it.
