The customer service here is pretty good for a Berto's.  However, on this day, it took 15 minutes to make two cheese crisps !  

They did apologize for the wait but sheesh what happened ? Did they have to run to Food City to buy the tortillas and cheese ?

Ghetto dirty location but they have great deals and specials.
