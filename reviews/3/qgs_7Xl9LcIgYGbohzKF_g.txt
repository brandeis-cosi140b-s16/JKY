I have been comming to this restaurant for over 25 years. Well this year hasn't been the best. A couple of months ago some one tipped themselves alot. I did get that money back finally. I was there last night and ordered the table grill cheese, it barely fed 2 let alone the 6 it claimes. You could see the bottom of the grill. Then the plate that came out was not what we ordered. Then next plate was not what we ordered. The server appeared upset and told the manager who would not come over and speak with us. We did only get one bowl of chips,  had to track down our own silverware. Refill of soda 2 min before we left. They did take off our plate, which I didn't ask them to do that. I have no problem paying and tipping as long as the food is right. They seem to go up and down here and it is frustrating,  but when they are on target they are great.
