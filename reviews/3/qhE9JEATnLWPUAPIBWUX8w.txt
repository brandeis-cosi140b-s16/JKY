We have been to this restaurant several times. They closed the old location and opened the new one. This new location is lacking in taste, quality and service. We really were hoping it would have the same flare as the old one and keep giving it a chance but it just seems to keep going down hill. The food is okay. Cheese dip a little watery, more onions and peppers in chimichangas than chicken. However, after the past few times, I am not sure we will be returning. We have had the same waitress (young girl with glasses, long dark hair) the past few times and she is terrible. Last night two tables that were seated after us got their drinks and cheese dip before our drink order was even taken. Every time we have had this waitress she always has to come back to our table and ask us what we ordered and when the food is brought out something is always incorrect or lacking. She never refills drinks, EVER. You will have to track someone down and ask, if it's her that you ask....you will wait and wait and wait. Last time we were there she delivered our drinks, cheese dip, THEN THE CHECK.....she gave us the check before we even had our food. Same thing last night. Never got refills and when we requested them she brought the check instead of refills. We also noticed that she wasn't refilling anyone elses drinks at her other tables either. My husband never complains, always tips and last night he was ready to leave the tip line blank. However, we did leave 15% minimum out of courtesty but if we go back we will request a different wait person. She has no business working in a restaurant what so ever. After speaking with a co worker this morning that goes there as well they said they have had the same issue with the same waitress before when they went and they wont go back because of her.
