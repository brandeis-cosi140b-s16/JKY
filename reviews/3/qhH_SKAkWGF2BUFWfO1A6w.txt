I went to Fiesta Caf√© because they were the only Mexican establishment, at the time, serving pork tacos. I was disappointed. The pork tacos were made sweet with some sort of pineapple concoction, and the tortillas were store-bought. I much prefer tortillas that restaurants make themselves.

On the plus side, this is one of the Mexican restaurants that tends to offer coupons via the mail. When I dined on a Monday night, Fiesta Cafe had a lot of older couples taking advantage of the discount.
