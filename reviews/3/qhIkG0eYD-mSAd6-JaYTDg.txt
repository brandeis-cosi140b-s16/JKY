Small little place.  Kinda left unsatisfied and still hungry. Spent around $11 on a soda, 2 tiny enchiladas with refried beans and rice, and free chips with salsa. They had only one server and a cook who doubled as the bus boy. Not a lot of taste going for the enchiladas and the salsa was ok. One plus was that food got there pretty quick after being ordered.  Ask for little ice with your soda, they brought me a large cup of ice topped with a few gulps of soda, finished before I even got my food, and wasn't offered a refill. I'll stick to where I usually go for Mexican.
