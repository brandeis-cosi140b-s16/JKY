I came here for happy hour with a big group. I'm going to give props to the waitress for splitting our tickets out accurately and without attitude. You'd be surprised how hard it is for some people to do that. 

On to the food:
- Chips and Salsa: Pretty horrible. Chips were stale and salsa was bland and a strange color. 
- Salty Dog: This was a hot dog wrapped in bacon with guacamole and pico on top. I am definitely a fan of this combination. It also came with waffle fries (also great). Only reason I'm giving this place three stars and not two.
- Chicken Tinga Nachos: My boyfriend got this and loved it. Huge portion of nachos loaded with cheese, beans, sour cream, pico, and chicken. It was suppose to have guacamole but guess they forgot.
- Margaritas : This is what I was most disappointed about because I heard this place was suppose to make great tasting strong margaritas and mine was way too sweet/sour and seemed to have little to no tequila in it. Same with the two other people who ordered margaritas. 

TV's were poor quality as we were watching the Heat/Celtics game. Only reason I am pointing this out is because this place has a sports bar feel to it. I probably will not come back again unless social situations force me to.
