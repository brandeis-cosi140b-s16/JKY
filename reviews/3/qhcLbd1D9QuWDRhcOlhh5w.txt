I had a pretty nice time here. I live only a few blocks away, but never visited until I had a coupon for a free appetizer.

My roommate and I came later in the evening, and there was no wait to be seated. The margaritas were on special for happy hour, and even though it was only lime & rocks for the special, I got one and was pleasantly surprised. I'm not usually a fan of lime margaritas OR margaritas on the rocks, but this one was tasty, for only $3.00.

The chips and salsa were really good--the salsa was thick but not chunky--the kind I love, and the chips were crisp but not oily how they can sometimes be at restaurants.

For our free appetizer we got queso con carne. I just thought it was so-so. It tasted too much like ground beef--I guess I was expecting something that tasted more like cheesy chili. Oh well, it was free.

I got the chimichangas for my entree, and I thought they were good, nothing special, but good. I really liked the rice and beans on the side though.

Since I only live a few blocks away, I'll probably be back.
