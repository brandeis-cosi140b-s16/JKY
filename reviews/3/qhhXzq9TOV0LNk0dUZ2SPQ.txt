Maria's serves up hefty portions of your standard Mexican fare such as burritos, tacos, and enchiladas. They also serve posole and menudo. The first time I went here I had a shrimp burrito. It was a gigantic burrito, but it didn't taste that great to me. It was a little bland, and the lettuce in it was juxtaposed with hot refried beans which made it soggy/wilted the more I ate it. The second time, I tried a bacon breakfast burrito. It was also a gargantuan burrito, but it was lacking in a few ways. First of all, the burrito had pieces of eggshell littered throughout it providing an unpleasant crunch as I ate. Also, the bacon wasn't very crisp and tasted slightly undercooked before it was placed in the burrito, so I got fatty chewy pieces as I ate.

The interior is a bit hot, and there's not much A/C in the restaurant.

They have a soda fountain here, but you could only get ice from it. Instead, they sell soda by the can, but if you want a Styrofoam cup to drink it in, they will charge you $.59 for it. They also have horchata, which I thought was pretty tasty. It was creamy and refreshing.

They have both red and green salsa to go with your meal. It was good, but watery.

Service was fast and friendly.

Despite the friendly service and the big portions, I was disappointed in the different items I ordered. So, the search continues for a decent Mexican restaurant around this area.
