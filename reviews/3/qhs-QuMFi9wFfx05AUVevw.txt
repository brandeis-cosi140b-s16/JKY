We went there yesterday and this was about my third time going there. I was hoping the other two times were flukes but I'm starting to think that's just their food. The steak was just.. crappy. It was a little burnt and tasted like char on some of the pieces. Honestly, I'm giving it three stars because of their name. It should be two. 

If you're not afraid to travel a little south to a slightly rougher area (really not that bad in my opinion) the original is down there. Huge, tremendous difference, worth the drive especially if you have been here and we're wholly disappointed by this place. The wait staff, hostess we're all friendly, nothing wrong with the way we were treated. It's sadly, the food itself.
