I ordered the fruit plate or "Plato de Frutas" and it was small and had few slices of fruit. Not worth what the price. The floor had a lot of trash and I don't know if it is always like this or maybe just because it is like 9:30 PM  but it was not so clean. The waitress was average and did not hear us asking for the bill until the 4th time. Other food was just ok. Nothing above average.
