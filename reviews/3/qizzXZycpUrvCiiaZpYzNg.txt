When I first heard original burrito, it made me think that this is where burritos were invented and that all other burritos (and burrito companies) are just straight up posers.

Anyway...

I rolled in and immediately took note that the Marco Polo was like a shredded beef breakfast burrito, so I went with that since eggs, rice, beef, and tortillas are just my thang.

Pros: Large burrito, eggs were cooked quite well, fair price and value (~$6).

Cons: Nothing exceptional in the quality/flavor department.


All in all, a little bit on the higher said of 3 but not quite a 4.
That being said, I do want to come back during breakfast hours to try a potato/chorizo burrito (yeahhhh buddy).
