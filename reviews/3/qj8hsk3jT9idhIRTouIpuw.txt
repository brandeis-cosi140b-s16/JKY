I really wish I could give this place 5 stars. The food is amazing, the atmosphere is really nice however to service is terrible. The wait staff is so slow. We were sitting for 15mins before we were asked for our drink order which wasn't even our waiter but a bus boy. When we finally were able to order the food came out pretty quickly but trying to get our bill and pay it was a fiasco. I do recommend this place but be prepared for a lengthy stay.
