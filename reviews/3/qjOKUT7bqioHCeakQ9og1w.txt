It's Chipolte so as far as fast food Mexican goes they set the stand by which other chains are weighed.   That being said, this location has one big problem and that is it's popularity.   While I would usually fare Chipolte higher this one always has a very long line and a but of time needs to be dedicated to it.  When looking for a quick lunch bite on a time crunch this location does not do it for me because of the quantities of people lined here.  
     I would reccomend a number of other places if you were willing to dedicate the time and patience to the Chipolte line.
