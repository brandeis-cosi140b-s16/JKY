I first spotted this place out the corner of my eye while craving for some carne asada fries.  I was on my way to Roberto's but this place was closer to my house so I decided to try it. It's a small little little spot like any other mexican food joint, the food was ok, the price was a little more expensive than other joints like Roberto's. Either way it was just okay I guess. I still think Felipito's on Tropicana is the best mexican food spot in Vegas, price, quantity, and taste.
