I like to eat at Qdoba about once a year.  

Every once in a long while, I figure it'd be a good idea to consume 1200 calories in 10 minutes and I file in to Qdoba for a burrito. Yes, they do basically serve Chipotle's menu, but I like Qdoba's better.  Why? Because they offer a bit more variety--the ancho chile bbq burrito is tasty.

Still, you're paying $7 something for a burrito that's bigger than your face.  Take that as either good or bad, depending on whether your concern is gastronomy or cardiology.
