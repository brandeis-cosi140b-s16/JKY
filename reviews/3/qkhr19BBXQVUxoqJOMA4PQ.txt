first time there and didn't know what to expect, the al pastor tacos were good, the carnitas taco was just a bit dry , the meat was tender but dry even with the sauces. it's really out of our way to eat there since we live by the Red Rock, we'd go back if we're in the area.. 
We ordered the fries with the meat since some of the reviews were high on that particular dish and I have to say NO, next time I'd rather order the nachos..... everything was fine other than that.... but like I said, it's out of our way....
