Used to frequent this place when it was on Scottsdale road. First visit after the move was horrible but realized that because of the bigger place they probably had to hire new wait staff who were probably overwhelmed as the place was packed. 2nd visit was better, the wait staff was more attentive and I didn't wait 30 min to pay my check.  Food is what I call typical greasy gringo Mexican. Nothing too special and it will most likely give you indigestion.
