I'm pretty much aligned with some of the reviews posted... The food was fantastic- it should be as it took 45 minutes to receive... Note to Chef: water should be provided immediately (common sense should kick in when seated in the sun), waiters should NEVER use the excuse of a new cook for a food delay, if a customer must wait 45 minutes- perhaps some complimentary ice tea would help. This restaurant seems to suffer from a CenPho phenomenon... It appears college kids are running the show... Perhaps a dedicated floater/Manager would ensure that staff/ service are on point... It was obvious Silvia was no c where to be found... In her absence,  someone needs to care about the product and service as if it was their own restaurant.
