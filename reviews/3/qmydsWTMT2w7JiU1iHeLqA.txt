Ravings on Yelp got me curious. So I finally went there with my beau to satisfy odd hour early evening hunger.

Um, not my type of authentic. Yes, it's cooked by very very friendly Mexican family, and I appreciated their service. But based on my backpack trip experience in Mexico, I'd prefer Mercardo Miramar tacos over this one. 

What's authentic is the group of guys at the counter with beer, munching on food, and having small talks in between watching soccer game.
