This is one of my go-to delivery choices in Champaign. I order from them a lot and my experiences have been a little mixed but for the most part yum-yum-yum satisfaction.

Pros:
- Most of the food I've ordered from them has been super delicious. Can't speak to authenticity but I sure can speak to how much I enjoy putting it in my mouth. Especially like the chile relleno, the tamales, the salsa*, and anything involving the cheese or ranchero sauces.
- Good beverage options. Love the horchata.
- Really reasonable prices. For most menu items, the portion sizes are quite large.
- Service is really friendly, which matters to me, even if they aren't always perfect.
- Open late.

Cons:
- Sometimes the tortillas on my enchiladas are not very good, kind of stiff and dry. Not sure if they are stale as another reviewer suggested, or overcooked, or if it is something to do with sitting around in the to-go container for too long. The shredded beef and chicken are also not quite up to par with the rest of their food.
- Have had occasional issues with service -- communication difficulties, missing complimentary salsa, a weird Campusfood.com-related snafu, trouble finding my easy-to-locate apartment door. All pretty minor and rare though.

A note on delivery: all delivery orders come with complimentary chips and salsa, but you get a ton of chips and only a little bit of salsa. You can order extra salsa as a side, though, as well as the cheese sauce. Those two mixed together = heaven.


* It's very cilantro-heavy, which I LOVE but I know there are some genetic mutants out there who taste cilantro differently. If you are one, this isn't for you.
