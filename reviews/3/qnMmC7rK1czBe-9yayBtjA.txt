Arrived for my birthday dinner with hubby tonight. Immediately seated & drinks ordered. Chips & a very good, spicy salsa quickly placed on the table. Hubby ordered the carne asada & I ordered the Fiesta Grande combo of 2 cheese enchiladas & a shredded beef taco. Big platter meals, so expect to overeat. Typical bland fare expected of chain Mexican food, with a few menu exceptions in the seafood dept. The carne asada was tough to cut, but the pica in my taco was nicely seasoned. I'd requested guacamole with my meal, but it never came, so hubby gave me his, which came with his meal. I mentioned it to our attentive server Raul, who made sure we were not charged. Also, hubby asked if the restaurant gave military discount; Raul checked & gave us a 10% discount on hubby's dinner.

We'll probably go back, since it's close to home, if only to try some other menu items.
