I like this location because its right across from the valley metro stop at 1st and jefferson. I've stopped here to grab a quick bite before catching a departing flight out of town. The chipotle is located in a complex right across from the stop so its not far to lug my luggage. And typically i order the burrito bowl because its a quick assembly line creation so no waiting for them to cook my meal. And my reason for stopping here is to avoid the higher prices at the airport
