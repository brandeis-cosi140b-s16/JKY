I tried this place on a recommendation from a friend. Honestly, it didn't taste much different or any better than la Pasdita Sonoran dogs, my go to place for my Sonoran dogs. I was expecting something amazing, maybe I built up my expectations too high. 

Good place but slightly overpriced, I'll stick to La Pasdita, taste the same, more variety and it's cheaper.
