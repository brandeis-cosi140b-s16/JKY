This particular Roberto's was on my way to work, and I know they usually take long no matter what you order.  So I Yelped it to get the number to place a phone order for pick up. (Thanks Yelp!)

The lady answered the phone, "Roverto's." I ask, "Yeah, is this the one next to the gas station on Cheyenne and Martin Luther King?" she replies, "escu me?" and goes off speaking machine gun spanish and hands the phone to a gentlemen who speaks slightly better English.  I find out it really is the one on Cheyenne and MLK and place my order of a Carne asada burrito.  I get there and tell them I just called for a Carne asada burrito and they just now make it.  What was the point of even calling in the order?

3 stars for the burrito still being glorious.
