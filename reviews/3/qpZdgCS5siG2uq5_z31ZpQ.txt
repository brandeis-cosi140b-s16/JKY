This could be a 5 star for me but honestly its been months since they have been opened and they have yet figured out a way to keep the line flowing. My suggestion is to use the other register and put no reserving seat signs like Zuppas. I can hardly ever find a seat after i order my food and half the people in it dont have thier food yet. I know that its quality food everything is fresh but when waiting over 30 mins or long in line kinda turns you off! 
Beside that i loveeeee the food here!! Unfortunately i dont come as often as i would like for the reasons above.
