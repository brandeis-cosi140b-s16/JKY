Actually I'm giving them a 3.75 for a rating. I've only ate here once while in Madison. I had a steak burrito. It was good tasting, some what large, and at a reasonable price. They have a big selection of ingredients that you can put in your burrito or taco. It's not a San Diego area burrito, but not bad.
