I visited La Catrina for a friend's birthday dinner and was pretty disappointed. The hostess was not very friendly and seemed irritated that we wanted to sit outside. Since she could give us no information on when we might be seated outside, we ended up inside, which was very cold. We were not given silverware or napkins until I went to ask for them. I ordered a Dos Equis Amber which was listed under the draft beers, but I was brought a bottle. The table seemed very sticky and dirty - I did not want to touch it. 

We ordered queso for the table which was totally delicious. We made it disappear, but were not able to put out the flame underneath it so just sat on our table smelling of burning cheese. 

I ordered the Ropa Vieja and the beef was very flavorful and tender. That was definitely the majority of the dish - it was served with very little white rice (maybe four good bites) and three little slices of plantains. 

One of the girls in our party told the staff twice that it was our friend's birthday and we were on a tight schedule trying to make a movie. I totally understand that it must be hard to round up enough staff to bring out the cake and sing the birthday song, but the restaurant was nearly empty and they really did not seem in a hurry to help us out. We were ultimately late. On a positive note, the tres leches cake was so, so good! I think I ate more than the birthday girl. 

Overall, I wish their service matched the quality of the food. I know of other Mexican places where I can get a real draft beer and receive better service.
