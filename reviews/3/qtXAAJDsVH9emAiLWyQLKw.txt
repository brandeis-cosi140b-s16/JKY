This is a rough looking little strip mall place. The kind of place you see all over the Valley. If you want atmosphere look elsewhere. 

We tried a few different things--tacos, torta and assorted other things. The food was all pretty good--not the best in the world, but good. Tacos are a $1 each. 

Prices were awesome and the service was pretty good also. There's not too much else to say about it.
