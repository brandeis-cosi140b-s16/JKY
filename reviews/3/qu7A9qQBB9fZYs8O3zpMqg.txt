I wanted to like thsi palce, I have just bought my wedding dress at Destiny's Bridal in the Borgatta!

Pros: Good chips and Salsa (free and refilled!)
Affordable guac
Good Margs

Cons:  The worst serivce I have had in years.
They are trying hard on the food and I like the idea of unique sides, but the taste just isn't there.  The  fish in the tacos was bland.
