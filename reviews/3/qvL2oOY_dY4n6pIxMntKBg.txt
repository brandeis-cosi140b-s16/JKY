I sat outside on a lovely summer day with the breeze blowing and a can of Tecate.  The jukebox was a little loud and the view of the industrial building across the street could have been better, but it was very nice anyway.
The salsa was great.  I ordered the potato flauta, but was brought pork.  I ate it anyway and it was very good.  I will definitely go back for the potato at some point.
