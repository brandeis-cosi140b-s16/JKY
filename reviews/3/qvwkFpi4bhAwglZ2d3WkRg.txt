Upon arriving, my girlfriend and I were warmly welcomed and sat promptly during what seemed to be a busy time.  They host sat us in a wonderful spot in the restaurant and was very kind. 

A young lady who was walking around filling water and occasional light busing table came by to fill our water glasses during this process she spilled more than an acceptable amount of water on our table and walked looked at us and walked away without speaking, apologizing and/or wiping up the spilled water. Them seemed odd as I'm sure I am not the only person who enjoys eating at a dry table.  None the less I waited to see if she was coming back to clean up and noticed that she wasn't  I went ahead and unrolled my silverware and cleaned up the table myself.  

Our waiter arrived and and kindly took our drink order, he was a nice gentleman and returned shortly after with drinks in hand.  Before the waiter left I noticed a hair in my marg and made him aware.  He was great and apologizing and returning promptly with a new one. My girlfriend had the blood orange marg which was amazing.  I had the Joyride which I also that was great, so good that I ordered a second round. We were both very satisfied with our drinks.

We each order our Tacos, I had the Standard, The Chicken Tinga and the Crispy Fish which our server recommended.  I must say all of the tacos were amazing! Great choices and a great recommendation on behalf of the waiter. 

While eating the same young lady who was refilling water stopped by and filled our water again, this time not spilling on our table but instead as she walked away spilling on the floor right next to me causing water to splash on my leg.  At this point I am laughing out of disbelief of her carelessness and poor demeanor as she works.  She has yet to smile and/or speak.  Luckily this was our last experience with this individual. 

When the check came I was surprised to see our bill for 3 margs, and 5 tacos was so cheap. 

Working in the service industry I know tips are a way of showing your appreciation for great service.  I refused to allow the hair in my marg and the careless water lady affect our service good service and left around a 30% tip after factoring in the discount given due to happy hour.  I wish I could remember his name so I could shout him out and let him know I appreciate his service.  

Hopefully he along with the hostess will rub off on the others in the restaurant.  Just because you aren't designated to serving others doesn't mean you are excused from working with a smile on your face and putting effort into your work.

I am in no rush to comeback...
