After a few brews from The Mason Lounge (located across the street from La Hacienda), the suggestion of grabbing a few simple street tacos was music to my ears. Dined at around 7:30pm on a Saturday night

+ Huge space, tons of seating
+ Somewhat harshly lit... felt like I was in my old high school cafeteria
+ Massive menu
+ Reasonable prices for both food and drinks

+ Quickly seated; server brought complimentary chips and salsa and waters
- Chips were a bit meh... slightly stale and tasted like oil was a bit old
+ Salsa was chunky, had a bit of a kick, and flavorful

+ Big selection of tacos available (two types of chicken, several variations of beef, tongue, tripe, pork)
+ Tacos were good, but under seasoned. Nicely seared, but lacked robust flavor
+ 6 tacos and 1 beer (we split it) was $15. Not bad.
- Service was lacking; we never really saw our server after food was dropped off

+ Mariachi band was good, but a tad annoying... there were only 4-5 other tables in the restaurant, and the band kept rotating around. I can handle one round of Guantanamera, but after 3-4 rounds, I'm done.

Not a bad place. I'd visit again when I'm in the area.
