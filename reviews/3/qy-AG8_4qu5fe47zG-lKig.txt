The good: Pork Quesdilla, chips and the Salsa. 
The bad: Crappy Velveeta Cheese dip masquerading as Queso.

Definitely better than Chipotle.The quesadilla was amazing, and so big I gave half to my boyfriend. The chips were nice and fresh, and the salsa, while being REALLY watery, was flavorful. The queso though.. Meh. This is actually crappy Velveeta Cheesy dip with some salsa thrown in. It's not with $5. Just get the chips and salsa. It's cheaper and tastes better. The hot sauce they gave me barely counted as mild, but they do have a nice selection of hot sauces by the drink dispenser, so I can forgive that. 

The workers were nice, and quick about getting  my food out. However, I did notice them completely ignore a young woman who was trying to tell them they were out of ice. Just stood there and chattered away in spanish totally oblivious to everyone around them.
