Now, I have to agree with Kelly R. on this review.  DO NOT BE SUCKERED IN TO GETTING HALF A SANDWICH AND SOUP.  I wanted the Mexican grilled cheese (which was amazing-goat cheese, tomatoes and avocado?  I dream of it) and the tortilla soup.  Well, the sandwhich was 8 bucks and the soup was 6.  For 14 bucks I could have had the whole sandwich and the whole soup, but instead I got half of each for 12 like Kelly says.  NOT WORTH IT.  However, the soup was amazing.  My friend got a burger and a huge order of chips/salsa and guac, so I know not EVERYTHING is expensive and small.  However, my other friend was also disappointed in the half salad/soup combo she was talked in to.  So just be careful ordering because you could end up with a little food for a lot of money, but the food is great.  Will go back for lunch.
