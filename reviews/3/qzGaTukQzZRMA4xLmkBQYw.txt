I went here for some authentic Mexican food and definitely got it. This looks like a hole in the wall type place. byob which is good for the drinkers! 

The service was not great. The person who served and took my order could not speak English and was so confused when I placed my order. Then gave me the wrong side. 

The food was good but nothing to go crazy about for me. I got a tamale and I enjoyed it! It's just that I am not craving to go back like I usually am. 

Recommend for Mexican food.
