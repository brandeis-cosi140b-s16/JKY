My Fam and I are big fans of the food here. We usually go through drive thru. Our orders are usually fresh, hot and delicious but lately the older woman with the heavily penciled in eyebrows working the window has been having a bad case of the grumps. She acts like anything you say or ask for is a huge inconvenience, is very condescending and just plain acts like she hates her job. Another Mexican food restaurant has thankfully opened up further down Greenway to replace this place. Unfortunately the rudeness has overshadowed the tasty food here. 3 stars Rivas!!! Attitude adjustment please!!'
