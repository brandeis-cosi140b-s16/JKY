The food is amazing, but the woman in charge of this location is extremely rude and doesn't care about customer service. I've been coming to this place for 8+ years and it was always an amazing experience until the management changed. Same owners, just a different manager. She's rude so be prepared to be served some major attitude with your amazing meal! I'm going to the other Burrito Express from now on.
