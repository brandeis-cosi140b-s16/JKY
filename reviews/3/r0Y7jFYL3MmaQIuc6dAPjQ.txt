It's a lot of food for the money.  Chips were decent, but the salsa didn't really have any kick at all.  The quality was decent, but overall the food left something to be desired--I find places like Maize and El Charro to be a better option if you're ok with not having a sit-down atmosphere.  Service was quite slow, especially given that it was the end of the night--it took at least 20 minutes for them to take our cash/cards after we were given checks.
