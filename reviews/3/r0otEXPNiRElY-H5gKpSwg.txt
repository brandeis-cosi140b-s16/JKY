I had the lunch special and chips and salsa today. The special was blackened fish and shrimp along with all the fixings and 3 tortillas. The chips are a little thicker than I like and the red salsa (both green and red are served if ordered) is very much like someone else reported...liquidy, definitely nothing for your chip to grab on to. The highlight was the blackened fish and shrimp, which I used to make my own tacos. The beans and rice were average. The place is small with most tables fitting two people and a few tables for four. Inside they can hold perhaps 30 people including the 5 or 6 people at the bar. I gave it a three-star rating because the fish and shrimp was very tasty but the watered-down salsa was not my favorite. They are opening a second location in SW corner of Scottsdale/Shea in about three weeks behind the Denny's and will have more space for patrons.
