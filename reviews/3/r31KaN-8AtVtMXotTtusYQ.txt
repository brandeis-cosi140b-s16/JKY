Horchata? None? Grr...

It is a pet peeve of mine when a place is unable to provide some of their most sought after items - this night, they had no Horchata. It takes hours to make Horchata - and when something takes that long, you obviously should have started making another batch ahead of time, no? That being said -

The food at Desnudo Tacos is better than average. Flavors are rich - sometimes a little overbearingly, but most people will enjoy their take on Mexican foods. I had the pleasure of trying their Tinga Poblana as well as a Pork Belly Torta. The pork was moist and full of flavor which was a definite plus. The torta was gigantic, and a fantastic value.

The environment of the restaurant is a bit of a minus for me. The pictures look nicer than the place does in person. It's sparsely decorated and the bright/dark contrasting colors are only on a portion of the walls with the kitchen a bit of an eyesore with its white paint and fluorescent lights.

Additionally, it's in a bit of a seedy looking area with a terrible parking lot, but that's not totally their fault.

All in all though, I wouldn't hesitate to try this place again or go there with friends, but I'd hope that they'd be a little better prepared.
