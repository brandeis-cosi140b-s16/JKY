Large menu selection! There's a veggie section, huevos, chicken, shrimp, other parts of animals I'd rather not eat. Pretty hard not to find something you want. 

FOOD
Complimentary Chips and salsa (3.5 stars): Come with a bean dip and a salsa dip. I liked the bean dip more. 

Soup that comes with meal (3 stars): Pretty good actually. Noodles inside were good. Broth is like a tomato chicken broth. 
 
Guacamole (3.5 stars): Good guac but I've had better. 
 
Shrimp fajitas (3 stars): Shrimp were way overcooked, pretty chewy. Rice and beans were good. They have hand made tortillas, which were okay. I used to live in SD where there are tons of Mexican restaurants that do hand made tortillas and they taste so much better. 

Complimentary Birthday Churros (2 stars): Not very soft. Caramel sauce wasn't so great with it either. Nice of them to give something for birthdays though! But these churros are on the regular dessert menu also, wouldn't recommend them. They also sing to you and put a sombrero on you for your birthday. 

SERVICE (5 stars): 
Our server was awesome. On top of everything we asked for. Waters were always getting filled. And once we told him there were vegetarians in the group he made sure to tell them what they could and couldn't eat. 

ATMOSPHERE (3.5 stars):
Place isn't that big but it's a good size, make reservations if u can, it was packed when we go there but we had reservations.  

PARKING:
Parking is tight. The lot is weird so it takes a while to get in some of the spots. 

Overall if you need to go to some kind of restaurant around this area it works. But nothing spectacular. If you have a big group they do a good job with service.
