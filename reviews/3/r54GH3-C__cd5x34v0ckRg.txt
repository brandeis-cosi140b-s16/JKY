It was Friday night and since the Yardhouse was packed tighter than a nun's handbag, that fell through. A friend and I wandered around town, and somehow ended up at Don Miguel's in the Orleans casino. We waltzed in around 9 PM, and it wasn't terribly busy. (It's not a huge venue, so it's emptiness was more apparent.)

For drinks, we started with water, then upgraded to firewater. My friend had a margarita, while I "enjoyed" a rancid, heavy shot of tequila (1800, if you're curious) and needed help to take it down.

Service was fast, and our food came out even faster. Speaking of speed, we watched horse races on a nearby flatscreen, though we didn't place any bets.

We munched on chips with various sauces, including salsa. My trio of corn tortilla tacos ($9.99) satisfied, and the aforementioned sauces came in handy. (I also took advantage of Cholula to add color.) For my entree, I had a choice of ground beef, shredded beef, or chicken tacos, so I asked for one each. Didn't leave hungry!

Unless you dislike Mexican cuisine, check out Don Miguel's for yourself!
