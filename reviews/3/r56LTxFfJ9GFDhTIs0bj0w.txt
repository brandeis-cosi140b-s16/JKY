Ok Ive eaten here twice now once before they expanded and again today.  I like the layout with the bar, outdoor seating and plenty of indoor space so you dont feel like people are piled on top of you like some breakfast joints.  My wife had the benedict with spinach and side of bacon which turned out to be the best part of her meal as she requested the eggs without runny whites which is basically what she received.  I was a little disappointed with the Huevos Rancheros the flavor was ok but nothing impressed me.  We ordered the Arizona Fire Corn because it sounded interesting and found the flavor to be good here however they charge $3.29 for a few tablespoons of this side; a little to proud if you ask me.  On a positive note our server was very good which helped the average food until our bill hit the table.  $41.50 and another $8.00 for tip we were out the door at $50 for two breakfasts, 2 Ice Teas and a couple of very small sides we wanted to try.  I like this place just dont love it but the location is great so what the heck maybe we'll give it another chance next time where in the area.
