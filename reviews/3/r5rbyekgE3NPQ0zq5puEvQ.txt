we frequent serranos because #1 it is really the only good family priced restaraunt out here. I do love the chips in salsa but some of my favorites are only ehh there. I do however like the relleno dinner that is what I usually order. I love green corn tamales but theirs are not very good unfortunately. They are very bland and I have never even found a green chili in one. Don't waste your time on the  tortilla soup either. This is awesome if it is made correctly and fresh. Believe it or not the last disappointment was a chicken taco salad. I don' t know how that can be messed up but trust me it can and it was. however I know what to order and on nights we want to go out it is still worth it to not drive far so if you live in queen creek I would go. Go somewhere else if you are wanting drinks. They do not know what a good margarita is there
