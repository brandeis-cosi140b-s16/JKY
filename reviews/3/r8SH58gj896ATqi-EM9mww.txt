I've been going here for lunch for 3-4 years (on average a couple times a month)...and in that time it seems to be on a slow decent downhill.

I used to think it had the best fish tacos in town but over time the once crispy flavorfil fish turned ever so slightly soggy.

Pluses:
good salsa
great ice tea
chips are good but there are better out there

Minuses:
Eaten here for dinner twice and been dissapointed both times.
Service is sometimes dicey
