I've been here before and will probably come here again.
That said, tonight was not their best night as far as I'm concerned. 
The food was less the expected. I've eaten here before and it was much more enjoyable then this specific time. All our meals seemed...lacking. Nothing to write home about either way.
Service was definitely off. The waitress herself was completely fine. We were only 3 and at the end of our meal we sat around and continued talking. They were expecting a large party and asked us if we didn't mind moving, not excited about it but definitely fine. We moved.
As their large party started to arrive, they noticed they were missing some chairs. When one person from my party got up to use the restroom the waiters took the chance and snatched her chair without so much as asking the other 2 of us left at the table! Completely rude!
