Would you believe I've never been to a Chipolte before?  I came here with a friend and figured it was time to try.  I've heard so much about this place!  Mostly good, of course.

I came in and noticed that the menu is simple and prices were fair.  I liked the selections available, and went with the steak fajita burrito. I got to choose my options, and it came wrapped up nice in tin foil.

I really liked the burrito I got!  I will probably be back again to eat here.
