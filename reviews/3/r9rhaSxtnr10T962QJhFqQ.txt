Continuing my quest to find the best taco in Vegas... I saw this place as I was driving down Ft. Apache and pulled in to check it out. It's a pretty big place in a dead strip mall. I walked in, the cashier said hi and handed me a menu. My order:

2 carne asada tacos -- the meat was tough, dry, and lacked flavor
2 al pastor tacos -- very tasty and spicy. I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food, so others would probably consider it to be mild.

The tacos are slightly more expensive than other places around town at $1.25 a pop. Each comes with onions and cilantro on top. The tortillas were ok, but nothing special. The tacos were decent, but still not better than Los Parados.

Their menu is big, with some breakfast items, tortas, tacos, burritos, quesadillas, seafood entrees, a kids menu, and a whole lot more. It's worth another visit just to try some of the other items. They have 3 other locations around Vegas.
