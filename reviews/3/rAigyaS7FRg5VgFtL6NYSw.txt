We just dined at Cabo Wabo. Patio seating is awesome because you can people watch while you dine. I love the vibe of the place & it's great location facing Bellagio. I ordered the fish & chip (16.95) & my companion ordered the chicken enchiladas (15.95).  The waiter asked if we want sour cream, & we said yes. The food was pretty good, but when the check came, they charged us $1 for the sour cream (you'd think it's free because it's a little dish of sour cream). On top of that, they charged a fee of CNF (2.15) which he explained it's a franchise fee. I've never heard of such a fee. So do you pay for a franchise fee at McDonald ? I don't think so. Also I understand they were busy, (but really not that busy; it's a Tuesday night) the service was really slow. Although it's not much money, I think the restaurant is really cheap to charge for sour cream & the CNF fees is ridiculous. Anyone here can explain what this CNF is???
