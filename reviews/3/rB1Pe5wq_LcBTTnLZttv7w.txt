I went here for the first time after driving by this restaurant for about a year.  The chips and salsa were great.  I ordered a cheese enchilada, taco and tostada combo.  It was very reasonably priced.  The rice and taco were very good.  The beans and enchilada were so-so.  I will return as some of the neighboring tables had some unique dishes that looked pretty good.
