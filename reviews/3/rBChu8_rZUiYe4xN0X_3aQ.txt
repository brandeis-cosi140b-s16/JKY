In an area better know for Blue Hairs, this place is alive and kicking.  The decor is vibrant and the food is standard Gringo Mexican.  Think fish tacos and burritos and tostadas.  Pretty simple, not so cheap food.  I myself went veggie: the red sauce on the enchiladas had the right kick of chili: the cheese gooey, and the bean tostada was perfect. The wait staff was attentive.
