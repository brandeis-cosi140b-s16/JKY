The layout of the place is awful. Most Chipotles have a natural line flow to follow, but here the path is straight to the register, which we all know is NOT where to start. The burrito prep area is also much smaller, giving this place that "airport restaurant" type of feel. Everywhere you sit feels cramped and too close to others.

It's really odd, because the Starbucks makes great use of their space. Maybe this will just take some getting used to.

The food is solid, reliable Chipotle. So meander to the front for your semi-healthy animal-friendly burrito fix.
