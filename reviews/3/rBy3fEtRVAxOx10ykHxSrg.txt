Not a whole lot of flare going on with Maki Taco, but good food nonetheless!  I picked up some of their tacos right before they packed it up for the night during a minor brewery crawl.  I brought a decent sized group, so we got to try the staple tacos. 

First of all, the average order is between $7-$9's for three tacos and that is a lot of food! 
The food came out relatively quick, around 10 minutes and all four orders were out right after the other.  We had the Korean Bulgogi Steak Tacos that definitely brought some heat with the red peppers and tang via the marinade.  The Teriyaki Chicken Taco's were flavorful, but the safe option to choose.  Lastly, we split the Thai coconut Chicken Taco's and they were exceptional!  Overall the tacos were seasoned well and juicy, but had more vegetables as filler at the forefront than meat.      

The guys running the truck were nice and efficient and I would definitely go back if I ever crossed paths with 'em in NoDa again.
