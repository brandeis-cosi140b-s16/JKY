I really wanted to like this restaurant, but I was disappointed.  So, let's start with the positives:

Pros:
- Most of the people working behind the counter were very nice (pretty much everyone but 1 person was super pleasant and even funny.
- Very big portions, so if you're really hungry, this is the place.
- Fountain drinks have free refills.  
- The horchata wasn't overly sweet.  My family enjoyed this.
- Fountain drinks had not only sodas, but a couple teas, and horchata and other stuff.
- Their restaurant is prepared for large crowds to be in line.
- Menu is simple and easy to navigate in case you forget.
- Lots of tables.
- There were a couple people in the eating area cleaning up areas.
- Homemade tortillas.  This was cool.
- I like that you can get enchilada style.
- Prices were reasonable, maybe slightly more than we would spend at Chipotle.

Cons:
- One lady behind the counter attending the guacamole & sour cream was a real b****.  She was incredibly rude not just to me, but to other people.  Yes, I know the guacamole & sour cream are extra charges.  It says so on the menus.  And after I confirmed the first time I knew, when I asked for those same items on another order right after the first, you didn't have to repeat that they were extra charges with a sour face.  Chill, lady!  Yes, I know I have to pay for it and was planning on it.
- The line was super long.  And when I went to check out, the guy said this is normal and what I was experiencing was typical.  If you don't mind waiting in line, though it moves somewhat quickly, then have at it.
- Restaurant is really dark.  Maybe something in between and not so dungeon looking.
- The food was okay, but some of the food was too salty and some sort of bland.  I'm a big Chipotle fan, and Cafe Rio's food just didn't taste nowhere as good.  But, maybe it was just me because they seem to get plenty of business.

------------------------------------

The food wasn't awful, but since there are plenty of other places I do like to eat at more, only if coming here was a social thing with other people other than my family, the taste of the food just didn't appeal to me.  So, if it's just with my husband and kids, we would probably opt to go to Chipotle.  Food would be 2 stars.

Everyone minus one crabby lady was really nice, so other than her, service was good and people were pleasant.  I would give the service 4 stars.
