Service is good. Food is good. I come here because it is Conveniently located inside the Tuscany. No need to drive around, short walk from the room. I've tried plenty of items here since I've been staying at the Tuscany for years. Chile verde, fajitas, carne Asada, albondiga soup. Good flavor an portions. TIP: Pick up a Vegas Magazine near lobby for a 2-1 entree coupon! They also have daily specials.
