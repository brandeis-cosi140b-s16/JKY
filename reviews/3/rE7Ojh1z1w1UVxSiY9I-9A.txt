Last night was my 2nd visit... and this time we only went to the bar. My friends and I went after the Yelp event, Yelp Gets Freaky at the Factory. They had salsa dancing and live salsa music, and that mixed with the crowd from the event, there was a pretty nice party going on. It wasn't too loud, we found a place to sit, the atmosphere was fun... the only complaint I had was that my mojito was terrible. My first visit I tried one and it was the same, and I gave them another shot, and yuck. My husband's mixed drink was the same... watered down and not mixed well. We'll be sticking to beer on our next visit, but we'll def be back with our dancing shoes next time!
