My wife and I just went here and were impressed with the cleanliness and overall atmosphere. She ordered the green corn tamale and cheese enchilada plate. I ordered the Diablo Scramble which included chorizo, eggs, potatoes, cheese, jalapenos, refried beans and warm tortillas. Everything was very good and I couldn't even finish it. My wife enjoyed everything except the cheese enchilada, which she couldn't finish. I must admit that their cheese was pretty poor quality. Otherwise, we enjoyed our breakfast and will be returning. Mariachi music added to the experience.
