You will have a hard time convicing me that any tex-mex restaurant in the valley is as good as some of our best authentic mexican cuisine, so Chevy's starts a leg down in my estimation. 

It's not bad, and the homemade tortillas are actually somewhat impressive. Still, I would advise exhausting all other mexican options first, then, in the tex-mex pecking order, going to Ajo Al's, or if that doesn't work, try Chevy's. 

It is a good place to take a large group and drink margaritas and celebrate and non-romantic event, such as a birthday or graduation. Celebrants are given a large sombrero, which, invariably, they will wear for the duration of the night out after sipping on a little too much tequila. 

Don't believe me? You'll see.
