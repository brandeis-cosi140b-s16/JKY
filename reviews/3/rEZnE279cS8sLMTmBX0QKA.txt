Time for an update on Chino.

I still like Chino very much, BUT in recent times at the Chandler location I've been getting overly greasy dishes and lower quality chicken.

It's possible I've just been unlucky.

So I'm still a fan, but I hope quality control goes back up.

Vegetable Quesadilla still rocks!
