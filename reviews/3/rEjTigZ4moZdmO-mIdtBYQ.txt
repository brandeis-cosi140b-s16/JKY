Friendly service and price is moderate for seafood.  We had the shrimp cocktail which was below  average in my opinion.  We don't recommend the shrimp enchiladas because they were a bland but the bacon wrapped shrimp were really good and worth the price.  I had the fried mojarra  (fried whole fish). It was perfectly crispy and cooked.my only complain about the fish is that it had too much salt. The saltiness made it a little hard to finish.  With how perfectly crispy it was the fish would be fIne with only a sprinkle of salt seasoning.  Also no free refills on soft drinks is a bummer. 

The biggest problem with this place is the smell of nasty urinals when you walk in.  It's really disgusting even though the place looks clean I couldn't get over the smell so we will not be back.
