Affordable food. Good selection of traditional style Mexican but in a fast food style.

Open 24 hours (a must in a city where you lose yourself in a casino until 4am).

Drive thru! Yey!

The rice was well cooked and on the bland side. Nothing a little pico de gallo couldn't fix right up.

Chips and salsa are spot on.

Beware! Their green salsa has more kick than most greens.
