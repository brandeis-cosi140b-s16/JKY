For awhile I was a regular customer. Ordering the Shrimp Tacos and Pork street tacos. For some reason the Spanish word eludes me. The sauce of the shrimp tacos was the best. I loved that they offered grilled onions and peppers. With the guacamole hot sauce it was very delicious.

I finally went back recently, they had a couple new lady employees who were nice. The food was made quickly and I took it to-go.

When I got home, the shrimp tacos just didn't look appetizing, the sauce was thin and very little cabbage.

I also ordered the two different tamales they offered. The chicken was more masa than meat. The beef was better. A good thing I like masa becuase it wasn't good but it was just above "egh". I don't know what happend, maybe it was just an off day, but it wasn't the same it used to be.
