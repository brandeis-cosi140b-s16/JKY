If you're looking for authentic Mexican, this is not the place. It's an American's version of Mexican. That said, I DO enjoy coming here to meet up with friends and have a good time, the ambience on the patio makes the bland food well worth it. Plus, they have some really good drink specials, which are fun to try.
