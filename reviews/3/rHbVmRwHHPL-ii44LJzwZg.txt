After spending the early part of the evening at Sun Devil Liquors, my friend and I realized we had not yet eaten dinner. Problem was, it was a little after 10pm and nothing down the street was open - but El Taco Tote was...The first experience for both of us.

We ordered the quatro tacos and the Panchos. There was a salsa bar in the middle of the room, which wasn't a bad discovery. The pico was a little peppery and had good flavor. The panchos were okay - perhaps because it was late at night they were out of nacho cheese. Nachos without nacho cheese are not the same, but they threw some regular cheese on to replace the deficiency. The quatro tacos were small street tacos, and they were fine. 

The place was descent - especially after our time at the bar and not having dinner, but I don't think I would choose it over Filberto's if they were side-by-side.
