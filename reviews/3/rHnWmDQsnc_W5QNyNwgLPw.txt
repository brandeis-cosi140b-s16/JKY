I would've given this 5 stars filled with so much praise you'd think I was a fake reviewer and related to the owners...if I was writing this 6 months ago. However things have really gone downhill in recent months and I'm over it. I have been in love with this place and a very frequent customer of Braddah's since they opened up north. Last night around 7:30, I got an order of nachos and I counted 11 chips in it. 11 chips?!! And they were stale so that was cool. I paid almost $9 for 11 stale chips and some chicken. I was left unsatisfied and hungry which is something I never would've thought I'd say about this place. This isn't the first incident, there have been multiple in the last few months which is why I stopped going there and showing social media love even when I did. Shady portions and oh, this new whole "add a tip and sign" thing is utterly ridiculous. Why am I tipping you at a chipotle style restaurant? What did you do for a tip? I'm just really confused and disappointed now. Braddah's, please get it together bc I really really want to love you again. 
Sincerely,
Hurt and Hungry in Vegas
