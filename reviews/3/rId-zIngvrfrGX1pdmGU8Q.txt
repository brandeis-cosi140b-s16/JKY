A vivir group of us came here to celebrate a birthday. This place is a little hole in the wall... But it is doing something right if it draws big crowds.
We ordered the shrimp enchilada, beef golden tacos, machaca tacos, green chilli tamales, and the chicken chimichanga.
Every item was pretty good with the best spice. I love their hot and spicy red and green salsa with their homemade chips.
