I was semi-hungry and was wandering around downtown Phoenix and found this Southwestern themed restaurant here in the mall. I figured since I'm here for a few days, that it would be nice to try something that is "Southwestern".

Came here for lunch and it was relatively empty and I sat at the bar. Nice clean area, with a couple of tv's for the sports fanatics. The servers were pretty friendly too. Although some of the servers were super bored since there were not a lot of customers.

Again, I wanted something Southwestern so I went with their Desert Fire Pasta. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?select=AykZwJA1xSgxLOBaWbWHOg It's basically shrimp and fresh mushrooms over angel-hair pasta in a jalape√±o cream sauce. Topped with Parmesan cheese and pico de gallo. This pasta was pretty much soaked with butter. Is that a typical Southwestern thing? Because if so, I would feel light headed all the time if I lived here.

And for dessert, I got their fried banana burrito with ice cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6Wc5DPXGudcNi2XK7QfQtA?select=PpE4HMvbpTU7mJdb19VlZA. Nice presentation actually. It's a great theme for a Southwestern style dessert.

Overall, a decent experience, though just a bit fattening to me with all that cream and butter. 

Went to downtown a couple of times, and this place was desolate. I mean everywhere else as well. Not sure why, but it can be a good thing but you must also wonder why...oh well.
