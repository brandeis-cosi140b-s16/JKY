This certainly wasn't the worst Mexican food I have eaten, but it wasn't the best.  One reviewer claimed the salsa was tomato sauce with chili powder.  It wasn't.  It had a mild flavor with a slight tang of spicy.  It was on par with Pace Picante.  I had the Cominbation #2 with a shreaded beef taco, tamale, and cheese enchilada with rice and beans on the side.  The sauce on the tamale was my least favorite.  The taco was good but nothing to ooh and aah about.  The enchilada was a flat pancake of cheese and tortilla, but it was tasty none the less.  The beans and rice were not on par with my local Mexican joint in San Diego.  The $3 margarita was enjoyable and worth the money.  I have had worse and paid a lot more.  Over all it was an average joint.  But the staff was very friendly and helpful.  Would I go back?  Maybe, but there are a lot of other Mexican places to try before I return.
