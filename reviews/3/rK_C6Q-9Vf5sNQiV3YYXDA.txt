Used to be a fabulously affordable restaurant with good food, too (and a nice vegetarian plate selection). Then in they suddenly printed new, fancy menus (minus the vegetarian listing), jacked up the prices, and decorated the place up a little more. After that the food didn't taste as good and the service became lackluster -perhaps forgiveable if not for the price increases. Our little group of Laredo's fans was heartbroken.
