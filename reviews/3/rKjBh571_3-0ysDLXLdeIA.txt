Sure it's not gourmet.  But I actually had a pretty decent 2 taco fish combo. The guy behind the counter was a little slow, but the food was quick and fresh and good.  Beans and rice were also good.  Excellent drink dispenser, lots of room and lots of seats.

When you are really tired of paying the exhorbant prices at the restaurants in the casinos, try something like this.  You may find a hidden gem.  If nothing else, it'll give you a quick break from the smokey casinos.
