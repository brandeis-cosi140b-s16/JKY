Very mediocre Mexican food, but good service.  Coming from a place called Dos Gringos, you have to expect nothing but gringo-y type food though.  I had the gringo burrito, which had a lot of meat, veggie, and black beans in it.  It also came with rice and beans.  Everything in the dish was very bland though, and I had to smother everything in Tapatio hot sauce for there to have any flavor.  Despite having some communication difficulties since it was hard to hear each other speak (We were outside on the patio at a table and a live band was playing), our waitress did a good job refilling drinks as needed and getting our orders in.  I would probably only go here again if a good band is playing here, but I wouldn't go here solely for the food.

By the way, the outdoor Jenga blocks are pretty cool.  We made a tower of 29 levels of blocks, but unfortunately did not beat the record of 34!
