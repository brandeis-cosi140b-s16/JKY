Went with my husband and daughter around 7:30 on a weeknight.  Was told there was a 20 minute wait, which was fine, except there were 5 or 6 empty tables.  I can understand staggering the seating of guests to not overwhelm the kitchen, so I didn't say anything.  30 minutes later we were sat at a table that had been empty the entire time we were waiting.  The waitress was very friendly, the salsa was good.  Also got the guacamole, which was very tasty.  About 15 minutes after we ordered our food, my daughter (who is 4) asked if her food was ready yet.  The waitress brought out her plate within a couple minutes, but we had to wait another 10 or 15 minutes for our own food.  We actually were still waiting for our food to come out when another waitress asked if we were ready for our check.  

The food is pretty good - nothing real fancy, and the prices are okay.  We probably will come back and try it again, but the wait time is a little ridiculous.
