Not much to say about this place.  It is not real Mexican food.  It is not cheap Mexican food. It is certainly not fast Mexican food.  
So - I really don't know what it *is*.

A girlfriend and I went in before a concert at the Compound in the same plaza.  A couple iced teas (we decided to skip the margaritas with the plans on filling our liquor consumption quotas at the concert), and the decision to split the nachos with shredded pork and the crab stuffed shrimp appetizers, as neither of us was super hungry.

Nothing wrong with the chips and salsa - fresh and decent flavor - but nothing special.  
The nachos were about as three star, middle of the road as a plate of nachos could possibly be.  Had they been missing any key ingredient - had something been prepared poorly or past its prime, I'd be able to suggest how to improve them - but they were just plain OK.  
The crab stuffed shrimp were fantastic - in concept.  Somewhere between the idea of them and the finished product being placed on the table, something went really wrong.  The breading used to fry them made them downright hard on the outside.  Either fork and knife or handle to gnaw off a bite was required.  The sticky sweet sauce they were tossed in didn't help at all.  The flavor was fine - but the texture just didn't work for me.

The prices weren't awful, given the ZIP code.  2 iced teas and the 2 apps - I was out for $30 + tip.  Half of that was the crab/shrimp debacle.  

Will I go back - well, if in the same shopping plaza - and with a friend in the mood for Mexican-style munchies - AND most of the other restaurants are closed - SURE!  Would I go out of my way to plan a meal here?  Most likely not.  Too much good Mexican food in this town to drive out of my way for what some gringo thinks the folks of N Scottsdale think Mexican food is supposed to taste like.
