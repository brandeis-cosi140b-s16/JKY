Was taken here for a work lunch the other day.  The food was reasonably tasty but unexciting.  When I order carnitas, I expect meat that's been cooked to extreme tenderness, not big chewy pork chunks.  Rice and beans were just OK, and normally I'll hoover up every black bean on my plate, but I felt no compulsion to finish them.  The nopales salad on the side was tasty, and the salsa that came with everything was yummy, as others have mentioned.  My companions seemed pretty happy about their fish tacos, so maybe I'll try those if I get brought back here again.  

I'd say, don't go here expecting anything other than lightly spiced totally Americanized Mexican food. It's not bad for what it is, but the whole experience, food and ambiance, seems designed to be nonthreatening to middle-aged white people. If I want that kind of experience, Cantina 1511 does it way better.  And since I live a few hundred yards from some of Charlotte's real Mexican and Salvadoran holes-in-the-wall, I'd probably give Zapata's a pass if I were the one picking the restaurant.
