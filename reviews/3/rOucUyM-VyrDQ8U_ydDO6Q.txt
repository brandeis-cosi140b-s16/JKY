Not bad bit the prices are pretty high for the food, you can get about the same amount of food in other places for less, the horchata has no refills and they charge 2.50 for a small cup, fountain soda for 2.19 for small size and it seams there is only one size. Food is not bad. I gave it 3 stars because of the food price.
