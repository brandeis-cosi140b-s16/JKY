Went there early on a Saturday afternoon with two of my kids. The place wasn't very busy and we were seated right away.  We ordered chicken fingers & fries for the kids and a lunch special for myself. The food was delicious and cheap, but the timing was weird. They brought my dish before the kids plates. What?!!? I was annoyed by that, considering my kids had to wait another 5 mins before they could start eating. 

As I mentioned though, the food was great. I had a lunch special, which consisted of a chicken sope (Beef or chicken. Two round and flat pieces of corn dough topped with refried beans, meat, lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream), taco and rice and beans on the side **plenty of food for lunch, even for a big guy like myself** The chicken was shredded and hot, topped with fresh, cold toppings and the corn tortilla was right out of the deep fryer. The kids food was hot and the crispy chicken fingers were tasty. 

We didn't have any special drinks or dessert, but would like to try some churro next time. 

The decor could be updated (fresh paint anyone?) and the service could be a LITTLE better (waiting on drinks for too long and the food timing was odd), but overall, a good value for a decent amount of food. 

I don't need to be wowed every time I go out to eat. This place won't wow you, but it serves it's purpose: cheap, quick, tasty Mexican food. We will return.
