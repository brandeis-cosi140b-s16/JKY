Good place for fast burrito fix.  I drove by here and was in and out in probably less than 10min.  Granted it was a Monday night... but it was still prime dinner time (in my opinion).

So without any line, I got my way pretty easily.  

I don't know if the unlimited chips and salsa is a new thing or not, but I was not expecting any chips in my bag at all when I stopped int to get my burrito.  It was a nice surprise - but they probably make up for the chips by selling queso.

I have been to this location in the summer and had the opportunity to eat outside in the patio area (in the back/side of the building).  It would have been great but the only thing I remember was a pungent smell.  We thought the trash just hadn't been changed out in a while, but when we were leaving we noticed the grease dumpster right outside the patio area...... DOH.  Even though our noses were not happy...we still managed to eat (which does say a lot about the food I guess).
