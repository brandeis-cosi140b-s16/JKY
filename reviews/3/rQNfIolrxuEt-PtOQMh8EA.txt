I was in the area and decided to try out this Taco shop since I don't live nearby.  When I walked into the restaurant, I thought I would have an awesome meal...but it turned out to be mediocre.  Here's what I ordered:

Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito, $3.10
Carne Asada Taco, $1.33

The BRC Burrito was ok....the Beans didn't taste fresh.  The Carne Asada Taco was pretty good, but didn't have that "addictive flavor" to it.  

I love Mexican Food and judge restaurants by asking this simple question..."Will I get the urge to drive a long distance (15+ min) to eat there?".....in this case, the answer was "no".
