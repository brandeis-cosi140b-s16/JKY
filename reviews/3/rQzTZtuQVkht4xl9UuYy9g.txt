My friends really talked this place up, but overall I left disappointed. Its saving grace is its extremely reasonable prices ($2/taco.) But overall, I wasn't that impressed. I had a fish taco, shrimp taco and pork taco. Of these, the pork was the best, but some of the pork in the middle was a bit under. Both the fish and shrimp tacos had little flavor to speak of, and the ratio of toppings (lettuce/cheese etc.) to protein was off. Tortillas were nothing to write home about either.

The food took too long given the atmosphere/style of the food. The interior was kind of schizophrenic, an incongruous mix of sports stuff and traditional Mexican restaurant decor.

But all this being said, the tacos are worth $2, and though I went on a Saturday, there are pretty good specials the rest of the week.
