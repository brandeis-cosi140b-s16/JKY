Maybe I got something terrible last time, but I'm upgrading Roberto's to 3 stars since I've had a few more things here.

The chorizo burrito, shrimp burrito were fine. The chicken burrito was very meh; standard line chicken, no flavoring. A chicken burrito was "just lunch" if you get my drift. IF YOU'RE PICKIN' UP WHAT IM PUTTIN' DOWN, 'NA MEAN?

The chorizo burrito and shrimp burrito I enjoyed. Maybe it's because I had some hot sauce. I don't know. My toilet also liked the burritos, but then again, what doesn't make me shit these days? I'm getting old. Or getting Crohn's disease. Mexican food makes a toilet holocaust. Burritos from a 24 hour taco shop makes for bathroom salsa. I could go on.

Overall: Solid, quick, cheap, tasty enough for the price, solid B.
