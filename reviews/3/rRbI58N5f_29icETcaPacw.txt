We headed to Stapley branch first only to find out they were closed! It was opened only 2 wks ago though, crazy! Then off to Power location, called and were told current wait time is 45mins! Still we went and passed by a very crowded parking area with bystanders outside On the Border entrance. We dint know where to go for dinner so we called again and asked for any bar seating. We arrived and proceeded to the bar with 2 available seats - we skipped the 45min wait and that was amazing..

I had Big Borduritto (?),  portion was indeed big lol.  Their salsa, which is bottomless, is similar to Chili's but is too spicy for my taste but I liked their chips better than Chili's. Overall the Big Burrito I had was ok, I will probably try a different one next time we head visit the place again. Taste was nothing extraordinary but they were not bad either.
