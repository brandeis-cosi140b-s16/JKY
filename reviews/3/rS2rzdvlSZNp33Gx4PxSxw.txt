Me and my boyfriend were craving mexican food so we decided to try Nacho Daddy. Of course we order a plate of nacho's because we think..."Nacho Daddy" can't go wrong. To my surprise they stacked the plate high with chips but there was barely any toppings and it was cold. Our waiter looked to be about 18 and had NO clue about beers, when my boyfriend asked...what beers do you have? any wheat? she grabs him menu and says oh heres our list of beers. He asks again do you have any wheat beers? she says ummm yes we have a lot. When his beer came she brought a warm glass and poured the beer in the glass...giving him almost a half a cup of foam. I ordered their street tacos, which were delicious! I mean you can't really go wrong with tortilla, beef, cilantro and onions. I honestly think I would go back to this place, but not sure if I'll order their nacho's or beer.
