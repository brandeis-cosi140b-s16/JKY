Kind, courteous and helpful are always things that my mother taught me when I was a kid. So when I took my mother here for lunch it was apparent that there was someones good mother present. 

The staff was so incredibly sweet, helpful and courteous it made up for the average Mexican food the kitchen was sending out. While my Taco Salad ($6.50) was pretty good, it wasn't anything special beyond the fact that it didn't have the usual soggy fried tortilla bowl. Mom had the House Special Nachos ($6.75) which were pretty tasty from what I could tell. Since I'm low carbin' I couldn't fully experience their crispy cheesy goodness. 

Perhaps in the future I will return when Im having an "off" day to try the delicious looking burrito's and enchilada's. Until then I get to use my own good values that my mother taught me so well.
