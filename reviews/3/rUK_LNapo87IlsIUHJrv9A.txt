went for lunch last week and hadn't realized that it was not the old dos. Menu looked fresh, and didn't have the typical 200 entre menu of the other mexican places in town.  The chips were fresh, but are flour-tortilla's, not corn, so they taste different.  Good, but I prefer corn. The salsa tasted fresh and they use all vegetable oil.  Veg options were decent, and not smothered in chihuahua cheese.
