You figured that because I'm a regular here I'd love the place but not so.  I enjoy them to a point and dislike them to a point. Well the good are that they're convenient located between a Chevron and Outback Steakhouse in a large shopping center near the strip, they're fast at least at night when there hasn't been a lot of people during lunch it get busier but they manage, they're friendly they sometimes crack jokes, and they're huge in size. Sometimes, well most times, their burritos are so big that they struggle to close it up which are both good and bad because it spills out while you eat even with the foil wrapped around but it's fills you.  They're huge that after I eat the whole thing I ask myself why did I do that.  More of the bad are that the fillings are cold not warm or hot but cold.  It just kills the burrito for me when I'm eating it and bite after bite I get a cold piece of something here and there.  There is a solution for this though order the bowl and ask for additional tortillas.  You can heat up the ingredients in the bowl and wrap your burrito to manageable sizes.

I enjoy the layout lots of interior seatings and lots of exterior seatings in its outside covered patio area.
