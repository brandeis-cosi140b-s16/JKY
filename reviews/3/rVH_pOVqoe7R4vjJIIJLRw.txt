I'd love to give this place 4 stars, but...stopped in here for lunch while in Madison. Be sure to check in with Yelp so you get free chips and salsa - which are delicious, by the way. You can choose from four different salsas at the salsa bar. We had the red and green medium, both of which were very yummy. Had a classic mango margarita - delish. So the reason I'm giving only 3 stars is because of the food. I had the steak tacos...first of all, there was hardly any meat on them and secondly, the steak was very tough and chewy. Very disappointing. My husband had the shrimp tacos which he said were skimpy on the shrimp (seems to be a theme here), but were good. A positive note about the ambiance: a lot of restaurants have TV screens all over the place, so your attention naturally diverts to that instead of the person or people you're dining with. This place didn't have TV screens - which is a huge plus in my book. Also, they were playing good music - not pop music - and it was low enough where it was just noticeable. Perfect.
