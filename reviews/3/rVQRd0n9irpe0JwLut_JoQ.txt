Zteja's consistently delivers good food. I frequent the Chandler location for lunch because it's near my office. "Satisfied" is the feeling I walk away with every time.... Not ecstatic, not disappointed.   I particularly like that they've updated their menu to include vegetarian and gluten-free sections.  They've always offered these selections, but you had to pick through it and remove meat... but get charged for it!  The new menu allows you to get regular items without meat at a reduced price... me likely ;-).  

My favorites are the Ancho Chopped Salad (Minus the meat and bacon) and the mushroom enchiladas.   Their chips and salsa are okay, but not really worth paying the $4 for.  I would recommend holding off for the corn bread... hint, hint... they don't bring it out until you order, it kills their ability to up-sale! 

I definitely recommend Zteja's for lunch, its good food with quick service (45min out the door).  My actual rating is 3.5, but that's not an option.
