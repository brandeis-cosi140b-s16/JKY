This place was a pleasant surprise. I didn't really know what to expect, but I was pleased with my experience. Service was a tad bit slow, but it's a big restaurant so I understand. It's also a little more expensive than I think it should be. The upside to that is that the portions are big and you'll definitely be full when you walk out. 

They start you out with chips and salsa, which are pretty good. If you order the guacamole then someone will come to your table and make it right in front of you. It isn't really a new idea, but I think it's a good one. I got the chicken chimichanga. It was amazing! My only complaint is that it wasn't larger. They give you a large portion in sides...stuff like lettuce, salsa, guac, rice, beans. I would recommend it for anyone looking for good Mexican food in Pittsburgh.
