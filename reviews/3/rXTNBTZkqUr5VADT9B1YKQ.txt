Went here for lunch. They had one server working which slowed things down but not enough to complain about, the server still did a pretty good job but I could see the more sensitive type knocking off for it. The food took a bit but the portions are pretty big. My wife got a bean and cheese  chimi and I got the Mexican pizza. The Mexican pizza was pretty much a cheese crisp folded over with some type of green chili. The Mexican pizza wasn't bad, about 3-31/2 stars and my wife liked her dish ok but nothing too good. The beans were not the best and nor was the guacamole. The soda was flat and tasted pretty bad. The chips and salsa were nothing to write home about. But again, the portions are big and the food is decent but I doubt we'll be back anytime soon.
