I thought is was mediocre. I had the menudo which had toooo much tripe, but very tasty! I will order again. my husband had a red chili burro, which was horrible. I also had a bean and cheese burro that was very good! I wouldn't recommend this place to friends, but I will return to try new items on their menu.
