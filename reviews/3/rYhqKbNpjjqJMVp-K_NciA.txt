Being from Iowa I mourned the loss of Panchero's when I moved out here.  I was SO EXCITED when someone finally franchised it out here in PHX but I have to agree with a lot of others that the vibe of this location doesn't live up to the ones I visited back home.

People like to compare P's to Chipotle but I have to scream "its not even close!!!!" when I hear that.  Pancheros fresh presses and cooks their tortillas in front of you so you don't get some flour-y mess that sat on a truck for days waiting to be delivered then sits in a warmer until you order.  They also give your burrito a nice mixing that way you don't get a bite of pico, a bite of rice, a bite of chicken and a mouthful of sour cream when you eat your burrito.

The reason I don't give this place 5 stars is the staff.  Sometimes I go and the staff is friendly and attentive.  Other times I go and the staff ignores me to play around and I feel awkward because I am not part of the inside joke.  Other times the staff is just plain incompetent like the girl who burned my Quesadilla twice and another staff member had to step in to complete my order.

All in All I give the place a 5 for food, 5 for value and a 1 for customer service/staff.
