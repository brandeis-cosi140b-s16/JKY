Good food, i love their salas! Too expensive and the service is terrible. I had my friends birthday last year and everyone enjoyed the food. Our drinks were left empty for long peroids of time, and you better hope they got your order right the first time because youre never going to see your waiter again... We didnt see our waiter until her brought our bill, and he also forgot to split our checks and then complained when we asked him to, were only had three different checks... I doubt we will go back again.
