Loved the decor, made me feel like I was in Mexico. 
Pleasant staff and the place was clean.
I thought the food was a bit blah, I got the carnitas tacos, it came with rice & beans. But I don't know why they bothered, it was in this tiny bowl, I mean tiny! Like an inch and a half wide.
My boyfriend got the fish tacos but again they didn't have much flavor.
Disappointed, as it's in the neighborhood and the decor was so nice... I had high expectations.
Won't be going back.
