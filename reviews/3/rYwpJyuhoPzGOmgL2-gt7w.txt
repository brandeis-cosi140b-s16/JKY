STICK TO THE TACOS!  I can't give better advice than this.  If you like walking into a sketchy neighborhood for lunch just to prove your manhood, this could be your place. 

The style of cuisine is stew based, so the use of the meats in anything other than a taco proved to be a greasy mess.  I ventured into both taco and burrito county, the tacos were rich and tasty, the burrito fell apart under the stress of the grease.

But as for the meats themselves, they were done perfectly for Michoacan style. Rich flavors pushing through letting your know that time and effort was put in to make this good.  Pleasant enough atmosphere that I wouldn't stop my lunch crew from diving into the hole in the wall again.
