Food and service are consistantly good - you have to order your margarita with specific instructions, otherwise you get a glass of sweet & sour.  Some staff appear to be lost or just hanging around but that doesn't affect my dining experience.  However, we always sit in the lounge so we can watch sports on the TV's.  Large outdoor patio is usually busy when we're not 100 degrees.
