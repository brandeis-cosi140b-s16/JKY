Decent chimichangas and good margaritas.

Honestly, I probably wouldn't remember Casa de Lara enough to warrant a review if it weren't for the spiders.  It was a warm September night and we ate on the back deck, where a surprisingly large spider population clung to the nearby building wall.  They weren't close to us or threatening, just there.
