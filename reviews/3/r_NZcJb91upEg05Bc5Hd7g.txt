I only got a chance to eat here once during my week long stay at the Tuscany.  The food was pretty good but the drinks were terrible.  I had the worst mojito of my life here and my friends didn't enjoy their margaritas very much either.  

I got the mushroom and spinach enchiladas and they were good.  My friend got the appetizer platter and she liked it and my other friend got a burrito and he seemed happy with it.

The service was OK.  We got a lady that didn't speak much English trying to take our drink order.  I had to use my rusty Spanish to order the drinks.  And then we didn't see much of the waiter and we had to wait for our check a little bit.

I would go back when I'm here next year but I will skip the drinks and make my own in my room for a fraction of the cost :o)
