The food was good although I wish they had ground beef.. The store was clean as a  normal fast food enviroment . The TV was in spanish so I couldnt  understand much that was being said. The staff was not real friendly or engageing although they stayed busy even though there were very few drive thru customers and no walkins while I was there..I was the only dine in customer my whole time there.. maybe timing....
