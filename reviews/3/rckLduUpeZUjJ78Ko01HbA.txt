I was so excit d to try out this place... Cute inside and love their salsa bar but their food in my opinion doesn't live up to all the hype .. Paying 2.25 for el Pastor taco the size if my palm with about 3pieces of meat in it wasn't worth it in my opinion... Not bursting with flavor it's just average... Won't be back unfortunately:(  staff is friendly though and helpful and the place is clean ..three stars
