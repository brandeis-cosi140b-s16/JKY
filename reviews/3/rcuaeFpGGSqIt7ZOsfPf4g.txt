I must say..Iv been a chipotle lover for years but I have noticed a steady decline in quality over time. My experience tonight fell short. The tomatoes in the mild salsa were old, the chips were stale, and the meat was fatty. The saving grace was that the staff was friendly. Get it together chipotle, I don't want to be forced to break up with you!
