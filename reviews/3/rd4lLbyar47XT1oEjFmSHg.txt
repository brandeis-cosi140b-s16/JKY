Style over substance.  Who puts goo over edamame and bakes it to boot?  Fusion?  I guess that's what you can call it but it was a pretty disgustng appetizer.  Go for the sushi.  Very nice.  Don't think you're getting anything by bellying up to the bar during happy hour.  No real discounts here and food choices limited and extremely small portions.  Think I'm kidding? Try the $2.50 per piece chicken tacos ......or dare to ask why the guacamole and chips to "go with" are ala carte from one another?  Really? Who doesn't give their clients an equal chips to dip ratio?  These are just chips for goodness sakes.   Commendable Wait Staff-Caitlin.  Everyone else is too busy checking their smart phones.  And yes, the smart phones are smarter than the users....bar waitress was insulting and hostess staff was pretty clueless. Be interestng to see if they are still here in a year. Good luck.
