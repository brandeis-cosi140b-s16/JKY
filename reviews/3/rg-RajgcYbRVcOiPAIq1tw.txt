While food is good, the service experience is unacceptable. No hostess available and we were sat down by one of the servers. The server took 10 minutes to greet us at the beginning. Since we had time to analyze the menu, we were ready to order drinks as well as food. 
We had: Calamari ( needed a few more seconds in the fryer), cantimpalitos ( excellent), tortilla (good), scargots ( probably canned, sauce was great). Bread service was good. Skip the sangria saince it was weak and watered down. 
Back to service: not even one table check, we had to waive for service for several minutes while being ignored by several staff members. We ordered round two of tapas, no table bussing or drinks offered. 
Without going into technical service issues, the staff need to be trained in genuine customer service. Smiling and general hospitality were completely absent from the place. Server was obviously " in the weeds" without a busser or assistant for the entire table turn. 
Will I be back? 
Maybe for an order to go....
