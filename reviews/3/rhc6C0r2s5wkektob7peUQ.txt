I've honestly eaten here at least once a month over the last couple of years with different friends and family. Some have loved it and some have not but have never personally had a bad experience until now.

The good: it was a weekday afternoon so it wasn't too busy. The hostess is always friendly as was our waiter this time. Fresh chips, warm bean dip and tortillas being made just a few feet away.

The bad: ordered a chicken enchilada but was served beef. When I brought it to the waiter's attention, he informed me I could find chicken in the other half of the enchilada and then walked away. Really? 

The ugly: the sopa tarasca was extra oily. So much so, I could only take a few bites. We asked for the check three times and every time was told "oh my god I'm so sorry". 45 minutes later we got our check after our party of four stood up to walk out because we couldn't wait for it anymore.


Three stars because aside from the oily soup, everyone enjoyed their food. Even my beefy chicken enchilada.
