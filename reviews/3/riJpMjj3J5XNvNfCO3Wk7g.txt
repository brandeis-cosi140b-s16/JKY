i am a chipotle fanatic and am destined to try chipotles everywhere. look not much to say about this place other than the fact yes, the food was alright did not notice anything wrong with it but WOW the staff is just not cutting it. the store is pretty much a walk in order and leave type of place and its small. so the fact they had 4/5 workers at one time is bizarre because my trip and my friend's separate trip we both waited and our process took 20 minutes each. like what?! also, i asked for extra rice and i received regular amount of rice. not a fan of that. cashier was unexperienced and took way too long. sorry, as a chipotle believer i was let down. GET IT TOGETHER!
