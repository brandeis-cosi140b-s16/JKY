It's no Chipotle, but it wasn't bad. The place is clean, the people are nice and the ability to customize your food is great. They did have more menu selections compared to Chipotle so I will go back and see if there is something more my style then their burritos... So plus one for that. Taste wise I'm a Chipotle girl.
