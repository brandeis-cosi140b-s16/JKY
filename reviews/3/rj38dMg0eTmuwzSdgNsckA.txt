This place is just like the other place I reviewed. Nothing different about reviewing this place like the other one so I'm just going to copy and paste my other review from another Del Taco just a few miles down from this one.....

This is the new 4th meal baby! Kick that taco bell out the curb and order some chipotle soft/hard tacos. Even them carbon tacos aka. street tacos. I'd take this over Taco Bell any day. I'm not really a fan of fast food, but I like this place alright! Bean burrito with green sauce FTW over taco bell's bean burrito thas fasho.
