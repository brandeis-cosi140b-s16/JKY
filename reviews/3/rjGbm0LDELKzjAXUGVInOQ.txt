I decided to try this place since it has changed owners. I went through the drive thru, I ordered a machacca breakfast burrito. So when I got to the window to pay, I seriously had to wait 5 min before they would even come to the window to take my money. I wasn't sure if they even took my order. Anyway, then appeared a 10-12 year old kid obviously working the counter and drive thru. I have no problem with giving kids jobs/ or family members but I felt sorry for him for having to deal with it all! He was very sweet and polite but seriously? My burrito was good but the red salsa was way too salty and by that I mean.. I think someone accidentally dumped the the whole salt container. I love yo support mom and pop places but not when they manage like this
