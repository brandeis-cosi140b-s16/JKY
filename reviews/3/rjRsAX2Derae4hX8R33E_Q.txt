Reboot!
Make way for a new menu.  
Smaller menu and probably more to the tastes of what most in this area think of as Mexican food.

Stopped by a couple of weeks ago and they had stopped making most items and only had some tacos, burritos and a few other simple items on the menu.  Was told to stop back in a few weeks. 

The new menu seems to be shorter and has some interesting items.   Notice they still have the Sopa Azteca, really good last time but decided not to order since not real hungry.  Ordered the Lomitos Majahual, a marinated port in a red sauce served with rice, beens and a salad.  Received 3 tortillas, so you can stuff a tortilla or eat it off the plate.  

The food was hot and good.  The pork was 4 large chunks with a nice tasting red sauce.  One piece of the pork seemed to be overcooked, but the rest not. Not sure how that happens.  

You can also get a beer or Margarita with your meal.

It was not busy but I still think later, when this place gets crowded, it will be hard to get the food out fast enough with so many tables.
