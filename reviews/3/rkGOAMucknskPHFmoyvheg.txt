I've always been a sucker for Mexican food--fast or slow made.  To me either kind of taco and burrito is usually satisfying.  So, I'm glad Taco Bell exists for some Mexican fare that is quick and good when one is on the run.  Thus I gobbled down a Burrito Supreme, Crunchy Taco Supreme, and large drink, followed by a 99 cent  Crunchy Taco and $1.09 Bean Burrito here while Diane was undergoing a CT Scan at Nellis AFB in the midst of an ER visit, before heading right back  to the hospital.  The #1 Combo supplemented by another taco and another burrito (I was famished!) nicely filled the bill.

Staff were friendly and helpful, and the place was clean.  No truly authentic Mexican victuals here--but still tasty fare in a pinch!

XXX-1/2 overall!
