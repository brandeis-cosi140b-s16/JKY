I think El Santo has a lot of potential.  It's the slightly more mature cousin of Spanish Fly, in Old Town.  It's set up well with a large pool, cabanas, and plenty of areas to lounge around and walk.  The DJ plays a good mix, and I'm pretty sure this is where most of the old Barcelona crowd ended up, emphasis on the old.  

I had a cabana here for my birthday, with a complimentary bottle of champagne, which was nice.  Unfortunately the female servers couldn't seem to get it together.  It took more than 30 minutes to get the bottle, even though it was not even close to being busy that night.  They did a terrible job of coming back to get us more drinks.  Eventually we were forced to wander to the closest bar to serve ourselves.  After that when the waitress showed up, we let her know that we were walking around from time to time, but still wanted to keep the cabana.  Next time we got up, they cleared out all our stuff, and then looked genuinely surprised when I asked them about it.  Wonder why you didn't get a good tip that night, girls?

I understand why places like this hire pretty girls, but if they can't bring me my drinks, or follow simple instructions, then they're useless to me.  If they got some girls in there who had a clue, this place could really be great.
