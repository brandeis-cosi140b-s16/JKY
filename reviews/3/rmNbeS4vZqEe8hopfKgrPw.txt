The Drive Thru times wasn't that bad, 6mins. I can live with that, of course the others waited way longer. I ordered The Standard with cheese, pretty good! It wasn't the WOW factor I was expecting. Blame @johnjayvanes for that one. The sauce was okay but it didn't bring anything out, maybe jalapenos to give that extra flavor. They have a special between 11am-3pm, you get a free side of fries. Free!? Sure I'll take it. Should've actually left it, if cooked fully, it wouldn't have been bad. But over half of the fries were way under cooked, a few were still raw.

But what I really wanted from The Stand was the Dulce de Leche shake. I'm a big sweet and salty fan, plus ice cream? This is up my alley. Five bucks was on the high side, but it didn't disappoint. It looked NO WHERE near the picture posted on the main business page here. It was extra blended and the guy actually wiped up the side before handing it over (thank you for that). Regardless, it was delicious! I'll be returning for the shake only.
