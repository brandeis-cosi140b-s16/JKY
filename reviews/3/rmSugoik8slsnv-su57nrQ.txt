A dive in a rough part of town, but the food is cheap, good, and authentic. Can't beat it with a stick.  

When I asked for the Chicken Enchilada to be served with the mole instead of the standard red sauce, they looked at me a little weird, but did it anyway (thanks!)  It was GREAT!

Served with a big glass of horchata, it was the perfect late night meal.
You don't have to speak Spanish to eat here, but it helps.
