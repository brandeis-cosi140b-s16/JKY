Decided to try Fausto's Mexican Grill to see how it stacks up to Roberto's. It wasn't bad. They have an extensive menu to choose from. I tried a chicken soft taco combo that was pretty decent. I LOVE frijoles and these weren't bad either. It's a keeper for nearby, quick, and inexpensive Mexican food when the craving strikes me, which is often...heehee.
