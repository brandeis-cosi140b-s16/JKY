The experience here was very mixed. The food (guacamole burrito and fish tacos) was great. But service was spotty. The waiter seemed inexperienced but he tried hard. No ice in our water glasses on a hot day. He informed us that they don't have a blender to make frozen margaritas with.  He mixed up the hot salsa with the mild. The in-house sangria had plenty of alcohol in it but it seemed that they made it in a hurry rather than letting the fruit infuse into the wine slowly, meaning that there wasn't a lot of fruit flavoring in the drink.

No signs showing where the restrooms were (up a steep flight of stairs). Very loud in the restaurant because there's no carpeting (brick floors). The view of empty lots is terrible. Some window decorations might solve that.

Pasqual's just opened recently.  I think with time they'll fix their problems. We'll certainly try them again.
