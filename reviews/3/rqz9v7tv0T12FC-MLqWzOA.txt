It is such a far drive around 15 min from the LV strip to this place.  the wait is kind of long, but the wait for food is much longer.  I ordered to-go the bulgogi nachos and tacos.  It took around 30 minutes for the food to come out.  It is tasty but I would not drive this far for OKay tasting food.
