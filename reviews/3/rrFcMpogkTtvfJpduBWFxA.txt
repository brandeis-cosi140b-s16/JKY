I've been here a few times and it's alright...americanized mexican food that's pretty tasty.  Personally my favorite thing on the menu is the appetizer nachos with beef.  They serve it smothered in a lot of cheese and beef...it's served with this creamy/spicy/cheesy sauce that I have no idea what it is, but it's damn good.  Also, the chips on the nachos and the chips from the chips and salsa they serve when you're seated  are always crisp and stay crisp throughout the meal...pretty good.  I had the fish tacos the first time I was here and had the shrimp tacos the last time.  The fish was okay and the shrimp really didn't have much flavor.  They use a lot of sauces with the tacos...kinda like spicy sour creams.  The sauces taste good, but they drown out the other tastes in the dish.

If it weren't for the nachos I would probably give this place two stars.
