Had a delightful lunch today except for the raucous noise (can't call it music).  First of all we had a hard time communicating with Brittany - couldn't hear- and many of the lyrics were just repeated so many times in a row it was maddening!  My dog could have sung better ooomlats than the "singers" did.  Who selects the "music"?

Food 4 star

Music - thumbs down
