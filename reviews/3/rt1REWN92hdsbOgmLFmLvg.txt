There is a good reason everyone else has raved about the molcajetes at this place.  It is probably the best dish to order here and is very good.  I wish they would have given me more tortillas though; I only had three, and it is a lot of food to eat.  You have to chop all the ingredients up yourself, but once you do that it is cool enough to eat after having come out sizzling hot to the table!

My family ordered various other plates and they didn't seem as jazzed as me about their selections.  My mom had the Pozole.  It was really good actually but the portion is HUGE, so make a meal out of it by itself.  My dad griped that his tacos dorados with shredded beef weren't deep fried like they do in all the taco shops in the the southwestern states.  At least they were a bit healthier this way.  I liked them.

The chips and salsa brought to the table were good.  I liked the salsa a lot - a nice spicy and smoky flavor.  The margaritas, however, left something to be desired.  They put way too much sweet and sour and triple sec.  Even at $3.50 I think I would just stick with a beer.
