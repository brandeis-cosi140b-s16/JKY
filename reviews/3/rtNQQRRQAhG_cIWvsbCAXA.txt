This is a decent place with the exception of a few things. I've been here a few times and for a Mexican restaurant its average. The quality of the food is overall delicious. Free chips and salsa and the portion sizes were pretty big. The burrito quesadillas is huge. 

Any-who, the only problem I had was that when I was given the dish for the salsa it was not clean, so I sent it back and they gave me a clean one. My friend that I was with had the same problem. I would think they would check these things before they gave it out, but they didn't. 

The prices are okay and comparable to other places such as Chipotle or Maize. I will be back again.
