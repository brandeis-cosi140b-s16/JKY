I like the small business owner feel to the restaurant as it creates a more personal experience. The prices are very fair (especially for students who receive an additional discount with their student ID) and Veracruz offers a more extensive menu than the chain restaurants which surround Veracruz do. I also love the fact that Veracruz serves Horchata as there are not to many locations in Pittsburgh which offer the delectable rice and cinnamon based drink.
