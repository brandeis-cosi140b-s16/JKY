I enjoyed their options. I'm used to the "white or brown rice" and "black or pinto beans." They offered white or Spanish, the Spanish rice was delicious. They offered black or refried, and oh girl, that refried was so good. I got the Al Pastor, and it was okay. I enjoyed my lunch but wouldn't have picked it again.
