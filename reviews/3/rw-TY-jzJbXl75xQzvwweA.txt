Like others have said,  food was good but the service was slow.  Chips were average but the salsa was good.  I had an enchillada plate and cleaned up everything on my plate.  Perfect size portion IMO.  Bar area has 3-4 large TVs.  Good place to watch a game, play some billards or catch happy hour,  but this probably wouldnt be a good "date" restuarant.
