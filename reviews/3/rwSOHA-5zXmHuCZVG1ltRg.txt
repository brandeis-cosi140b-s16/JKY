Finally tried this place over the weekend for lunch. I really wanted to like Sabor more than I do. For one, it's close to my home. Secondly, I appreciate ethnic food, and this is pretty authentic (at least for Elizabeth). 
The joint was blasting latino music, I almost felt like I should dance a little. It's happy music in my ears, granted I have 2 left feet when it comes to latin dancing. I wanted to try something new, so I opted for the Arepas ($4.50).
Checking in got me some free chips, so I ordered a side of guacamole as well ($1.25). And by side I meant a condiment plastic cuppy size.  They did pack quite a bit of guacamole in that small thing. While it tasted fresh, it was a little bland. Could use some salt/seasoning.
The arepas came out piping hot, like burning fingers hot. The corn cakes were crispy. It's stuffed with shredded chicken & cheese. It has a creamy/mayo based sauce on it. But again, it was bland. I was hoping for more flavor. While it wasn't bad, it wasn't great.
So at the end I ended up packing up the unfinished food... which I gave to my dad since he didn't have lunch.
