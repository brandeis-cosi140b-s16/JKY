This was highly-recommended by some friends who have been coming here since they were kids. The green chili carne was definitely 5-star ... right up there with the best I've ever had. Rice and beans good too, as well as chips and very good salsa. 

My husband loves chicken chimichangas/pollo fundidios. So, he got that. He said it was ok, but he wasn't too impressed, as he would rather get his from Garcias or Someburros. 

Daughter had bean burrito, and we shared a good cheese crisp. 

Oh -- I had a margarita on the rocks. Decent price, but not a decent margarita. Too much like that fakey mix taste and was there any tequila in there? Not bad for the price; but I would just get water with lemon next time. 

I'll want to go back to try other items, though I may have to order that green chile burro again .. so good.
