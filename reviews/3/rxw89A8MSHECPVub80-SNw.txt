Not much food on the menu but prices aren't bad. this place is a whiskey and tequila joint so I was expecting them to be able to mix it up but it was disappointing. I asked for some common drinks such as Midori Sour, Irish redhead, seven and seven. None was available. Really disappointed with that. I waited about 10 minutes for my waitress to come back around just so I can order the drink. But the chips and quest was delicious. Margaritas are great also. Altogether a great food place but I expected better since under the name it says tacos, tequila and whiskey. That's why I have a 3.
