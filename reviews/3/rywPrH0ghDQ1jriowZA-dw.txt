X-Tapa Joe's is yet another mexican restaurant in Scottsdale that's alright, but nothing all that special.  It'll satisfy your taste buds, but will not blow them away.  It's also a little overpriced.  Fortunately, there is a $30 for $15 gift certificate on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  That definitely makes the place worth a try.

I had the spinach enchiladas. Pretty standard.  My wife had the chicken fajitas.  Again, pretty standard, but the tortillas were ridiculously big, more burrito sized than taco.  I will give X-Tapa Joe's credit for having the chips and salsa brought to the table just seconds after being seated.  I will not complain about that!

X-Tapa Joe's calls itself an upscale mexican restaurant.  There's a hilarious hypocrisy to this description.  There are handwritten paper signs all over the restaurant and handwritten changes to the menu.  Pretty cheap and low scale.  I think The only thing that was upscale was the price of the average at best food.
