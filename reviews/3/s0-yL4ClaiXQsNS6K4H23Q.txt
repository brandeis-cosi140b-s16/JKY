I really wanted to like this place because I love the idea of a Korean taco but they fell short.  I tried one of each taco and didn't feel they were well executed.  The tacos have a lot of juice and gets all over your hands if you're not careful, so it doesn't work that great as street food.  Also, I thought the kimchi tasted too sour and overpowered the meat.  However, I did really like their fries and though the seasoning was really tasty, similar to Cajun fries.
