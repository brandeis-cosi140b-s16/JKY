Love love love the food, but this is one of the slowest Chipotles around! There was a short girl and a really talkk guy that worked there and would really move the line along and they were friendly, but they was gone for a time and the place really fell apart. I have patience, but when the line is literally out the door and employees are moving at a snail's space and too busy laughing with one another, it's gets frustrating. Luckily, that short girl was back the last time I visited and it was a good experience again!!
