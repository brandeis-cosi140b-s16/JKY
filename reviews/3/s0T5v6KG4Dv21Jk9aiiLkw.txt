I was shocked that 29 people had even been to this place when we drove up for lunch today. The menu is a decent size but they might be trying to do too much. I had the chicken club. The bacon was great but the chicken was chewy (tasted like it was thawed too quickly). The diet Pepsi also had a strange taste. Next time (I'll go back because it was alright and super close to work), I'll get a BLT because that bacon was 2.8 of my three stars.
