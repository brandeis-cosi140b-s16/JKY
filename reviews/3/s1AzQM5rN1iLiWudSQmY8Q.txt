This is one of my fail safe hole-in-the-wall eateries. They are consistently good and fast, as a matter of a fact I used to eat here even when they were on Southern Ave. All the breakfast burritos are huge and flavorful. Superb rolled tacos and sauce (although I wish they had more meat inside their still darn good). The service is friendly and they keep the tables pretty clean (unless you go during lunch rush at which that point it becomes an utter zoo). Better than Filliberto's and won't give you gas afterwards. Plus they are cheap- long live $5 lunches!
