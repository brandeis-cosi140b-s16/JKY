My husband's choice. He loved it.  I, on the other hand, thought it was just ok. For a taco shop, it's a bit overpriced.  I think our total meal came out $40-$50 and we didn't have any alcoholic beverages.  I've had better in Phoenix for the prices (Barrio Cafe) and would rather visit a real taco shop and eat for $10 than go back.  That being said, the staff is very nice and the food was good.  Their salsa bar is very enticing.
