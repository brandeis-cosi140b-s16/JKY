This has been my second-favorite place to eat in Flagstaff, so I was looking forward to having it down in the Valley. 

It was kind of disappointing. The horchata wasn't great as it had been each time up north, although the container was almost empty. Several minutes later when staff refilled it, I tried a little, and it was probably better, although I had drank enough by then. 

I did add the hazelnut "shots" to the beverage and that made it pretty flavorful.

However the food itself didn't impress me, either. I got what I know I like. This time it seemed dry. I asked for more salsa, and the woman added two more scoops of pico. I think what it needed was twice as much regular salsa as they added.

I got the veggie burrito. I would have liked to see bell peppers and onions added inside it. They don't seem to have those staple Mexican ingredients. It was just beans and rice in there, and a little salsa and maybe pico de gayo and cheese.

It was good. Just dry. And not what I was used to, or expecting.

Although my aunt and uncle went there with me to experience their first visit. They both liked it.

That's why it's three stars, instead of two. Because it disappointed me (leaving me "low and dry"), although it was still good, just not as good as what I'm used to having from the other location.
