Open until about 10pm nightly, in what at that hour is the deserted Maricopa drag, this sort of "hidden in the parking lot" dining destination deserves to be distinguished as delectable domestic, deliciousness.  Don't think that you cannot get Menudo on Saturday and Sunday, or mejillones served in a vodka sauce!  

The prices are moderate and the atmosphere is cantina.  While I was eating there late one evening on a Tuesday night, I was actually  repulsed when a decision was made by the hostess to begin a cleaning up regiment using nothing less poignant than Pine Sol!  I gasped, I choked my Rocky Point Fajita, and I glared evilly at the kitchen door.  Don't think I did not pack my remaining food and take it to a less "resin scented" area to enjoy it without that hassle.  In fact, I want to give this place another star, but I cannot when such poor judgement was made.
I guess at least the place is thoroughly cleaned.
Muy bueno!
