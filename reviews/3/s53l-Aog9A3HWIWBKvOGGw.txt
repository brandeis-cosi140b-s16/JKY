This place was my favorite till I ordered the Super Nachos it tastes like Taco Bell but worse.  Fake cheese sauce, meat, beans, guacamole and sour cream.  Hardly edible to choke down.  No tomatoes, no onions, no REAL cheese, zilch.  Seriously they must have pounds of shredded cheese and they used plastic cheese sauce instead for nachos. Most of the food is good would've given it 5 stars if they didn't mess up something so simple.
