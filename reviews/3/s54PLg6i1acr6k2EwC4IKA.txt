The problem with this Taco Bell is the complete lack of organization. I know someone who works there. He spent over a month calling and coming in at specified times only to be told the manager he had the meeting with was not there. After a little over a month, we find out that manger was fired. Then the lady who took his place was a tiny bit more organized. Now, 3 months later, the person I know works the line and has yet to be officially trained on anything. He has never done the computer work or safety training. He asks about it and is told there is no time. He was thrown on the line the first day, with absolutely no knowledge of what he is to do. If the management would step it up and train the employees, they may be surprised at the quality and reliability of their teams. I have first hand witnessed the manager lie to cover her lack of effort. with the knowledge I have now, I'd say these kids are doing a remarkable job.
