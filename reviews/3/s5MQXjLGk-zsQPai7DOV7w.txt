Like other Yelpers who have reviewed before me, pretty much a replica of Robertos. Same options, same flavor, same prices, only difference is their drive-thru. Small salsa bar inside too. I ordered the #4 two cheese enchiladas and the flavor was severely lacking!!! But the carne asada burrito was delicious, and we also had a torta which was ok to. Open 24/7
