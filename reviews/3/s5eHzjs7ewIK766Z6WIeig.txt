The building is super awesome but the food and drinks haven't impressed me yet.  I've been here a couple times and some of the tacos were good and some were lacking.  The al pastor was good but super spicy and not as sweet as pastor usually is.  I liked the shrimp taco but there wasn't anything amazing about it.  Maybe go once just to see it, maybe have a drink, but go across the street to Gadzooks or down the street to America's Taco shop for better food.
