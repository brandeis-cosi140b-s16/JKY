Your chips and salsa are dynamite - chips are warm and crunchy, lightly salted and the salsa is spiced just right. But your entrees leave a little something to be desired. I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Service is quick and friendly but the food again - just okay. I could compare you to another local family-owned Mexican restaurant here in the valley.
