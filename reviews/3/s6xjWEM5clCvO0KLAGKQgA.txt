I have to struggle with this rating here.  I stopped in for Taco Tuesday  ($1.00 tacos) and a beer.  The place was empty and I was served up a beer and free chips and salsa immediately. 

The salsa was delicious, some of the best I've ever had. It was thick and had a little bit of a kick to it. 

The place is very clean, service was fast and courtious and the background Spanish/Mexican music was not too loud or too soft.  

So why the three stars? The server asked if I wanted hard or soft shell tacos and I said hard. But when they arrived they were soft shell.  I didn't make a fuss about it... hey, it's a dollar taco!  They still tasted better than Taco Bell.

A couple came in while I was nursing my beer and the girl ordered soft tacos with no tomatoes. I heard her say this twice and her tacos came with tomatoes. There's gotta be a disconnect between the servers and the kitchen and for that reason I rate them a three.
