The typical Tex-Mex place.  Another spot in Champaign that seems like it has been open forever.  The building is made of adobe, with a great shaded outdoor seating area.  A few dinning areas inside with a bar in the back room as well.

Service is hit or miss, depending on how many people are here.  The food is very typical for this kind of joint.  Tacos, burritos, chimichanga, and various lunch specials and combinations.  Globs of refried beans and starchy rice.  A bunch of different margaritas, and a crap beer list.

That is it.  Good for a nostalgic trip when visiting the family.  Though nothing to go out of your way for.
