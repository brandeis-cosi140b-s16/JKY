Cool place, good tacos. I hv only been once and haven't had been driven to return on a special trip, but I would return if was downtown. 
The price seemed kinda high, about $7 for three super small tacos. I my opinion, they would sell more with better pricing??
A .99 taco would most likely promote the beer sales, just a thought :)
I like the place, the staff were great, I think it should do well.
