I tried a carne asada quesadilla and was grossed out by the huge amount of meat in the tortilla. Next, I tried guac and chips and was grossed out by the slimy guacamole. I thought I would never return.

The next week at school, however, I saw my teaching colleague enjoying a Filliberto's breakfast burrito and it looked delicious. She confirmed to me that their breakfast items are generally tastier than their lunch and dinner items.

That same week, I headed to Filiberto's for a bacon, egg and cheese burrito. In contract to my disgusting dinner choices, this menu item was delicious! The large tortilla, crispy bacon and real-tasting eggs made for a satisfying breakfast. I was definitely "full" for the morning AND lunch.

Come to Filiberto's for breakfast at dawn (or breakfast at lunch or dinner), but don't come back at dusk.
