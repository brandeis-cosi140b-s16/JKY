I have to admit, my friends had to drag me to this Chuys location because the one on Cave Creek and Thunderbird is horrible. This location, however, seems to cook their food when you order it rather than once a month.
I had the Tri Tip tacos and they weren't bad...they weren't delicious either but I wasn't horrified.
The staff was pretty friendly and everyone I was with seemed to enjoy their meal.
