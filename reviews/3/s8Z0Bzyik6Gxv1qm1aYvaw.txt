Just gotta be honest here... I wasn't too thrilled with Cabo this visit.  It was our 19th wedding anniversary... Went in with a party of 8 and were seated rather quickly. ..we had reservations but arrived an hour or so early... So that was nice of them to accommodate us. Three of us ordered fajitas... Which tasted great but the portions were so small! My son only had 3 strips of steak! I tasted my husbands chicken fajitas and the chicken was a little dry and flavorless...So disappointing! I usually order fajitas in other Mexican restaurants and end up taking a doggie bag home because there was just so much food... Not here!  And for the price I think they could have used more meat and veggies. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food... But just looking across the table... All I saw was small portions...but no one complained and everything looked great.  I do love the feel of Cabo though...I love how it is decorated, and the Salsa Bar is superb!  Love the margaritas too! Sunset Station is across town from us, but kind of sentimental...so We will definitely be going back to Cabo...just stating away from the fajitas.
