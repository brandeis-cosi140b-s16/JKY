Out of all the fast food joints I feel less awful about eating here vs anywhere else. call me crazy, I know.... 

So this location is new & clean. Service was good & quick. Textbook Taco Bell operating procedures. I've been hearing the adds, seeing the adds & I finally found a Taco Bell in route to my daily adventures so I decided to see if these breakfast menu items were something to brag about. I had the sausage waffle taco & my buddy had the bacon waffle taco. We both ate it due to being hungry but we were both like ehhhhhh I've had better.... The hash brown was good size in comparison to McDonald's but it was saturated in grease. It was an adventure accomplished but shortly lived. I can't see myself craving one more of these little taco breakfasts anytime soon. Guess the pancakewich is still reining supreme.
