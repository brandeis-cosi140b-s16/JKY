Pretty good food. Some items on the menu are better then others. I love the Chimichanga and the soft tacos. The service is good and you never have to wait long. Great neighborhood joint. I prefer them over Roberto's. The prices are also very reasonable. The place is around the corner from my house...no need for me to go anywhere else. Viva Taco serves its purpose.
