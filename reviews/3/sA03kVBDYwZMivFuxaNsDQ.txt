If it wasn't for it's great service I would have rate it a 2 star.  The good part of this restaurant is that they give you big portions; however, the bad thing is that the food is too greasy and mediocre.  To their credit, they are better than many Mexican restaurants in the city.  They are, however, not the best in town.  The margaritas are tasty but will get you as buzzed as much as a glass of lemonade will.  Whatever you do, do not try the chicken poblano, unless you like the taste of prune juice.
