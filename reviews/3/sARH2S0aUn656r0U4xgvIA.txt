The service is ok at this location. I sat at the bar and ate, so I always had the bartender at my service. Besides that, I think there was only 1 or 2 other servers (a little after lunch)

The food is pretty good. As always, I recommend the habenero salsa (you gotta ask for it, the standard salsa is average). I havent eaten anything at this location, but the other ones have good food. I got the pork street tacos at the 2 other locations and they were consistantly good.

As far as the booze goes, I was somewhat impressed. The bartender knew quite a bit about the different tequilas and they even had my favorite one, Cruz Tequila! mmmmmm. I had a standard margarita with Cruz and it was tasty. Not bad drink specials

I would recommend it if youve never been
