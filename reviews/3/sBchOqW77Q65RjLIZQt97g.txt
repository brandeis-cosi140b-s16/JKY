I eat Mexican at least five times a week so I am glad this is near by. Still, I wish they would step it up a notch. 

The concept is traditional mexican served fast food style as in chipotle or cafe Rio. Love it! Mexican for me should be quick and easy. Being able to customize is awesome too! But the food isnt the best-compared to fast food or authentic. 
Rice is bland. Choice of beans. All the toppings including a good pico de gallo.  Have to ask if you want your chesse melted. The only thing keeping me from moving in is the salsa. More tostitos in a can than the delicious, runny, cilantro infused salsa great places like el patron (check them out!) have. Even worse its served in small cups. I would need at least 20 to suffice my salsa craving. The service is great and the guy very nice but I doubt he would oblige.  
Great spot to eat and run but not sure its worth special attention.
