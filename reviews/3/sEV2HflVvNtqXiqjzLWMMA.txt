I agree with everything that has been said about the stunning interior of this restaurant, but you can't eat the eye candy. Unfortunately the food is sadly lacking. Every good Mexican cook knows soft tacos should be warmed a minute on the grill before stuffing. The sides seem like after thoughts that have not been seriously developed. The house sauces come in 3 small bottles tableside, but it's nearly impossible to get anything out of them. La Condezza on 16th Street with its impressive salsa bar delivers this same concept much better and cheaper.
