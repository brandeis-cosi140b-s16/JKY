The food is typically delicious.  It is New Mexican cuisine, not Central Mexican, etc.  Just ask them- they'll tell you.  This used to be one of our favorites, but they got too full of themselves as they got too full of customers.  They skimped on some ingredients (though you'd never know unless you started eating there soon after it opened).

The service became rude, with a few pleasant exceptions.  They started to nickel and dime (e.g. serving a tiny amount of Chipotle salsa and charging for a refill). They began adding an 18% gratuity to parties larger than four, then providing service deserving of no tip at all (and I am typically pretty generous since I know what being a server is like and appreciate that most servers are struggling financially).

We avoid it now.  However, we found the Blue Adobe in Mesa.  The food there is as good (which is a compliment) and the service is usually very friendly and attentive.

Try this place once, and see for yourself.  For a good test, go with a party of 6.
