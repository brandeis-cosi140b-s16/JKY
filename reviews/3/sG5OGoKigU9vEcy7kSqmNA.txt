The food is good and I'm pretty picky.  Stopped in here for lunch.  I was a little skeptical.   The space is quite large and loud and service was a little slow and disorganized.  Just as I was starting to regret the choice, our food arrived.  After one bite, all was forgiven.  I had the portabello veggie wrap.  It was served with salad on the side.  It was really really good.  Fresh ingredients, good flavor, not laden in oil or creamy dressings (most restaurants in Phoenix ruin veggie dishes by loading them down with fat and cheese).   I will come back for lunch just to have that wrap.  My cohort had the Reuben with slaw on the side.  It was also excellent and the slaw was fresh and light.  

Despite being a little slow, the service was friendly, and the scene was surprisingly low key.  I came straight from a hike in sweaty outdoor gear and did not feel self-conscious.  Also, the restaurant is so big that I can't imagine there every being that long of a wait, even at peak hours.

PS - Do NOT get the oatmeal. I think it is actually one of those instant Quaker microwave packets.  Bad.
