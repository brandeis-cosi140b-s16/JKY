Just okay. 

For some reason I can never understand/hear the staff at this location. I don't know if the music is too loud or there is too much background noise, but have to ask them to repeat themselves all the way down the line. 

Regardless of what I've ordered it always seems cold by the time I pay, get my drink and sit down to eat. Between not using foil, the air conditioning and the ceiling fans, it just makes for cold food. 

The chips and queso are tasty and are the only reason I let myself get talked into coming here from time to time.
