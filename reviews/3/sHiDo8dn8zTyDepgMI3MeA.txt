Decent for a quick bite.  My usual at any burrito shop is Carne Asada so my review is purely on that.  The burrito was very large and filling.  The meat itself was pretty blah.  Its not skirt or flap for sure.  To their defense you hardly ever get skirt or flap anywhere.  Maybe top round but I'm almost suspecting bottom round.  It was pretty dry.  Will grab a bite there when I don't have time for the others.  Its was pretty good.  Just not great.  Gonna have to try something else on the menu next time.
