Chayo is a new Mexican style restaurant located in the Linq.  It's right outside the Quad, near the new side entrance to the Flamingo.  The restaurant has a mechanical bull located near the middle of it, even though I'm not quite sure how that relates to a Mexican restaurant.  I've usually seen those type of things at country western bars.  Just seemed a bit tacky to me, but I'm sure it helps the nightlife business.

Anyway, on to the food.  The menu here is not large by any means, but they do have some standard tex-mex type cuisine.  You can get enchiladas, fajitas, tacos, etc.  I ordered the shrimp fajitas, which were $20+.  Just a piece of advice, skip the fajitas.  The shrimp was ok, but most of the other items were bland.  I almost forgot that we did have some chips and salsa, which were good.  The salsa was spicy, although not too bad.  The only drawback is that you have to pay for chips and salsa here ($3), and I know most of us aren't used to that.  Those are complimentary at every other Mexican restaurant I've ever been to, but hey, it's Vegas.  My wife ordered the chicken enchiladas, which were dynamite.  I would highly recommend those, as they are full of flavor.  Two people could easily split them.

Overall, I thought this place was pretty good.  Not my favorite, but certainly not bad.  I'd like to try one of the other restaurants in the Linq area next time.
