When you are looking for some good Mexican food, not tex-mex, nothing fancy, just good old Mexican 1900 is a good choice. Although the food isn't the greatest it hits the spot. Unfortunately on this visit the chips were very stale with a truly bland salsa. With that said we enjoyed the quesadillas and fajitas. The Refried beans with melted cheese, yum! The service was good, nothing spectacular and the margaritas could use a little more tequila, ha ha!
