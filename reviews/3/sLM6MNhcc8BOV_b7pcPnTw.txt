Been to fastfood for years and this place is nothing different. No matter what's the name of the place as long as its fast food. You will always get that crappy service, crappy food and the crappy place. What do you expect? Cheap price for a better service? Lets just be practical, 

if you want the best service and the best food. You will need to go other places than Taco bell.
