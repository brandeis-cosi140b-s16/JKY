I love Mexican Food!!! And the spicier the better!!  This place is OK.  I recently moved here from the East Coast so I have been looking to find the best Mexican Food here (feel free to contact with recommendations).

I have been here twice (it is less than 2 blocks from my house) and enjoyed it both times.  The food was OK.  I think they try to survive on being very hot.  However, my experience was that the food was tolerably hot.  Many seem to think the salsa is too hot.  I liked the green salsa a lot.  The red salsa was spicy, but not overly spicy in my opinion, but it did not taste good.

The gentleman that served me was very nice.  All in all, I think the food is OK.  The service is OK.  The only problem I had was that I though that the pricing was a bit expensive for typical Mexican fare.  Many of the dishes are $12 or over, with some of them topping $20.  I will continue to go here when I do not want to cook because it is close, but will certainly be checking out other places as well.
