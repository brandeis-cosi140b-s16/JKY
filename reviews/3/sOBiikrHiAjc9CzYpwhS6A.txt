The food here is excellent!  The service (in terms of how fast your food is prepared) is poor.  We came here for a lunch during the work day and we expected our lunch to take a little longer than normal, but this was a verrrrrryyy long lunch as we had to wait at least 30-40 minutes for our food.  It should be noted that the restaurant wasn't even at capacity.  I might come back on a weekend when I have more time to spare, but will not make this a regular place for workday lunches.

I ordered the paella and it was really tasty.  Funny enough, my favorite part of the meal was the flour tortillas they served on the side.  Those tortillas were to die for!  They were heavy, buttery, chewy, soft perfection, yum.  It was also enough food to take home and have another very filling meal.
