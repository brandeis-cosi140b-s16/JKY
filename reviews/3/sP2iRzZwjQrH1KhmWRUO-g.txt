The tortillas are very good, but the quality of the meat that they place therein is a bit of problem.  The first time I went I had the carne asado burrito, and although the taste was good, I chewed the meat in that thing for an hour and half and my jaw hurt. So the second time I went, I got the chicken burrito figuring the meat would be more tender. It was, but still the quality of the meat was lacking.  Again, the taste was decent. The third time I ordered a egg burrito for breakfast, and I must say that the quality of the eggs they put inside the burrito are just great.

Really low prices and some nice baked goods.  I would certainly buy a bag of the tortillas they sell at the counter.
