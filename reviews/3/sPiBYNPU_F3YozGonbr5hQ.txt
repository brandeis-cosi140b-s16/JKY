I don't think it quite compares to the main restaurant in north Mesa. Food is decent, but there is kind of a weird sterile creepy feel to the place. Why doesn't it smell like Mexican food? Or anything at all? 

It beats the Taco Bell across the street, but I would hold out for the main restaurant if possible.
