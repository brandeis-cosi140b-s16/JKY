Short and sweet. The food was decent, something not the same in the taste from the other locales I've had. I think it had something to the taste being a lil bland, not very seasoned on my carnitas Chimi. 
But the service for the most part was good, and we were approached by the manager so it was a nice overall friendly environment.
