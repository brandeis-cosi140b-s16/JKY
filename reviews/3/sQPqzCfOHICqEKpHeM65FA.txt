Been here several times and I figured it was time to write a review. Went in to grab some lunch on Friday and had the chile rellenos and the carne esada fries which are fries covered in meat, cheese, sour cream and guacamole. There is easily enough to feed 3 hungry people with the fries and it only costs 5 bucks. The chile rellenos were pretty good as well. It was the first time Ive tried them as I usually go fr a burrito or a chimichunga. I think I'll be having them again. Its nice to have a cheap, fast and fresh mexican place close to home.
