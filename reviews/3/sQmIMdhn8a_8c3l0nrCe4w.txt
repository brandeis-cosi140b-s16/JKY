Talk about ambiance, this micro-sized restaurant is located inside the convenience store at a Choice gas station.  There were but 2 employees, one on the grill working his tail off and a laid back counter person taking orders.  Most orders were to go, but we consumed our meal at the 5-6 seat counter.  We each chose a pair of mini (street) adobada tacos that were amply filled with spicy meat though the could have been a notch better served with crema.  I had to pay for our beverage separately from the cashier for the gas station/mini market.
