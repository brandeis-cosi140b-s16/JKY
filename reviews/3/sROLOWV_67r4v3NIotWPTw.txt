My fiance and I went here a few months ago. We wanted to try some good Mexican food, and we got it.

When we first walked in, the floors, the ceilings, the chandeliers.. everything was beautiful. But it was so slow. The service was ok, I ordered a Steak Quesadilla and it was freaking huge. He said it only had Steak and cheese in it, but they had put green peppers and onions in. I'm a fan of those two ingredients, but it just looks bad when you can't remember what comes in an item.

Despite everything being huge, the food was delicious and it came fast. The price was also great. We will definitely go back.
