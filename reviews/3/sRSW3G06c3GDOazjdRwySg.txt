Very popular.  Fresh and tasty food.  I had the carnitas chimichamga and a strawberry margarita.  Had to ask for my margarita twice.  Food took a long time but arrived hot and tasty.  Very noisy with the water and light show if you sit on the veranda.  The entire Sam's Town experience reminded me of Boomtown in Reno.  Interesting characters and lots of kids.  An upscale truck stop with a family theme.
