For me this is authentic Mexican fast food, but then I am a white girl from the Midwest. Every so often I get a craving for Tacos El Compita. My husband and I make the trek there and order so much food - several tacos, a quesadilla, a huge torta, etc. It is so good. And then I ultimately get sick a few hours after I eat. I swear I won't go there again until a month later when I get the craving again.
