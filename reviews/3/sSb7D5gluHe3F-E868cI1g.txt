The food is worth 5 stars. 
Minus 1  for no one understanding English.  Call to ask what time they stop serving lunch the person that answered gave me to someone else, the person she gave me thought I was asking what time they open and close, so that's the answer she gave me then hung up.
After eating here, minuse 1/2 for the fact they have a full dessert menu but had no dessert prepared.
When I got there asked what time they stop serving lunch she said lunch is good all day when I got my bill I was charged full price. Minus 1/2
