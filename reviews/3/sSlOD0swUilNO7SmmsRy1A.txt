Last meal in Charlotte before our flight.  Nice, bright atmosphere, and the restaurant was very large, which I couldn't tell walking in through the front door.  I liked the wood furniture and decor.  I had a feeling I'd been there before, but it's fairly new, and it was my first visit...

Everyone who tried the complimentary homemade chips and salsa enjoyed it.  I ordered the Two Taco combo, where I chose a soft taco filled w/ beef for myself, and gave a hard corn taco (also w/ beef) to my nephew.  Enjoyed everything else on my plate!  The "dirty rice" wasn't greasy, and I liked the texture and flavor of the refried beans.  Mom and sis shared a fajita combo platter, with chicken and shrimp, which they both enjoyed.  I'd sampled a juice (sorry, but forgot the name) drink that wasn't on the menu, but didn't like it- tasted like cough syrup to me, so I went ahead and ordered sweet iced tea.

Wouldn't mind going back to try their other lunch combos, or to have dinner there on our next visit to the Queen City!
