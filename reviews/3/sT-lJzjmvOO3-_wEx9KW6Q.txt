This is your typical large Mexican place.

Most of the food is boring, and identical to every other place like it.

However, that being said...

There are a few gems on the menu.

The BBQ Chipotle tacos are very, very good. The pork is very tasty with these. 

They also recently added pork nachos to the menu, and it is very good as well. Chips, cheese, black beans, and pork. It also has a moderately spicy green salsa mixed in that adds a perfect amount of heat to the dish.

My wife really enjoys the California Burro.

The side items (rice, beans, etc) are plain, and boring to be honest.

The service is typically good, the wait staff remembers us. The chips and salsa are also quite good.
