Mixed reviews aside, I am a fan of this longstanding Mexican restaurant near the Capitol.  I am not sure how long it has stood on the corner of 15th Ave. and Van Buren, or how many hookers have passed by its doors, but I have to say that pre- and post- remodel, it still remains a great spot for good Mexican food and people watching.  

Yes, the guac is weird; yes, the area is a little sketchy; and, yes, the drinks are hit and miss.  But, overall, the food is usually fantastic and the new look of the place, with a great patio included, is wonderful. The crowd is a mix of locals, state workers and long time lobbyists and politicians.  With a mix like that, you're bound to have an eventful dinning experience.

Whether or not you can pronounce Oaxaca (the "oax" sounds like "wah"), and whether or not you appreciate a good ole hole-in-the-wall-remodeled-hot-spot, give Oaxaca a try. I am hopefully you won't be disappointed.
