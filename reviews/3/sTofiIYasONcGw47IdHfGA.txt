Place is right by my work so we go there all the time.  Small place, looks like a converted house...but damn they can make some good food.  The 3 carne asada taco lunch plate is "off the hook".  And on top of that...$0.01 beer with any lunch.  The only down side is the service kind of blows.  The is usually only 1 server covering all the tables, they are rather slow and have a hard time splitting our check.  They get it all done eventually.  We know that when we go there we will be getting crappy service, yet we go anyways...cause the food is that good.  Make sure to tell them I sent you.  You won't get anything...but it would be funny.
