I've eaten here several times and normally would give them 4 stars but this last time we had horrible service and I was charged twice for extra cheese with my dish when I did not revive it the first time and complained. I also can't give them 5 stars because their margaritas are over-priced and they don't list prices on their drink menu. Not even for soda! I'm pretty sure I've been charged different prices for the same drink before since I frequent the place.
