Food is always delicious! Lady at the check out was preoccupied with watching the TV behind her while I checked out. I repeated my order twice to make sure it was right, paid for it, and as I sat to wait for it, I thought the cost seemed low. I would have asked her to recheck the order but the line was out the door and I knew I repeated my order, so I hoped it was correct . When it was finally done, I was short a burrito. Her remark was rude and she said I should have noticed that I didn't pay enough. I informed her that I told her the order twice but that it was obvious she was watching TV. She said she was not watching TV, she was looking at someone next to the tv. I told her what I ordered again- the entire order, and she realized that she messed up on one of the burritos AND forgot another. So she charged me for the mistake and was unfriendly about her mix up. RUDE SERVICES HERE. I just love the food though, otherwise I would not come back.
