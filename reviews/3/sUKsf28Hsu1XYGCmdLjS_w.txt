Was I impressed with this place? No. Not at all.
Why?

First off, it was extremely hot sitting in this place like they had it set at a solid 78-80 degrees. Awesome :|

Second...A burrito that only comes with pico de gallo and guacamole on the inside with your choice of meat is weird to me. Where you have to pay extra for other ingredients? Stupid! I could understand switching out ingredients. The carne itself was good enough but not good enough for the burrito to be spectacular.

IDK if ill go back some day maybe if someone takes me ill give it a shot again.
