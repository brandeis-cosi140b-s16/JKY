In the nice little town of Wickenburg, former hub between L.A. and Phoenix, Anita's Cocina serves very acceptable Mexican (Americanized) food,

The menu is not huge, but all the usual players were there.  I was hoping for a crack at the pulled pork-potato taco mentioned below, but, alas, none was to be found. 

The stars of the meal were the light, crispy tortilla chips and the "mild" salsa, which had great flavor and enough of a tingle that kept me from trying the "hot" version.  I would buy that salsa by the gallon...

The BF had his usual chile relleno, which he pronounced very tasty.  It looked to be not as fluffy-battered as some I've had, but he was satisfied.  I had a red pork tamale (decent, nothing special) and a shredded beef taco (beef very tender, nicely stuffed, tortilla not fried crisp, which would have been my preference.)  The beans and rice were very edible.

GO......go to Wickenburg, support their economy, it's a nice little place, great little Western museum.  If we go back and we're hungry for Mexican food, doubtless we will be returning to Anita's....and I will be on the lookout for that pork-potato taco.....
