id give this place 5 stars if it wasnt so dirty. looks like they slop a filthy mop around once a month or so to add to the layer of grime on the floor and reaching about 6 inches up on everything, several large picnic tables inside which are fairly clean on top but feel sticky,my food was served to me on a dirty tray (had grease and bits of rice on it so in all fairness this was probably from being in the prep area and not from someone elses dinner)cook in back had a baseball hat on with a large marijuana leaf in the front that was clearly visible from the dining room, couldn't see his face just that hat kinda bobbin around, made me uncomfortable to realize that was the person making my food,the guy at the counter was nice and even tried to help me figure out what i wanted ( i had been there once before and couldnt remember what i had had but wanted it again) so props on that,im sure its annoying when customers dont know what they want. i gave three stars because despite all the filth and the inappropriate hat i found my food to be delicious and at least seemingly very  fresh, i had the burrito patron it was good stuff. although i do think i will go there again i think its a shame that the place is so dirty and run down because if it were nice and clean i think id go there frequently,weekly at least.
