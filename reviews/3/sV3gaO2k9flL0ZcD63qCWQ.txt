Had to check it out because it seemed so interesting. Gorgeous restaurant with a really cool concept. Can't decide if you want Mexican or Chinese? Why not do both? 

I'm a fairly adventurous eater and my dinner companion can easily be fooled into trying anything if you tell her "it tastes just like chicken". We had an assortment of tacos (carnitas for her, beef tongue and pork belly for me) along with the shrimp dumplings (my friend had never tried any kind of dim sum so we figured, why not). Pretty good tacos, not sure what to think of the dumplings. The mango sticky rice was a little strange and not what you would expect but still kind of cool.

While this would not be my first choice for Mexican food or Chinese, it is a cool place to go to in Cosmo with fairly decent prices or with a big group (lots of things to share).
