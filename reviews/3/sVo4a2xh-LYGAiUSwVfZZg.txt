This place makes their tortillas fresh which makes all the difference in the world for the taste.  I ordered the steak fajitas and the boyfriend had some tacos with a gordita.  Neither of us were impressed with the gordita.  The fajitas were good, but the meat was clearly low quality and a over cooked.  However, the tortillas definitely made up for it.  The tacos were delicious.  

Service is terrible here.  It seemed like the wait staff didn't have assigned roles and it wasn't clear who was going to take our order, if anybody.  We just ordered as though we were going to carry out and then found our own booth.
