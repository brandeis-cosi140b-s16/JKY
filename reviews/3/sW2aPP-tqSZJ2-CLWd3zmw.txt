Not sure If the Mexican food chain Robertos Taco Shop Changed its name or this is a new chain. But regardless there used to be a Robertos Taco shop here. I came here during my lunch for some Mexican food thinking I was going to a Robertos to find its now Don Tortaco. Well I didn't care It looks like its a newly renovated Robertos. 

Food: 3/5 The food was delicious, a lot of meats, a huge glop of guacamole and ton's of onions, tomato's, cilantro, and lime on top. I noticed that the flour taco was very flimsy. Maybe it was over loaded or something but it ripped easy. Which is a big no no.. made my meal pretty messy. 

Price: 5/5 The price was very chip it was Al la carte per taco $2.35 for Carne Asada. My meal came to $5 and some change for 2 fully loaded Carne Asada Tacos. 

Service: 3/5 It's a very fast food type like Mexican restaurant. Other than ordering its pretty much self service after that.
