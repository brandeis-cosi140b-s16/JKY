The only reason I gave a 3 was because the food was very good. We got the most popular steak dish and it was very good. The service was very poor for the type of establishment. The server took our order and we did not see him again until our food was done. He did not even greet us until we had sat for a few minutes. Someone did bring us water in the meantime, but did not speak to us at all. We also sat for a long time with our coats on waiting for the check. They were not busy at all either..
