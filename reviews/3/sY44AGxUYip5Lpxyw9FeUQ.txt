Chipotle, Qdoba, Zaba's........

Like many other Americanized burrito joints, Zaba's offers a lot of the same.  You choose your protein, beans, rice, salsa, fillings, they roll, you eat.  I may be the only person to hate Chipotle, so if you're a fan you may like Zaba's as well.

My experience there wasn't all bad.  The place is clean, the staff friendly and happy to let you try one of the meats before choosing it in your burrito.  I don't think this is any better or worse than Chipotle or Qdoba, it's just that all these places are average at best.  

I went with the shredded beef tacos.  The beef was a little dry and not too flavorful, but the hot salsa and pico de gallo helped. 

I had the chicken nachos as well.  The queso sauce they use is salty and while many people will like it, I did not.  I wouldn't come back here, but again, I'm not a fan of this type of place, so take my review with a grain of salt, or in the case of the queso, lots of salt.
