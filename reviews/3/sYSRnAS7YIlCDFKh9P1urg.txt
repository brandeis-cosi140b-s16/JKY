This panaderia on 32nd street can be intimidating to any non-spanish speaker since the staff and the majority of the customers of this panaderia do not speak english. I stumbled upon this panaderia one afternoon with my friend Dani, I was craving a donut or some kind of postre. The churro at Del Taco was not going to do it for me, and lo and behold I came upon this treasure of a panaderia. I was half expecting someone to at least understand me but sadly not. It was abuzz with people. The store is part bakery part cafeteria where you can buy menudo and other hot snacks, and sit at the tables to eat. As you walk in and after the tables there are shelves of desserts and pastries filled with cookies, donuts, and the like, so grab a tray and pick and choose! And they're all CHEAP. I think one time we got ourselves close to 20 different kinds of goodies and paid a whopping $7.50. It was awesome. You have to admit that if a business doesn't understand english, they understand the language of currency. But yea, this was the kind of place where if you had any questions, you were left to your own devices to distinguish and determine what baked goods they were and if such tasted good. I think we were amusing as the non-spanish speaking pair playing charades to the spanish speakers to understand us. Oh well, it's an experience and I will come back!
