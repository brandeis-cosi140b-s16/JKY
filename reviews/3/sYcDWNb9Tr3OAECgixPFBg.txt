When Chipotle first arrived in Vegas, I was a huge fan. Never had a Mexican fast food experience like this before. Then Zabas came along, pretty much stealing the same concept but with a broader menu and ingredient selection. I have to admit that since Zabas came into the picture, I haven't been to a Chipotle! This was my first visit in at least five or six years, if not more.

I was surprised to see that they now offer brown rice, perhaps taking a page out of Zabas book and stealing a concept from them. What they were lacking was the potatoes that I love to add to my Zaba Bowl at Zabas. Was disappointed about that, but hey, not a deal breaker. Especially since I saw they had Coke Zero on tap! lol!

All in all this location seemed pretty nice and packed. The noise level was extremely high, but not nearly as obnoxious as Cafe Rio. Oh and that music either has to go or be turned down a tad. 

Would I eat here again? Yes, but have to be honest that I only ate here today because a friend was craving it and that will be the only time I'd eat here again - if I were with someone who wants it and I'm not the one driving. Great food, my vegetarian style bowl was rather tasty minus my potatoes but I prefer Zabas choices and atmosphere a lot more.
