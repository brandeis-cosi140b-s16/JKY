This place seems to be a bit understaffed. As others have said the portion sizes they give are less than the standard Chipotle sizes. They also need to work a bit on their food consistency. The fajitas and chicken were blackened (aka burnt). Maybe that's more of a local taste thing. I'm not sure. 

Employees were friendly though and it's a clean location. Food tasted fine overall. Just not as good at the local Chipotle I go to back in California. 

It's a convenient distance from my parent's place out in Vegas though. I'll be giving this place a few more tries before giving up.
