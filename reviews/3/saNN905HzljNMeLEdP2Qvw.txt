classic tex-mex, fresh ingredients, and over-the-top service (Amber).

--server Amber is caring, thorough, watchful, professional and unassuming; i'd hire you in a second for "Chez Bizzle"
--fantastic happy hour specials, and great apps to accompany
--"bucket of beer" with juicy limes on the salt. who can complain?
--FRESH, quality ingredients
--the shrimp coctail/ceviche is just a tiny bit gloopy, but FRESH, tasty, and absolutely worth the trip
--cheeese crisp is crispy exactly like it should be, not flimsy. it's my new favorite for an east-side cheese crisp (Los Compadres still holding the phoenix-wide trophy)
but this one was just a very bit charred.
--"street tacos" remind me of the real things (hard to beat the beach view and freshest seafood of Agua Prieta, Mexico, but it sure reminded me!)

went this warehouse-turned-Mexico-street-bar restaurant for a "thank-god-you're-resigning" going away party and was extremely skeptical given the decor/ambience, but I couldn't help but remember some very drunken fiestas had at places like this in Mexico. (Yelp, when you going to Mexico?)

Depending upon the charism of its cooks, It's a place I'd love to see featured on a cooking show. TEACH us about fresh tex-mex ingredients, please!!
