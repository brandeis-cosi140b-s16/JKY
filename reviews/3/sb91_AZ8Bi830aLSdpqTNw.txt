My fianc√© and I have been here twice. It's close by our house so we are going to keep going but we won't be ordering food. We've tried the Mexican and the burgers and both are subpar at best. We won't be ordering food again. We went yesterday and had to wait for service while the waitress finished her cigarette right outside the front door. Both times the staff seemed more interested in hanging out at a table than actually helping the customers. The only exception to this is Mark who is on top of it and the only one who seems to do anything. If we had any other options as close as Matta's is we would go there instead. Maybe they'll get better the longer they're open.
