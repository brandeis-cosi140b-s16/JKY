I got the Macho Nachos with beef and a steak taco which is heavily over priced. The taco just lacked overall flavor. The beef in the Nachos was dry to my liking but the retried beans cheese made up for what could have been a disappointing dish. The salsas , red and green both were really toned down for someone like me enjoys a little heat as far as red sauce goes. This place I would recommend for a person who would shy away from a real deal Mexican hideaway. I gave it 3 stars for the comfortable environment . Peace!
