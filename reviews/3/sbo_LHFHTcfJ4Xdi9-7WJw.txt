Homemade chips were a dream during a two hour layover, however, the chunky salsa needed to be blended more.  One chip dip delivered a tomato chunk that was half the salsa bowl.  Horchata was watery and as expected...not authentic.

5 people in the kitchen and one cashier doing too much that caused obvious delays.  Does anyone manage this or do they just do what they want?
