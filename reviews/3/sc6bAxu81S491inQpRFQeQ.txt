Los Taquitos location C terminal Gate 3.

Counter service - 5 stars. Wonderfully friendly counter girl.

$6 Egg & Chorizo breakfast burrito - 3 stars. Most flour tortilla. Very little egg and chorizo. Average airport fair for the price.

Papas side - 1 star. All we could taste was salt. We both threw them out.
