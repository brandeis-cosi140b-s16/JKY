I was thrilled to learn that a Komex had opened up a bit closer to my workplace. Love their food especially the fusion beef bulgogi and pork belly tacos. The Buffalo location is bigger even if the layout is a bit odd. A bar which looks like it will never be used, takes up a large portion of the room. 
This Komex isn't as hectic as the other smaller location at lunch time. However, during my first visit here with coworkers, someone apparently placed a large takeout order which resulted in waiting for our food for nearly 45 minutes. Even made to order food shouldn't take this long. They need to have enough staff to cook these call-in orders in order to not affect restaurant service. We were patient though and their food was delicious. 

I tried them again on a Saturday at lunchtime and the food came within 15 minutes and the service and food were spot on. I had fusion tacos again and my husband tried their enchiladas with different meats. So far so good.

But during my most recent visit on a weekday and lunchtime with coworkers, all sorts of things were off. The water tasted funny and they put the skimpiest portion of pork belly meat in one of my tacos. A coworker and I both asked for kimchi on the side. Hers was a generous portion and was on a small plate, like a true kimchi side dish. Mine? Well, it looked like a few kimchi shavings in a small tin container like what people use to hold ketchup or tartar sauce. I asked our waitress what was up and she said that the kimchi orders are the same (really?) and that there are 2 different chefs that made our items. So I got the short end of the deal then? Sigh. Anyway, our waitress never offered to remedy this blatant inconsistency in the food- which I thought was bad form. Food should be consistent even in the case of two different cooks/food preparers.

So if you're going to eat at this Komex, get ready to play some food roulette.
