The previous time I ate here was like 13-14 years ago.  I think this was the only location at that time.  I had a spinach enchilada and a fish taco.  I had already been introduced to 'bertos around the valley.  Because they use 8" instead of 10" tortillas for their enchiladas I thought I didn't get enough for my money and they used cilantro, which I do not care for, in their fish taco. I removed this place from my list of lunch spots near work.

The other evening eating at Stir Fry Paradise I noticed quite a few customers at the Caramba next door.  So I looked up the reviews for all the locations and didn't see any red flags.  And Korina A doesn't care for cilantro either and she made no mention of it in her review.  So I tried it out again for lunch.  This time eating in instead of sending someone for take out. 

I got the combination #4 (see picture), shredded beef taco, cheese enchilada, rice, beans ($6.65) and a small horchata.  Total with tax: $8.54.It is still about a dollar more than a 'bertos and the enchiladas are still smaller.  But it gets better.  The meal comes with a bowl of fresh chips.  There is a salsa bar with fresh made salsas instead of inedible hot sauce.  They use the next grade up of cheddar cheese.  The enchilada sauce is better.  The beans and rice are a little better.  And I can no longer eat all of a 'bertos combo any more anyway :-)  I just barely finished this one.

It was a perfect day for the patio.  Being on the North side of the building I can see it getting hot at midday even with the umbrellas during  the summer.

It is still a fast food Mexican place but one that is worth a little more.  It is now back on my list of places to go.
