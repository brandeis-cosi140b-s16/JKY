Visited Z'Tejas last Thursaday night.  After a flight, getting settled in, my wife and I ventured out on a very hot August evening.

Greeted kindly at the door, got to our seats, welcomed by our server, McKenna.  She was kind and talkative and inquired about our day.   More so than most, which made me feel a bit more connected to the experience.

The food was all very good (not super duper, but very good).  Wasn't sure what to expect as it's a new chain that I've never visited.  I ordered the turkey burger, and side salad, my wife ordered the Ahi tacos.  The table cornbread was fresh and yummy.  We also ordered table-side quac.  Well prepared, again by our server.

The bar looked entertaining with a beautiful Tequila Tree.  Wasn't in the mood for a drink but certainly would next time.  

Everything was pretty good!  Would certainly return.
