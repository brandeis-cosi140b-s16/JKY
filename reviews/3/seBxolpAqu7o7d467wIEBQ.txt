Unless you're looking for a taco stand, it's easy to miss. While on Tropicana Avenue, it's situated in the parking lot of Showtime Car Wash, just east of Jones Boulevard (pass the Albertson's). There's no designated spots to park, so find a space that doesn't disrupt traffic and keep an eye on your vehicle. You won't be there very long anyway.

Tacos are just $1.50-2/each. Al Pastor (Pork), Asada (Steak), Cabeza (Head), Chorizo (Sausage), and Pollo (Chicken) are $1.50 and Lengua (Tongue) and Tripa (Tripe) is $2. You can add cheese and sour cream for $0.50/each or guacamole for $1. There is an extensive salsa bar that houses fresh salsas (I really liked the medium orange-colored one) and great toppings like diced white onions and cilantro.

There are other menu selections like quesadillas and plates (maybe tortas?). Soda cans, water bottles, and Horchata are offered for $1 (Horchata may be more?), but I would suggest bringing your own beverages.

I ordered two Al Pastor tacos, one with pineapple and one without it. I wasn't sure what I'd like since this was my first time trying Pastor. The tacos are small (normal corn tortilla), but piled pretty well with meat. I was surprised how much I liked the pork with the pineapple (I guess I shouldn't be too surprised since I like ham with pineapple), but it added a nice sweetness. The pork wasn't very flavorful and lacked juiciness and tenderness - most likely from being chopped so small and cooked on the flattop a tad too long. The tortilla was also warmed too much resulting in a slightly dry texture. So, overall, just okay. It was still good enough to fulfill a craving, but definitely no sparks.

I wouldn't say I would never visit this taco stand again, but I probably wouldn't order the Pastor. It could possibly just not be my favorite taco meat or they may do Asada or Pollo better. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt or just have the salt shaker ready.
