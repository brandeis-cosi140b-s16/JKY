You know that weird hole in the middle of Las Vegas that you don't really go to unless you work there or are driving through it?  That's where Phat Phrank's is.  I didn't even know that Decatur and Sunset existed until I a lunch meeting one day.  I kind of thought it was...just desert.

The menu is pretty simple, as you pick your meat, and then you can have it on a plate with rice and beans, or in a burrito with all the guts nicely wrapped together.  I ordered a carnitas burrito and a drink.  The burrito itself was well made, but the taste was bland.  This may seem strange (especially with the health food nuts), but I thought the burrito was TOO dry because of the lack of oil and grease.  I guess you could compare it to a burger that's too lean; you gotta have some fat in a burger, and you gotta have some grease in Mexican food.

Can't fault the service, though; food came out fast and they came by checking on refills at least 3 times.  That, and we loitered for about 45 minutes after eating, and they seemed to have no problem with it.

For now, this place gets a solid 3 from me.  Maybe if I revisit, I will get a new combo in my burrito and see how that comes out.
