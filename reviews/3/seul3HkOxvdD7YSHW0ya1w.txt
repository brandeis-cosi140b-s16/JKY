This place gets on my nerves. First off, let me be clear, the food is awesome. Especially, you guessed it....Fajitas!! I always get chicken or with shrimp. They make their tortillas in house, which you can never beat. Really good chips and salsa. A little too good, because I eat too many chips along with that tasty salsa. 

I have some complaints. The parking lot is a little hard to see in the dark, and if you miss the turn, too bad for you!! Also, inside could definitely be updated. It bothers me that the place is always busy, it's a little pricy, but it's a little dingy on the inside. It's dark, old tables, old booths, old lamps. The portions are big, but it's not a good place for a family on a budget. It's good quality though.
