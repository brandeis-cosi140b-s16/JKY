The food was okay and so were the drinks but my kids only picked at their food and there wasn't much in the way for them. The inside of the restaurant had a lot of monitors playing sports but club music was blasting and seemed to be in contrast with the setup if the restaurant. The menu is pricey, they layout is odd for a Mexican restaurant and this in combination with the okay food would make it someplace I wouldn't immediately recommend to a friend unless I had no other choice.
