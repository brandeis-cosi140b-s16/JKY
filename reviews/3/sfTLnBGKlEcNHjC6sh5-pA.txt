Stopped by this place for Mother's Day breakfast.  We had a pretty large group.  Its a smaller restaurant and shares its space with other restaurants, and The Yard.  Nice ambiance and friendly service, but the food was OK.  I sampled a lot of different dishes and really nothing stood out.  The portions are really small here.  My girl and I ordered some orange juice, which they had was fresh squeeze and you could tell the difference, which was great.  Too bad it was served in a little glass.  Couldn't be more than 10 ounces.  I ordered the chiliquiles and my lady ordered the divorced egg dish.  Both tastes good, but wasn't really a lot of food.  Go to the Original breakfast house and the chiliquiles is double the portion and tastes better.  I'm a huge fan of breakfast places and I doubt I come back to this one, maybe for the ambiance and The Yard.
