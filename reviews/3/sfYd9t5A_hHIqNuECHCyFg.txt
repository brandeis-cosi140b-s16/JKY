I used to enjoy this place a lot more than I do now.  I still like the atmosphere.  The tables with coins, stamps and other memorabilia.  The moving train of taquila hanging over head.  The giant barrels.  I still like the salsa bar.  They have a good selection ranging from mild to spicy, chunky to thin, cold to heated.  That coupled with the endless supply of serve yourself chips is is good in my book.  The food, however, is lacking a certain freshness and authenticity.  When you order a taco you receive something that looks like it belongs in taco bell.  It is not the fresh fried shell you get from Roberto's, that's for sure.  The rice and beans are okay.  Nothing special.  The chimichunga is filling.  It is loaded with meat and cheese and comes with a scoop of sour cream and guacamole.  The scoop of sweet corn cake was not as sweet as I am used to.  It was actually rather starchy.  And I remember the days when Garduno's used to bring out sopaipilla's with honey after the meal.  Those days are gone apparently.  My only reason to go back now is for the all you can eat taco special they put on once or twice a year.  When you get a taco in a soft flour shell, it aint bad.
