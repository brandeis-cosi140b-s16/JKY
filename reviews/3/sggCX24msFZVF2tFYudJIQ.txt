I have been here 2 times and this was the better of the two. Both times I got a chicken salad with the tortilla, beans, shredded chicken, lettuce, pico, and guac. The first time, the lettuce was not shredded very well and there were huge leaves, making it really tough to eat. The second time it was much better. I don't like how they put the beans down first; I have to dig for them and then there are a bunch on the very bottom after I've eaten all the lettuce and chicken. The food is pretty fresh, but the drink area and sitting area are kind of a disaster. Could definitely do more to enhance the ambiance. But like I said, pretty fresh, fast, healthy and does the trick.
