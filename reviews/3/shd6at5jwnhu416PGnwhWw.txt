I like going to this location my food is always correct, the person who works drive thru window is always friendly and funny. Toda when I went through I asked for a moment to look at the menu the guy cracked a joke said take your time im here til 3..lol then when i was at the window he asked what sauce i wanted i stated none he was like well i didn't want you to have none of my sauce anyway. These little things can help add to your day, instead of being transactional he was friendly and provided excellent customer service. The last time i was there one of the girls was equally as friendly, great customer service is what makes customers want to come back. I like their menus change and their box meals are reasonably priced
