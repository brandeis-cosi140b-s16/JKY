The food is great!  We are from NM and it is the best restaurant we've found for the best read and green chile however, the service has gotten really bad. We have been there three times in the last six weeks. Once on a Saturday about 4:30, on a Sunday after church, and last night at 6:00 p.m. Each time we have had the same waitress and each time the service has gotten progressively worse. Last night, we asked for sweetener for ice tea. My husband finally had to to go the bar to ask for it. The waitress was just sitting at the bar. He had to go back to the bar to ask for refills. Again she was just sitting at the bar. When we were finished with meal, again he had to go to the bar to ask for the check. I called three time to finally speak to a manager. I spoke to Hugo who tried to brush it off as they were too busy. Ok once I could see but THREE TIMES? We will give it one more chance and then hasta la vista Frank and Lupe's.
