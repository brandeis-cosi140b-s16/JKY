This place was poppin! We had to park in the Dallas and Co. Parking lot cause the Parking Lot was full. The entire structure is pretty cool- they've been pretty successful with an attempt to 'Go Adobe'. 

Overall, the food though wasn't that great. I guess I might just have really high expectations for mexican food because I love it. I ordered their 'Mexican Combo Dinner' and got a beef tamale, chile con queso, chorizo enchilada and the enchilada was my fave..
