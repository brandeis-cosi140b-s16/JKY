First, let me just start off by saying that Roberto's is not my favorite Taco Shop. I eat at Roberto's only when it's past midnight and after my friends and I have had a night out on the town. Roberto's greasy food is just what the doctor ordered after you've had your fill of drinks. Roberto's Taco Shop also happens to be conveniently located next to where I live. I usually order the combo quesadilla meal, which at $4.55, is a no-brainer choice because it's 1) cheap and 2) hard to mess up a quesadilla. The quesadilla is loaded with cheese and dripping with grease, which is fine by me in the wee hours of the morning. The beans and rice served with the quesadilla are average.   

Here's why I'm giving Roberto's Taco Shop 3 stars even though I think their food is less than stellar:

1. Affordable prices
2. Food is brought out quickly
3. Open 24/7
4. You can eat your food in peace and quiet at 2AM at a sit-down fast-food restaurant
5. Located throughout Vegas

 Customer service is minimal, but I don't expect anyone to be perky at 2AM. I would say I'm a regular at Roberto's, but it's due to the fact that it's convenient, not out of love for the shop's food. In sum, Roberto's is a no-frill Taco Shop with average food, but it's a quick and easy option that everyone can agree on eating at before hitting the sack.
