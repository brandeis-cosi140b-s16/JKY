We stopped at Mims based solely on Yelp's review.  Mims is definitely your "hole in the wall" establishment, and not much to look at.  I had the 1/2 bacon cheeseburger and onion rings.  The burger was slightly overcooked, but I forgot to specify medium rare, so that may have been my fault.  The onion rings were actually very tasty and crispy.  If you can overlook Mims appearance, the value is very good.
