The place got renovated a few months ago and although I can't tell any difference, at least the guacamole has been very great. If you check-in on YELP, you can get a free guac and chips appetizer (valued at about 8 bucks). This is very good and traditional guacamole with nice avocado chunks and some queso to boot. The last two times I have been here the Bears have been on TV and this is a Bears bar. Well they lost on Sunday and as a side note how miserable must it be to be a Bears fan for the last 30 years! Not alot of Chicago folks on hand, but enough to know some folks were watching. Too many Bears bars in Phoenix. Anyway, El Hefe is decent to watch football (they have NFL package) and the open air atmosphere means that your right in the mix of the party scene, even at noon on Sunday.
