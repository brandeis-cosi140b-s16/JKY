what can i stay?  in the mexican/southwestern semi-fast food heirarchy, you will find salsaritas somewhere in the middle.  not as bad as taco hell, but not as good as moe's or chipotle.  about on par with q'doba.

i usually go with the small steak or burrito bowl to go.  when they make the regular burritos, i think they could stand to drain the scoop of meat a second or two longer so as not to create a mushy mess three minutes into your dining experience.  the combo isn't too bad with a small cup of queso (seriously, i once said cheese instead of queso and got the most quizzical look from the guy) and a drink for about nine bucks.

its not a huge place, nor is it built for comfort, so i tend not to linger.  they have another location in the overstreet mall, and the traffic at this location is much easier to deal with.
