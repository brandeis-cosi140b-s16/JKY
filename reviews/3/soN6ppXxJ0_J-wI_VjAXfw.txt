As a die hard mexican foodie, I would have to rate the food as about a 3.5, but what's with the "up charge" for cheese and sour cream?  I've always been a big Chipotle fan and am willing to pay nearly $10 for a burrito, chips/salsa and a large drink, but this place really irritated me.  I asked for lettuce in my burrito and received both a dirty look and about five small shreds...WTH???

Yes, the tortilla was pretty yummy and the meat fairly tasty, but I really hate being nickel and dimed for everything.  I'll stick with Fili B's for the cheaper and more authentic version and Baja Fresh for the Americanized Tex-Mex (or whatever) version with a free salsa bar.
