3.5 Stars. The food was very good, good values. Also, there is something to be about a Mexican restaurant with a large number of Mexican people eating there.

My main problem-- the margaritas were not good at all. Like someone just added a drop of tequila to this bad mix. Way too sweet. Come on guys, you can do better.
