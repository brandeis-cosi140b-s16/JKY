Our family has been twice, once when they first opened and then again this past weekend. Great food and the Frescas are so fun and yummy!

My only reason for lower stars is the personality of the girl working the register. She has no personality. After finding out about the restaurant by being a subscriber of Arturo's YouTube account I was expecting someone fun and outgoing. 

During our first visit we loved the salsa and wanted to see if they sold a bigger side to go. She gave us small ones with no real dialogue of if larger ones were offered. On our second visit we saw a Fresca, but weren't sure what kind it was and it looked really good! When we asked her what it was she looked at us, looked at the drink as it went by to be delivered and didn't respond.  

We will definitely try again I would just love a bit more of a fun experience.
