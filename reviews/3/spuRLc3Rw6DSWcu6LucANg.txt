I stopped in for lunch a little after noon, so the place still wasn't too crowed yet. The staff was wonderful, chips and salsa arrived the moment I sat down. The chips were okay, but I wasn't a big fan of the salsa. 

After a quick review of the menu, I was very impressed with the selection of lunch combos! You can pretty much mix and match whatever you want. Tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas and more...and it's all for a very reasonable prices. 

I went with Amy C's suggestion and got the chimichangas. One beef and one chicken, the combo comes with rice and beans. 

My food arrived quickly. The chimichangas are pretty small but I did love how they were coated in the cheese sauce. First thing I notice is that they didn't skimp on the filling, both of my chimichangas were packed with well flavored meat. Overall, it was very tasty. The rice and beans (covered in cheese) were just a little blah, but overall it still makes for a good meal. 

Next trip...I will be having some table side guacamole because it looked delicious and of course I have to try the cheese dip!
