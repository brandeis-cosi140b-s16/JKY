My girlfriend and I agree that the food is great but the drinks were terrible. The bartender was 'sketchy' and disappeared while 'making our drinks' which took 15 minutes. Bacon wrapped shrimp was fiendishly delicious, the chips n dips were good, and our waitress was pleasant. I just assumed a place called The Salted Lime, would pride itself on making margaritas that would rival Margaritaville's.
