Amados is great Mexican fast food with less grease than all those other 'berto Mexican fast food joints that have sprouted around the valley. I especially enjoy the carne asada burritos, with the pico de gallo, cilantro and guacamole, best fast food on the cheap! Their rolled taquitos are super crunchy and loaded with flavor and topped with cheese and the dipping guacamole is not all that but ok for the price. The selection of sugar fruit drinks are good, Tamarindo, Horchata, Jamaica and the Melon drink are good but on the sugary side. The Salsa bar is ok, green and red sauce, diced cabage, sliced limes, cucumbers, pickled jalapenos/carrots and sliced raw jalapenos that will set your mouth on fire!  They are open 24 hours and it tends to be crowded with the local skater poser gavacho kids on the weekends.
