Julio's has pluses and minuses which equal out to about three stars in my book.  FIrst, let's outline the positive-Pollo Magnifico and the big star is actually the CHICKEN!!  I could actually do just fine with just a little less of the jalapeno cream cheese sauce/cheddar on top because the chicken really holds it's own. I must admit this is a dish that I cannot get past.  I order it every time I go, it's that good!
Minuses would be the mopes behind the counter (I am not a regular patron but every single time I go the counter help is dreadful-thank goodness it's a short encounter), their salsas are free and worth price charged (they have a sweet/fake taste to me), and yucky Pepsi products at the pop dispenser (a.k.a. Diet PineSol).
