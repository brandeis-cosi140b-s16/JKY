OK I am reading alot of good reviews about the Sandbar and I love the atmosphere. But what happened to the food?  Got the Mexican Cobb with the mixed greens. Since when was iceburg lettuce considered mixed greens? Oh well it was good at least.  My friend got the turkey melt with cold hard bread that banged the plate. And the fries were not only cold but hard and hollow on the inside. How can you mess up a french fry?  I have to admit I hardly ever complain but with food like that I will have a hard time coming back for more.  Sorry Sandbar, please kick up the menu for yummy treats and I would like to give you another try.
