I am a sucker for chips and salsa between 2 and 5 am. That is just a fact that I must live with. Please believe me when I say that barring any Manuels or  Macayo's being open(which there aren't) that the chips and salsa from Fredericos are the best. Contrary to what many believe this is not a drunk review...yet. The chips are good! Like hot and crispy restaurant style good. Shit ....now I'm hungry. Over the last few years I have sampled close to half of the menu and I'm never disappointed ...believe me I'm accustomed to disappointment at this stop on my journey. Whatever... Try it late night and early morning( 24 hours a day) and I don't think you'll be disappointed either. Damn..I'm hungry now.
