I had heard good things about Canteen, so a group of us decided to try it out before our show at the Improv.  It being summer and all we had no intention of sitting outside, but we had no idea that Canteen doesn't have real tables inside!  They are set up more like a lounge; there are benches with what I guess they intend to be tables about foot off the ground between all the benches.  This is fine if you are just going or some drinks, but as we were going for dinner, this made things quite complicated.  Tacos can be a messy food to eat, with sauces and toppings dripping out of the shell, so the lack of a proper table posed a problem!  In months where the temperature here is below 90 degrees, there are plenty of patio tables, that are of normal height, just not sure what the intention is on the inside?

With all that being said, the food was actually really good, we tried a variety of tacos, a torta and the enchiladas and everyone like the food.  We didn't really get into any drinks because we were going to the Improv and they have a drink minimum, but their selection was wide.

I am not sure I will have a chance to try Canteen again, as the hostess told us they are closing next month...maybe they are remodeling...regular tables...or maybe they are closing?  Not sure, but either way, I won't gamble until it is patio weather.
