Tucked in the corner of Greenway and Tatum, sits The Corn Flower.  I went in for lunch, very simple setup with a friendly staff.  I ordered the chili renello and an empanada.   It was a pretty small amount for the cost you pay for a chili renello.  Just one with a red sauce on top and a side of rice.  Nothing much to the rice.  The chili renello was good but not really filling.  The empanada that I tried was the chicken mole, tasty for sure.  I think the empanadas was the highlight of the lunch.  May go back and try some other items.  It's worth checking out due to the variety of empanadas they have that you can take home and bake or eat there.
