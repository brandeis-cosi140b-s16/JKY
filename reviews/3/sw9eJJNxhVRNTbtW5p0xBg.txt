This was my old neighborhood.  My friend talked me into trying their burritos.  I first tried their red chili. It was salty and the sauce too thick. . I did like their skin . Their was plenty of sauce and meat. Also tried their green burritos . It had too much cumin and again the sauce was too thick. Meat was a little dry . I did like their macaco and egg . Their chips were nice and fresh
