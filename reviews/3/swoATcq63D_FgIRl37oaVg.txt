I liked sitting on the couch in back to eat.  The service was very pleasant and attentive.  I loved the chips and salsa.  The mango jalapeno margarita on the rocks was amazing.  The best margarita I ever had.

Unfortunately the carne asada tacos weren't yummy at all.  Very bland, no flavor.  Same with the re-fried beans.  I added a co-workers avocado and sour cream as well as salsa to the tacos and ate them.  Wouldn't order them again!!
