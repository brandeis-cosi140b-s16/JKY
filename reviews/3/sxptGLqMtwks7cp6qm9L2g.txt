Remember what I said in my last review?  I said, "DON'T CHANGE."

You changed.  That didn't take long.  The place that seemed so incredible on its first night with so many subtle, balanced flavors suddenly turned into just another Mexican joint with "pretty good" food.  Edible?  Certainly.  But, nothing really outstanding nor distinctive.  We went there again specifically to recreate the opening night experience that we remember fondly.  They just couldn't maintain the quality, and the portions seemed quite a bit smaller too.

No, this just isn't the place to recommend anymore.  I certainly don't bear them any ill will and hope that they can bring the level of quality back up to what it was.  We'll come back some time and see.
