I keep trying to check into this location but it is not on Yelp so I am forced to review it... ha ha, anyway.  I go here since it is close to my home and it is better than the other place on Lake Pleasant and 83ave (cant remember the name of the place).  It is still no Carolinas but they have decent chorizo burritos and the rolled tacos and beans are way better here.  It looks like this location is pretty new.
