I would rate this a 3 1/2 stars. Stopped by for an early dinner (4p when they opened, still quiet) with a friend. Typical chip/salsa bar. Food was pretty decent (had the combination plate (the burrito was bland, the enchilda was good, the arroz was great along with a very tasty tamale and a perfect chile rellano), my friend had some sort of shrimp fish dish and she ate every bite) The service was great. My pet peeve is an empty drink glass or bottle. Never once was it dry. Place is a little dark inside, bring a flashlight. Had fun watching the overhead catenary system of various tequila bottles parading across the wall. The decor reminded me of a Claim Jumper restaurant or the Thunder Mountain ride at Disneyland, a little out of place for a mexican restaurant.
