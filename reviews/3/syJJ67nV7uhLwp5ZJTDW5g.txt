Cons:  Horrible table salsa with the chips. Like Campbell's tomato soup. No flavor. Asked for a spicier salsa and was told that's the only salsa they have. 

No traditional Mexican drinks like Jarreto. 

My Corona beer came with a slice of lemon in the bottle neck. Let that sink in a moment. 

Wife's carne asada came with a tasteless bean soup. She's Brazilian and loves beans, and wouldn't eat it. 

Pros:  We came here for the food and admittedly it was pretty good. Wife's carne asada was good. My steak fajitas was good as well, with refried beans, rice, and tortillas. It was a thin steak chopped up, not really a steak steak, but it was tasty. 

With a few refinements, this place could be a lot better. My wife is incredibly picky and only likes Mexican food. We passed by this place today and she said, "Never again."
