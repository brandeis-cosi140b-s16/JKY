Have been to this place several times for lunch while working in Casa Grande. The food is probably the best in town! Don't expect the quality you'll get in Phoenix or Tucson. However you will get a quality meal that taste good.  They have excellent lunch specials! If your looking for a good place to eat at  while visiting Casa Grade or Driving down I-10, this place is good stop for a good Mexican meal.
