This place is my favorite fast good Mexican place so far in Surprise. I have tried their Carne Asada breakfast burritos, Huevos Rancheros, Rolled tacos (my personal favorite), torta, and chimichanga. Their chips and chunky salsa are amazing to add to your meal and their fountain drink Pepsi is amazing! I don't know what the difference between their Pepsi and other restaurants Pepsi's but theirs is def quite tasty. The reason I only gave this place 3 stars is because they have on multiple occasions messed up my order, as well as taking forever to get me my order. On top of that their was a huge incident with their Litchfield park location of food poisoning, and they have had multiple violations...I hope this is not the case for this place.
