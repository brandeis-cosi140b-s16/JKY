This place was decent! The chips and salsa to start off with was really good! They were really addicting! 

I had the combo plate with an enchilada and taco. It was really good! Super filling and worth the price. My only complaint was the fact that it took over an hour for us to get our food. Granted we had a really big party, but the place was pretty dead at the time so it doesn't make sense. 

I would come back sure, but not to go out of my way
