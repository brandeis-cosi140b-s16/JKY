Very decent place.  The food is freshly prepared/made to order.  Their menu is small but so are most places that have a similar feel to it.  The good and bad are that it is located in Sunset Station.  Bad because it is in the Casino good, because it is in the Casino.  I say this because some people will never enter a casino and those who do come here have a great alternative to some of the bigger restaurants to use their comp dollars and to find good inexpensive food.
