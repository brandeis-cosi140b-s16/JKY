The customer service at this location was excellent. The cashiers and server were very nice and helpful. 

The problem is they cook almost everything in lard and don't seem big on sharing that with customers. We discovered this after asking a few employees, and we were happy that they helped us find something that wasn't cooked in lard. Unfortunately, it ended up being a cold chicken salad with no seasoning, but the customer service was still great.
