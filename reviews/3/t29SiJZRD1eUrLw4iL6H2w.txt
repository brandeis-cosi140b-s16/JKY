I enjoyed my experience at the Revival. Overall, the food was good. I met up with my husband there and a neighbor (who had been there for an hour already drinking and feasting) to order a cocktail and an appetizer.

The pork belly is good, but not as good as Pig and Pickle. They had a thinly sliced potato at the bottom and I felt like that was a bit too acidic for the pork belly. 
I had the chicken and I thought It was good but a bit too salty for my taste. I had to give it to my husband who is an athlete and is always looking for extra salt. 

My husband had the duck confit and I had some of it and hoped that I had ordered that instead! The polenta was nicely cooked and the flavors were spot on.

One thing that I did not like was one of the waiters. He had a stuck up feel to him, making comments about 'oh i only eat at ___'  and 'my pallet is very sophisticated', 'i wouldn't dare eat at ___' and trying to make it seem like he was better than us. Given that it was their first week, I would have preferred to not get that from the waiter.

I would go here again but now I'm warned on how expensive it is. The drinks and some of the food is a bit above what the neighborhood calls for.
