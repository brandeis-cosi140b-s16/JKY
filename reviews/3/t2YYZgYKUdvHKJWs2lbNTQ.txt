Visited Viva for lunch with a few co-workers and it was ok, there were two parts of my experience that I appreciated:

1- the salsa is excellent - perfect amount of 'hot', fresh and not chunky!
2- our server, Omar, he was very, VERY conscientious and quick! 

The food . . . . I was hoping for memorable, I wanted to love it, but it was average.  I've had better, yes, quite a few times actually.  I ordered the Ensenada style fish tacos and they are not like those I've had in Ensenada and frankly were tasteless.  There was a green chile sauce that was supposed to be used for a dressing, but it added nothing.  The beans were ok, rice was blah -- and again tasteless.  

Another person in our party ordered the Mexican style soft chicken tacos -- she said they were good, but agreed with my beans and rice evaluation.  

The prices were a little high as some of the other reviewers mentioned, $9-10 for a plate, and the drinks will add another $2.50 to your bill... but if the food was amazing, I'd have absolutely no issue paying that.  

Nothing special, nothing exciting, just plain ol' AVERAGE Mexican eats!
