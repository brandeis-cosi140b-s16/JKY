I would like to try Richardson's again. I went on a date here and we were going to order a couple things off the menu, but the manager said, "Let me take care of you- you're going to love this". We looked at each other (date and I) and were like, "Ok, I guess".

The manager sent out a garlic plate. It wasn't the worst thing for a date, since roasted garlic isn't stinky, but it was a cheesy heavy gross mess for me. I'm not into that kind of food at all and would have much preferred to choose something different. It was huge as well, we couldn't even finish it and didn't have any room to try any entrees on the menu. 

So, well, next time I know better and will stick to my own palate preferences rather than be persuaded by  a stranger that thinks first date food should be the size and style of a fancy superbowl platter. The dish wasn't gross, but it was incredibly heavy for 2 people. i might order that as an app if I was with a party of 4 or larger.

Overall, the place is beautiful and it's a great date spot. Call ahead and make a reservation though. I hope one day I can go again and try something that I like better.
