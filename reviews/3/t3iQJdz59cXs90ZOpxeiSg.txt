Really fun place to go on a Friday night.  I am originally from the Midwest and this place reminds me of the party bars back home.  Not the pretentious, douchey bottle service crowd, but just people having a few drinks and a good time.  Why is it that everywhere in the valley with a dance floor has to be pretentious and douchey anyways?  The bar has a cool set up with sand outside to give it a beach type of feel, so be careful if you have on white shoes with that.  I have had issues with the waitresses her in the past not being willing to switch a tab over and making me cash out at the bar or just being uppity in general, but it was never enough to ruin my night.  The other issue is with the music when I have gone.  The Djs there don't really seem to be fluid in their mixes and can really kill the vibe clearing out the dance floor quickly.  I don't want to accuse anyone of anything, but the mixes sound bottled almost like they were arranged before the night started and I think a better DJ could keep the floor packed and just make for a better overall time.
