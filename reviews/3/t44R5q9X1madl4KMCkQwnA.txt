I really enjoy this chain, the fresh food, the nice staff and the quick nature of being able to get your food despite a massive to-the-door line. This location had most of these bases covered, but feel a little short on others. 

So, let's "Oreo" sandwich this review (good, bad, good). They had a line when we arrived, even though it was 8:30 p.m., but they moved it quickly and with purpose. The staff was nice when arrived to the front and it was our turn to order.

I had carnitas tacos, as per my usual, topped with mild, cheese and sour cream. I thought it was a bit odd that they put my tacos into the burrito bowl instead of the usual plastic basket, but hey, a carrier is a carrier. The carnitas was completely cold...not luke warm...but cold. Still edible and tasted okay, but not what I was wanting or expecting. 

The main seating area was a bit chaotic and messy, but like I said earlier, it was busy and they had a decent sized line, so turn around on tables was probably just behind and playing catch up. 

The overall restaurant was clean as a whole though, if you didn't count the tables needed a little TLC and before we left, the line died down and they were making a visible effort to touch the place up from the rush, so yay!

Overall: B
Not my best Chipotle visit, but not a loss by any means. "A-OK"
