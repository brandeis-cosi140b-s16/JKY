Chuy's is a chain and there is nothing surprising about it, it is cheap and decent mexican food. This particular loaction has a great staff. They are always friendly and chatty. 

Things that are cool~
They give you a stuffed animal instead of a number. That just cracks me up, so instead of the runner looking for number 23, he looks for the purple crocodile haha. 
They have a salsa bar, the tomatillo and pico are both pretty tasty. 
They don't put lard in their beans (eat up).
The fish skewers and shrimp fajitas rock.
Matthew K. may be there all hot and dirty
