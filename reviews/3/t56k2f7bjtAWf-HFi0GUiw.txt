Went to there outside patio today for lunch today with my wife and my leashed dog. We were early and were meeting six other people there. After speaking to the host who checked with his manager we were told that a dog was not allowed on the outside patio. We left and told our other friends to meet us at Eva's Mexican restaurant. They did & we had a great meal with our dog under  the table bothering no one. It's the first restaurant with outside seating in California'  or Arizona to turn my dog away.
