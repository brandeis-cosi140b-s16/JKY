This location is inside a gas station/mini mart.  The parking lot is often full so be careful when manuvering through it to get to the drive thru.  Or you might just go inside and sit.  There are pleanty of tables to accomadate the lunch rush.  The thing about Del Taco is that if you order a combo, maybe a taco and a burrito, you get fries with it!  Kinda weird but who doesn't like fries right?  It's filling and cheap.  The other two reviews here are from 3 years ago.  I've been here a few times and customer service is fine, even at the drive thru.  You can't beat 39 cent tacos when you're on a budget!!
