I have to hand it to Filiberto's, they do make some pretty tasty food at a really good price.  Thier open 24 hours, they serve breakfast all day, and gosh darn it, thier all over the place.  I can't throw a rock in this town without hitting a Filibertos.

Despite that this place is a mile from my house, its not my normal filibertos location (I hit up the one off southern instead)  I came here because I was across the street at Safeway and had a sudden urge for some tacos and rice.  I swear, service at Filberto's is slow, but this one seems to be slower then usual!  Also, its right near the end of the light rail at Main and Sycamore, so be careful with all the rail foot traffic that happens here.  Can be kinda scary at night trying to make a left on main street!

Parkings kinda tight, but if its not busy, you should be okay.  Went up to the window and got my # 3 order to go, and had it out in no time.  The drive thru sucks here, as it weaves through the parking lot, and I fear getting hit when I go through.


Anyways, foods as good as it is at other locations, and Im quite full after eating what I could and putting the rest in the fridge for later.  O, this place accepts cash and debit cards only, but if you use your debit card, theres a 60 cent charge for that, so try to pay cash....and theres only 1 outdoor table, so dont bother trying to sit and eat here!
