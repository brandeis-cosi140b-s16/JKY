Their draft beer selection is weak, but they have a huge tequila menu. I have eaten there 3 times in the past two months, and it's alright. The food wasn't really anything special, but the bar staff is always nice and friendly. I got the peanut butter chocolate cake last time I went, and it was horrible. But their salsa is pretty good.
