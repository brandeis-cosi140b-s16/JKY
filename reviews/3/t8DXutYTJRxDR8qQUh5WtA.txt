As I walked on to vida today I expected a lot from such a beautiful restauraunt , we started off with a agua de watermelon which was delicious and a really nice waitress (yesenia) she was very attentive wandered all our questions, I was really happy till we got our food even though the prices were affordable I did expect much more , I ordered the Cobb salad and it was good my sister ordered carne asad and it was way over cooked , 2 eggs instead of three which is what we paid for . I would go back but this restauraunt need a way better chef iin Mexican and this was not authentic !
