The fresh tortilla thing is pretty cool and the fact that they use all white meat chicken is a huge plus, but the chicken is not marinated as stated. Not a huge fan of the mix all the ingredients together in the burrito before you roll it thing either. The girl was mixing for at least 2 minutes. It doesn't make a difference in my opinion. The chips are blue and way better than the competition - you get a huge bag for 75 cents. It seems an exact copy of Rio also, but Rio slices the chicken and this places dices it. Guac is extra and looked a bit tired at 9pm on sunday, but nobody can top Chipotle guac, so I passed and the mild salsa's are both pretty good. It still is a good burrito place, if not spectacular, but will hit the spot if you just want the basics and not the bells and whistles. About $7.50 total.
