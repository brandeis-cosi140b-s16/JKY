This place is pretty decent, especially compared to Chipotle. It's right across the street from campus, so I find myself going here a lot [ but mostly because my friends want to go]. 

The pork barbacoa is really good. Sweet, tender, and goes great in the burrito. And unlike Chipotle, this establishment puts all their burritos through their little toaster/heater thing, which I enjoy. Not a big fan of cold food, let alone cold burritos. They also offer daily specials, such as fish tacos or tamales so there is a little variety every time you go. 

Prices here are a bit steep. And the staff seems to be trained into tricking new comers to get all the costly upgrades, such as getting burritos enchilada style and getting sour cream. They make it seem like these upgrades aren't really a big deal and don't mention that they cost more. 

They do offer a stamp card, so be sure to get one when you go. Buy 10 items, get 1 free.
