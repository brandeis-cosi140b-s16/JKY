Pedro's was some of the better that I have tasted in Madison.  Being from AZ, Mexican food which is "amazing" is hard to find.  Their salsa had a good flavor.  One thing which was great is their tortillas, fresh made and if dipped in the con queso sauce they are even better!  The service was not amazing, drinks were empty a lot.  Overall Pedro's is eatable, if you want authentic Mexican then this is not the place for you.
