I feel like moes is chipotles red headed step sister. The taste of the food just isn't as good as its other alternatives. Too much spices added and overall everything tastes kind of burnt. One good thing about this location in particular is how nice the employees and management are. And FREE CHIPS AND SALSA is the best! Overall just kinda eh though.
