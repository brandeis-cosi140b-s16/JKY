After living in Albuquerque for 6 years, I know good chile when I taste it. Los Dos Molinos serves up a damn good green chile. Unfortunately, the food over which the green chile is ladled isn't quite as spectacular. I tried the blue corn enchiladas and, while they were descent, they weren't special.

What's more, I was disappointed that the meal ended without a basket of sopapillas on the table. If you're trying to pull off authentic New Mexican cuisine, you had better deliver some sopas with the main course. Sure, I could have spent an extra $6 on their weird sopapilla desserts, but I'm no sucker. 

If I go back with different (not lower) expectations, Los Dos might get a 4-star rating. The green chile salsa was tasty. Also, I suspect their adovada ribs are worth a try.
