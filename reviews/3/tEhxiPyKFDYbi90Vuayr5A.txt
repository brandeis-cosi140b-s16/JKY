Ok. So, I've been back about 5 times since my initial review.  

The good: the flautas are very tasty! The tortilla chips maybe the largest I've ever seen and they give plenty. 

The bad: they stopped giving the cheese dip gratis. They don't have a license to sell beer on Sunday.  They dropped all beer specials. They seem to have product inventory management issues, almost always out of something.  The service is inconsistent, yet with the same staff?  

Altogether, still very decent mex food for Fort Mill, with a few things to overlook but if it's about the food and not a lot more, try the flautas
