Total hole in the wall but it was open late so here I went!
After staring at all the options at the wall I finally went with the huevos rancheros. 

Pros
+Portions
+$5 
+Salsa Bar

Wow I finished this five dollar box of goodness but just barely. It came with beans, rice, veggies, egg, pico, and tortillas on the side. If your hungry and in the area a combo from Tacos Jaliscos is way better then shelling out for the 5 buck box at T-Bell's.

IT DOES THE JOB
*It really does look like your run of the mill Filiberto's combo but taste's better somehow
