Pretty good food. I had the beef carnitas and a beer, the daughter had steak chimichangas and water.  The meal came in about 10 minutes and they give you quite a bit of food.  Everything was fresh. My steak was on the chewy side but flavorful. 

The reason for just 3 stars is

1. No chips and salsa.  Really! !  So you just have to sit there and wait. 

2. Price.  $30 for 2 lunches?   And the daughter had water?

Good food but at the price there are other pl a case for me.
