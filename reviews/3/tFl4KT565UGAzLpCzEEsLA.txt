This place reminds me of a outdated concept restaurant in Downtown Vegas. This place needs a renovation.  

The food is decent but it looks all the same.  Beans, rice and cheese.  The margarita are awesome and cheap.  

I love seeing young Snottsdale chicks walking in and afraid to order.  They know they are getting a 4000 calorie meal.

This place isn't bad, but it isn't good.  It's just a block away from my house and my pregnant wife sometimes get's the urge.
