Your typical bland Filiberto's, but it's always open to rescue you when the late night munchies/Mexican cravings hit. My favorite day is still Tuesday when you can get a beef or chicken taco for 99 cents. This location is a bit cleaner than others I've seen but it's still the same mediocre food joint. I wish their hot sauce was hotter.
