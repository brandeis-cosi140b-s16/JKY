I have now been here twice. The fish taco is like nothing I have had elsewhere, and I enjoyed it. I can't say that I like it as much as Chipotle, but it is decent food and it has Chipotle slightly beat when it comes to price (although it is still kind of expensive for what you get). One great thing about Rubio's though that I love is that they give you a free meal on your birthday (with signup). That shows that they care for their customers and it was what brought me into the restaurant. I will probably visit from time to time.
