It's been a while since I've been to this Taco Bell.  I dropped in for lunch yesterday and had great service from the cashier Juan.  He was friendly, patient, and made sure the order was correct.  He also made recommendations to customers on the combo menu if it saved them money or if there was a similar items that they might be interested in.  He should be recognized for his effort as most fast food employees don't give a **** about their job or customers.

My food came out fast and accurate.  I ordered a 7 Layer Burrito and 2 Bean Burritos.  The only knock on it was that the Bean Burritos were messy.  When they wrapped them, they got red Sauce all over the outside of it...so the Sauce got on my hands.  Oh well, that happens sometimes during the busy lunch rush.
