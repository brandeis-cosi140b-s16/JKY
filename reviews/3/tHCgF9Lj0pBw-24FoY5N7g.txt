What a menu! Tacos N More has a huge selection; quite overwhelming for first time diners.  They have tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc.  and offer many kinds of meats: chicken, ground beef, shredded beef, pork, as well as more obscure such as tongue, intestines, etc (no thanks!).

I ordered a chicken burrito with rice, beans, and sour cream as well as a shredded beef taco.  They also give you tortilla chips and have a large salsa bar. The chips and salsa were excellent.  The shredded beef taco was also quite good, bursting with flavor. However, my chicken burrito was not good.  The main culprit was the chicken.  My first bite contained a huge piece of cartilage, and a couple bites later I found some bones, then fat.  This continued for the rest of the burrito.  I don't know about you, but I'd rather not have to spit bones/cartilage out when trying to eat a burrito.

Service was friendly and they have the 100+ flavor Coke machine which is nice.  They also have outdoor seating, but it is pretty run down.  I may come back and try something else, but I would avoid the chicken at all costs!
