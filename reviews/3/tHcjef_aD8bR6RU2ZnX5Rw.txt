I HIGHLY recommend that you do not drive through this location.  Both times I have had two people in front of me but wait for 20 minutes to be serviced!  The service inside is way faster.

I really enjoy the Chili Cheese Fries with no red chili, add green chili sauce and cheese.  Yummm!!!  $2.79 and it fills me up and I leave happy.

They also offer a macho sized fresh brewed iced tea with lemon for only 79 cents.
