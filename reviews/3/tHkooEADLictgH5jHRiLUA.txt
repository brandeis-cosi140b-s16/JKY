This was our first time eating at a Baja Fresh. Overall I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting less flavor from a fast food mexican joint, but their fajitas at least had some great flavor (at least with some the of their salsas on it). It was a bit loud in their and I'd probably go for Chipolte/Qdoba over them in the future but in a pinch I'd have no problem going to another Baja Fresh.
