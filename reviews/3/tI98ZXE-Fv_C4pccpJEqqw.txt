I usually love this place.  It's right by my place so I eat here about once every 3 weeks.  People have been nicer there lately and now they usually speak English.  Last time I went, I ordered 2 potato tacos, one with no lettuce. Also a couple more tacos.  I paid for the tacos, then a minute later they told me they were going to make the potato tacos even though they were not on the menu but the cook there that night did not want to do it.  The lady said that any other cook would, but not him.  So we chose two beef tacos instead, one with no lettuce.  They made us pull around to the front to wait.  Once they brought it all out, both beef tacos had lettuce on them. I brought one back in and the cook took the lettuce off put it and new container and the girl at counter handed it right back to me.  I told her there was still lettuce all over this.  So she gave back to cook and he did nothing to it and the lady gave back to me.  I told her it looked exactly the same so she handed it back to him.  He then gave me one that was hardly a crispy shell with cold meat and cheese on it, looks like what they out in the fryer before it was fried.  At that point I was mad.  The drive thru lady came and said she would make it herself.  She made it, and it was delicious.  By then my other food was slightly cold and I was late running an errand.  That cook was very rude and obviously hates his job.
