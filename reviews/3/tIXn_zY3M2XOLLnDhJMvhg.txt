If you're coming here for a margarita, congratulations. Spend the $15 and get the yard margarita on the rocks (name escapes me, evidence of a good night in January). I don't know if it was because it was off season or the bartender was quitting or something, but he made our yard margaritas with GOOD tequila. It wasn't just a dash, either. He used one bottle to make both our drinks. Yes, ladies and gents, I was walking around Vegas with half a bottle of tequila in January. Happy times, happy times. The guacamole was good, the chips were salty. Just like a pre-tequila fest should be. Don't remember the food too much...probably worth noting that it wasn't memorable.
Seriously. Get that drink. You won't need to order anything else during that night. It's something magical.
