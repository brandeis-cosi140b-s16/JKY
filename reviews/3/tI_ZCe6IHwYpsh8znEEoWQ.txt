A friend recommended this restaurant to me for a quick lunch.  It did not disappoint, although the "over the top" decor and piped-in music brought back memories of being at Epcot in Florida.

Great portions, good value and excellent service.  If these are your keys to a great dining experience, then you've found Lindo Michoacan in Summerlin.
