Recently, Habanero's has opened up a new location on the north side of Madison. I have not seen the original owners/workers in there in a good 7 months. Since then, food quality hasn't suffered. Not the same place. They are now more stingy with portion sizes. I use to be able to get a burrito that would burst. I would be luck to get anything other than beans. Want Guac? Cost $75 more and they give you a half of spoonful. 

I believe extra meat use to cost $1. Now it's $2.

Disappointed in what they have become.
