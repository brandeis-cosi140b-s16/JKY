What we ordered:

Shredded Beef Tacos
Bean and Cheese Burro

I think tortillas were stale because they were broken on the tacos and the beans burst through the bottom of the burrito on the first bite and it wasn't grilled (or if it was it was barely cooked).

They do not have a salsa verde option, but their red salsa is good and isn't watered down.

Otherwise the flavor of the beans was nice.

Typical corner taco shop but the lady working there was super sweet. It was later in the evening, around 6:30pm.

Not impressed, but not the worst.
