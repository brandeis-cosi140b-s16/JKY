Stopped in here twice because it was in a good location.  They had good service and cold drinks, but the food was just ok.  I think this would be a great happy hour place for a few drinks and maybe a snack, but it is not the best mexican food out there.  Don't get me wrong, it is not bad, just nothing I would be dying to go back and try again.  If you go there it is probably because of the location and not the quality of the food.
