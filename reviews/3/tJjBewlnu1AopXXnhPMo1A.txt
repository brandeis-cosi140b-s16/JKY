Not quite sure it's up to the hubbub that the 5* reviews are giving. Solid "hole-in-the-wall" type place. Although I didn't feel like everything was amazingly fresh and "authentico" it was cool to order a giant veggie burrito.  My daughter seemed to like her carne asada tacos.

If you're in the area and want a Mexican nibble - try it.
