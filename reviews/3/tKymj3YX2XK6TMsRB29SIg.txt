Hash brown breakfast burrito with ham, sausage, bacon, eggs, cheese and enough cholesterol to have cardio issues before you finish. The food is good. Armandos now has a Filiberto sign. I'm not sure if they bought or merged. 

Just tell me the recipe for the red hot sauce. Anyone, who has the recipe?
