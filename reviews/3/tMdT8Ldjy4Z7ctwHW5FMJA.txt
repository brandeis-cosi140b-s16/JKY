Randomly went here after dinner on a Friday figuring it should be open until 9PM. They have traditional Mexican casual food and baked goods. 

The lady and I awkwardly spoke Spanglish back and forth and I ordered her suggestions of cake and "elote" (not corn but some dough wrapped cheese mystery cylindrical baked good.) The cake with it's syrup soaked strawberry, whipped cream, and moist vanilla interior was spot on but I cannot say the same for the "elote." I also am pretty sure I had the white girl mark up or this place is expensive for a Mexican bakery as the receipt did not have any itemization, no prices were listed in the store, and it was a rather high bill. La Purisima is still my go to for baked goods but I might come back to try the food.
