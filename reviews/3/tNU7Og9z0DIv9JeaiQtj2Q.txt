Hurts me, seriously, it PAINS me to give 3 stars. I want to give 5. But the truth is, it only deserves 2!

I absolutely LOVED the orginal Komex. LOVED IT. I loved the fettucine dish, the calamari tacos, the quesodilla. All soooooo good. I figured, since it's the same owners, just a new location, it will be the same food.

WRONG......Nope. Not at all. 

It seems like all the flavor that makes Komex stand out was GONE here. No love man, no love. My fettucine dish was boring. There was nothing there. Barely a hint of the spices that make it taste so good. 

Maybe, just maybe it's because we ordered it to go. 

This place FINALLY shows up on my side of town...awesome!......only to find it is just eh, I've had better.

I will try it again, and eat in this time. I'm looking forward to bumping it up to the 5 stars I think they truly are!
