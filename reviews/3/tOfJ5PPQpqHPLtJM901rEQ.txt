Screw KFC and its suspiciously anemic-looking, super-salty "chicken" pieces. The second that I found an alternative to my husband's weird craving for fast-food chicken, we dumped the Yoh! empire brand. 

I love me some El Pollo Loco. It's super-cheap (family meal for 4, under $20); the chicken parts are identifiable as real chicken; there are always two to three cooks grilling up a sea of chicken, so you know it's fresh; the marinade makes the meat soooo tasty; and the ranch beans are nummilicious. Love stuffing some of the chicken and beans in a tortilla, drizzling with the avocado green sauce and chowing it down. My kids love it. The husband loves it. 

We only use this one location. The service isn't the fastest, but it is ALWAYS correct and with a smile. 

I must admit - my last visit there was less than stellar. I was asked to park until my drive-through order was ready. After over 10 minutes, and watching another dozen or so cars whiz through without having to park, I called the number on my receipt (no, not lazy... a car full of hungry kids), to ask how much longer it would be.  The girl who answered quickly mumbled, "Ok, be right there" and hung up before I could reply. I went inside at that point, and asked to speak with the manager. No one would say why it was taking so long (I suspect someone forgot) but the manager had already comped a few flan desserts (not bad for being so cheap). When I explained that this visit was a disappointment, after so many other, very satisfying experiences, the manager asked for my receipt and promptly refunded every cent. I didn't even ask. This removed all doubt as to whether I would return. I will definitely be back. In fact, maybe this Friday... hmmmm...
