I hit this place up in hour 2 of my 5 hour wait for my flight and ordered the quesadilla.  Came with nacho chips, salsa, guac, and sour cream.  

Everything was GOOD.  My final bill was under 10 bucks (I didn't get a beer or anything) and I left very satisfied.

Perhaps my favorite part of the establishment was the staff.  The bartender was very nice and outgoing.  We talked sports and stuff.  He's probably used to making small talk with all sorts of weary travelers.  Anyways, it was appreciated.
