Not quite sure why this place is so raved about.  I got a pastor and asada taco and an asada quesadilla.  The pastor was pretty good.  Carne asada had a lot of chewy parts and tasted slightly burnt, not much flavor.  I'm not sure what the crispy thing was that they put on top of my quesadilla (it looked like a fried corn tortilla maybe?) but it tasted burnt and gross.  Maybe I wasn't supposed to eat it?  lol, who knows.  The ordering style was weird.  You have to stand in a different line for different types of meat, they load up your tray with your order, and you go to the cashier to pay.  I probably should have said to go in line but I wasn't sure how this place worked so I had to ask the cashier to wrap up my plates to go after I paid.  I'll stick to Los Tacos next door.  Their carne asada is to die for and their quesadillas are a much better value.
