It has been a while since I was last at Willy and Jose's and I think I remember the food being better.  It seems that their location change to where the old cafe used to be has affected it.  That is not to say that the food was bad.  The chips, salsa and bean dip were all pretty good.  I ordered two item combo with a chicken tamale and beef flauta.  The tamale, while tasting good, was small with little meat and a thin layer of masa.  The flauta was filled with delicious beef and was quite good.  It was odd to me that it came out covered in enchilada sauce.  I am used to getting a flauta dry with a scoop of sour cream and guacamole on the side.  The rice and beans on the plate were both OK though not my favorite version.  The rice was more spiced and more heavily seasoned than I like.  And I typically prefer black beans to refried most anywhere I go.  As for the rest of the parties meals, my grandma did not care for her chile relleno stating that is was "different."  This is not in any way a mark against Willy and Jose's.  My grandma is just very particular in what she likes and if it is not what she gets at home it is not good.  My dad, on the other hand, said the relleno was good but perhaps on the spicy side for the more sensitive eater.  I would not know.  I don't eat rellenos.  I did, however, take home the left overs from my aunt's meals.  The chicken quesadilla was loaded and quite filling.  The steak boracho from my other aunt was tough and lacked significant seasoning though I could smell the whiskey it was marinated/cooked in.  I just simply could not taste it.  Finally, the margaritas ordered by my aunts were sent back for not having enough tequila.  They consider themselves margarita connoisseurs and should know a bad drink from a good.  The waitress seemed to agree that the bar tender had not used enough tequila and was happy to add a bit for them.  Over all, not a bad meal at Willy and Jose's but I've had better from the same place in the past.
