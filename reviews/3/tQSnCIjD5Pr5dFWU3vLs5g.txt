Fundido is amazing but, prices seem to go up and up. I honestly. An not bring myself to pay almost 20.00 for one any more. Luna does have great coupons like buy one entree get one free though so hubby's and I will get fundidos and I don't feel so guilty. I worked at luna in high school and I have no problem eating there ;) other places such as pei Wei and quiznos I wil never eat in again lol!
