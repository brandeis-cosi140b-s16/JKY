As someone who has done business valuations for other local mexican food chains such as Macayo's, Serrano's, Carolines, Carlos OBrien's, and Valle Luna, Ajo Al's seems to fall right in line with these types of family owned mexican concepts.

The families have owned and operated them for many years, some have passed them down to the next generation, but all seem to follow the same recipe and that isn't a good thing. For one, none of these businesses have invested a single dime in their locations within the last 15 years and it shows. Ajo Al's is no exception. Their decor, with the cowhide booths, old carpet and annoying table tops are outdated, dirty and simply don't work. Sure, you probably don't care if the food is good, but the smell in these places make the food taste worse and that smell is caused by old carpet.

Ajo Al's is average food. My suggestion to the owners would be to do the following:

1. Use less salt. I think I have had several heart-attacks leaving the place. Tone it down.
2. Tear out your carpet and ugly cowhide booths and remodel. It is time and you simply cannot compete without a makeover once every 7-10 years.
