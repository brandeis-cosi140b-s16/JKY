If you are a traveler and working in the west valley, it is late and you don't want to commute then try this place out.  Phoenix is interesting when eating mexican.  You tend to get more of the Sonoran influence which is basically american mexican food which tends to be heavy with sour cream and yellow cheeses.  

This place used to be an ichi ban and you will notice the left over teppan tables as you walk in.  The food is good they have a good assortment of your usual enchiladas and burritos. 

They have plenty of beer selections and some margaritas. The service was very good and that will definitely suffice for the three stars.
