Took my son and his buddy to Rosa's. The service was a bit slow but the food was great. The retried beans are the best I have had in a long time. And the salsa was spectacular. I had the pork tamale with enchilada sauce, it was ok.  My son got the rolled tacos and his buddy got the shrimp taco. They thought it was good.
