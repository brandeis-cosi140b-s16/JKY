Mmmmm first time eating here, my expectations arnt high for a place like this, i was expecting same style as a taco bell but a little better portioned. As i thought, the portions were def. better and the food better quality. Not much of a huge fan of drive through eatings but i was in a rush. I had the double grilled chicken burrito with sweet potato fries and it was ok for what i paid and how fast it was. The service is quick and the portions are good for the price. All in all if your in a rush and your on a time crunch, hit the place up. You cant really go wrong.
