i am a california native where good mexican food comes from so i decided to go try this place out.  well when i walked in the door i had to wait 5 minutes until somebody came out to greet me and take my order.  but the cashier was very nice and helpful when she finally did come out.  it's too hot here in vegas and i didn't want to cook.

they have alot to offer on their menu so i decided to try the nachos and a burrito for work tomorrow.  the nachos were plenty and probably could eat on them 3 times.  lot of chicken, bean, and all the other fixings. 

the shredded beef burrito was okay as i had better.  everything was made to order so i waited another 10 minutes but that was fine.  i probably will try this place again and see what their tacos taste like.  being from california my tongue palate knows what good authentic mexican food should taste like.
