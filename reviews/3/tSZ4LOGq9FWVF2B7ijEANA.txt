Finally stopped for dinner after driving past every day and living only 3 blocks down the road. Everything was fresh and delicious. You get bean dip and salsa with chips and soup before the main course. 

The small band playing through dinner was entertaining, though a bit loud for the quiet Sunday evening crowd. 

The service was delayed (appeared a game that was on in the bar was more important than our business) and they couldn't bring us the table side guacamole we ordered because "the avocados weren't ripe enough" 

Not a slam dunk but its convenient enough for good Mexican food that I'll come back again.
