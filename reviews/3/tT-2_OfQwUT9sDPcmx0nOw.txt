I was here the other day and it was decent. The staff was friendly and the food was adequate. I like that they have a salsa bar. I have been here a few times and it's always reasonably good, although some of the food tends to be a bit on the bland side, especially their veggie burrito. Before you say veggies are bland in general, if you're a good cook then you can make anything taste good so I don't wanna hear it. The fish tacos are good.
