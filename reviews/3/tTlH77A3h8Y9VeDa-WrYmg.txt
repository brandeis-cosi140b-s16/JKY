Umm, surprised there is no reveiw yet for this location!!!! O.K. anyways this Baja Fresh looks and feels like a typical Baja Fresh. You go in order, wait for them to call your order, get up and pick up your order. There is a salsa bar and you also get your own drinks. I have never felt that this location was dirty or too slow. Sometimes they get orders mixed up but hey we aren't all robots yet....
I really only get excited here over the Langostino Lobster tacos-YUM!!!!
Oh and I can't forget my favorite salsa- Mango Salsa-YUMM!!!!
Oh and one more thing they do have good Churros-YUMMY!!!

The churros are short and thick not long and skinny(sounds like I'm describing some guys at the club last night but I'm not...) Anyhow, the churros do have a bitter after taste everytime- but that hasn't stopped me from enjoying them.

So yes I would and do go back to Baja Fresh for my Lobster Taco,Mango Salsa & Churro fix....
