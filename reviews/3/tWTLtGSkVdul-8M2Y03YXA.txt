The food was good, and the staff was friendly.  However, a few minor changes are in order:

They serve powder coffee creamer, not cream.  Kinda cheap, guys.
The plastic ware is very cheap and breaks, kinda hard to eat your food with a broken fork. ;-(

However, the food was very good and the place was clean.  Just a few tweeks and the place wold rock!!
