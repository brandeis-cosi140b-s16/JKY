The family and I came here because I had a craving from fish tacos. My little guy got the chicken nuggets. And my husband and I shared a fried shrimp plate and a fried fish plate,then used those to make tacos for ourselves. So, first the kids chicken nuggets... Honestly kinda gross. The meat inside was much (like they deep fried canned chicken, for chicken salad) now almost every restaurant gives the kids menu short shrift and Las Glorias is no exception. This isn't a complaint just an observation. Now the main dish(es): the shrimp, the batter was ok, nothing flavorful or extraordinary. Not greasy which often happens when coming to a joint like this. The fish was equally adequate (and underwhelming) , except that was greasy. My husband picked off most of the batter and then ate it. Nothing about the meal was great. What was really good however was the salsa they brought to the table with the chips. That was particularly good and gave the tacos the only flavor (other than the limes) there was to be had. 

As a non-food aside: the music was loud and incessant. Just like every other 'authentic' Mexican food joint. 

Would I go here again? Probably not. This is too big a city with too many wonderful restaurants to waste time just getting adequate food.
