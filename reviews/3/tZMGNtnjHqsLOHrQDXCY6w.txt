Some like it hot...
Not the best Mexican food that I've had, but I would definitely keep this one on my list.  The menu is very affordable and the food is wicked spicy, both of which I love.  I had the fish taco on  my last visit and loved their seemingly home made tortilla.  The chips and salsa that are placed on the table to begin with are not the best.  The chips could use more salt and the salsa could use a couple variations besides red/green.  Keep in mind...low price point so I'm not too judgmental.
