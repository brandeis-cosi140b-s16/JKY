Since I was in the mood for bomb a** tacos I read the reviews and decided to give this place a try... ordered a Carne Asada Torta and 2 Pastor tacos .. husband ordered Carne Asada Fries ... The Torta was great found some fat in the meat but I got over it and he really liked the fries.. the tacos on the other hand weren't so good.. they were dry and kinda burnt tasting.. I would go back but not for tacos.. and probably through the Drive thru cause its convenient and the service wasn't so great so no need to go back in. The young girl that took our order was nice but never asked how anything was or even if we needed anything.  Also there was an older lady at the counter (in a hot pink Kelly Bundy dress ) who I'm sure was an owner of the place that thought she was better than everyone who walked in and never smiled just stared at everyone and made you feel uncomfortable.  If youre looking for good tacos, Tacos El Gordo is next door it's always busy and fast paced but the tacos are better !!
