I'm not entirely sure why it was so dark in Super Mex.   Thematically, I don't think of American-Mexican restaurant food as "brooding."  However, it was a good choice for a late-shift lunch break, as it was inexpensive, well-portioned and filling.  I think it came out (financially and serviced) about as well as it would have been at a grab-and-dash place like Roberto's, and they weren't skimpy on the free chips.   

But who turned the lights out?
