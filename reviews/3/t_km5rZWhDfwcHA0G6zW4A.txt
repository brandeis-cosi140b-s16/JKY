Other than the sand angle, definitely just an average bar.  The drinks are okay, the service was average.  Definitely caters to a younger crowd, although the crowd was mixed the last 2 times we were there.  Have never eaten there.  The music is definitely geared to 20 sometimes, although not as bad as the techno pseudo music played at some other clubs.  Will definitely go back, not because of the club, but because of the location.
