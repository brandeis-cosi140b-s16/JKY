Found this place on Yelp when visiting Scottsdale, AZ.  It is a fairly small place and the bar appeared to be filled with the regulars when we stopped in late on a Tuesday afternoon.  That made it a bit noisy, but the crowd wasn't really a problem; they were obviously just having fun (they appeared to be retirees; probably snowbirds from back home in Minnesota!). 

I had the Pambazo "House Special" Sandwich, which was carnitas pork, with red sauce and creamy slaw on a roll.  Nothing super special, but it was good.
