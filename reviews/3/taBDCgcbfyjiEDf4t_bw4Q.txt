Went here because of the "shop small" AmEx event. I love texmex food so I have been curious, but I don't think I will be back. Texmex is greasy, but when you eat part of your food and the one inch void in the container is filled with a clear liquid (oil) you lose your appetite.  Besides the food seemed like one step above Mexican day at school.

The snowbirds seem to love this place, but there are other options that involve less of a wait and less lubricant.
