A note on context: I arrived into terminal 3 at 10pm hungry and looking at a 12:50am flight to the east coast, so I was none too picky.

That said, the service was fast even as the staff was clearly closing down for the night (seems like it closes right around 10pm with some slight leeway). There was only a limited menu available, so I had the shredded chicken burrito, which came with nachos, and two large Sam Adams. The burrito was fine, neither wonderful nor terrible, and the chips were fine though sans salsa, which was a bummer. The draft beer was middle of the line, no complaints.

My bill was $21, each item being about $7 each, which isn't bad at all for a sit-down airport restauarant. If you enjoy lounging before a flight, this restaurant is cheaper than an airport Chili's and has mutliple TVs with different sports channels on, so not bad for the traveler on the go in Phoenix.
