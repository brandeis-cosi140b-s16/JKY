Great tacos! Had the chicken & it's mixed with grilled peppers and onions which gave the taco some girth. Great guacamole & much better than cheap generic Mexican restaurants. However, while we were there, a police officer came in and went back to the kitchen. Another officer came in & they escorted an employee out. Was sketchy. Walked outside to leave & cop cars parked at entrance. Had 5 people outside arguing with police. Ummmm......
