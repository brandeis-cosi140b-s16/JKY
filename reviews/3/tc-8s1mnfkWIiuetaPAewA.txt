Not the best, not the worst. I ordered the tacos, and I found that they are very stingy with the protein. Not to mention the preparer of the food didn't really seem like she wanted to be there. She didn't seem enthused to be serving me. Now that I mention it, none of the workers there seemed very welcoming that day. The mango salsa is on point and the other menu items look pretty good. I'll be honest, it will only take one more experience like this when it comes to customer service to drive me away from this place. Note that this was my first time there.
