This is the only Mexican restaurant I've yet to see in Pittsburgh, but it gets the job done.  The interior is weird and dark, and the bar is cluttered with random crap so you can't sit there.  Significant portions of the dining area were also cluttered with empty beer and liquor boxes, and this preponderance of clutter made me wonder about the kitchen.  The service was fine, friendly.  The food really isn't that bad.  It's barrio Mexican, which is my favorite.  Word to the wise: when they say something comes with beef, they mean ground beef.  You have to ask for steak.  For example, the $11 big quesadilla with beef is a disgusting tortilla shoved full of ground beef and cheese.  You have to request sliced beef.
