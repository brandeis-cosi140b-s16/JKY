Kind of like Roberto's. The food is pretty good as far as semi fast food Mexican goes. it's a much better alternative to Taco Bell that's for sure. The best part is that it is open twenty four hours to crave those late night munchies or when your wife sends you out at two AM for a food run. The prices are very reasonable too. I'll usually order a Carne asada tostada which only cost $3.80. Sometimes the even have specials on tacos buy two get one free. Throw in the little side salad bar with radishes, cucumbers, and marinated carrots with jalapeno and you got a rather large meal four under for bucks.
