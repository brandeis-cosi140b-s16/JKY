I've been coming here on and off for about 6 months now.. I have noticed at times they can be inconsistent with their food and quality. The staff seems to be mostly family which is nice and the owner lady is very nice as well. There have been times I would give this place 5 stars and times I would give 1. Wish it wasn't like that. Taco Tuesdays are probably the best day to go. The interior is not exactly pleasant, which is strange because there is a paint store right next door!! If your thinking about going here I hope your a gambling person who likes a 50/50 chance on a good visit!
