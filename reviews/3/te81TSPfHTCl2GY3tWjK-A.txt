Was excited to see they offered a Sonoran style hot dog. Tasted okay but definitely not even close to what a Sonoran style is supposed to be. Avoid it if you have had the real thing. For example, they just use a large regular hot dog bun. Couldn't even bother to get the bread right.

Okay in a pinch.
