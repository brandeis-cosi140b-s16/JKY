I hear hoots and hollers about this staple of the NoDa district but I was honestly not too impressed. I went in with two other friends. The hostess was polite and friendly and entertained me with a chat while I waited for my friends to show. But this was more of an obligation as Cabo is one of those places where they will not seat you if your whole party is not there. Even on a Tuesday night when half the restaurant is empty. So don't even ask.

When they showed up and we got our table we each ordered something a little different. I split my taco choice getting one with fried shrimp and the other with fried fish - it was a fried food kind of night for me. My friends got salmon tacos straight-up and the salmon salad. For starters the salad and the salmon in it were pretty tasty. I can't remember if it was guacamole or sliced avocados in it but either way it was a delicious addition. Apparently that salad is one of the hottest things on the menu here.

But my other friend and I figured on the namesake of the place and went with the tacos. The plates came out with that delicious smell of fried and grilled fish and we dove in. But the fried fish was tasteless and 3/4 fried batter crust which just blanketed the general flavor. The fried shrimp was okay but in general the tacos were lacking in additional spices. If you want better seafood or other types of tacos I would suggest Krazy Fish first and foremost. Most likely I will be back to Cabo for some function or other gathering but I won't likely bank on the tacos again. That salad will be what I go for next.
