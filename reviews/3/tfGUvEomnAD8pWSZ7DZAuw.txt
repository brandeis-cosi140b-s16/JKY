I stopped in today before my flight and was honestly underwhelmed.  I am shocked that Chef Silvana puts her name to this dumbed down concept.  The staff was not friendly at all...they seemed bothered to help me.  The chicken burrito was good, but nothing special...you expect a lot more after dining at Barrio Cafe on 16th Street!
