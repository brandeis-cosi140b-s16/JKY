I'm surprised by the many negative reviews of Tinta. I went here for lunch and thought it was fairly good and the amount of food I got was substantial for the price. I got a bowl with rice and beans, the pulled pork and beef, hot salsa, cilantro, grilled jalapeno, cheese.... it was spicy and tasty. The bowl cost around 7$. It was certainly better than most food court meals. If I were in Arizona Mills, I would eat here again.
