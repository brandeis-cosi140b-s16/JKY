We went there once.  And never went back.  We live around the corner and love Mexican food....so it's a little odd that we just never go, and there's probably a reason...it might be that the restaurant setup is a little awkward (there's just a bar/pit in the middle and tables around)...it might be that the food was OK, not great....who knows?  
But, on the plus, and the reasons we'll probably pop in again, the drinks were generous and they didn't skimp on the liquor (I'm looking at you & your skimpy cocktails, Max & Erma's!), the selection was better than your standard Amercanized Mexican fare, so it's worth another visit, but I'm still waiting to be impressed.
