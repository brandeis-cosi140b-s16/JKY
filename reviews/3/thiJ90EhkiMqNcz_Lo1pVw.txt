Took a client out to try BQ for lunch today. At best the food was ok and a bit pricy for lunch. Had to sit at the bar as the staff couldn't clean tables fast enough to find us one. With one manger two hostesses and five wait staff couldn't understand that one. Might be a cool place to take out of towers but won't be back on any regular bases.
