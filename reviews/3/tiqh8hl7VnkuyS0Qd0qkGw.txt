Two words sum up this restaurant: ghetto Mexican. Don't mean that in a bad way. So it is your typical Mexican food in very large portions.  We came here for New Year's eve with the BF's fam because the father wanted a mariachi band but you really loose ambiance here because it is kind of ghetto. We couldn't find the place at night because it has a tiny door. It was also very empty on NYE prob because all the usual goers upgraded lol.  Anyway would not recommend if you are looking for ambience and polished food and are picky like me.  But if you want cheap Mexican and large portions this is your thing.
