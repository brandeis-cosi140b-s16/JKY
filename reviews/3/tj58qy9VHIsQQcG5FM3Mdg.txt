This place would have gotten 4 or 5 stars but it's gone downhill since I first ate there.

I'm a big fan of toastada salads.. I love eating the salad and then dipping the "bowl" in a bowl of soup. When I used to order them, I would get a salad and a bowl of tortilla soup.... now - their version of "bowl of soup" differs each time I'm here. They put everything in a 4 oz "bowl"...and I swear that 4 oz is a cup of soup not a bowl... also, their service has gone  to the birds.. They are borderline rude. 

What's so annoying is... no matter how bad the service experience is --- I  LOVE THEIR FOOD (reminds me of my Oyshi sometimes). I can't really give this place a bad review because each and every time - the food is so awesome.... YES they over charge... YES they change their size standards...but every time --- their food is pretty darn good.

I hate to say it but - I really like it. My work friend swore that the last time we went there would be our last --- but then we finished lunch and then we looked at each other and said, "so - next week?"
