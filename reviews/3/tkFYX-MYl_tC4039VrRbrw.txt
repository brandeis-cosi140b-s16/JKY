My boyfriend and I have been to all three locations here in the Las Vegas valley, and this one by far has the best view! You can see the entire city of Las Vegas from your table. This location is Very Beautiful, however, I only gave this place three stars due to the service. We literally only saw our waiter once the entire night, and once we were ready to go, it took him 20 minutes to grab the card to pay the check. I understand it's busy, but it was a Tuesday night, and not that many customers were there. Also, management did see us waiting, and made eye contact with my boyfriend, but still nothing was done. I would come back for the food and the view. However, I prefer the original location in terms of service
