I kind of have a love hate relationship with this place. I hate how much the food cost just for a burrito but I love not having to spend three hours in the bathroom afterwards. I hate the overly yuppie vibe but love the clean look of the restaurant. I.... well you get the idea! Growing up in the valley I was surrounded by mexican food places so I always wondered why someone would pay almost 7 dollars for something you could get for around 3? I guess it is the not having to worry about being shanked by someone in a parking lot in south phoenix or finding grandma's hair in your combo platter( it will make you wiser). All I know is that for me it is nice to have a place to eat if you do not want to gorge on a McNasty burger (I'm hating it!). Just wish they would dial back the hipster thing to 1995 GAP store levels (no I will not sign your petition!!) I get it you care about the earth, now can I please eat my food?
