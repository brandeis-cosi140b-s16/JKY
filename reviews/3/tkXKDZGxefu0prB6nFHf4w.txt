Its the beginning of birthday weekend, so I figured, why not hang out with my friends at Spanish Fly. I'm down to try something a little different. 

I've lived in Vegas and LA. Both cities know how to do clubs. Particularly outdoor clubs. I just assumed that this would be no different.

Unfortunately, it was hot as hell last night, and borderline stormy. Pair that with a birthday party full of imbibing, and you have a disaster on your hands.

We had a cabana reserved. The staff was VERY nice and accommodating. Our server was typical Scottsdale....attractive, big boobs, blonde, etc. 

We hung out, drank a while, but left before the night ended because it was so damn hot out. No misters. Our cabana's fan had one setting: slow. The TV didn't have a remote. Oh well.

Drinks were stiff, bathrooms are well-maintained and the music is pretty good. Crowd is alright here. Definitely not as douchy as The Mint, but not as cool as Smash.

Yes, we ended up going to Smash afterwards. I'll come back for daytime partying when it's a pool party.
