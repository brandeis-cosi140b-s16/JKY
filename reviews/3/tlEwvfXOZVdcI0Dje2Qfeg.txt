My mother and I came here for lunch. When we walked in there were only 2 tables  with parties of about 6 or 8 and 2 tables of 2. Seemed like that they had already been served their meal. It took a long time for us to receive our meal. While we were waiting the restaurant filled up. A couple of times we waited quite a while for our iced teas to be refilled. I ordered the Molcajetes. My octopus was charred. I had a bite but it made me gag. However, I did like everything else that was served in the bowl. Just make sure you have something cold to drink because it is very spicy hot. The refried beans were excellent. Not sure if we will come back. Average experience.
