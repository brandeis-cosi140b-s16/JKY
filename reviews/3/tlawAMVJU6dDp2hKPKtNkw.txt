Just tried this place for the 1st time yesterday and was really happy with their meat (I chose chicken), but sad at the lack of options - no jalepenos? Shame! But my salad was good and tasted fresh & healthy. I'll go back, but only if there's no Moe's around!

PS: Moe's gives you chips and salsa bar - this place you gotta pay big bucks for chips and a tiny thing of salsa - NOT COOL!
