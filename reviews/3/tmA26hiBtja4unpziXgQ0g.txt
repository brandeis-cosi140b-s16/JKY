I just recently found this place on Rainbow near Smoke ranch. This is my 3rd time here the food is decent enough to eat here when I don't feel like driving too far for real good Mexican food. The raspados ( crushed ice with a syrup flavoring ) are the best I've had here by far. The down side to this place is that they don't have a variety of meat options for tacos. And the wait was the worse. Im a pretty patient person but I swear the wait for fast food tacos was over 20 minutes and the place wasn't packed at all.
