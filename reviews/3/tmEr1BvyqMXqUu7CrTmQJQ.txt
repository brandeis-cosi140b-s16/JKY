Not much around this area so my options were limited.  I asked what was best and ended up with a carne asada burrito.  The tortilla was homemade and delicious as well as the salsas (although lacking much heat).  The beef was of low quality.  I think people come here for the price based on the area, prices of food, and quality.  I would come back but try a different type of burrito.  Nice people and typical hole in the wall Mexican restaurant atmosphere.
