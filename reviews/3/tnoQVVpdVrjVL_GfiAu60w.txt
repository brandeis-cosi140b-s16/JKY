Good pupusas are always found in seedy-looking areas, but the interior here is surprisingly well-appointed. Pricing is super-low, $2/ea is a bargain for the size of the 'pusas here- they're filling, cheesy, and served with the perfect coleslaw and tomato sauce.

Added on an order of yucca frita, not realizing it was an entr√©e plate including chicharrones but the order was good- I prefer my yucca super salty and garlicky, and this wasn't quite that, but it was still a good portion size and very crispy.

Service is friendly- don't be afraid to make a phone in order, even if they answer in spanish the phone is quickly passed to someone who can take your order and fill it correctly.
