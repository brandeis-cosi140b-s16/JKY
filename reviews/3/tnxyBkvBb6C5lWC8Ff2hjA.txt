This place is like a healthy version of cafe rio or Costa Vida. It's pretty good,  but really spicy! It helps if you ask what's good before you order if its your first time. My husband got a steak burrito and I got a steak salad and we both felt like there needed to be some kind of sauce or dressing and it was a little too spicy. But all the ingredients were really fresh. Their chips and guacamole are also really good and the staff was really friendly.
