I like what they are doing, still needs some work around the edges, but it has potential. I especially love the micro-farmers market they do and sell fresh veggies right out front. Service was a bit slow.

Let's start with their salsa - it's very close to pico and just didn't have much flavor, which is odd, because their house-made hot sauce is flavorful and pretty spicy.

The enchiladas were a bust - taste was bland and dry tortillas, just weren't flavorful. The taquitos on the other hand were pretty tasty and included lots of cheese on top. They had lamb barbacoa tacos on special and I thought they were on the right track, but a bit dry and the pieces weren't cut small enough .

I think the mole-covered burrito is probably the way to go. How can you go wrong? The menu has some nooks and crannys and with the specials - there is quite a bit of exploring to do.

They need to get some side money to the city councilmen (or whatever it takes) to get their liquor license - Mexican food without Mexican beer is a tragedy.
