Food is good, but the menu is not correct.  I ordered the 4 mini burros which state it comes in the four different varieties. The cashier informed me I can only get two types and upon arrival at my table they were mini chimichangas instead of burros.  Food is good just disappointed in the deception of what the menu says.
