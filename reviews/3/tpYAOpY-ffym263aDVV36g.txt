Seems to be a family owned establishment.  I've been here a few times and the service is always friendly.  I order the bean burrito and it's very good.  The beans have a good flavor and the tortillas are good as well.

I would definitely go back to try a breakfast burrito or something different.  The salsa was fresh and different than most other burrito shops which was nice.  

It's reasonably priced.  The decor and such could use a little updating.  The tables and chairs are a little janky but this isn't a big deal to me with dive establishments. 

 I will go back.
