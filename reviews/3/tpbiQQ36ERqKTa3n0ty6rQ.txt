There is really only one menu item that gives this restaurant cause for 3 stars otherwise it would probably be a 1 or 2 star joint. That is the "Doug's Surf and Turf". Too bad Doug cant design customer service the same way he designed this great shrimp and steak burrito! NO calling ahead for take out. Perturbed burritesses at regular customers, make you feel like a major killjoy for ruining their empty restaurant atmosphere with your surf and turf order. still this location is better than the new one at Summerlin. That place is abyssmal.
