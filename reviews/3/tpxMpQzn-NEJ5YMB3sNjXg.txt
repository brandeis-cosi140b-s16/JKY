Me and my husband came here for lunch on a Saturday. It wasn't moderately busy. The servers kept walking past us without noticing us. It took a little bit for the server to come over to order our drinks. The alcohol was expensive. $10 for a margarita. We both got waters. Husband ordered the Sorrano Dog and it was very good. I ordered the Carn√© Asada burrito for $12.95. It only came with lettuce and a small amount of pico de gallo. Additional add ons were extra for the burrito. Burrito contained dry steak, black beans, cheese, and rice mixed with bean mixture. The filling was very dry and not very good to me. I had to eat some of my husband's fries. We also had the complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were all broken up into small pieces, like the bottom of the bag chips. The salsa was good. I had to pour it over my burrito to make it taste better.
