Omg the nachos.... Yes.... And the bean dip.... 

Stopped at morenos for a quick lunch. Service was quick! Place got busy for lunch so you know people like it. Hubby and I shared the nachos that came with lots of yummy carne asada and a street taco just to try it. 

Taco was alright. 2.5 stars. 
Everything else is a solid 3. 

It's good! Amazing? Eh, not really but I will be back for these nachos...... Believe it.
