Think hot dog stand in New York... But in a parking lot and instead. it's tacos.

The area in the front was a  mess. No one had cleaned the condiment area for some time and it wasn't covered. I know in most Mexican restaurants have sneeze guards but this place doesn't have that nor do they have covers... A little bothering.

The tacos are TJ Style (Tijuana, Mexico) and the flavor was OK. It was nice to be able to eat something like this since the only TJ Style tacos I like are located in San Diego.

If we're driving by and I feel like having me some TJ style tacos, I'd take a make the visit.
