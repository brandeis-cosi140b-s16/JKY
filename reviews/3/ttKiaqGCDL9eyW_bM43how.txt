A mexican place coming out of Iowa is like an Italian joint coming out of China.  It just doesn't seem to make sense.  I also find it funny that the day of my visit, all the staff were white women (an older attractive woman, and two cute college girls).  Not a Mexican in sight.  

Its not really a problem, because Panchero's isn't really Mexican food.  This is a burrito joint similar to Chipotle or Qdoba.  

So if this place is just like whats already out there, why should you go?  

#1) Freshly pressed tortilla.  Its a gimmick, but a tasty one.  Somebody who reviewed said something like "it doesn't taste like a real tortilla ... its too chewy."  Hey moron ... this is what a real tortilla, sans processed food preservatives, is supposed to taste like.  

#2) They mix the ingredients for you before folding your burrito.  Their burritos aren't as big as Chipotle, but at least you don't bite into it and get a giant mouthful of rice, and then a mouthful of meat.  Instead, you get a mix of all the ingredients in every mouthful.

All in all, the place is good, not great.  Nothing about the actual burrito (besides the tortilla) stood out, but thats not a bad thing.  It was filling, tasty, and a reasonable value.  I'll make it back there at some point in the future, but won't go out of my way.
