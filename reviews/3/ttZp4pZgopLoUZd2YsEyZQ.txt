Very friendly staff, great selection on menu, delicious flavor. However one issue is that our guacamole appetizer was barley served 2 minutes after our salads and then our meals were brought to the table in less than a minute after the guacamole was delivered. Timing was off!! 
I also felt that the menu is over priced $5-$6. 
I've spent less money at 5-star Mexican restaurants. 
The atmosphere was very Traditional, inviting, and beautiful. I'm very interested in exploring their happy hour specials.
