Meh......    Mediocre at best. Don't eat here if you are vegetarian or have diet restrictions.  While they attempt to accommodate one's needs, unfortunately they fell far short for us. I ordered a shrimp enchilada which had LARD in the shrimp mixture.  After telling our waitress I was vegetarian but would eat fish. My husband ordered Flautas de pollo, a chicken dish with crispy burrito type shells. And for real people get over chipolte sauce. It's not that awesome. 

I'll give them that the chips were good while they were warm and the bucket they come in is cute and just the right size. 

Do yourself a favor and just the block over to the container and eat at Pinches Tacos!
