12 girls for dinner they were more then accommodating to all of us, checks were split from the beginning which was so nice.  The food was pretty good,  restaurant was not busy at all I don't think we had 1 complaint about the food.  The walk from the front was a little far for girls in dresses and 4 inch heels.  If your staying at this hotel I would recommend trying it out.
