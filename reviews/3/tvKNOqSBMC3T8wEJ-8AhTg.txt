This place is in a questionable part of town.  The exterior and interior are simply decorated.  A little effort would be nice.

Our server was friendly,quick and attentive.

The chips and salsa are good.  The salsa has a nice touch of spice to it.  I could always use more, but it is hotter than most places.

We ordered a cheese crisp to start.  It is essentially a super thin pizza crust with a ton of cheese meleted over it.  I love thin crust pizza, and I love cheese even more, but it could use some seasoning or some kind of sauce.

For my meal I ordered the cheese enchilada lunch special.  The enchiladas were ok.  The sauce was very good.  The rice was ok.
