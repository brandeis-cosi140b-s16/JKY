We decided to try this place since Kona was packed. There happy hour food was pretty much all fried food nothing healthy. Nor was any of it to write home about . the so called spicy was sweet. There was 6 of us we all ordered dinner and not one of us was impressed what so ever.then or dirty plates sat in front of us for over a half a hour tell I see our girl and I asked her to please take them away.  So not impressed with this place. Don't think we will be back:((( we will stick with Kona grill
