I am not overly impressed by La Cabana.  I ordered a lunch special consisting of a shredded beef soft shelled taco, two pork tamales, rice and beans.  The taco had good enough flavor but the shell was soggy from sitting in a foam box and basically steaming in its own juices.  The tamales had the right meat to masa ratio but was a bit bland.  The red sauce was almost paste-y.  Some more spice and some more salt would have been a nice touch.  The rice, on the other hand, had too much salt for my liking.  I almost always eat all of my rice from a Mexican restaurant.  Not today.  And the refried beans I don't think were cooked all the way through.  I found a couple of crunchy beans and so I did not finish them.  If there is a silver lining to that gassy cloud it is that the beans were almost obviously homemade.  I don't know the last time I found crunchy beans in a can.  At $10 for this meal, I am disappointed. I don't know that I will be back.  But at least I gave La Cabana a try.  It was a welcome change to the limited fast food I have grown so tired of.
