I was hungry as I didn't eat breakfast before boarding my plane and Phoenix is where my connecting flight is. I ordered from the take out line. I tried ordering from the menu on the wall, but was told they still serving only breakfast and the cashier lady pointed me to the breakfast menu. So many options to choose from or the lack thereof... I ordered the Arizona Burrito which came with eggs. The burrito had cheese meat and potatoes on it. The meat saved the burrito from being too land. If I'm going to pay $13 for a burrito, it should've been a bit more tastier than this. I can get a much bigger burrito at a taqueria anywhere in San Francisco for about half that price.
