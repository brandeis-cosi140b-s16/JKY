Second time I've been here now, and I must say service was slow both times. The server/host/food runner combination really takes away from efficiency in my opinion. However the server is always friendly, despite the lack of expediency at times. 

Moving on from the service, the food is actually a refreshing change of the usual Mexican foods, as you won't find the generic carne asada and such dishes here. Octopus Tostada is one I highly recommend, very nice blend of textures and flavors. Price is also very acceptable for the portion and sizes.
