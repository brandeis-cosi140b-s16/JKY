We went there for lunch and expecting to be able to have good steak options...no...only for dinner. It seems like except for a few places people are stuck in this country to eating good food only for dinner and be limited to some less tasty options for lunch.  We grew up in Europe and lunch is the main meal of the day and we try to keep it that way since evening large meals are not very good for balanced diet and a good sleep.
We had fish trio -was ok, some too spicy; the blackened steak -too peppery. The mushroom and filet toast were great. However the baked oysters were way too spicy- could not taste any oyster. Also we had the beef skewers- sort of dry but ok in the end.
