First time here. Lube the hippy vibe. 
Ordered 3 Travis, one carne, chicken and one fish. Carne rocks, fish was gross way fishy and still undecided on the chicken. Big tacos, comes with beans, cabbage, rice and cheese. I skippted the cheese.
Eating as I write. ..the chicken doesn't have much flavor. Three green sauce helps however. The ingredients are definitely fresh and the tortilla is very fresh, fluffy and beautiful.
