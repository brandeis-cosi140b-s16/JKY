Overlooking the fact that this chain started on the campus of TCU, and TCU just beat the Badgers in the Rose Bowl, this place was just fine.  

Fuzzy's has locations throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, and Texas usually knows what it's talking about re: Mexican food so I thought I'd give this place a try.

I got the taco plate dinner, which features two tacos and two sides.  I chose the crispy fish tacos, and they did not disappoint.  The fish was perfectly seasoned, grilled and moist, accompanied by a lightly spicy mayo-based sauce, iceberg lettuce, fresh ripe diced tomatoes, and a heaping load of cilantro.  The flavor was good, though the tacos were somewhat small.

For my two sides I chose refried beans and fried potatoes.  The refried beans were adequate, moist, and topped with shredded cheese that melted.  The potatoes were diced, generously seasoned, and prepared like American Fries.  They tasted good, and even better when topped with Fuzzy's signature hot sauce, which is provided at each table.  However, I didn't find the hot sauce, labeled as butt-burnin' (gross?), to be all that hot, but it still tasted fine.  

Overall, I am used to finding more food on my plate at Mexican restaurants, though what I had tasted good and I would come back to try something else.  Hopefully the place will still be around then.  I was the only person eating here for lunch, because it's early January and most of the students haven't returned for class yet.  The restaurant is also located a non-walkable distance west of campus, along a retail strip that also includes many other restaurants and businesses.  

Compared to other Mexican/Southwest fare, I'd say Fuzzy's is better than Taco John's/Taco Bell, on par with Q-Doba and Chipotle, but not as good as Tex Tubb's or Pasqual's, which are local and located down the street.  In terms of menu variety, though, it has Q-Doba and Chipotle beat.
