I hate to make a negative comment since I am a weekly regular, I come into this Rubio's nearly every Tuesday and then some. I generally enjoy the fish taco but since it was Monday I thought I would simply get a bean and cheese burrito. That was not a good decision.....One of the worst I have ever, had. I could not eat a lot of it. First it was just a little above room temp, the cheese was a little cooler, not melted or even warm at all. The temperature was not what made the burrito fall below the rating of "not good" or worse even earn the rank of really bad, it was the moisture that somehow escaped from within to make the outside wet and soggy.....I'm sorry Rubio's to have to make this post because I like this place....I'm sure or at least hope this is only an anomaly and not a sign of things to come.
