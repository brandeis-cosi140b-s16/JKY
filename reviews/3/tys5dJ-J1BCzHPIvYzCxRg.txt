I really love Chipotle but damn, people.. Why you gotta give me a cold burrito?! I was ordering my usual burrito and the they had to switch out the tray of as the ran out.. This will forever stick in my mind. Burrito would have been bomb had it not been for the cold meat. 

I'll try this location again tho. Nice patio, friendly service but make sure they do it right when you go. Chipotle on..
