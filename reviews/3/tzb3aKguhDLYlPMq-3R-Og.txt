This is definitely a great place to grab drinks and dinner with friends on a Friday night.  The outdoor patio is spacious and the inside space is quite large as well; finding room for out party of 8 was no problem at all!  
The food was pretty standard (I got the cheese quesadilla and asked to get vegetables added and our waitress was able to accommodate my request with no problem!) and the prices were very reasonable (I paid $13 for my quesadilla and a good-sized margarita, tip included).  In regards to their drinks, the servings are VERY generous! Our party enjoyed a range of their margarita selection, spanning from lime margaritas on the rocks to mango-strawberry frozen margaritas and everyone was happy with their drink of choice.  We all went with the Jumbo (or was it Grande?) size (the equivalent of a medium) and it was definitely bigger than expected, but great nevertheless!

Not the best Mexican food I've had, but it was a great place to meet up with a group.  I have a feeling that I haven't seen the last of El Toro!
