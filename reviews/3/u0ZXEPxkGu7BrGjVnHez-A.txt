cool bar area for casual dining, margaritas and chips and salsa.  Pretty casual fun place with a lively buzz. Any time there are colored Christmas lights on the ceiling it's time for a laid back party.  All of the tacos are unique and some are fantastic.  The back seating area is just OK in my opinion but the bar area is more cozy and fun. They often have a band after 9:30 and it can get loud in the bar area but that can be fun too. Just depends on the band.  
Good spot.
