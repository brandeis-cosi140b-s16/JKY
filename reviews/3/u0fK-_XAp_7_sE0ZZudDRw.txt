Flicka's is the place to go if you are trying to ball on a budget. The drinks are cheap!  The service is pretty good, but if Flicka is there and you talk to him he will be sure you have a good time. Flicka is a fun bar owner and makes you wish more industry business owners were more personable. 

The food is surprisingly good but it is bar food so don't go here looking for a trendy menu.  

It's a little dark for my preference to watch a game, but if you like darker lighting places then you will enjoy this place.
