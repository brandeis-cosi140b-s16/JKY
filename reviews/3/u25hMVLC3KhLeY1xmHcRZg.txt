First off, I was excited to see a location opening up near my home. I have heard from friends how good this place is. I went yesterday for my first time and brought our food home. The food was good as expected. The part that bugged me and why I can't give them 5 stars is the attitude of the staff from beginning to end. They were acting annoyed with the slowness of my ordering. It's a place I've never been so of course it's gonna be foreign to me. I understand it's new to the staff too but they were not busy. 1 person in front of me and 1 person behind me. At the end they wouldn't take my buy 1 get one free coupon because I didn't order two of the exact same thing. The coupon is misleading and doesn't clearly state it has to be two of the same item. The girl was rude when she told me I couldn't use the coupon. It was like she was happy to say no to a customer. As someone in the food and beverage industry I advise the management of this location to work with your staff on how to treat new customers.
