I was excited to finally try Pacos after much delay on my part getting there. For me it was just OK. Service was really good, which was a nice surprise. The food; however, was a separate surprise. Granted it could have been what I ordered too. 

Ordered the enchiladas (can't remember the exact name) and there was so much cheese sauce/queso all over the dish that it was hard to gave a bite of anything, including the rice & beans, without eating cheese. Being from Wisconsin, I like me some cheese, but this was too much. Either way, I'll give it another shot because the location is great!
