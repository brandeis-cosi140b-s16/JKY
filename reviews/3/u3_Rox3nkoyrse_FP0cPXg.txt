Been a long time customer for years and they were pretty consistent until recently. I feel like their quality of food has decreased immensely, as well as the service. Before the burritos were immensely bigger and had a sufficient amount of chips along with it. This has changed to microwavable small burritos with only three to five tortilla chips. In addition, the amazing pastries Azteca has been known for have become dry. Now for the service that certainly has plummeted entirely. Many of the employees working behind the counter are BEYOND slow. Orders can be seen behind them piling up by how much they take their time or not giving the To-go orders in a timely manner causing them to become cold.

Please Azteca, I have seen you at your best. Fix your service and food because this is turning into just a mediocre restaurant at best. Bring back the authentic Mexican restaurant we love.
