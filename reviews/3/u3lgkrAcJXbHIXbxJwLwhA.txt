Went over during Lunch Hour. Wasn't busy so service was quick and friendly. 

But as soon as I walked in I noticed a smell, like a sewage smell. So I made that order to go! It's unpleasant for folks thinking about dining in and I hope they fix it in the near future. 

The food wasn't too shabby. I ordered a Torta de Carne Asada, $6. 

Affordable prices and decent food.
