This is a business and somewhat tourist oriented restaurant in the center of town, just east of the Las Vegas Strip.

I come here at times for business lunches, tends to be pretty good - nothing spectacular, but serviceable - reasonable food, reasonable prices, good service.

Items like the carnitas, fajitas and other standard fare are rendered well and relatively middle of the road, so they have broad appeal, do not offend anyone, but are not terribly unique or interesting either - standard but, again, reasonably good.

Outdoor seating area is nice, weather permitting.
