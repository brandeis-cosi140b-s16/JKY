Well, it's no Chipotle, but I was actually surprised. It's been forever since I've indulged in a little Crazy Chicken, but we don't eat a lot of fast food, but getting grilled chicken "feels" healthier, yes? 
Went to grab a quick bite of protein, I got a chicken, rice, black bean and lettuce burrito. Pretty basic. 
El Pollo Loco is like Chipotle's less attractive sister, but she's still dateable, yes? Occasionally.
