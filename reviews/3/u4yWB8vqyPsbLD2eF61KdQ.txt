Came here for happy hour...but the happy hour sucked! My friend and I came here because we saw online that there were $2 tacos during happy hour. Not true. There was only $5 shots and a certain beer for happy hour. No discount on any other drinks. The tacos and ceviche were decent, but I wouldn't come back just for that. For locals, there are a ton of other good Taco Tuesday Happy Hours in this city.
