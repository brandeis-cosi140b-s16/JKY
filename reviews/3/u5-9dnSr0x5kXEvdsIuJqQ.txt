What can I say? It's friggin Taco Bell. Garbage food that is great only when nothing else is open and you are at risk of withering away to death. If you are though, going to go to Taco Bell, go to this one. The older guy that runs through the drive through is awesome. He will either repeat the order back to you so incorrectly you'd wonder if you really did say 856 tacos and a side of grilled stuft burrito. Sometimes you pull up and he hands you a soda you didn't order, and says it's because you are the 1,000,000th customer. The guy is just out there, but you know what? he breaks the fast food mold and actually gives personality to a terrible establishment.
