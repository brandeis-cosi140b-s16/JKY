Called in an order for pickup. We ordered super nachos and a machaca burrito. They allowed us to use the 3 free rolled tacos check-in promo even though we didn't dine in! The order total came out to about $15.50, a decent price for the huge portions! 

Food was hot and ready when we arrived to pick up. Place was clean, and staff was nice. 

Now as far as the quality of the food, it was good but a bit on the salty side. The green salsa was a little... Tart, I guess? The machaca was okay, but again really too salty to taste any of the other flavors! (For instance, Chino Bandido's or Carolina's machaca is loaded with flavor and spice!) :-( Maybe it was a fluke. I've tasted better Mexican food but for being so close to home and priced so well, we will probably come back.
