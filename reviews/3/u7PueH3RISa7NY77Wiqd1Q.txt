I returned with a group but didn't tell them about my prior review.  Here's my second experience...better than last time but still a food timing issues.  The better part.  I ordered the egg breakfast.  Everything on the plate was great and there was so much I took left overs home which were good reheated later.  The star was the bacon.  The best bacon I've ever eaten in my life.  The valet parkers were speedy and organized.  It's an amazing place to people watch.

Here's the area they still struggle with - speed from food order to table. So the key is just enjoy another beverage and cherish the extra conversation time.
