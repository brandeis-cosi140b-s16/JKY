The place is clean.  Prices are always decent.  The burritos, tacos, and salad are big.  It's just that the food here gets a bit tiring for me.  I know of people who really love this place though, and don't seem to get tired of it.  It's just that there isn't much of a variety to choose from.  You've got your salads, tacos, or burritos all of which that consist of the same stuff.
