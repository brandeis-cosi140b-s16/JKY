Good. A friend told me about Rubio's and I had to try it. Asked a few questions about the menu and the manager was very helpful. The fish taco is very very good and I more than like the grilled shrimp burrito. Rubio's will definitely because one of my new regular spots. It would be nice if they had a location "inside" of the 101.
