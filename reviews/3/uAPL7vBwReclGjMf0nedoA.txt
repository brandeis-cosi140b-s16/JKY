Like others have said, this is indeed a hole in the wall.  What they lack in decor, they make up for with the food. I like their veggie burrito - very big with equal measures of beans/rice and other kinds of vegetables.

The only issue I have is that the chairs are fairly dirty. I'm not a fan of restaurants that can't keep their dining area clean. I'll keep going to the salsa cabana, but I hope they clean the chairs.
