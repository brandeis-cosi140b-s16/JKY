Yeah, this isn't really authentic Mexican food, but they do have good specials for lunch.  You can come out of here for about six or seven dollars, and it is much better quality than fast food.  As far as Mexican goes though, it really doesn't stand the test.  It is hard to find any good food besides the average chains around this area though.  Just go off of Central Ave. to grab some Mexican food.
