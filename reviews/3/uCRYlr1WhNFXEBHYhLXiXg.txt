Well sometimes it's Great and other days it's not so good.... Today I was bummed! This is the second time I get a super salty burrito, almost as if they are trying to mask something. I have even gone back to return it due to the lack of quality. The owner is very graceful and helpful. He offered to replace the item (mar y Tierra burrito), which I did for an amazing shrimp burrito. Maybe it's the meats? I was craving something close to home and I ordered the chile rojo burrito. I should have went with the shrimp! The beans are really good here too, I just wish the flavor and quality was consistent with all the menu items.
