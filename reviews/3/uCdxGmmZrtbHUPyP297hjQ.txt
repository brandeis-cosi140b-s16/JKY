Stopped in here last night mainly because I was craving tacos. And it was Tuesday after all. Had the little street tacos that are made with pork and onions with a green salsa. Just what I wanted. They were ready pretty quickly. They were tasty. I also had some Horchata which was a good sweet complement to the spicy tacos. Pricing was reasonable. I would go back again for sure.
