Hit and Miss.  I was here once and it was really really good.  For my 2nd trip I brought family here from out of town and everything was dissapointing.  We made reservations, they were not busy, but when we arrived they had to put tables together and ended up seating us a solid 10 minutes late.  I ran into a friend in the lobby who said he was waiting for a half hour for a take out burrito! Then they forgot to assign us a waiter, when one noticed later he scrambled to get our orders.  The service problems continued, but I think this waiter was trying his best, it just may have been a little too little too late to bring our moods back up.  The food was not great this night, pollo asada and carne asada overcooked, the rest of the food was underwhelming.  I will give them another shot, but my impression is that they were really disorganized.   The old restaurant that was in this location was good but seemed to have the same problem.  Someone needs to put an experienced manager in here who can make the food consistent and the service good, and this place could be great.
