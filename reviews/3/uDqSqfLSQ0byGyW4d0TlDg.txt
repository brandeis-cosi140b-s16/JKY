We had been going to Mucho Gusto for YEARS and LOVED it. We work right down the street and that was our go-to place. We decided to try The Revival today for lunch - our whole office. The food was tasty and appetizing and we knew that Chef Kelly Fletcher was the Chef at House of Tricks so we knew the food was going to be great. But because we still have House of Tricks, we REALLY missed Mucho Gusto. There is just no place like it so we were a little disappointed that it's gone. We all had an idea - what if some of the new menu offered some of the old favorites from Mucho Gusto? Big ass burrito, a few of the taco plates, guacamole and the amazing chips and salsa. Now that's a place we would go back to over and over. The Revival - we just assume go to House of Tricks because the food is so similar.
