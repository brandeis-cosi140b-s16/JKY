This is the only remaining outpost of the once proud Matta's on Main street in Mesa.  The old Matta's closed out in 2007 due to the oldest Grandson wanting to go out on his own.  They were scheduled to open a Matta's in the Mesa Riverview complex but haven't seen that materialize yet.
This one on Higley has some of the same things from the original (salsa, cheese crisps, standard tex-mex fare).  It's really a counter service location with tables.  It has a drive through as well.
I'm not going out on a limb saying that this is good but not great Mexican especially for the prices.  A single taco - $3.75.  Single Enchilada - $3.75.  For those prices, you would expect much better than you actually get.   And you don't get any service to boot.  Clean up after yourself amigo.
So, they get a OK rating from me give that it is counter service and expensive.  I miss the old Matta's.  2-star.
