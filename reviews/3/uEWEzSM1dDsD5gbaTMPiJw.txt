Took the family here tonight they have a full bar and outside seating which is nice although we sat inside.  As you walk in you cant help but notice the many salsa awards propped up in the corner for both hot and mild salsas.  Although Ive had better I would certainly say that theirs is the best restaurant salsa that Ive tasted in the valley.  My wife ordered the pablano pepper and said it was a little spicy because it came with the seeds in it but she liked it.  I had what they call the Accupplulo Chicken or something like that basically a Chicken Burro with Cream Cheez Sauce on it.  Presentation was fair taste was good.  Kids had the beef tacos they where good.  Service and Pricing was Good.  All in all certainly not bad but when your salsa is better than your food you get three stars.  They also serve  breakfast and the prices looked very reasonable for Fountain Hills so we will go back to see if its better than the dinner menu.
