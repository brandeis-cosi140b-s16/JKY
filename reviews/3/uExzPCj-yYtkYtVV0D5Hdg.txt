Tuesday night is taco night! Thirty-nine cent tacos that can't be beaten for the price. Admittedly, cheap tacos aren't a great selling point for your average Yelp foodie, but they are heaven on earth for the four and five year olds who typically accompany me to Del Taco. These picky eaters ate four and two tacos respectively on our last visit and split a churro for dessert. 

Sure, the tacos are a bit small, but they are surprisingly good quality. Much less greasy than your typical Taco Bell beef taco. Also great the way the restaurant places a basket of assorted taco sauce on each table. I'm not a fan of much of the rest of the menu, but Del Taco nicely fills the "cheap Tuesday night out" niche for our family.
