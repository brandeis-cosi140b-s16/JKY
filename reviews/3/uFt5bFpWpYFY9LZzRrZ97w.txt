This place was good, just not as good as I had hoped based on the reviews.  I would have given the place 3 1/2.  Since I can't, I decided to balance out another reviewer who gave the place 4 stars but also thought it deserved 3 1/2.

Positive notes:  Hot sauce had some bite to it, chips were good, Camarones culichi had a wonderful sauce.  Lots of fresh limes served with the meal.  Full bar.

Not-so-positive notes:  Shrimp in the Camarones culichi was overcooked (cardinal sin for a seafood place).  The shrimp coctail was just ok - good sized boiled shrimp, but not too much flavor.  

If driving by and hungry I would stop in again, but not if I have to drive too far out of the way.
