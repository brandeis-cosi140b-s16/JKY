So I had gone to get a carne asada fix!  And well...This place did not exactly deliver.  I had ordered the carne asada chimi and it had a heaping pile of sour cream and guacamole on top which by the time I got home made the chimi slightly soggy.  It  almost seemed as though the burrito had a million layers of tortillas surrounding the carne asada.  And the Carne asada wasnt amazing either.
