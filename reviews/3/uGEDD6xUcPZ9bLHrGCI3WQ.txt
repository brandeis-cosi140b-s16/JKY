I was here for the first time recently and since I was at Pink Taco, I ordered......tacos!  The baja fish tacos to be exact.  Sorry to say but I thought they were some of the worse fish tacos I've ever had.  If you're recovering all day from the night before and you're finally able to hold down food, but all of a sudden you can't because your fish tacos taste like someone walked around with them balled up in their fist outside in the Vegas sun for an hour, you'd be disappointed too.  From other reviews it sounds like they have a lot of other good food on the menu and I'm sure they do but I won't be wasting my money on their fish tacos again.  They were bland and soggy, two things fish tacos should never be.  
Great decor and a fun place to eat and the service was great too though.  2 stars for the food and an extra star for the service and surroundings.
