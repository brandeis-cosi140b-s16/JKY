Really great food and have loved eating there, but their hours are inconsistent.  I called to place a to-go order 15 minutes before close and was told they were already closed due to cleaning.  I will come back because I like the food, but it's quite frustrating how limited their hours are and that you can't expect them to be open when they say they are.
