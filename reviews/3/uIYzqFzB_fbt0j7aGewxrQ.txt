I had lunch here today with a group of coworkers to celebrate a birthday. It was ok, but I don't think the food is good enough to justify the price. 

They had a table ready for us (we'd called ahead since we had 9 people), our server was efficient and didn't make any mistakes. They didn't give us any trouble when we wanted separate checks and almost all paid by credit card. I was impressed that my water glass was refilled several times, and more chips/salsa were delivered shortly upon request. 

I'll definitely be back since the location is convenient, parking is easy, and everyone can find something they like. But if it were up to me, I'd prefer Chipotle.
