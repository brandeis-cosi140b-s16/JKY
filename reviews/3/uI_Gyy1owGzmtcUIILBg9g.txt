Ajo Al's is pretty much a Phoenix staple in the sense that it's been around for a long, long, while. This is your generic Mexican food. It's perfect for a family-dinner, perfect for a casual dinner and perfect for one (or several) margaritas. 

The atmosphere here is casual with the character of a Mexican restaurant. I enjoy the food here when I'm in the mood for something hearty and cheesy. Their Salad Carbon is absolutely amazing. It's the opposite of fat free but that's what makes it so good right? This salad comes with either marinated steak or chicken and it's topped with mushrooms, avocado, shredded cheese that melts with the heat of the meat and this delicious Jalepeno ranch dressing. It's a must if you visit.
