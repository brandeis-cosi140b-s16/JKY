We went to 3 Margaritas on a Friday night for dinner. The parking lot was empty. It seemed that only employees were there. I almost wondered if the resaurant had closed down. 

When we got inside we were seated right away and there was only one other table of people. Most of the staff was at the bar watching a soccer game. We were quickly given our chips and salsa and our drinks. The standard salsa is a bit runny and has a smokey flavor. It was good but wished it was more of a pico de gallo than a picante sauce.

I ordered the chicken flautas meal and my dining companion ordered the beef chimichanga meal. The waiter prefered we order using the meal number rather than the description. (i.e. The number 3 and the number 28 for example)

Both the meals were served with rice and beans. The rice was good, not overly flavored. The beans were a bit thin and very salty. The main dishes were great though. The meat was cooked well and there was the right amount of crunch on both the chimi and the flautas. Despite the beans we really enjoyed the food overall. 

I would go here again if nearby but I don't think I would go out of my way to go for just the food. The margaritas and other drinks were priced fairly decenlty so if you're craving Mexican food and drinks out with friends it is the way to go. 

During the meal, Scott Ian from Anthrax fame was seated next to us... Pretty cool.
