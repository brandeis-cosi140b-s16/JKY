Went inside to see what is on the menu since this was my first visit. Luckily it was Tuesday. $2.24 for three tacos? Had to try that. Since I hadn't eaten anything all day it tasted great. Kind of thrown together but the shell was crispy and good still even when I got home.. The filling was tasty. The ingredients fresh and crunchy. Nice polite fellow behind the counter.  I visited the one on Sahara. I never go to fast food places ever but this was so close to my apt I broke my own rule.  Glad I did. Beats 
cookin and cleaning up a messy frying pan. I'll go again if I get a hankering for tacos.
