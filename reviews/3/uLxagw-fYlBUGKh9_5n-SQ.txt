Ok. So .... not a huge fan of macayos. It's very basic mexican food. I've had some bad ass mexican food in San diego!!!! I went to macayos today and I had to share my favorite thing is 5.95 for a huge bag of yummy hot chips and a 24 ounce (or less) full of salsa chunky or smooth. I'm having friends over tonight so I added an extra salsa (extra charge) I have a large amount of chips and salsa and that's my favorite thing about macayos. If ur craving chips and salsa this is the spot for chips to go. Bang for your buck
