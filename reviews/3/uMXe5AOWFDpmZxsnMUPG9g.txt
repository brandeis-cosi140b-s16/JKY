Not going to lie, but after watching undercover boss, I've been wanting to try something from Rubio's!
Nice selection of tacos, fish tacos, burritos, and salads. It was neat to see the wrap for my burrito be freshly made. Decent amount of stuffing inside, could use more chicken(or steak, whichever you order). The size is  decent as well for under 10$ 
But it might have cost more because it was at a station casino.
The fish tacos took some time to cook, but it wasn't too long of a wait.
Rubio's a good place to grab some quick lunch, but it definitely has competition compared to Baja fresh and Chipotle.
