Was drug in here against my will last Thursday! I will admit the place looks awesome at night. Unfortunately, there was a photo shoot going on (for Maxim Mag) and the douche factor was unusually high. I'll come back on a weeknight or day-drinking on a weekend and see if my attitude improves.

I hear this is the ultimate for day-drinking and people watching.
