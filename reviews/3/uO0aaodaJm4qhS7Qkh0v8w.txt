The man and I have been meaning to stop in the west side location for a while, now that we live in Middleton. The first time we went to Tex Tubb's it was at the Atwood location, for brunch, and we had less than stellar service. The second time we went, more recently, it had vastly improved. SO, we decided to give the University location a go, as well.

There's something that's missing at the west side  TTTP. The salsa bar, obviously(unless I just didn't see it, but our waitress never offered)...but even something beyond that. It just seems like a stripmallicized version of the Atwood location. 

Aside from THAT, the food was so-so. I wasn't as wowed by my blackened tilapia taco, and I thought both tacos(I also had catfish) had wayyy too much sloppy stuff. One had black bean puree, flavored mayo, AND guacamole. It was so gushy that I couldn't even taste the fish that was swimming(haha) around in the depths of goo.

The side of guac we ordered was so-so and less than flavorful. 

I also didn't appreciate being seated across from the side door which was totally drafty, either. 

The limeade was tart and tasty, though!

I'll go again, and try something else.
