My experience here was fine.  The service was fast and friendly...as I was the only one in there for quite some time.  I ordered the Super Burrito which was a combo of the Mexico City Burrito and Gold & Black Burrito along with an Al Pastor taco.  The steak had good flavor but the nacho cheese sauce of the Gold and Black I could have done without.  The Al Pastor was tasty but the tortillas were a little dry.  My biggest gripe was that the beer was not very cold.
