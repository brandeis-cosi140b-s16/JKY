I had the three tacos for $7. Two barbacoa (shredded beef) and one pibil (pork). I prefer corn tortillas, but they use flour. These are not the street tacos that im used to. Just okay. Tortillas were lukewarm which is a pet peeve for me.

Iced tea was very refreshing on a 113 degree summer day in late June.
