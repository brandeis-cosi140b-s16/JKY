I never knew this place existed. It's right next to Yogurtology and Babbo Italian Eatery. I had the chicken & beef tacos. My boyfriend had the carne asada plate. Complimentary chips are provided since we were dining in. They also have a small salsa bar. I personally liked the fire roasted salsa - it had the right amount of heat for me. They gave us a very generous portion of rice and beans on the plate. I was so full after the chips/salsa and tacos that I barely touched the rest of the plate. It's not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but I would definitely return considering how decent the food was and it's close proximity to my home.
