I decided to celebrate "National Taco Day" with a tasting of sorts at Taco y Taco. Unfortunately, the results were decidedly mixed.

October 4th is one of those so-called holidays dedicated to a specific food, and this restaurant decided to celebrate it by offering all non-seafood tacos for $1.00 (normal price $2.25). Having eaten a lot of tacos at other places since my previous review, I approached this as an opportunity to try a multitude of the meats available here. The lone exception was the reasonably tasty carnitas (tender pork) because I'd eaten my fair share of those on their Mexican Independence Day celebration at the OG Taco y Taco. I would have skipped the al pastor also if my friend hadn't gotten too full too quickly.

I actually went here for both lunch and dinner, which was necessary for me to have the stomach space for everything. I was going to describe the two meals separately, but I'll list what I ate from the best to the worst (with line breaks to separate tiers). Note that not all of the options will be appealing to all palates.

==========

- Buche (pork stomach): probably the best rendition that I've eaten, bursting with flavor and juices.

- Tripas (beef intestine): about as strongly flavored as any tripas I've had here or anywhere else.
- Barbacoa (tender beef): I wonder if this has the fatty bits that are normally served with cabeza. It was pretty good overall, and I'd order it again.
- Al pastor (marinated pork): flavorful, but still not as good as one particular local taco stand. It's still pretty good, although the pineapple was a bit too acidic..
- Cesos (beef brain): distinguished by the almost creamy texture, and no sign of prions so far

- Cochinita pibil (roasted/marinated pork): tasty marinade, but too chewy.
- Chicharron (pork rinds): this actually lacked the crunchy stuff that my friend reports usually getting when ordering it, so it was just a rather spicy, marinated, and overall intensely flavored pork. It packs a punch that I'm not that interested in.

- Pollo (chicken): surprisingly good, but chicken isn't that unique naturally, there wasn't a special marinade to lend any flavor, and most people go to taco places for beef and pork, not chicken.
- Carne asada (grilled/marinated beef steak): pretty good, but not as impressive as what I've had elsewhere in Vegas.
- Chorizo (pork sausage): served as finely ground meat instead of as a cut sausage, so the texture was disappointing. The flavor was average at best.

- Lengua (beef tongue): significantly tougher to chew than it should be, suggesting that it's been overcooked or wasn't cut properly.
- Cabeza (head meat): boring compared to past experiences with this meat, seemed to lack all the fatty bits that provide flavor and typically make it a can't-miss option.
- Suadero (a beef cut from near the udder): the one I was served was simply too dry and chewy.

In addition to the unfortunate issues in various meats, I found another problem. By the time I had seated myself and readied myself to eat the tacos, I found that the tacos as a whole were merely warm and approaching lukewarm. Yep, on both visits.

I think this happened because of the inherently flawed ordering/paying system: they'll prep the food first, then you'll most likely have to wait to pay (I did wait, twice), then you'll spend more time filling beverages and obtaining lime wedges, salsas, etc., and finally you get to sit down and start to eat. My currently preferred taco joints in town ask you to pay first, then allow you to do other things while waiting for the tacos. When the tacos are ready at these places, you'll be done with all of the other time-consuming tasks, so the tacos won't be too cold. As with most foods, tacos simply don't taste as good after they've cooled down.

By the way, I'm still not cool with the prices for the standard meats being that higher than the standard $2.00. What's next, a bump to $2.50? Let's hope not.

I saw too many flaws today. I'm no longer comfortable with giving Taco y Taco anything more than a 3-star rating. I've already been reluctant to return, and based on my observations, I'll continue to limit my visits here to sales (holiday promos, happy hours or Taco Tuesdays) and occasional invitations by friends.
