I used to live right across the street from this restaurant but never actually ate there until last night.

Me and a bunch of girls wanted to go out for half price so we gave Mi Ranchito a try. The chips were delicious, the salsa however was EXTREMELY watery. It literally dripped everywhere on the table, making it impossible to actually enjoy. Not that the taste would make you enjoy it...

Me and a friend split a veggie enchilada and another friend shared some of her veggie quasadilla. The enchilada, though stated on the menu would be served in a corn tortilla, was most definitely not. The tortilla was, for lack of a better word, mushy. The red sauce proved to be as equally flavorless as the salsa - red sauce is supposed to be spicy, come on! There were barely any vegetables in the enchilada and they were awkwardly cut and stuffed. The quasadilla on the other hand was quite delicious. If I ever do intend to visit again maybe I'll try this?

The only redeeming quality of Mi Ranchito was the lovely decor and their delicious margaritas. I had a peach margarita that was perfectly refreshing. 

Though our waitress was absolutely awful (she overcharge one of my companions credit cards), the bartenders were friendly and had great taste in music! I'll return just to drink next time.
