In the middle of ghost town with no where else to go (and the closest McDonalds 30 mins away) this place hit the spot. It's a basic Mexican restaurant with an awesome happy hour and good food. I've experienced the bar and wait staff, and both are helpful and quick in providing service. No complaints here.
