Every time I'm in Vegas I stop in for either lunch or happy hour. This is not authentic Mexican food but it's still good. The margaritas are good as well. I would recommend if you're going to be around the luxor to check groupon (they usually have some deals) then stop on by for a margarita and some decent food.
