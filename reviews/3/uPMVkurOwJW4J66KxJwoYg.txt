I am from southern Orange County, so I might be a little bias. The decor and ambiance of the place is pretty fun, but the place is a tight squeeze. I was there for a quick lunch and ordered the Al Pastor tacos. It came with three tacos and rice for 6.50, no complaints on price. The tacos were yummy, just wished they used fresh pineapple instead of canned. Secondly the rice was a little hard, as if it were oldish or stale, but good flavor. 

I was there during lunch and the place only has about 9 tables. They were considerably busy and I felt like they were trying to rush myself and other customers out. 

Overall all pretty good considering price. I would give it a shot if in the area.
