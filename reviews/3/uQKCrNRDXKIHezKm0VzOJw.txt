Fairly new to this part of the country and had not eaten at a Macayo's before. The Good: The Service was spot on and I really enjoyed the fried ice cream for dessert. The Bad: The rest of the food was kind of uninspired. The salsa they serve was very much like picante sauce out of a jar and not very flavorful. I ordered chicken fajitas and was kind of surprised when it arrived to see that it was just a sliced chicken breast laying atop a bed of sauteed onions. No green or red peppers, no tomatoes or any of the other vegetables you might see in such a plate. The side plate did have refried beans but no rice, a ball of sour cream and a ball of guacamole beside a couple of teaspoons of pico over a few scraps of lettuce. So while this was not awful it kind of depends on what you are looking for in a restaurant. If it is more important to you to be pampered by your server than the quality of the food you are putting in your mouth, then this might be the place for you. As for me, I will probably keep trying the other mexican options in Casa Grande.
