Nice to see another Chipotle pop up in the area. There's no shortage of traffic on Charlottetown Ave....

This place is a little larger than typical chipotle setups.... Line starts on the left instead of right and the inside still has the industrial feel.  The tables are laid out with high counter stools and a couple of regular height tables.

Patio area is pretty killer.  Good place to do some people watching.

Staff is super nice... You could kind of tell they are still training but no huge mistakes.  Everything is clean and makes for a solid, predictable experience every time.
