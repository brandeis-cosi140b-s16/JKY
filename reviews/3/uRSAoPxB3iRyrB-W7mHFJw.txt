Very affordable And I think this Robertos might even be cheaper than some of the others around town (obviously not by much, but still cheaper). The service is always decent but most importantly, the food is made really quickly compared to the other Robertos.  I always order ahead and it's usually waiting for me when I arrive.  The place is also way cleaner than most of the other Robertos which definitely makes a difference.
