Small place for counter service only. There are only 5 chairs lining the window wall for you to sit in as you wait for your order...and no place to sit outside. So have a destination in mind when you place your order...

The food was good and fresh! The shrimp fajitas were plentiful and flavorful. The one sketchy part was no prices on the menu. I guess they make them up as they go? 

The place stays busy and people were in and out during the lunch hour. It was bright, clean, and employee was friendly. I was definitely happy to use my Spanish, but like Nicole W. said, it's not necessary...your pointer finger can interpret just as easily.
