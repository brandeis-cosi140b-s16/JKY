On a recommendation from the concierge at the Luxor, Mary Jane, we had dinner last night at Hussongs.  I didn't hold out much hope for finding authentic Mex on the strip in Vegas but I was pleasantly and happily surprised.  

Luckily she'd made us a reservation (5 of us locals) and we were seated immediately.  The place is long and narrow and they have squeezed as many tables as possible into the small space.  For those who are familiar with Mandalay Place, it's in the former Chocolate Swan space.  

Anyway, we had standard chips and 2 kinds of salsa.. nothing memorable except the chips appeared to be hand made as opposed to processed and bagged.   
Service was fast, we had our hand shaken margaritas within minutes of ordering and it was extremely crowded due to MAGIC & the Vet Convention.  Margarita was large & delicious.  
Our appetizers were the:  guacamole, thick and chunky with just a slight bite of spiciness and def. delicious; the queso fundido which was thick with cheesy goodness; and the house specialty, Elote Plazero, an ear of corn on the cob, roasted with a thin coat of mayo/butter and cheese.  I could have had a 1/2 dozen of those and called it a day. 

Only 2 of us opted for an entree, both having the Enchiladas Suiza. It was beautifully prepared, presented and gobbled down!! This cantina is not for those who are expecting mid-America "mex" -- it is as authentic as it gets north of the border. 

...and if it is any indication, I am going back there today for lunch because I don't think I fully experienced all that mexi-goodness last night and must have another go of it.

EDIT: 9/1/2010... 
We went back last night after not going for 6 months.  Service was terrible. Not just for us..but all the surrounding tables.  I knocked it back to 3 stars for that.  The food, while decent, can be found at places who can appreciate our hard earned dollars.
