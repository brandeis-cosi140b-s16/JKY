Pretty average Mexican food.  Went for lunch and had the stacked enchilada plate with chicken.  The chips served before the meal were hot and crispy but the salsa was only fair.  Like mine chunky and this was a bit too watery for me.  The stacked enchiladas were nothing special.  Store bought corn tortillas swimming in green sauce and cheese.  The chicken inside had little flavor and could have been shredded better.  It came as a couple of large chunks of meat.  The beans and rice...well...average once again.

Service was okay as was the cost.  Guess I prefer the little places closer to downtown Phoenix in the 16th-24th street area as they are much more authentic tasting.  This would probably be a good option for families with small kids or older folks looking for more bland Mexican options.

All in all rates a meh.  This is my first usage of the meh word as I didn't feel I understood it until now.
