Large portions, I can definitely say that! Ordered two tacos, rice and beans. Huge mound of food that a fattie would pine over. Food was ok. Taco shells got soggy and were falling apart which bothered me. Shredded beef was a bit salty and chicken was a bit bland. Chips and salsa were very good though. If I went back, would try something other than the tacos. Waitress was good and got us in and out within our 1 hour lunch break. Place is not anything special but not bad, was simply ok. I think this is what you would call Mormon Mexican food. Not saying I hate MM food (Costa Vida is great) but this place tries to come off as authentic and nothing about the flavors were big like they should be in true Mexican food...
