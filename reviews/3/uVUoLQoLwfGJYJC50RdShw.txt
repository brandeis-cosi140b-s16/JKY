Honestly, I was expecting worse.  The food was good and the prices were decent.  I had a tostada with no ground beef.  It was gigantic and pretty tasty.  The black beans were spicy.  My BF had the veggie fajitas; it did not look good.  The veggies looked like they were from a bag out of the frozen section at the grocery store. Chips and salsa were good.  They have a salsa bar and all of the salsas that I tried were decent.  If I was in the area, I would go again.  It is far from the strip.
