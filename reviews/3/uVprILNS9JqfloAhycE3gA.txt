We went to Rock Taco for lunch and had mixed feelings when the meal was over.

So, here's what was good: The portion sizes were very generous and my pork street tacos were delicious.  I also had a side of Spanish rice and it was very fresh and flavorful.  I also enjoyed the seasoned tortilla chips and salsa.  The restaurant itself was clean and well decorated.  The patio was really pretty though we ate inside as it was a bit chilly.

And here's the bad:  Our server was very pleasant, but seemed kind of unsure of the menu when we were ordering.  He had a "helper" but we had to wait for our food for a while and I don't think our drinks were refreshed at all.  We also waited a long time for the food to arrive and another long span of time before our check arrived.

I will definitely visit again because the food was that good.  I hope the service improves, though.
