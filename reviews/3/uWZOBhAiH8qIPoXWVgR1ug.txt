Came here for lunch on a weekday and was promptly seated.

It's a spacious restaurant with good drink and lunch specials. You can't go wrong with complimentary fresh chips and salsa!

I had the fish tacos lunch special and it was pretty good! Their margaritas frozen or on the rocks are delish and reasonably priced as well. 

It's decent mexican food but not the best i've had but a great lunch option for work!
