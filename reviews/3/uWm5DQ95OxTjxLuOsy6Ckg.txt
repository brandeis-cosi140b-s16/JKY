I worked in the same plaza as the one on Mill and used to frequent it for lunch (and enjoyed it) so when I discovered they opened one up close by, I was stoked.

My ''go to'' at the Tempe location had always been the Pollo Fundido...not ''authentic'' mexican food by any standard, but it was always a chickeny, cheesy, gooey flavor bonanza that I enjoyed thoroughly.  Feeling nostalgic, I went ahead and ordered one.  Renata K mentioned that the chicken was ''watery''...she was right.  I  cut the guy in half and a bunch of liquid came pouring out.  Of course that immediately turned me off because not only was it gross in general, it started sogging up my Fundito (it's deep fried...basically a chimi)  That watery chicken had no flavor at all...basically a very tasty shell with very tasy Fundido sauce filled with chicken textured nothingness.

Might have been an off day...since I've had the Rod Burro and the green chili burro and they have been good...afraid to order the Pollo Fundido again but a friend did once while we were there and looked like the same issue (he's not picky AT ALL so he said it was good).

2 things that I always liked a lot at Someburros: the rice and the hot sauce, were both still awesome at this location...just won't be ordering my ''go to'' there....sadly.
