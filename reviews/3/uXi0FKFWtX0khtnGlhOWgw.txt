Why the rampant fuckwaddery, Phoenix?  I've been to other Filiberto's/Poliberto's/whateveriberto's restaurants before and really loved the food.  But this place, along with pretty much every other fast food Mexican place in the valley, falls prey to the flaccid-burrito issue.  Seriously, what the hell?  How hard is it to roll a burrito tightly or pack it full?  Especially when you don't offer any extras that may lead me to think it's rolled loosely so the customer can unroll it to add condiments.  Not even lime for the fish burrito- by the way, what's with the lack of condiments offered in Phoenix too?  Depressing.
So.  Food is probably a 4, better than average tasting.  Sometimes it's really greasy and you need to tear a hole in the bottom of the burrito to let it drain while you eat.  Or in my case I learned to stop eating at that point lest my stomach seek revenge later on.  Carne Asada is tasty.  Fish burrito is mayo-y.  California burrito is really good.
Their ability to roll a proper burrito is non-existent.
