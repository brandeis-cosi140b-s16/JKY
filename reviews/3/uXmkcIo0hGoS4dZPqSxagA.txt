While I love supporting local business this place left me feeling unsure.  While the tacos were good I do have some suggestions.  

First off don't judge this book by its cover. It is very unassuming from the upside and the "Huge" we're open sign in the window lets me believe they must be struggling for customers.  Once inside you can tell the owners have put a lot of money into making it a nice place.  It is very clean and the salsa bar was a nice touch.

As far as the food..I have hear from multiple people that their Carna Asada is very fatty (they must not trim the meat) so I steered clear.  I have the three taco place with ground beef hard shell tacos.  Immediately I was a bit disappointed as the shells were notate from scratch but store bought taco shells.  While the flavor was good I was left desiring more.  The rice and beans were standard so no complaints there.  Overall I could see myself eating here more out of convenience then actually going out f my way. It's a shame as  sure their overhead for the renovations must have been a lot.  Price also seemed a bit high but nothing crazy.
