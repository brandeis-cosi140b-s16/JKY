Not too shabby. Pretty standard menu of mexican food.  The food comes out fast and piping hot.  I had the carnitas chimichanga and it was really good.  The guac served on top was delicious and not all runny like some others in town.  The margaritas are big, delicious and fairly priced.  Oh!  And you get free chips and salsa if you're ordering a meal.  Love me some chips and salsa, especially when the mild is so tasty.  I would go back to Manuel's to try a bit more of the menu and to take advantage of happy hour margaritas!
