I kinda am obsessed with fish tacos..so I feel like I know what a good fish taco is.. And these are just okay. We came on taco Tuesday so they were only 1.50$... I would never pay 3.00$ for them. 

It's decent food..but it isn't loaded with flavor or made very well. Seems kinda slapped together and overpriced. That's all
