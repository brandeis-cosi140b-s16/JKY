Ate here while I was on a layover.  A great way to sample the whole Jose Cuervo line, including the 1800. Silver, and Reposado tequilas.  Even though the restaurant was in an airport and had a lot of people coming and going, I still felt relaxed and not rushed.

The shrimp tacos came on two soft blue tortillas each and exceeded my expectations.  The main course was accompanied by a generous serving of black beans and a small serving of chips and salsa. 

My margarita on the rocks was very good!  I wanted to stay for another, but I had to jet.

The service was friendly and I enjoyed my visit here.
