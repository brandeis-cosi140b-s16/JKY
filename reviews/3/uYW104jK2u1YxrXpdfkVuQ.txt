I lived in Scottsdale for 7 years and just came back for a visit on business and hit Sandbar for the first time in a while. It is a place to dig your toes in the sand and sink back with some cheap happy hour drinks and chips and salsa. No matter which location, just go to meet your friends, enjoy the desert sun and have no high expectations on culinary greatness.
