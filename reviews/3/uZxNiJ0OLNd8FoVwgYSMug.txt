I read mixed reviews of Matta's but since it was near our hotel I thought why not give it a try. My wife and I arrived at the restaurant at 7:45 and were told the kitchen was closing. I believe the sign said they were open until 9PM. We were able to order our meal which was good but not the best Mexican we ever have eaten.  The server never brought us a refill on the chips an salsa. Would we return? Maybe , but we would try to arrive earlier.
