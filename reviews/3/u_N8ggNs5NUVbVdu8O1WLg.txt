We saw all of the pictures and thought "This place can't have 3 stars...the food looks super good!". So, we tried it out. And sadly, it was 3 stars if not 2 1/2. It's just your typical Americanized Mexican joint that needs so much more spice and flavor. 

I don't need to write much as there are numerous reviews already. 
The food was okay. It looks much prettier in the pics. 

We ordered a decent amount of food. Worst thing I always hate about restaurants - they used pre-cooked rice. Rice is pretty cheap, people. And pre-cooked rice is disgusting. 

Biggest downer - when you go to try a new place and spend over $100 and the food is not that great. Time and money you can't get back. 

The service was excellent and the restaurant is pretty. But if you're going to try the food, it's "merh" at best.
