Since Vegas has a habit of distorting one's time and reality (and sobriety), reviews should probably reflect that property. Off the bat, BG like most Vegas eateries is expensive, but the last renovation makes the place a bit nicer than in previous years. We've already established that my being from San Diego makes me a Mex food snob by default. I'm thinking BG falls more under the Tex-Mex category. If you're in Mandalay for a convention, BG's location can't be beat. I don't know where I'm going with this review.
