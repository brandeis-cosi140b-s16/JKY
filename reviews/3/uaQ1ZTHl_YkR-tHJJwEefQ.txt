This is an ok taco bell. It's much better then the one further up on eastern, but it's not good enough to get me to drive past del taco on a regular basis. The staff is friendly, the food is as good as it gets for taco bell and it's a good alternative to the norm. It is after all fast food and the taste reflects as much.
