Only been here once, Our waitress was bubbly to say the least.  I had the classic taco/enchilada/beans& rice combo & it was fair at best, the taco being the most eatable.  My wife had the Camarones Rancheros and she claims it was the best she ever had.  The salsa was way mild so we asked for hot salsa, when she came back she said to be careful, its like fire, well closer to ice than fire & it didnt have any taste on top of it.  If I was in the neighborhood I'd give it another try, but wouldn't go out of my way.
