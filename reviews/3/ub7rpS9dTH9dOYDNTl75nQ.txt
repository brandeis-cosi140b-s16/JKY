For my wife and I, this was a two-star experience at best, but you may enjoy it more, IF (capital letters):

1.  You don't mind sitting in a small crowded area on torn stools and quite possibly waiting in line for it (it's open seating and pretty much no reservations).  To be fair, you might find a place in the dining area up the steps, but it only has one very large table and two or three small ones.  The bar area also seats about 20 to 25.  At Sunday brunch it was very crowded.
2.  You aren't really concerned about erratic service so long as it is polite.
3.  You like very spicy food.  I personally like some spice in my food (I order medium heat when given a choice) but this goes way beyond that.  I also like spicy-flavorful, but this was spicy-overwhelm the flavor.
4.  You are not value concious, because prices are a bit steep here.

Obviously I will not be back so why do I think you might enjoy it?  Well, it's different - 

A.  The food gets high marks for creativity and you might enjoy it if you can take the heat.
B.  It's clean -- a hole-in-the-wall but a clean one.  You might enjoy the "quirky" ambiance.
