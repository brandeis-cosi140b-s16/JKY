So this is the best place so far in Pittsburgh for Mexican that I've found. However, I'm sure there's some hidden gem out there somewhere. I wish this particular location was bigger. Every time I go it's completely full and a bit loud. I love that they have the black bean dip from Kaya in the strip as well as pretty similar fish tacos for less $. The margaritas aren't bad, but I usually only get them during happy hour.
