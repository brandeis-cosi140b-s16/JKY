I think the lady behind the counter didn't like me.  Could've just been me.  I don't know.  It's just how I felt.

When my boss first told me about this place, I thought he said "Al Molina" and I was like, "You mean the guy who played Doc Ock in Spider-Man II?"

I've been here a few times, today was the first time I'd been to El Molino in about 8 months.  I happened to be in the area, popping in to buy a backpack at Staples an decided to get a burrito to go to munch on when I got back to my office.

One thing I really didn't like was that you had to ask for the key to use the bathroom.  That's something very typical of, like, a gas station that bums use to shit on the floor.  I went to the bathroom and it said I had to ask for the key.  I went back to the counter and the woman disappeared in the back so I kinda just did a little pee-pee dance until she came back.

It was a little too expensive for what it was.  A thing of chips was like $4.50.  That's crazy.  Granted, the chips are really good and you get a lot of em, but... don't you have a thing of chips I can buy for a buck that comes with a much more reasonable portion?  I got all these chips in the fridge at work that won't be edible on Monday, probably.

The burrito I got was very tasty.  The salsa they gave me was also super good.  Nice and smokey and spicy.  Seriously.  Man, that shit was spicy.  I kind of have a soar throat today so that spiciness felt super good to me.

I had to laugh when I opened up my to-go back once I got back to work because I actually thought maybe I didn't get ANY salsa, but when I took a look they gave me soooo much.  I made a small tower beside my meal, like a Stonehenge of heat.

Three stars:  Good.  Not great.  Weird bathroom.  Unfriendly lady.  Good food.  Too expensive.
