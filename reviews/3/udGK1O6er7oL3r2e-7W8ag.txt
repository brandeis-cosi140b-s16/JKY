I would give this place four stars, as I love everything about it, except the lady behind the counter. She has zero personality and can even be rude at times. We just went for for Taco Tuesday, and after ordering our tacos, we find out it's Taco Wednesday.  My wife ordered 3 tacos and we get a "combo #3" which I explained to her was wrong and she got loud and rude arguing with me.  She's in there every time we go, so maybe she needs a day off or six.
