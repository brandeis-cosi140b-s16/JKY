My husband and I went to Serrano's last night because the reviews sounded very good.

I have to start out by saying that everything was very good except the meat was over salted.  I had the carnitas plate and my husband had the Serrano chicken burrito.  Both meats were very salty and they could have cut the salt by half.  If someone likes that much salt they can always add it at the table.

The rest of the meal was very good.  The salsa bar, the guacamole, the real plates that were hot when they were delivered to the table.  Much better than a usual fast food place.

Of course, over salty meat is just not pleasant or delicious to eat so we more than likely won't be back.
