It might just be me, I didn't think that the food was very good.

I got a bowl and my husband got the burrito. If I had to choose, I don't think it was better than Chipotle or Caf√© Rio. The al pastor meat (pork) was unique for sure, but it's not so good that I would go here for it.

On a positive note, they didn't serve the food in Styrofoam containers, there is a fountain drink station, and the veggies were fresh.

I may give this place another chance only due to the fact that I didn't try their most unique items and tried to stay safe, but for just a bowl or or burrito I would just rather eat at Chipotle and plus it would be cheaper.
