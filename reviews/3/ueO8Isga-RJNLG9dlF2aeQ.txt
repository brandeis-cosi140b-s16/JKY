I went to this place due to some elite yelpers giving it very high marks.  Here is my take:  
The food: 4 Stars.  Very Authentic Mexican Cuisine. So before you go there realize you are not going to get a taco with cheese in it.  The portions are not going to be overflowing your plate.  There isn't going to be a hundred different combo's to choose from.  The Menu is one piece of paper.  That said, I really enjoyed the salsa bar and the authenticity of the food.  
The Service:  2.5 Stars.  Perhaps a drawback that comes with the authenticity.  When I went there the people who worked there knew very little English.  Thus, they didn't get my order right.  Also, when I went they only had one server.  So when they had 5 Tables it was difficult to get more chips and refills on soda.  
Overall, I was happy.  I got a good meal for a very cheap price.
