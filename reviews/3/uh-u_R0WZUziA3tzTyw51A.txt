We came tonight for dinner after learning the Tauqueria had re opened.  We loved the previous Taqueria, which was Tia Rosa's at the time.  Anxious to enjoy it again,  we were disappointed..  The food was mediocre.  I ordered the supreme nachos expecting what I was used to.  The food tasted like it needed seasoning,  the amount of meat was less than previous,  etc.  I am glad we returned,  however,  I'm not sure about returning..
