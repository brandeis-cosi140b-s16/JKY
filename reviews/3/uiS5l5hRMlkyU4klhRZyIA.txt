Born and raised in So Cali....I've had my fair share of Mexican restaurants from Los Angeles all the way down to San Diego.
Aside from having a fantastic date with my special someone, Lindo Michoacan did not satisfy my expectations. 

My date enjoyed his margaritaS. He got two of them. So all you drinkers out there, drink up. This stuff is good. (So he said.) 

Besides the complimentary chips and salsa + bean dip....we also ordered guacamole for an additional charge. The guac.... +1 star. They prepare it fresh right in front of you....with all the mixings of cilantro, onions, tomatoes and your choice of the level of spiciness.

Our entrees, both of us ordered the combination dishes; a beef tamale and one enchilada (choice of beef or cheese.) Combination dishes includes rice and beans. I opted for all rice please.
My beef tamale was pretty bland....and my beef enchilada wasn't very good. Also, pet peeve of mine: I love my food pippin hot. They brought out my entree warm. Ehh.... =/ I just settled with it and ate my food. Although filling, it just left something to be desired.

To sum it up:
+1 for the guacamole dip
+1 for the great view of the city of Las Vegas that my date reserved for us.
+1 for the waiter service.

Sadly...that's pretty much it.
Just like how Olive Garden can be considered "fake" Italian and PF Changs is glorified Asian food. Well....Lindo Michoacan can be added to the "fake" Mexican food. Give me some hole in the wall Mexican restaurant instead.
