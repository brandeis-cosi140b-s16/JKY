The cashier was not real friendly or helpful. This may be because of a language barrier. The cook was very attentive, and real friendly. Sang as he cooked, and cleaned his grill.
My husband had the carne asada tacos, of which he said was delicious. I had the #2 which is the  asada burrito, with beans, rice, and a drink. Neither my husband or I liked the refried beans, however the rice was really good.
Liked the idea of the salsa/veggie bar. Did not like the fact that  they charged me to use my credit card. Would probably not go back due to that.
