I am always on the lookout for new places in Las Vegas to eat Russian Food. So here's another place. I like the name, Dacha is Russian for "Summer Home", which I've always had fond memories of when I was a kid growing up in Russia. The outside actually looks like a Dacha, which was pretty intriguing. Problem was that the inside looked like a Russian Dance Hall.. Loud music, Hookah, strange d√©cor, not the best first impression. 
The food was good. Olivie is something you can judge a Russian Restaurant by and theirs was great and it was a very nice portion. 
They were out of the pickled Herring, which was a little disappointing. 
Rassolnik was well balanced and tasty. Zharkoe was good too, haven't seen this dish on too many Russian menus, despite being a common Russian dish. 
Overall the food was authentic and the prices were reasonable. I want to come back and try the Piroshki and the Borsht, both of which are a good barometer for Russian Food. The service is not bad and I like addition of classic Russian Cartoons on the big screen. 
I am a little confused about the some of the reviews, which look about as fake as  Watches sold near the Red Square. Grammar mistakes obviously written by the same person. A little distasteful, so I am docking a star for that, even though it's a little funny. Overall, I would totally recommend coming to this place and trying the food. If you  are or have ever been interested in trying Russian food, this place will give you a good idea of what it's all about.
