I honestly think this deserves more of a 2.5, but hey I feel like being nice. 

We came here with a semi large group - 8 people. We were seated within 15 minutes which was excellent. 

Then the waiting began. A  inattentive and somewhat condescending waiter took our orders after 40 minutes. My friend ordered a drink and when it came it was not up to par, and when she complained the waiter had the nerve to instruct her on what the drink was - as if she didnt know!

The food was actually great. The chips and salsa were excellent. The tortilla soup was awesome. 

Somewhat expensive IMO, especially for poor service. I am totally over spending a lot of $$ at restaurants that don't appreciate the business.
