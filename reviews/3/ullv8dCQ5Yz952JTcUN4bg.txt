Yesterday night was my first time eating at the restaurant.  I wasn't blown away but it was ok.  The food was good enough for the price they were charging and the overall experience was pleasant.

I had:
Carne Asada entree that came with rice and beans.
It was pretty tasty, the marinade was delicious and the meat was very tender.  I order medium and the steak came approximately medium rare?  a little bloody but still acceptable. (i don't expect perfect grilling just because they are not a steak house and it's hard to grill to perfection or as ordered.  not too concerned)  The beans were alright and the rice was ok, nothing spectacular but still delicious.  I ordered corn tortillas to go with the meal and they were good.

the bf had:
Chicken and Steak fajitas.  I don't think you can ever go wrong with fajitas at a mexican restaurant just because in my opinion it's a DIY dish and if the toppings are good you can never go wrong with meat served on a pipping hot skillet.  The meat had a tasty marinade and the peppers and onions were tender enough to enjoy in the wrap.  He ordered flour tortillas and looked pretty delish.  i had a bite of the chicken alone and steak as well and they were good.  I had some onions and peppers later on and they were good as well.  

Chips, beans and salsa were endless and their chips are very crispy and fresh, the salsa seems a little store bought but the beans w/ them were tasty.

Overall, it was a good experience, nothing mind blowing but i would definitely go back and try other things on the menu.
