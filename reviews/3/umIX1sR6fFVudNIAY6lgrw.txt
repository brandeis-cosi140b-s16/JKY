Good Tex-Mex in the Phoenix area - little family-owned place near Old Town.

Convenient to local hotels, and they give you yummy sopapillas with  your meal. They are not overwhelmingly accomodating of special requests, but are ok with leaving something you don't want off your plate. 

Salsa is tasty if not a revelation, like the rest of the food. Service can be poor if you are dining alone, so take a book and plan on staying a while. The food's good enough that it's still worth going, however.
