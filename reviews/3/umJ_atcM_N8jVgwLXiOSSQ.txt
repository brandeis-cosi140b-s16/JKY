Had just rolled into town. I was starving and craving tacos. I just sort of ended up here. Service was mostly prompt and always friendly. I received chips and salsa and had my drink order taken and filled in no time. However, once I got my dinner I never saw a server again. I had to go up front to ask for my bill. Turns out you pay for it up front (so I was told), but I didn't know that.

I had chicken tacos and a margarita.The tacos were fine. The chicken was a bit dry. If it had been moister then the tacos would have been perfect. The cheese they used was excellent and did not overwhelm the taco.

The margarita was huge and well worth the price (I think 6.50). I couldn't even finish it, but it did a great job of helping me relax and unwind after a long day of travel.
