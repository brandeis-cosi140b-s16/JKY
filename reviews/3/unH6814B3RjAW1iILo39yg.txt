Decent choice for Mexican staples such as burritos, chimichangas, and enchiladas.  Service is fast, friendly, and attentive.  The salsa that came with the chips came in two varieties: mild and hot.  The mild wasn't chopped well enough, and there were whole stewed tomatoes in it, but it tasted OK.  I think the chef mistakenly thought that you had to add black pepper instead of whatever type of pepper they would normally use for the hot salsa, because it was littered with thick black bits of pepper, so much that when you smelled it, all you could smell was black pepper.  

The food came out in very fast time.  I had the shrimp enchiladas, which were OK.  They weren't the best enchiladas I've had, but not the worst.  One shrimp still had some shell on it, and the shrimp itself was a little tough.  The green sauce was nice though, and it came with some big chunks of nice green chile.  The rice and beans that came with it were pretty good, very flavorful.  I tried some chicken chimichanga, which was a pretty big size.  The chicken was tender, and the tortilla it was wrapped in was nicely deep fried and came with a good amount of guacamole and sour cream.

We came here around 7 on a Friday night, and it wasn't busy at all.  They do have a mariachi band that comes in around 7:30-8 P.M. to perform, so there might have been more people coming in later!
