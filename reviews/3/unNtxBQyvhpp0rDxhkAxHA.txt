Maybe the adobada was not the proper choice for a first Phrank's experience. It was okay but not spectacular. The beans were quite garlicky but not bad. The rice was just blah.
Now for the excellent guacamole-- it was fresh and flavorful!! It gave me hope that maybe I should give Phrank's another try on another day somewhere in the future.
