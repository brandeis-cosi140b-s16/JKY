I have to say I have a love hate relationship with Taco Bell. I love the food and hate it when they get my order wrong! My bean burrito had some other "bonus" ingredients this time (a little beef and lettuce). I LOVE the Baja Blast Mountain Dew!! Hey Pepsi... did you guys put crack in the Baja Blast?? I wish I could buy it off the shelf, but alas I guess I'll continue to brave Taco Bell for my fix!
