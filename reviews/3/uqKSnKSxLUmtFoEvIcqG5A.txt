Taco Bell and I go way back to the days of my youth.  I still like to stop by and order a 7-Burrito every now and again.  Just as I did on Saturday afternoon.  I also like the cheap chickcen burrito they have.  It is another go to for me.  But what do you do when the Taco Bell nearest to you is hit and miss on a regular basis?  I continue going expecting frustration and being pleasently surprised when everything runs smoothly.

More often than not my frustration arises from the people infront of me in the drive-thru.  They take so damn long to order sometimes.  Other times, like on Saturday, the delays seem more of the fault of the people behind the counter.  I saw a bag of food passed back and forth between the window and the truck ahead two or three times.  Apparently they could not get the order right inside.  When I got up to the window I waited though I could clearly see my food sitting there as three employees were discussing another issue.  They knew I was there and even took my money.  I was getting a little irritated and may or may not have cussed a bit when I drove off.  Yet on a previous visit I was very surprised at the service I received.  I was greeted warmly when I pulled up the the order box.  I got my food quickly.  It was fresh and hot.  I was even given a free Vanilla Dr. Pepper slushie thing as I seemed "to be in a good mood."  If I wasn't before I certainly was afterwards.  That was kind of cool.

With any relationship there are bound to be ups and downs.  And so goes mine with Taco Bell.
