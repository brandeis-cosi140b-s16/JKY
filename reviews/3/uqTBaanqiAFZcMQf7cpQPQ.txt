I like Filibertos a lot. I have eaten at most of the locations several times. This particular location is pretty reliable, there are some occasional misses but they are rare. They have a fairly nice and large interior with a salsa bar. Try an arizona burrito with beans or the two taco combo... delicious. And don't worry about rumors, I have been eating Filibertos since high school, hundreds of times by now, and have never, EVER, gotten sick.
