We came late at 10 pm and they close at 11. But they were nice,  the food was ok.  My kids got the cheese quesadilla and fries, ehhhh, nothing special. I got the taquitos which were really good and the nachos-thisr were horrilbe, it's chips with shredded cheese and microwaved! I'm not sure how they melted the cheese but the chips got tough and they shouldn't call them nachos at all! Mu hubby got the skinny tacos and the fish tasted like 10pm fish! Soooo we might try again, maybe earlier in the day instead.
