I can see that the this place got mixed reviews and I understand why. My meal was good (I had the vegetarian platter #2). You do get free tortilla chips as you do at most Mexican restaurants but the salsa was runny and just okay in my opinion. Also, our margarita was disappointingly small and was 75% ice. 

The service was very friendly but it seemed unorganized because we were waited on several people who kept coming up to us asking if we had been helped yet. It was busier when we were there though so that was probably contributory. I would describe the decor as cheesy. Meals possibly overpriced. 

Overall, I rate this place as average. Fine if you are craving Mexican but wouldn't go out of my way to go here.
