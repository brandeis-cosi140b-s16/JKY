Definately family owned, bad part about small restsurants like this is that they dont hire actual waiters...usually a son, daughter niece handles this task and the downside to this is when there are more than 2 occupied tables service gets a bit sloppy but, everyone is very nice. Now to the food, if you are a menudo or pozole (pork and homony soup) fan please give this place a shot, tortillas are hand made for menudo and the pozole is made with niztamal which is the original way to make it. All the other dishes we've tried are good but, nothing to go crazy over. Ill come back for pozole for sure.
