Great place for happy hour drinks. If you want a bucket of cheap beer with friends, then this is your place. The patio area is nice when the weather isn't too hot. Wait and bar staff is great. 

Why the three stars then? The food sucks! I have not had one good item from the menu. I think those who say the food is good had too many drinks during happy hour.
