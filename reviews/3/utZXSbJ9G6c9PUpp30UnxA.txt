Used to come here almost every weekends while I was studying at Arizona State University.  Been going to their location in Tempe by the campus a lot before they moved and then closed.  I like this location because it's so far away from ASU and is in Old Town Scottsdale where a lot of other people comes.  Best time to come out is like I said, on the weekends where you will see a lot of people, young and old.  It might be very crowded if you come out late and you will definitely not be able to find a parking spot.  So come out early and stay out late.
