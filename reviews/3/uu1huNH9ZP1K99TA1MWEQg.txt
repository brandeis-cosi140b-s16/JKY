There's a bit of nostalgia for some people when they talk about Pancho's Mexican Buffet. And, I suppose this is the best Mexican buffet that I've been to.

The three-star rating is not a knock to the quality of the food, service, or cleanliness of the restaurant. All of that is, fine; it's a buffet after all. It's a little different in that they serve you cafeteria style and if you "raise the flag" on the table the servers will come to refill your drinks, reload your entrees, and bring sopapillas (with honey!). If you're not super familiar with their offerings, make sure you take a good look on your first time through, so you know what to ask for.

It's pretty busy and there's a lot of turnover so the food was all very fresh, but nothing was really excellent. The best thing is the sopapillas; fresh squares of fried dough, drizzled with honey. They're really good.

The food is not really authentic mexican, but it's a few steps closer than fast-food Taco Bell / Del Taco.

Bottom line, if you had a big group with kids and want to have a sit-down dinner with okay all-you-can-eat food that isn't too expensive, Pancho's is pretty good.
