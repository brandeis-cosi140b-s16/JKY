Qdoba has recently increased their prices so that most things on their menu are a few dollars higher than similar items at places like Chipotle.  They justify it by giving you all the toppings you want for free, but if I had mounds of guacamole on everything I ate, I'd be as big as a house.  So, my basic burrito is 30% more expensive.  Not such a great deal.  But it;s made me try Chipotle again (and in fairness I was food poisoned at Chipotle about seven years ago and so stopped going) and now Chipotle is the place for me.  Better tasting food and lower prices.  Qdoba needs to roll back their prices to what their menu was a few months ago.
