My wife and I had breakfast twice at the Miracle Mile location in Las Vegas.
We both ordered the $3.95 breakfast and were happy to find one of the few places that is open for breakfast in the Miracle Mile before 8 AM - it is Vegas Baby.
My wife  ordered the eggs with sausage and I had the ham variation. The sausage was a patty rather than links, which my wife prefers. Included were southwestern style potatoes and choice of corn or flour tortillas. Both breakfasts were adequate and a deal in Vegas. Service was friendly and prompt - at 7:15AM :)
