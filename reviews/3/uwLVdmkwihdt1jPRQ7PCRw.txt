This chicken chain is awesome.
The quality and taste of the food at each location is remarkably good.

These folks know chicken.

The best thing is feeling of being full without the guilt for eating at a fast food.
And unlike some other places, the chicken doesn't need to be overly coated and deep fired (not that there's anything wrong with that) to be tasty.

I really enjoy the food here.
