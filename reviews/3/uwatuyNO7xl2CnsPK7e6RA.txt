This is a down to earth type place to eat. Ambiance is at a minimum. Local customers look a little rough. The food is good but not exceptional. They offer a decent variety but should stick to a smaller better menu. The item you want is a meatball sub. I caution you to always call ahead. This three meat special runs out daily. You will be disappointed if you don't.
