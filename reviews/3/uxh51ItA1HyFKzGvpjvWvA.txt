A friend told me this place has good green chili burros, and being a Green chili junkie I had to go. The restaurant is rather small, and the bars on the order window tells you it's not the best area of town. The food however is very good. 

I realized after eating the burrito that I had been to their store in Surprise. It's a much nicer place, but it is very small as well. The green chili they make is very soupy, so it's a knife and fork thing, not something you pick up and eat. This location was a little spicier than the Surprise store, which I liked. I may have to try the red chili here, since several people here like it. 

In this area of town I still like Caramba's green chili better. It's more meaty.
