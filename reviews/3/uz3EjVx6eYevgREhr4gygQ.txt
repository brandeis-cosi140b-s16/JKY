The Mariachi band was great.....but the enchilada sauce was a disaster. The worst sauce we had ever tasted - bitter and bland. All the other dishes were edible, pretty decent. The service was slow due to the restaurant being under-staffed. We may have gone on a bad night.... It could be a nice Friday evening if you love mariachi music and don't order the enchiladas.
