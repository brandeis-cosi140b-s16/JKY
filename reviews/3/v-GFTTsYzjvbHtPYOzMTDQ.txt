3 1/2

Rolled in for lunch with my coworkers. 

Initial thoughts: quaint, clean. 

Sign on the front door: no public restrooms. Hmmm, not sure that's allowed. 

Regardless, I ordered the pork carnitas plate and a drink. $10. It was very good. No complaints. Pork was crispy, tender and delicious. The plate came with lettuce, guacamole, rice, beans, and a huge delectable tortilla. It was really good, required no additional seasoning.  I couldn't finish the huge portion. 

My gal pal was thrilled with her taco salad. A fresh crunchy shell and huge chunks of chicken breast sealed the deal. It had rice, guacamole, salsa, lettuce. Yum. 

My guy pal loved his special beef burrito plate. He says 4-5 stars! Better than Robertos!

They  have a little salsa bar with 5 salsa choices and the usual limes and pickled veggies. 

The girls at the counter were super nice. Definitely comparable or better than your fave fast Mexican place. Give it a whirl if you're on the East side!
