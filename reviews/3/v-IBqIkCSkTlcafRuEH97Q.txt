El Santo can provide a few different experiences, all depending on the day that you go. Like I experienced yesterday, it was a fun and relaxed atmosphere. Go on a day or night where they've brought in an EDM producer or DJ, expect a wild and very impersonal experience - Personal only if you've bought a bottle of liquor. On these wild nights, expect tons of people, very little room to move around, and lots and lots of drunk fraternity-boy types. It's a bit of a turn off for me after experiencing this about a dozen times.

Yesterday's experience though was pretty good. I'm leaving my rating off of yesterday and not all my other experiences. I was able to get a free cabana at the front door when I asked. The wait staff was very attentive. The margaritas were really tasty. The shrimp tacos were very good and the perfect amount of food for poolside service. I have a hard time rating this at 4 stars because I had a ton of fun, but it wasn't quite up to par with a stellar experience.

One of these days I may re-rate based on the night life experience. I can tell you off the bat that it would be a star or two lower than my current rating, based on past experience. Again, if you're looking for a nice, chill atmosphere, go during a weekday or weekend when they do not have a big-name live act.
