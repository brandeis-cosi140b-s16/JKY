This place is so sketchy in terms of the way it looks. I've only been through the drive thru, because I only feel safe staying in my car with my gun. The ordering speaker looks like the old school drive - in microphones, and they NEVER quote you your price until you arrive at the window. The food is decent, if you're prepared to reserve a toilet within 45min of eating it. Nothing special... Perfect for breakfast burritos or a fast fix
