Went there last night late for a chile relleno burrito. I craved one and I haven't had theirs yet. It was delicious and had refried beans. I could taste the relleno batter which mixed with the other ingredients well, but there should've been more relleno. Overall great tasting but too much bean. Nice heavy burrito.
INSIDE SKINNY: Pay the extra buck for a double handful of watery red salsa shots. Sign on drive-through window. A whole shot at the right time makes a magic mouthful.
