I just can't handle a place that charges extra for sour cream and guacamole. It breaks my heart! Especially when it's for carne Asada fries or a carne Asada burrito. 

I've been here twice but those were late night munchie runs when I didn't want to drive to far locations. 

Service is quick and the food is good.. But not that good. Their hot carrots are crunchy too and not spicy what so ever, but their green salsa is delicious and always hits the spot. 

Id recommend you come to this location if you're in the area and not wanting to drive far.
