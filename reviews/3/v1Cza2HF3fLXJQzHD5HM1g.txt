We ate here early in the year and was pleased by the food and service, so we tried it again.  Nice misters on the fringes of the covered patio to help with the heat.  My wife had steak fajitas, and I had a brisket quesadilla, both from the lunch menu.  Chips and salsa were really good, but the main course for both of us wasn't all that good (too much gristle in hers, not enough brisket in mine).  Good service.  Probably would go back, but we've had better.
