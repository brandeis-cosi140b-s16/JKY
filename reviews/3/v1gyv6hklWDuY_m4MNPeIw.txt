While not in the same class as Elmers, Paquime, or Polibertos, this particular Los Favs is pretty quality. The last 5 or so visits have not been disappointing,  and its run the gamut from burritos to breakfast burritos lol. Go with the chori breakfast burrito w/beans.  Especially if you just ran 4-5 miles. Anyway, if its too late for elmers, this 'll do
