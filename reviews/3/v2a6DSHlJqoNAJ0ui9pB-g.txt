ITS A BAR....SO THAT'S GOOD....

THE PLACE: i went here with my boys last weekend on Saturday to grab a few cold ones after walking down the strip.  Right off the bat i could see WHY this place would be a hot spot but it just seemed like a regular bar to me, people had to keep telling me it was crazy. Calling it a cantina imply s mexican-ness but i dident see any. Bartender had that depressing VEGAS LOOK were you get the feeling that they have been taken in by the lifestyle and it just wore them out, i mean she was still hot but, it was a painted on hot and she was nice enough to us, but we were being assholes They DID however have a nice big wheel that chicks could spin to get free drinks or drink specials for everyone or something like that and they would get up on the bar and be sexy, so i'm all about that. Nice decor around with allot of crazy shit on the walls.....

THE BAR: Yeah they had beers, yeah the had shots, yeah they had what LOOKED LIKE nice margaritas, bar seating was nice and it was like half outside half inside. Cheep also, Miller Light set me back fro $3, i'm good with that.

OVERALL: Yeah i would probably go back but it was just OK this past time i was there...I wont totally discount it.
