I really wanted to love this place but I ended up just sort of liking it.

I read the reviews and gathered that it is best to order to go and reheat at home. So I ordered 2 dozen. I don't really care for the set up. It is a little awkward to reach into their fridge and pick your empandadas. They had a nice presentation but I wish they had long, waist high coolers instead, similar to a salad bar.

The man behind the counter was a bit cold at first. He seemed to warm up and become friendlier by the end of our transaction but I was uncomfortable at first. Also he charged me per empanada instead of by the dozen price listed on the menu. Not that big of a price difference but still kinda ticked me off. I didn't say anything because I had a Groupon and was already getting a good deal but you can bet that if I return I will rectify that situation.

When it came to heating the empanadas we were clueless. There weren't any directions that came with them, or on the menu, or on their website. So we heated them in the oven until they seemed warmed through. I think it was a mistake because pastry was a bit tough, dry and not as flaky as I expected it to be.

The Hawaiian pork was the favorite with my husband and son. My husband wished there was filling in the empanandas. I had vegetarian ones. I wasn't crazy about the spinach one but I did like the potato one.

A little later we heated up our dessert ones. This time we microwaved them. The texture of the pastry was much better this way. We will keep it in mind if we return.

The chocolate and lemon ones were delicious and melted in our mouth. 

My general feeling is that the empanadas are a bit overpriced for what they are. I think they would make great party food. But to feed my starving family? I'm not convinced.
