Given this location is close to my work I find it convenient. I generally go through the drive through. It can get busy during lunch hours but for the most part they move cars fairly quickly. Customer service has always been good to me and my order is always correct and complete. My typical order is a chicken bowl with rice, pinto beans and chicken. This place is perfect for those looking to cut down on greasy fast food meals. While it's still not the healthiest, the charbroiled chicken is simply flavorful and a healthier choice.
