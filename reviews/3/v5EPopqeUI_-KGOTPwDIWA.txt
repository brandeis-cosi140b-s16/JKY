I wanted to try something different for dinner, so I headed on over to Pancheros to give them a try.

I knew I wanted a burrito, and I dig the fact that the tortilla is made right then and there, that's pretty sweet.

I went with the grilled steak, and I was going to toss some grilled veggies on there, but after looking into the pan and seeing dried up stuck to the side veggies I quickly changed my mind.  I went with the white rice, pinto beans, meat, cheese, salsa verde and sour cream, after everything was layered inside I thought they would wrap it up, but no they took a knife and mixed everything together, had I known they were going to do that I would have asked for the salsa & sour cream to be added later, I like the layering effect. Maybe I'm weird but I do.

Over all, I prefer Chipotle, I wanted to like this place, but it just didn't stack up.  The ingredients didn't look fresh, the white rice was supposed to be cilantro & lime but I can tell you there were no hints of green in the rice, and I happen to think cilantro is the best ingredient in the world but it was missing from my rice. The grilled veggies like I said where dried out and stuck to the pan, the meat was tough and cold. I just wasn't impressed over all.
