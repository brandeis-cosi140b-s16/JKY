I'm not sure why everyone seems to dislike this place so much, I had a pretty good experience here. We were seated immediately and got some decent chips and salsa (hot and mild). They seemed to be a little understaffed but our server did her best and the food came out very quickly. I had a carne asada quesadilla and I thought it was delicious. I haven't ordered a quesadilla at a restaurant since I was a little kid, but this was definitely a grown-up version filled with big chunks of meat, black beans, corn, and large slices of bell peppers. I really enjoyed it and they had good guacamole too. Oh - and the best part? $1 margaritas!! $2 for strawberry but only a single buck for original. Now that's a great deal. I'd definitely stop by this place again if I was looking for a low-priced and quick sit-down meal in the Imperial Palace area.
