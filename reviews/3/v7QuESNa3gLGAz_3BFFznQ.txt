Good - bueno..

That's about it - went here with the family last month and we all enjoyed our meal. Only problem is I can't remember what I had....

So, yes I was satisfied and would return, but I can probably think of a dozen more places I would go to for authentic mexican food first.

I don't believe you will hate it but, you probably will not do back flips in the parking lot either!
