Been passing by this place for a while now. I saw they had a offer on restaurant.com so decided to give it a try today. For those of you who have never tried this place the offer would be great and of course a nice deal for those who love it as well.

We started out with some "Chile con Queso Dip" that cost $7.95. It was very good and we would order this again. The chips that came with is were delicious. 

I had the "Cheese Enchiladas" that cost just $7.50. It came with rice and beans. The price was very affordable but I wouldn't order Enchiladas again. They weren't authentic tasting.

My man had the "Carne Asada Burrito" that cost $8.95. It also came with the usual rice and beans. He did enjoy it and said he would order it again. It was a nicely sized burrito. 

We each had a couple Margaritas and they were tasty :)

All in all we would come back at some point and give it another try but I had to give it 3 stars because of my Enchiladas not being up to par and I would obviously try something else.
