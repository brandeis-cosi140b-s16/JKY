The food was delicious and I'm from Sinaloa Mexico! I would add more stars but the service was not too good. It does help if you know a bit of Spanish but the menu does come in English. The shrimp ceviche is awesome and one tostada can be shared. The fish filet in garlic sauce is huge and really tasty.
