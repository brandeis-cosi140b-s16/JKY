I've given this place three tries and what's weird is the rice and beans are good but everything else is below average at best. Usually it's the other way around.

I've had green chile twice and carnitas once. All three plates arrived quickly and hot, but they all lacked real flavor and authenticity.

Service is okay but you have to pay extra for a smile.

Last thing, the chips and salsa are good but aren't worth stopping in for.



After eating there a few more times I am updating my review.  Avoid the carnitas.  They are nothing better than cubed pork on a bed of grilled onions with pepper.  No sauce, no sides, nothing.  

Everything else is okay.  But be cautious of ordering off the menu, at the very least ask how much they're going to charge you.  I special ordered a burrito and lunch cost me $18 with tip.  That's way too much.
