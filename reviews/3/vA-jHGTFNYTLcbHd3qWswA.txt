I had lunch here yesterday and the place was pretty empty which is usually not a good sign.  We sat at the bar and the service was friendly and prompt.  The space itself is really odd, because it's located now in the old mill site tavern with old black and white pics of steel workers next to tacky mexican decorations.  I ordered three tacos, the chicken taco was pretty good but not memorable.  All three were served on really good authentic corn tortillas.  The chorizo was really good served with a little lemon.  My favorite by far was the seasoned pork served with plenty of cilantro and a few chunks of pineapple.  These tacos are authentic, which means pretty small all three would equal about 1/2 of a mad mex burrito.  My friend had the chicken burrito, which he said was very good.  Their salsa with  the chips was spicy and crisp.  This is a decent lunch spot, probably wouldn't spend my evenings here however.  Overall, a good 2nd choice to El campesino for real mexican food.  I'd give it four stars, but I believe it's a bit overpriced especially the drinks.  They charge $2.50 for a bottled water??
