The remodel they did to the building is very nice.  It is cozy and cute inside.  The service was friendly and attentive.  My wife got a margarita and it was fantastic, fresh made from scratch.  I got the beef enchiladas and they were delicious.  My wife got the green chili and it was top notch as well.  Overall, the fare was fresher and more interesting than a typical Mexican restaurant.   We loved the food but we probably won't be going back much.  It was just too expensive for what you get.  The margarita was $13.  Our bill came to just over $70 for 2 entries and 2 drinks.  There are a lot of alternatives in the area that are significantly less.  They need a few lower priced (under $10) items on the menu.  They charged $4 for chips and salsa. it's too bad they priced the food one tier above what they deliver.  It was a great experience otherwise.  My review is one star lower as a result.
