Via is a lot like that 10 year old beat up Honda Civic that got you through college and the first crappy job after. It's pretty reliable, you don't really want people to see you drive up in it, it's better than nothing at all, but you're always thinking about that time when you can finally get something better. Highs = chips/salsa and the margaritas. Lows = same old cheese and bean mess you always see and a nasty bathroom and smell at times. It's the North Central version of Tee Pee. Head South and go to Gallo Blanco if you have the time.
