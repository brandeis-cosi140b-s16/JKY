Back in the glory days of the Galleria Mall no restaurant chain was probably more frequented my me than Baja!  I loved Baja for their fresh ingredients and diverse menu items.  

Had to relive some old childhood memories and make a trip to the old Baja next to the galleria and use some precious entree coupons haha.  The food was good and the price was right as usual @ Baja!
