We used 2 go here 4 a l8 night or early morning quick fix, but have noticed a lot of cutting corners going on 4 awhile. While prices have increased (as they always will) the quality & quantity of food has decreased. 

   Burritos that used 2 b huge/fat have been consistently getting skimpier each time we ordered, consisting mostly of the folds of a huge tortilla instead of being filled. The sauces & even the pina/horchata drinks have been watered down significantly. Combin8ion pla8es many times had overly refried, old tasting, thick dried out beans w/ guacamole & sour cream being less each time or 4gotten completely. Red & green sauce cups have now become flavored salt Water (which news~flash over~salting doesn't hide it)! WTH is the deal w/ finding Meat in NON~MEAT orders EVERY SINGLE TIME?? EWWW, that's a HUGE DISGUSTING No~No 4 Veg~Heads 2 discover such when ordering the very limited items we have 2 choose from on ur menu as it is!!

   It won't b likely, but we may decide 2 give them a try in a very distant future if ever feeling desper8 enough 2 take another gamble after losing a bit 2 much 2 many Xs worth of visits now! More cost 4 @ least the same we used 2 get woulda been alright, but we can't justify paying MORE 4 LESS in food, service & quality as that's a RIP~OFF!! Such a shame, but MAYBE they'll improve ~ not holding breath as I don't wanna b called Smurfette...
