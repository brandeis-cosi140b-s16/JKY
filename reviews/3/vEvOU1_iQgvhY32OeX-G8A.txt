Went to Toros for a dinner on a Friday night.  Service was good, but could have been better.  I had to flag our waiter down for utensils which weren't on the table but no big deal.  In other Tapas restaurants I'm used to the waiter coming over pretty frequently to check if you want anything else since they are small plates.  
We ordered an array of tapas including the padron peppers, pil pil shrimp, and ox tail.  We also ordered the pork sandwich.  The peppers were tasty but I probably wouldn't order again.  The pil pil shrimp was excellent...lots of flavor and cooked very well.  I would skip the ox tail next time although it was done well.  The sandwich was terrible...dry with no sauce on it.  We ended up dipping it in the pil pil shrimp sauce which wasn't bad, but definitely do not order this.  We will probably be back to check this place out again, but it won't be a regular dining experience for us even though it's close to home
