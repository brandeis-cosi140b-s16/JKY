We tried this place a couple years ago (I'd been there some years ealier before that) and my husband's burrito was sent back three times. Finally after getting it right, he scored a beer on the house. I rarely make changes to my order, so mine is usually good. 

So we decided to give it another try- using a certificate from www.restaurant.com. We went with one of our friends. It was not too busy except for one large party. We had a bit of a wait on our meals.  They both ordered the seafood burrito but after a few bites noticed that the other seafood listed on the menu was missing. ( I don't remember what I ordered but I know that it was a safe choice for me.) They asked the waitress, and she checked in the back for us. She came back explaining that the cooks had run out of seafood- shrimp was the only seafood in the burritos. Why didn't the cook tell her in the beginning, so that she could've said something when the food was taken out to us? Also, the burritos were charged at full price even though they weren't as advertised.  The waitress only came back to refill our drinks once. We couldn't help but wonder if the service and the food was not at the best due to using a certificate from www.restaurant.com. 

Even with their posted signs with specials outside, we might not be back. And we don't even say that much, either.
