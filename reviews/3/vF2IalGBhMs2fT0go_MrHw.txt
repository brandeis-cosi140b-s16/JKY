I've been here twice for lunch.  By far the best thing on the menu is the guacamole, which is made table-side (I realize the table-side guac thing is such a gimmick, but, like a cat to a laser pointer, I fall for it every time).  Their house salsa is pretty good, too, and can be spiced up with chipotle per your specifications. Many pluses for the warm chips, too, which they keep coming throughout your meal. During my first visit, I had the Red Chile Chicken Chopped Salad, which was pretty good.  Second time, on a friend's recommendation, I had the Carnitas Tacos but they were a miss--not served hot enough and not that flavorful. 

Vida is in a great location, right in the Epicenter, so seemingly accessible to everyone working in the Uptown area. The restaurant itself has a great vibe--lively but not too noisy.  I've had good service here, too. The hostesses have seated us pretty quickly even though we always come right during the lunch rush, and the table service has been good.

My main issue with Vida is that, both times for lunch, I ended up dropping around $20.  I think it is the guac (the aforementioned 'best thing on the menu') that is the killer, but, nonetheless, I think that is too much to pay for lunch.  Drop the prices a bit, Vida, and I'll be back for more.
