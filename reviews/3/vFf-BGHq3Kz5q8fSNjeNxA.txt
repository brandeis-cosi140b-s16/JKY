We went here based upon the 4.5 star reviews. I don't think it was deserving. It was good, nothing special. The food was fresh and the place was clean. But it was a little over priced. We got the shrimp tacos, bean and cheese burrito, carne asada tacos and chips and guacamole. Basically it was a cleaner less greasy Filiberto's.
