I've visited this location a few times before. Usually end up going once a year. It's hard to find amazing Mexican restaurants in the area, but this one is okay. 

I've always gotten the Pollo Con Queso and it's pretty good. Portions are huge and moderate pricing. The servers are always upbeat and friendly, and the restaurant never seem to be extremely busy so you are well taken care of. 

Would not be in any rush to visit again, but give it a try if you are craving Mexican food.
