I go back and forth with whether I like this place or not. The food is sometimes bland and sometimes ok. The only time it wow-ed me was when it had just opened a few years ago. Over the past year or so, the flavor isn't really there. I'd have to say I normally eat at this place for convienence. Their chips and salsa is good, service is ok, and the food varies.
