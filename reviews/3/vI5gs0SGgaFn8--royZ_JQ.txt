This is your typical Roberto's and I can't see myself giving it 4 stars. 

Food is pretty solid and service is good. The condiments look a little old sometimes, so just be careful with that. I've been here a few times, sober and not so sober. So I'm sure the employees were like "why are they laughing so much?" I'm sure they're used to it though. 

Typical run would consist of carne asada nachos, beef tacos, maybe a adobado burrito depending on the bf's appetite and a side of enchilada sauce. We never end up using it all, but the bf and his brother swear that all the food tastes better with it. 

Good spot for food after a night of drinking or just a night of gluttony.
