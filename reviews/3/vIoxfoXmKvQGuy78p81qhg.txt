It's "OK".  I love spicy food, and like someone else said, some of their dishes seem spicy just to be spicy foregoing full flavor.  Their Margaritas are too sweet, IMO, but do pack a punch.  I also think their food is too salty, specifically their tortillas.  I also would NOT recommend the Mesa, AZ location.  It is nowhere near the quality of the Phoenix location.  I have been to the Phoenix location 8 times and the Mesa location 2 times and both Mesa experiences were sub-par.  If I were to rate based on the Mesa location I would give it a 1 or 2 star rating.
