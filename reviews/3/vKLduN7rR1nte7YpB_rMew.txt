This place has really changed. After this visit, I'm pretty sure that it's no longer one of my favorite places to go in CenPho.  They took all of the good things off of the appetizer menu, and what we did have was bland. The red wine was also chilled way too cold. My Malbec didn't have that great of a flavor because it was too cold. Oh well, on to the next...
