I love China Poblano already because it is in the Cosmopolitan and that place just makes me feel cooler than I actually am, aaand Mexican and asian food in one spot! I took advantage of the double menu and ordered cochinita tacos and pot stickers. The tacos were delicious and the pot stickers were not my favorite. Call me crazy, but I prefer Ling Lings from Costco. The bill came, we gave the waitress our cards and then we sat there waiting to get them back for about 25 minutes. When I asked another server what happened to our cards, they said that they were having problems with their machine. Please relay that information to the customer before they have to track you down. Ten minutes later another server comes out with our cards. It was really annoying and really expensive. Hence the 3 stars.
