Pretty good carne asada. Portions are Hugh M. Unguss.  My appetite was too big for my stomach this go-around.  Had the super-huge bowl of Menudo, and a carne asada quesadilla.

For the menudo, oregano is not included in the setup, you have to ask for it, and there is no option for flour tortillas or bread. The tripe was a wee bit firm for my liking, and there was a lack in hominy.  The broth was good and flavorful though.

The Quesadilla was HUGE! good meat, cheddar cheese.

Super big portions, reasonably priced, roasted/salted, super hawt jalapenos! A-OK indeed
