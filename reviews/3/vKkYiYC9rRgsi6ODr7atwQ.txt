Since I won a $50 Rubio's catering gift certificate at a Yelp event, I figured it was time to finally try out Rubio's.

Placing the catering order was very simple and easy. You can do it all online - pick out what you want, when you want to pick it up, etc. (And you can arrange delivery if you want.) And I appreciated that they called me the day before my scheduled pick-up to confirm the order.

When I walked in to pick up the order, the place itself was actually quite nice for a fast food-type place. And some of the pictures of the fish tacos did have me salivating just a little bit. And the menu did appear to be rather expansive.

As soon as I arrived, I was helped immediately. Once I said "catering pick-up", they knew my name, knew I had a gift certificate, had my order all packed up and ready to go, etc.

The packaging was pretty nice. It was all in a nice, reusable tote-type bag. On top was a box of utensils, napkins, and plates. And nothing I ordered spilled or leaked or anything.

I ordered two platters - one salad and one quesadilla (mix of some steak and some cheese). Honestly, the quesadillas weren't much to write home about. Good, but nothing different or standout about them - just average. The guacamole that came with them, though, was above average. The salad, while just a salad, was quite tasty. There was plenty of cheese, which I appreciated, and the dressing was deliciously spicy. 

So good service and good food, but nothing that really pushed me to think of it as more than a-ok. However, I do now intend to go back and try out some of their tacos and other items. And probably get some more of that salad dressing.
