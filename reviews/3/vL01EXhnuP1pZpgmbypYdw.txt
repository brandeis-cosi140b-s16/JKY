I like eating pink taco. There I said it.....WHEW I feel liberated. Especially since I just got out of a scissor fight. 
Mexican food is supposed to be filling and inexpensive. WTF.....CHEESE and BEAN dip. 6 bucks....Uh yea... NOOOOOOO!
What actually made me laugh is the Mexican Turkey chopped salad. Mexico has TURKEYS???? The food here is not bad. It's good for what it is. But There's always too many people - For what it is - like non authentic attempt to mexican food. It's not bad. It's definitely over priced. The service was average. The food to me other than the mexican turkey....How...wha? I dunno  - there's nothing special. So plus 1 for average. plus 1 for name....plus 1 for fun.
