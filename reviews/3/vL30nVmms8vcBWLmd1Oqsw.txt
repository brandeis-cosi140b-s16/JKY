I've been to this place more than a few times and I'm surprised I haven't reviewed it yet! Mainly I come here for metal shows and beer, not so much the food lately but this review is not about that! We were in the area Saturday night on my Bday and wanted to stop in for a round and some music! 

The music tonight was eh, so we mainly chilled out front. You can dine outside as well which is cool. The buckets of beer are priced reasonably, $13 I believe for Dos Equis Amber. 

We didn't spend much time here after we finished a couple buckets. Overall, it's in a nice location near campus and the strip. The staff is friendly with a HUGE selection of beer and tequila.
