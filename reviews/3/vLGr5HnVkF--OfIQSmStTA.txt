The food was OK, it's an interesting fusion.  My favorite was the doughnut looking thing with pork and condensed sweet milk. An investment should be made on cushions for the long tables,  a bit uncomfortable for eating. The server was nice. However never got a refill on my drink and my food was the last plate to come out.
