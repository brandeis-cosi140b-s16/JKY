This lil Mexican food Resturant was great. The salsa was really awesome. I had the hot one. Loved the flavor. Enchiladas with the RED sauce was great. Andrew,  our waiter was spot on with everything. Never had to ask for a refill on anything. Next time I'm n casa grande, I will definitely come back.
