Was turned onto this place by a friend. When you walk in, you get this Truck Stop, dirty, dingy type of a feel. This has never scared me because most of the times, these places have the best food! (Check out Polaris Cafe behind the Rio All-Suites Hotel and Casino! Best breakfast!)

Sat down and everything appears to be a tad old and run down. But, the service was pretty decent. You could tell these people aren't corporate, and I don't mind that at all. 

I ordered the veggie burrito, wet (with enchilada sauce) and half with hot sauce and the other half with regular. I like my food hot and this was HOT!!! At first I thought I wasn't going to be able to handle, but then I adapted. LIke I said, I like my food HOT!!

The burrito tasted as if it were prepared by someone who knows Mexican food, and not by someone trained to cook and emulate it. My overall experience was that even thought it aint the prettiest or cleanest place, the food more than makes up for it. I say at least give it a shot and judge for yourself. Will I eat here again? As Dave Hester would say..."YUUUP!"
