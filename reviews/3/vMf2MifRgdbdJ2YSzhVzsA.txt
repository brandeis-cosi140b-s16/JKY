I was sad and disappointed to see that Gecko Grill closed!  I was out with my friend and we were both craving fish tacos and Gecko Grill immediately came to mind.  We show up and all the signage is turned off and it looks emptied... sad.

Well, just so you know what you were missing.. I'll share.
The only thing I ever ordered from here was their salmon, fish, and shrimp tacos.  They were wildly inventive!  Besides being cooked well, they had this yummy fruit salsa (mangos, pineapple, cilantro, onions, etc) that varied on each seafood taco, but was always so complimentary.  I have not been able to find salmon, fish, or shrimp tacos with a fruit salsa THAT good... that is a huge bummer to me.

I went once with some other folks and, unfortunately, it seems their tacos were the only good thing.  My husband had some carne asada tacos and sides and found everything on his plate was sub-par and so did my cousin... so, that's where you get 3 stars.. plus the place inside was kinda creepy pink.... it was a very un-appetizing color.
