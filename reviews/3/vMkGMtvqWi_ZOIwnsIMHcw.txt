The shrimp ceviche is fantastic and it was a delight to taste homemade red & green chile sauces on the enchiladas. I've never been to a mainly seafood Mexican restaurant before, so it's hard to compare to others, but I've had the typical seafood dishes at Mexican chains (Arribas, Macayos, etc.) and this is way better. Atmosphere has authentic charm, but the bathrooms could use improvement. Unfortunately during my first visit, they mixed up a sauce request and forgot to bring out a burrito for my son.  We had more than enough food so it wasn't a concern. The price is decent - $45 for a family of four. Overall, I would come back if craving fresh seafood. I would recommend giving the place a try!
