Roberto's is my greasy fast food Mexican spot of choice in the area, but every once in a while I have a hankering for something different and that's when Felipito's comes in handy. Their food is ok, nothing spectacular but they have some different options like churros and other desserts to tempt the tastebuds. They have all the typical Mexican fare and it's all greasy and pretty tasty. I usually end up with a breakfast burrito or rolled tacos, which were a little crunchier than I would like but I enjoy their salsas quite a bit. 

They have a drive thru which is the main attraction for me. It's attached to a gas station and 7-11, which also makes for a convenient spot to pick up grub while running other errands or picking other snacks we might need.
