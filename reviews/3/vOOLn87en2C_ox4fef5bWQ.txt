Great, greasy Mexican food. I always enjoy their two taco lunch meal with rice & beans. The ground beef is very flavorful (although a bit greasy at times), and I enjoy their salsa -- it isn't chunky but it has a kick to it.  

And, perhaps, what may make El Capitolio most intriguing is its close proximity to the Capitol and state offices. If you are a bit of a politico like me, it is a great place to politician-watch.  You may be just minding your own business, enjoying a taco, when low and behold several politicians, big named lobbyists or state agency heads pull into a booth behind you.  Tuneup your ears and you may just get some good gossip. 

So, with a yummy taco in hand, and your eyes & ears open, you may just find yourself having a great meal and a possible "You won't believe what I hear" moment all in matter of a one-hour lunch.
