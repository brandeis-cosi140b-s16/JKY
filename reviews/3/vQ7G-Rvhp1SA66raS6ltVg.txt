Since I work in the area, I have passed by this restaurant on quite a few occasions. I finally got the chance to try it out since my coworker was craving a bean burrito for lunch. 

I opted for the three taco lunch special which comes with three tacos of your choice and a soda. They have hard and soft shell options. I chose the hard shell chicken taco and two soft with carne asada and carnitas, just to get a little sampling of a few options. My dining partner ordered the burrito special with chicken. The chicken and carne asada were pretty good, I was a little disappointed by the carnitas. All the tacos could have used a little more flavoring as they seemed a little on the blander side, but there is potential. I added some of the salsas they offer at their salsa bar, which only consists of three varieties (medium, hot and verde) and that helped. My coworker said her burrito was just ok. She had hoped it would be a little on the cheesier side. 

Overall, I had a pleasant meal and I look forward to giving this little shop another chance soon since their prices seem pretty reasonable and they have a relatively extensive menu.
