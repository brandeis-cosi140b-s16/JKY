I had really high hopes for this place. The menu looked very good. However I must admit charging for chips and salsa is such a no-no. I have never been to a Mexican restaurant that charges for chips and salsa!!! This would be the first of many complaints for the meal. Bryan ordered a beer I ordered my standard water. For our app we ordered pazole to share and they were out on it so we went with the xochitl soup. It was ok. Nothing spectacular. Then we waited for food and drinks. I asked if they had horchata and they do!! It was ok. It had a weird aftertaste though.  I ordered the Chiles Tehuacan which was sweeter then I thought it was going to be but not to bad. The rice was a bit Under cooked as well.  Bryan got fajitas and he liked the fresh tortillas. The staff here just seamed like they had no idea what they were doing. It took forever for drinks and food and for empty plates to be taken away. It was just bad. For dessert we had fried ice cream which was actually the stand out for me. It was perfect. Also the prices were really high. When it was time to pay the check our waiter charged Bryans card to someone else's bill. We noticed it and he fixes it but service just seamed a mess. Alas I was let down. I won't be returning. The prices are to high the service was unorganized and the food was just average.
