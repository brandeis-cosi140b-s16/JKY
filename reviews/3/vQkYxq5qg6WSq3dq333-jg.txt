Sigh. I would not call this Mexican food, more like American style Latin food.

Now that we got that outta the way, the tacos were so-so. The set up is kinda like an assemby line. You tell them which meat and toppings you want and they prepare it right in front of you. I've had tacos prepared this way before and the meat is never hot. I got the taco basket which includes tortilla chips. The chips and lemonade were the best part of the meal.
