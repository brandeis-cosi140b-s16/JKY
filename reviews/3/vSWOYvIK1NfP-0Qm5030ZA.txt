Tacos with onions and cilantro, yes please. I haven't tried the chorizo or papas con chorizo but I'm glad it's an option. 

The Bistec ala Mexicana is thinly cut steak sauteed with onions, tomatoes and pickled jalape√±os - the tastiest thing we ordered. For the Tostadas, the chicken is better seasoned than the steak, and they come piled high with toppings such as thinly sliced avocado. The horchata is sweet and cinnamony with no chalky after taste. A+. They offer a variety of Mexican beers by the bottle including Dos Equis, Sol, Tecate....

I'm guessing the priciness of a divey place like this has more to do with its State Street location than anything else. Prepare to pay anywhere from 10-20% more than similar establishments elsewhere. Would I take my friends from Mexico to eat here? No. Would I come back myself? Yes.
