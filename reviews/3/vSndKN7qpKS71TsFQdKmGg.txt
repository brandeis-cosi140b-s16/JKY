Let me start by saying Macayo's knows how to make a Chimichanga! 
It's the only thing I get there and they are delicious! The atmosphere is wonderfully bright and open,and the staff is friendly. 
The Ahwatukee location is where we usually go because it is convenient to our home.
I don't like when a host sits everyone together in a section when there is a whole restaurant with open tables. If you don't have enough servers to cover the whole restaurant, then hire some. 
The other thing that was a total turnoff was the amount of Flys buzzing around. We spent the whole meal swatting at a few annoying pests. 
I don't know if they might need to move the dumpsters or keep doors closed, but something needs to be done. 
I hope the next time we decide to go back this will be taken care of.
