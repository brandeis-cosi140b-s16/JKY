This was the only place open when I arrived in Charlotte late that night.  I was thankful just to find something after walking around the area for a while since I wasn't given a car... 

The experience is similar to a Chipolte, if you're not from the area. They did have tofu and other options you don't normally see in chain of this nature. The food was ok. I was amused by the fact they had Southern (sweet) tea and Northern (non-sweetened) tea. I guess the war between north and south continues! 

They gave me a huge bag of chips with my meal.  It may have been because they were closing but I never did finish it all off. In fact, I think most of them ended up being thrown out. 

Overall, if you're looking for something that can be relatively healthy and vegetarian and nothing else is open, check this place out.
