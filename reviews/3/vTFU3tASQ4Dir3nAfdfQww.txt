riddle me this? how does a mexican chicken shop have english speaking workers & right next door at jack-in-the-box no one can understand a word. the service is fast & friendly. very helpful & thorough. the atmosphere was nice-outdoor seating available.very clean. the food is good, a refreshing change from all the fried stuff. an unusual flavor of lime & smoke but good. a little pricey. but lots of coupons available. 
if you haven't tried it i would recommend it especially if you've had enough of the wannabe "fried" chicken places
