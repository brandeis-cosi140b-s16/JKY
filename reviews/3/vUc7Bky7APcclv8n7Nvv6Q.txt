Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the food here. The ambiance is very cute, shabby chic, and modern. Very small but I enjoyed all that. The drink and  food prices were ok. Average I'd say.  The food was just a bit bland. My husband and I tried 4 of their tacos. 2 different pork tacos, one had potato in it and that one was the most flavorful one we had. One was a "New York steak" taco with very little flavor. And lastly the Baja shrimp taco... No flavor. However, I did like the way the shrimp was cooked and the size of the fillings that come in the tacos . The rice and beans were pretty tasty. The cup of creamed corn was the best thing we all had. Our friends got the sample of salsas. They were fun but also lacking flavor. Service and staff were nice. Restaurant and restrooms were clean and cute. I guess this is just not my type of Mexican food. I would give it a try and see for yourself. But as for me, I won't be back for the tacos. Maybe just a drink at their cute bar and a cup of cream corn.
