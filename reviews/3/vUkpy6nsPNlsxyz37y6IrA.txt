Decent spot. Not like the taco shops in SoCal. Price is decent. Crunchy tacos are good. The California burrito lacks flavor. The hot sauce is not flavorful either and is only mildly spicey. The service is always good. The restaurant is fairly clean which is a huge plus. Best part about it is that it's open 24/7
