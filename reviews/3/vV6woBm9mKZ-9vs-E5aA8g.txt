Super clean. Friendly service. 
If you're looking for all that faux Mexican ambiance, look elsewhere. This is
a taco stand,  cheap tables and chairs. I didn't come for atmosphere, I came 
to eat.
My chorizo & egg breakfast was flavorful. Rice had good texture and flavor. Beans
were delicious as well. My breakfast companion had hard shell chicken tacos, and
she thought they were extremely tasty.
Good (and cheap) food, clean tables. I will definitely be back.
