I actually like this place, but today my experience was not good... why?
well I can't believe the price of their "bean and cheese" is actually more than a beef one? ... on top the beans they added was probably equivalent to a scoop.. mostly toritlla.. what a rip off!  Once again, I do enjoy their food but I better find me a more reasonably priced place.. or one that actually serves what you pay for..
