Just like everyone else says, it's similar to Chipotle.  I like Chipotle better though.  It was very quick to get our food, eat and head back to work.  I had lunch over 2 hours ago and still smell like the restaurant so I'm not a fan of that aspect.  It was decent for my first time coming here but I'm not sure I will be become a regular.
