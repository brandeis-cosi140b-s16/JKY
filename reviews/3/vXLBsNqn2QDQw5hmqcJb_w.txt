Quality of this fast food is better than most.  Tortilla used for the burrito was delightfully soft and a bit flour-y, and the frijoles con queso inside were tasty.  Prices not bad.  Salsa bar could use some improvement.  Seating is decent inside, but parking is bad so just give up and park in the grocery store lot nearby.
