Russ brought home burritos from the 'bertos, and I noticed for the first time.... The food is very, very .....average. It's decent Mexican food, especially if your on a budget. Although I have eaten Filiberto's many times before, I have never really craved Filiberto's, or taken a bite of their food and thought...wow! But, I have never had a bad experience with the food and my vegetarian orders always come out right. I love the horchata!
