They heat their chips. This always starts me off in a good mood at a Mexican restaurant, as well as a good margarita when I feel like drinking.
Their salsa tasted like it was out of a jar or made with ingredients that came out of a jar and had some fresh cilantro in it to freshen it up. Not the best, but certainly not the worst.
Their margaritas were very good and on special when we went.
I ordered the chili rellano, beef taco and cheese enchilada. 
The rellano tasted like it had been frozen. We asked the server and he said fresh, but mu taste buds disagreed. The taco was just OK. Beef was seasoned and reminded me of a generic Taco Bell hard shell taco.The enchilada was good. 

I would go back only if my friends who brought me here wanted to go again.
