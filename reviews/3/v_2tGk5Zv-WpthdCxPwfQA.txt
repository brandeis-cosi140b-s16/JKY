Don't go to Dos for authentic Mexican food or stellar service, you'll be disappointed.  Go to Dos for a fun atmosphere, good Happy hour and cheap "bar" food... then you'll be pleased!  Dos usually hits the spot after a hot day at the baseball game or for a first stop before a night out on the town.  It has all the essentials, food, ATM, toilets and a huge selection of booze!
