I ate here a couple weeks ago and it was about a 45 min.-1 hour wait.  I had the enchiladas and they were really good. What I got upset about is the waitress forgot to put our food in. She also did not check to see if we need another drink or refill on our drinks. My husband had a beer and was not asked once if he needed another one and she was no where to be found. They could have made more money on the beers. Once she remembered our existence she did apologize and was nice but how the hell can you forget about my meal. They seriously should have offered it to us for waiting a very long time while everyone else was getting served. I had to wave her down for her to check on our food.  Oh... The person serving us water was the best part of our experience because he made sure our water was always topped.  Very frustrating on how we were not compensated and we still tipped (not sure why).

I will however try it again in hopes of better customer service and will write another updated review. It may take me a while considering......  That's too bad because I eat a lot of mexican food and they are right down the street from me.
