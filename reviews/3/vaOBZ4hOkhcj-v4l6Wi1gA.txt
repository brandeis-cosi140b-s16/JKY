Within a stones throw of the beautiful WI capitol building this place is where I had my first margarita ever.  I really hope there is more to them than salt and tequila taste....

The food was average mexican fare, drinks were ok, staff was really cool and the pictures of Frida Kahlo made me go into the bathroom every 5 minutes to make sure I didn't have a uni brow also...

If you are in town and want to pick up some college girls go here because unless it was some anomaly it seemed like every table was filled with young ladies.  And either I am getting really old or young girls are looking much younger than when I was that age.

Nice place, I'd go again.
