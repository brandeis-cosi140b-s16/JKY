This place is good, but not THAT good.
I feel like finding great Mexican food places came so much easier in Southern California. Like a few others stated, it's a little pricey. For $18, I got two carne asada tacos and a shrimp tostada, with avocados and sour cream. Again, they were good. Just not OMG-this-is-phenomenal-over-the-top good (like say a Taco Mesa or Caliente in Costa Mesa, or Pinches Tacos in L.A.).  I feel like the yelpers here have overrated this place. I would have been ok if the tab came out to around $12; $18 is a little over the top for what it was. I think I could cook up something comparable in my own kitchen.
