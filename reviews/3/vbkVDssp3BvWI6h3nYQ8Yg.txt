Dear A.T.S.

I am one of your customers. So much in fact that your employees know my name. And so it is with love that I share these things with you:
 
* Your food is good but overpriced...there I said it. Times are hard, we know your making a bundle, why should a burrito and coke cost me $10?
* Your margaritas suck...too sweet and carbonated!
* Your happy hour tacos are puny
* Quit advertising 'al pastor' anything...btw they gave me the runs (true story).
* This white girl loves Mana but you guys are over doing it...spice up your music selection!

All in all decent place but feel like your being cheap on us. That's a quick way to lose business.

Yours truly
