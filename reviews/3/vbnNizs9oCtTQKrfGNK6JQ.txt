Whoa Daddy, my favorite Fili-B's! Ok, so occasionally they screw up my order, and yes, it's drive through only unless you want to chance the park benches and chance, 
1. Getting stormed by homeless folk. 
2. Getting stormed by lost hipsters on their way to Pita Jungle. 
3. Getting stormed by Catholics protesting Planned Parenthood. 
4. Getting stormed by embarrassed youngsters looking for Planned Parenthood while cloak and daggering the Catholics. 
5. Getting stormed by pot heads looking for the smoke shop. 
6. Getting stormed by seedy people looking for the sex shop. 
so stay in your car, take it home or to a park and enjoy. The location is not desirable, and they don't always nail your order, but come on, it's Fili-B's! When they get it right, it is SOOOO freaking right.
