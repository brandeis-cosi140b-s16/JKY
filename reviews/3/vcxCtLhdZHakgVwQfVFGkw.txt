Enjoyed Cozymel's.

This a great spot off the strip, and we really do enjoy the restaurant. The service is consistent, friendly and quick.

The food is very good, and fresh. The salads are crisp and crunchy and  the guacamole served tableside is delicious.

I love having an option that I know I can count on off the strip where parking isn't an issue and it satisfies the craving for Mexican food.
