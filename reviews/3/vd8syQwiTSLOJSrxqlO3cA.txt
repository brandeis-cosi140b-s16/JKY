Found this place doing a random search of restaurants in the area on my way back from Phoenix. Knowing I can never pass up the opportunity to try new places to eat; I was all in.

Place was easy to locate with my GPS guiding the way lol. Upon entering the the establishment the interior looked a little old and worn, but the smell was definitely enticing with various meals radiating throughout the place.  The seating was area's were a little small and cramped (bigger tables would have been nice).  Our waitress and staff were very pleasant, but seemed overly busy.

We started with the standard chips and salsa which were simple and nothing spectacularly different than most I have had.  I decided to ask the waitress what she would recommend and she politely responded with the "quesadilla with works," but suggested the sauce on the side.  (Well done cause this made the difference)

Our food was out very quickly which was impressive considering how busy they were.  My quesadilla was huge and very tasty with perfectly shredded beef.  Again very good job to the waitress for suggesting sauce on the side as this would have made it very soggy and un pleasant to eat.

All in all a pleasant experience  but nothing spectacular.  Some small improvements in the overall experience would push this to four stars, but I will be giving it three. If you ever find yourself in Wickenburg, Az and are craving some food, give this place a try.
