Hey it's Taco Bell - what do you want?  I'm giving this three stars because it's A-Ok which is Yelp's rating system.

If you haven't been to a Taco Bell before then I don't know what to tell you - it's cheap imitation Mexican food with questionable quality ingredients.  It's not like you're going to take the pope here for a visit though, you're just getting some food.

The staff at this location are helpful and pleasant, and that's really all I ask for.  I don't come here often, but it's true to the Taco Bell brand.
