It was a pretty basic, average Mexican bistro. It is good for a large group, we were well accommodate for a party of 10. The fajitas were great. Unfortunately, the waitress began by selling us a 'special sale' pitcher of margaritas that was completely watered or juiced down. It had very little tequila in it, which is obvious in a margarita on the rocks. That was pretty dissappointing.. The food was fine.....Guac was good...Other then that pretty average.
