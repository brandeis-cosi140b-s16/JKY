This place is a pretty good concept. It's a lot like Chipotle or Zabas... However, they give it a Hawaiian spin.

The location isn't in the greatest of neighborhoods, but there are. 2 more locations you can visit.

You order the type of rice, beans, meat and salsa you like. They have Tacos, burritos, and bowls. 

The price was very reasonable. Service was fantastic. The only thing I'd complain about, is that the bathroom was kinda dirty.

I would recommend giving it a try, and judge for yourself.
