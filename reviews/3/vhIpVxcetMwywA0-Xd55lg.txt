From enjoying numerous Mexican restaurants in Denver, I'm always on the look out for some good authentic Mexican food (or at least knock-off Mexican food). I remember the meal saying 'jumbo' burrito but feeling hungry when I finished. I had shredded pork in the burrito, that was a good eat. But the price seemed a little high for the quantity I received (not to say it's expensive though).

From the way my friend talked about the place, I didn't expect it to be as small as it was. Granted, it wasn't very busy at the time of our visit; but I'd hate to go when they were. I did see some large beer vessels sitting at a few tables, great for a large group.

I was also given some grief from my friend for not ordering tacos from a 'taco shop'. In can't help it if I enjoy other meals outside of a taco - I would have definitely been left hungry if I chose that limited option, after seeing his plate.

I think this place is more ideal to get a few beers with drinks and enjoy a light meal. I don't see the allure in Fuzzy's, but I'm sure I'll be back again - it seems to be popular with some of my friends.

Also - where can I find a Mexican place that serves Chimichangas in Madison??
