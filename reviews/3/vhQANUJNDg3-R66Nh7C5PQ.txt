Picante doesn't stand out from the crowd of chain Mexican-American grab-and-go spots. They are decently priced $5-7 and have a good location without much competition on West blvd.

Let me start out with the positives.... 3 tortilla options (spinach, brown, white) and they offer brown rice in addition to white, very filling (big portion), fairly healthy, and fast. The veggies here looked nicer than other chain places.

On to the dislikes... $1.60 extra to put Guacamole on your burrito ...what?! To be fair they were nice enough to put a little scoop on me for free because management saw me say noooo thank you. Also, I couldn't taste the herbs in the chicken and my rice was a bit tough (even for brown) as I was served the last scoop in the container. The food wasn't terrible but it wasn't really good either. My hope is that they will put a little zing into the food to separate it from the competition. 

I am a Guac-fanatic so unfortunately the extra charge will send me straight back to Salsaritas next time I want that type of lunch.
