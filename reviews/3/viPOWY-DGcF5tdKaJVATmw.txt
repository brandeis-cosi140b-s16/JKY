First come first serve. Only sit down restaurant in the Delta terminal. Service is fast but supply can run low on staple items such as olives/olive juice for a martini.  Food is standard, still better than the cold sandwiches you can get from the refrigerated cart occupying the terminal hallway.  Nice way to kill time waiting for your flight and especially if you're still craving some mexican good while here in the south.
