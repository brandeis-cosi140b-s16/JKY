Hits:  ambience, live music and food. Corn chowder and chicken street tacos were delicious.  So was the Dos Equis beer. 

Misses: rushed service (plates cleared when one diner was still eating), had to ask for basics like hot sauce and guacamole, and the bill was presented to us without us being asked if we wanted coffee or dessert.  Also, some employees (managers?) were dressed in (nice) street clothes so it was difficult to ask for service not knowing if the person we were asking was an employee or a fellow diner walking by.
