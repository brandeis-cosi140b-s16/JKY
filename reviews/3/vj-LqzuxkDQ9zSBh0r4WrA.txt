Food is great and very authentic. Prices are very reasonable for the quality and amount you get. The red salsa is always empty when I'm there and usually have to ask for some. The carne Asada Burritos are awesome.
My only issue is the place is a little on the dirty side. The soda station area is always dusty. I have gone there 3 days in a row to find the same X I made in the dust on top of the soda dispenser. The people there when not busy just sit behind the counter and should be cleaning when store is slow. Just my opinion. but compared to Mexico im sure this is spotless. If you go there just order and eat but don`t look.
Hope it gets cleaner
