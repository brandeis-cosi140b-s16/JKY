Mediocre, disappointed. Live music was too loud in that small space, couldn't speak to each other! Charged too much - charged for wine that we didn't get, after discussion it was removed from the bill...expensive extras like sour cream $1.50 guacamole. Not attentive staff. Too many kids working, they congregated at the post next to the door. Overall, overpriced.
