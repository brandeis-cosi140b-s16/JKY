They are fabulous when you order the margaritas either full price that is less than $5.00 or happy hour that seems almost free.
The food and service varies just like any other Sonoran Mexican place,when we were here this weekend Emanuel gave use truly spectacular service unlike any service we had here before.

I always order the Chicken Fajita salad and every time it is slightly different but always decent I had it at least four times.

We go here instead of a chain place it is much better than chains even on a bad day so far.
