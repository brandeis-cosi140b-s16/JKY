The perks of this hole in the wall taco shop include the fact that it's got the typical rundown look of legit taco shops in SoCal. You know, the kind of nondescript building that indicates a shop thats not about the ambience but the quick, hearty and greasy food. The drive through and 24 hour operation add the ultimate perk of convenience. As for the food, it definitely does it's job as quick, hearty and ridiculously greasy. We tried the California burrito and carne aside fries - staples of a SoCal native - and they were simply decent....doing the job but not quite hitting the spot, you know? We figured that we may have to try other items to see if their specialty lies elsewhere but I can assure you that when we do it will be because the place is conveniently located and readily available at one in the morning.
