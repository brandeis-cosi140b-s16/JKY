First off, this place is busy every time we come for dinner, so they must be doing something right. The Pollo Fundido is the reason you come to Some Burros. So good. Probably not good for you due to deep frying the whole thing, but it is delicious.

I can't vouch for how fresh the food is--our meal came out as soon as we sat down, which is nice, but they must have some of the food prepared ahead of time.  Not entirely sure of their operation in the kitchen, they may cook everything fresh, but just something I noticed on this visit. And the salsa is nothing to brag about--bland and tasteless.

My wife and I usually split the Fundido and they actually split the meal for us unlike other places where they just give out an extra plate.  Not the most authentic Mexican food I've had--overall, it's just okay.
