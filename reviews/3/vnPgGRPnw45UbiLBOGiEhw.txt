Dos Gringos is a hit in the nightlife-starved Mesa. The scene is a lot different than the one you'll find in Tempe or Scottsdale however, but the bar is packed most nights of the week.

The large bar features umbrella-covered tables, two floors and a menu with items such as burros, enchiladas and sandwiches. 

You'll find more of an older crowd typically and lots of families. When the bar first opened, I couldn't get past the amount of kids running around a bar at 9 p.m. Thankfully this didn't last much later than 9:30.
