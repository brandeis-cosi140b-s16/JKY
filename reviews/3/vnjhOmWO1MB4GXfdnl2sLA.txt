It was not very busy when we first arrived around 7pm but it slowly picked up over the course of our meal. The ambiance of the place is pretty cool and if it were in a better location it would make for a nice hang out/bar spot.

We were seated promptly and order chips with salsa and guacamole which came out very quickly. I had the short rib and pork taco. The pork was ok and the short rib was better. My girlfriend had a fish taco and veggie taco. She was happy with the fish, not the best she ever had but good. The veggie was a raw taco with kale and butternut squash. It might have been better if it were saut√©ed. 

The parking lot is kind of strange. It is one way that leads to a dead end. When you leave you have to back out and drive the wrong way.
