I really only go to Los Favs for one of two things:

Bacon Breakfast Burritos.
Chili Verde Burritos.

Both are better than the same product that is offered by other Mexican places in the immediate area.  

I like their red and green sauces.  The chips that they serve are perfect for my taste.

Their hours are very convenient for most people, since they open early and close late.

The staff there has always been friendly towards me.  As long as they do their job, that's all I ask for.
