The food is fantastic and I love the layout of the large space Frida inhabits. Watched most of the World Cup games there this summer, and was pleased enough with the quality and speed of the bar service I recommended the place to fellow World Cup spectators, which increased my posse threefold by the finals. When we showed up for the France/Italy championship match, we were greeted at the door by a friendly hostess who was instantly interrupted by a man who reminded her loudly that all customers that day were required to order food. Between the time we walked in the door and our butts hit the barstools we heard this same man make the very same announcement to different staff members at least four times.
Now, there are several problems I have with this: 1) you set up a temporary yet strict policy and want it enforced, you train your employees beforehand --not belligerently, and certainly not in front of customers. 2) Our group would have ended up spending twice as much money than we did if we hadn't been required to order food, since most of us had eaten already and were too full afterward to order the original barrage of margaritas we had hoped for. 3) The restaurant clearly wasn't prepared for the large task of making food for EVERYONE in there, as the service was excruciatingly slow, wrong meals were delivered, and the sound of falling trays and dishes was only barely punctuated by the bossman shouting insults to his staff. The experience was horrible. And the owner was the person responsible! Amazing.
Go there for the food, go there for the friendly service and tip your servers well. But I personally avoid the place like the plague if the bossman is around.
