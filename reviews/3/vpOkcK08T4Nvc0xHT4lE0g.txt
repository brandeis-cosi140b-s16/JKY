Totally agree with the rest of the reviewers about this being the usual greasy, meat-heavy Mexican restaurant with no frills, but soul-satisfying stomach-filling food. If you're on a diet or if you're the lettuce-eating, fat-free-everything types, you'd do best to steer clear of Poliberto's--everything is unabashedly huge and dripping in lard here. I wanted to get the three tacos combo, but since I'm a recent beef-eater, I couldn't stomach the description of tongue and beef head being included in the tacos. Though I figure it must be tasty :P

Anyway, I got the chicken taco and the carne asada taco and got plenty of lemon wedges and salsa. The tacos were huge. The asada was more delicious than the chicken. The chicken came topped with lettuce and shredded cheese and had a hard shell, which I was definitely not expecting, and didn't like. Other than that...Ok to eat at when you're hungry and want to save a buck.
