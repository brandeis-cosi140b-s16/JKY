Food is great. BUT DON'T BOTHER ORDERING ON THEIR APP!!!!! We arrive 5 min after the pickup time & they had no clue we ordered online. Not much of an apology given, just an uuhhh we didn't see it & we end up waiting 20 min. there was hardly anyone in line either & when we finally got the food, we get it with a huff. Not polite and inefficient. Train your employees please & a little more courtesy would be fine.
