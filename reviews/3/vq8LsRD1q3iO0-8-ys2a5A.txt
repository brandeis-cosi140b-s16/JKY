I spotted the cool big rust colored metal sun on the side of the building & suggested trying this place instead of driving to Rolberto's on 7th St & Camelback.

I'm trying not to judge this place too harshly since the happy hour prices are pretty darn good & the people are super friendly. I want to go back & try more things on their menu with different sauces & styles.

Free chips but you don't get that many at a time. They're a little greasy, but still good. I love chunky salsa & there isn't any. They have 2 different kinds that come in bottles. The more brownish 1 had a smokey almost chipotle flavor. It was actually really good.

My meal: Chicken chimi. No melted cheese on top, came on the side. No pico de gallo, costs $1.50 extra. Majorly unhappy about that. If it came automatically I'd really like this place. Meat was a little bland.

Friend's meal: Chicken chimi recommended by Jose enchilada style w/ green sauce which was an extra $1-1.50. The chimi needed the sauce to not be as bland. It did taste really good this way. Beans & rice is an extra $2. Refried beans were good. They weren't salty & were very cheesy.

My happy hour $3.50 house margarita came in a margarita glass! What's with places not using margarita glasses?! It could have used more salt. At least they didn't water it down or skimp on alcohol. I wasn't carded. I'm over 21 & was the only 1 drinking but my friend is not 21 yet. He was driving but they probably would have served him.

I like the decor. They have a room or 2 off the main 1 for overflow or big crowds. The restroom wasn't necessarily dirty, but it was pretty run down. The mirror in there is way too nice for the restroom. It's funny.

We also had 2 soft drinks. The bill was almost $30 total.
