I never thought I'd be reviewing many chain restaurants, but this warrants a review.  

I've always been pretty happy with Chipotle; you know what you're getting. Granted, the ones in CO give you a free drink with a student ID, and they don't seem to do that in NY, PA or AZ, but the food is always pretty much the same, the cashiers run smoothly, and the lines move quickly.

Here? Not so much. We waiting almost 25 minutes standing in line this Sunday, and got maybe half of the food I'm used to getting (I'm a vegetarian; a teaspoon of beans isn't going to give me much protein).  my partners food was the same way, and up and down the line we heard people asking "um, could you give a little more please" or "I'd like a bit more than that, thanks."  Same price, less food = sad Shanna. I'm hoping this was a one time thing....I love their salad and their soft tacos, but it's not worth a line that long.
