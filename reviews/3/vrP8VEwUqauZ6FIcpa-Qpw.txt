It's a Taco Bell... How much different could it be from every other Taco Bell out there???

Everything was pretty good here. Average. Nothing to rave about. My nachos bell grande actually had enough of everything on them without making my chips soggy. Especially enough cheese! 

The guy taking our orders was having none of my humor :( 

There are NO mirrors in the bathroom! Wtf is this nonsense? Also, the big wooden stall doors tend to slam. *BAM!* yikes! *jump* *cringe*

I know the water comes out of the same nozzle as a soda, but it came out brownish. I know this because I set my little clear water cup down on the sink. I really really hope that was just soda residue.
