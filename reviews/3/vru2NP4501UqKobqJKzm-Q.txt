Breakfast was good here with an enormous breakfast burrito made from a nice tortilla that seems homemade.  Pancakes were alright, but certainly a generous portion for the price.  Service was great.  Plenty of smiles, not so much English, but that's fine for me in a place like this.  Warm atmosphere inside with rather ordinary seating, and the focus is clearly on the food.  Don't be scared by the outside appearance.
