It is a hole in the wall Mexican fast food eatery. I've never made the choice to eat there while sober. When I'm choosing off of the menu I try to play it safe and order something easy to make that doesn't spoil quickly. It is dirty and the service is sub-par; however, this restaurant is not trying to make itself out to be anything more than it is.
