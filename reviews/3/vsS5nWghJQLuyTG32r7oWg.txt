The food here was really good and the servers were great.  Not sure I would go back as it is the most expensive food I have had in Phoenix.  $15 burritos is completely insane for what most places charge.  $3.50 chocolate milk for my daughter was also a little outrageous.   It's a shame because the food was good overall.
