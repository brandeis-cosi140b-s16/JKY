This is my second time eating at this Chipotle. The food is good, service is ok, but their portions on the meat or Sofritas aren't that great. My daughter got chicken and they gave her about half of the normal size portion. When we asked how much it was to get double meat they said $3.65!! Seems like a lot doesn't it. When she asked if she could just have some more meat they gave her one more tiny cube of chicken. So, this location is about average, there's better one's in town.
