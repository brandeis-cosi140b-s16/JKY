China Poblano is a very interesting looking restaurant located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel/Casino on the Strip. When you enter the restaurant the first thing you see are two open kitchens. One side is Asian with Asian workers and the other side is Mexican with Mexican Workers. 

The food is mostly served tapas style.

I started out with a fish taco. It cost over $6.00 and was slightly bigger than a street taco. The taco seemed very freshly made but.......the fish taco was too acidic for my taste and sort of flat tasting. This taco was made with a very fresh tasting but very thin corn tortilla that got soggy and fell apart.  It wasn't bad just not yummy. 

I sort of fell for the hype about the 20 vegetable fried rice. This dish was featured on Food Network TV's Show, "The Best Thing I Ever Ate." The fried rice looked beautiful and had butterfly shaped carrot slices and a couple fancy baby vegetables but if you closed your eyes when you ate it the fried rice tasted the same as from any cheap Chinese take out place.

Service was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is cool and interesting.
