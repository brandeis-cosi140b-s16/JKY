The correct name of this business is "Salsarita's Express," (see the attached pic).

Salsarita's Express is located in the Atrium area of Charlotte Douglas International Airport - almost a food court feel to the area.

We stopped in here for a quick bite during a layover. I ordered the grilled chicken salad - with corn, red onions, black beans, and jalape√±os. Probably one of the healthier dinner options available compared to all of the fast food. Overall, a fair salad - nothing about it would make you say "Wow." But it was filling.

Of course you can get more traditional psuedo Mex fare here as well: Burritos, Tacos, and such.
