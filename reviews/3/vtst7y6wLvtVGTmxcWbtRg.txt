I am torn about this place, I enjoy the bar and patio during game time and just hanging out with friends.  The place is always busy so these reviews dont hurt them much.  Sad to say but the only thing I order here is chicken wings...yes they do have them and they are not on the menu.  I do not care for their Mexican food at all and even their salsa is not that great.  I wish it were better but it does not seem to hurt their business because they are always packed.  I recommend going to Camineros across the street if you need Mexican and then get plastered here.  Very casual, good size bar and patio, service is always very good and other than the food I actually kind of like this place.  Ha ha, sorry Top Shelf
