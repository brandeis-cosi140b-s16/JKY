Not bad.

Ordered the cheese enchilada dinner to go. The guy at the counter was very nice and helpful with the menu. My favorite Mexican dish is chilli rellenos but they were out so I ordered cheese enchiladas.

The food was good, not too greasy. The enchilada sauce had a nice heat to it. Beans and rice were definitely better than the typical Mexican joint. Will be back with my husband to try some more dishes.
