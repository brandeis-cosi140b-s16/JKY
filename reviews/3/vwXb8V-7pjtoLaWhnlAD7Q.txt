We went here for the first time on Tuesday night. It came highly recommended from my director so I was excited. We went around 5:30 so the place wasn't packed yet. We were seated immediately. I liked the chips & salsa but Nichole didn't. She thought it was bland & flavorless (she's the Mexican so she should know). She had the green chilli burrito while I ordered the chipotle shrimp. Nichole didn't like the burrito. She said it was like green chilli pork out the can (I liked it but then again, I'm black). My chipotle shrimp were pretty good. Jumbo shrimp cooked in chipotle sauce with rice & beans. I'll agree with Nichole here; the rice & beans needed salt & some love. I liked the food but will I drive from Chandler JUST to eat here? Probably not.
