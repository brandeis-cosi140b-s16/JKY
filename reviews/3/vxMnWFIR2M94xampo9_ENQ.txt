Been here quite a few times, mixed opinions each time. Chimichangas are really good, I enjoy their tacos as well, and decent enchiladas. However, two dishes I've had, Chile relleno and another that I forgot the name of, weren't too good. Service is okay most days, but I had a bad experience once where I went with a friend, we waited forever for our food (but we were eating chips and talking so we didn't really notice) until she came over and gave us the check and then we told her we didn't get our food yet. 

Bottom line: Mostly decent food and mediocre service. Pretty authentic stuff though. I'm sure I'll keep going
