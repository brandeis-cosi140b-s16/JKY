Holy moly. Ever go somewhere that could have been great, but the other clientele really sour the experience for you? 

Never having been to Cafe Rio, we didn't know that dinner hour would be quite the zoo it was. Since the place was busy, we decided to get our food to go. 

This is what I wish I would have known: (one) it's advisable to read the menu and make your choice while still at home. There is no big-print menu up high so that you can read it from way back in the line. There are two small menus available to peruse as you make your way through the line. The first is in an awkward spot and the second is half a step from the spot where the employees start asking you what you want. I say "start asking" because (two) it seems you'll be asked 3-4 times what you want/ordered. You have to remember. (Three) you don't really get the "choose your own ingredients" option here like you would at say, Chipotle. The item you order comes with certain stuff on it and the staff will ask you if you want that stuff. But that's it. Much more sit-down restaurant in that regard. (Four) Unless you're tall, you won't be able to see your food being made on the other side of the counter. 

(Five) There are some patrons of this location that think it's totally fine to have 7 kids under 6 and an infant through the line accompanied by a single adult (who is trying to order for his giant party, as 3 other adults sit, kidless, at a table). If that was you or someone you know, for the love of god, sit the kids at a freaking table while you order so they aren't running around, blocking the menu and stepping on other people's toes.

Anyway, we both got tacos; mine were mahi mahi and Boyfriend's were steak. Both came with rice & beans. Everything was good and I'd go back to try something different, but if it's as overrun with horror children the second time, I don't feel like I'll be losing anything if I never go back.
