This was a good pollo bowl, although I'm not happy they got rid of the make your own versions. Now, you just get the standard items, but at least the chicken is decent white meat chunks and the rice is usually cooked good. It is a pretty unremarkable item, but yet still a healthy and safe choice at this chain. Ask for less beans because they load that up  bowl with plenty of beans.
