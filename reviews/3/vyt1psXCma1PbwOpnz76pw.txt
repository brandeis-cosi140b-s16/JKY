Thank you chipotle for giving me a burrito the size of my small asian d...oughnut.

By normal food standards this place is a four star but by chipotle standards I give it  three stars. I ordered a steak burrito, now if you have ever been to chipotle you know that they load their burritos to the max to where it's just too big for your mouth to get a good bite in, but sadly this burrito was just normal burrito. It wasn't that chipotle burrito where I felt my taste buds getting a massage from the burrito gods. In fact, I bet the burrito gods were highly disappointed with this burrito and its maker. 

It's $6.75 for the steak burrito usually I'm content with that price, but it was meh this time. Went here around the afternoon and this place wasn't really busy, maybe it was because its near the gym :D.

*~*~The workers here really do skimp on their food, the portions are so small.*** I mean if you're into burritos that are small and potentially could've been amazing then go for it but if not head to another chipotle location.

TIP: You can get extra rice, lettuce, beans, corn, and fajitas for free just ask for it. Extra meat cost extra doe.
