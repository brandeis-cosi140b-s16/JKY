I'm a fan of fish tacos, so this place definitely hits the spot.  When I visited, I tried the Jerk Flounder Burrito and the Shrimp/Crab Dip appetizer.  Both were pretty tasty, but probably not any more special than dishes I've had before.  And,  don't expect the food here to be of any authentic Mexican quality.

I do really like the ambiance.  It's a nice casual place to go with friends, although it does get kind of noisy.  I've also heard that weekends are pretty packed, but I went on a Thursday night, and it was fine.
