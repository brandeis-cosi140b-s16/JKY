This taco shop is close to my house and delicious! I like getting their carne Asada burrito and fries... But believe their menu is good. The only issue I have with this place is there are homeless people coming up to your car asking for money... The funny thing is if the cashier spots it she will yell through the intercom "leave my customers alone" overall quick and convenient Mexican food.
