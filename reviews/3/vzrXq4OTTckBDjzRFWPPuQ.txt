Seriously HEPL

I kind of like this place, but really...WHAT THE F*CK IS UP WITH THESE PLACES AROUND HERE WITH NO WINDOWS?! I get a bit paranoid and creepy crawly. I know it sounds silly, but I have issues with places that are super dark and serve food.

The food wasn't bad, really. It was passable. When I'm feeling super lazy I come here but make sure I eat fast and am outof there in half an hour - the no windows thing really freaks me out.

Service was fast, snappy and very friendly. Food wasn't so shabby, but too bad I couldn't look outside and watch traffic.

No windows place that I kind of like but will have to settle for to go.
