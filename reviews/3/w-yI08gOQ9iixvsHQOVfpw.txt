I havent had carne asada fries in a looooonnngggg time! I've been being a good girl and going to the gym and avoiding these 3,000 calorie mofos! 

One night a few days ago I decided to go, at first I was very hesitant then I said eff it! So I park and walk up to the window. They just looked at me like I was stupid. I ordered asked for no pico and paid. The lady recited the order to the dude and he said something, which I couldnt hear (Spanish is my 2nd language) and thy both laughed... I was a little annoyed by that. I went into the store and got a tea and poked around.

I went back to get my order, which was just sitting by the window in a bag. I looked into the window and they were again sitting in the back of the kitchen talking. I gestured like, is this mine? I mean shit, I didnt want them to have to get off their ass to get me another couple red salsas so I just left. 

I got home and looked at my sinful foodz and they looked sooooooo yummy! I hesitated! And of course I was let down : ( They looked amazing but were def bland, all was bland! BOO!

No mas Robertos for me!
