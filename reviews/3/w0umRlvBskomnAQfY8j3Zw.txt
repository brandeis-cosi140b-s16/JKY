On The Border sent me an email asking me to review my last visit there. Well, the food was good. We went there on Taco Tuesday.  They gave us regular menus when we came in, we had to ask for the menu with the specials on it,  They should be giving you the menu with the specials on it without you asking or it. Maybe, they want you to order from the regular menu!  Anyway, the special menu was disgusting filthy with caked salsa all over  it! YUK! Called a manager over to show him. I believe he said it would be thrown out, but as we were leaving the front hostess was cleaning menus! It looked like that was one of them! When you go into a restaurant dirty menus should NOT be handed to you!!!  Hoping their menus are clean now, if I do go back and a dirty menu is given to me I will walk out! YES, it was that dirty!!!
