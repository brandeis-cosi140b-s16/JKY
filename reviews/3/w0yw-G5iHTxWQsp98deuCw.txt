Really?????!!!!????  5 broken glasses including 4 shot glasses chipped on the rim.  Unacceptable. If I swallowed glass I would have had to call a lawyer.  Terrible.  When the bartender was told about the glassware, she examined the glassware and put them back in the dish pit for washing and reuse. Are you kidding me?  Someone needs to order new glassware or replace your garbage staff.
