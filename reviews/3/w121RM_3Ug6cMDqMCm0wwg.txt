We went to Ocho Locos in Anthem the other night for dinner.  I agree with Holly J on this one.  Big improvement over the prior ownership with Pinta Nueva!  They are still working out the kinks with their new menu and staff so I'm looking forward to visiting them again soon to see if they deserve a higher rating.  

They offer a good selection of traditional and American Mexican food.  They have a full bar and offer a decent selection of beers on tap.  The service was good, not stellar.  They redecorated and added some nice HD TV's for sports and concerts. 

Our meals were good  "A-OK" but you can tell they are new, still working out some of the details with delivering excellente Mexican comida or alimento!  

Will visit again soon.  Hope you give them a try next time your in Anthem looking for Mexican.
