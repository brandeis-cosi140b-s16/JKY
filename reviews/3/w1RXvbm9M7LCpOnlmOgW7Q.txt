We have been eating at this Macayo's for a very long time. It used to be my favorite place to eat. I have since moved on to Caramba, because it is a much better value. Don't get me wrong. The food here is good, but not as good as it used to be. The prices are really high, as well. We ate here a few nights ago and it was almost $14 for my carnitas plate, and around $12 for my wife's chimichanga. The carnitas were good, but not $14 good. The chimichangas used to be what this place was renowned for. They were huge and relatively inexpensive (around $8). They seem to be more compact now and almost look like they're prepared off-site and then heated up when you order. The chips and salsa that they bring when you sit down are alright (although nothing can compare to Caramba's salsa). 

There are some good reasons to eat here. The service is usually really good. The waiter was really attentive when we were there and kept my drink filled the whole time. They are one of the few places that still take reservations. They have a cool room with stars that the kids like sitting in.

We'll definitely eat here again, but I wish that it was a place I could rave about like I used to.
