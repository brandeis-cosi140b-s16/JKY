The food was amazing. I had a sirloin steak with cactus and some sort of weird quesadilla thing. It was weird, but good weird. It was the best dinner my husband and I had in Vegas during our stay. 
This place would get 5 stars, but the customer service sucked. I think we saw our waitress a total of four times. One of the wait staff constantly bumped my partner's chair during our meal everytime he walked by. The server who brought our food out did not know which table it went to, and so he just kind of wandered from table to table as it was rejected by customers. Then, as I had just finished and my partner had just a few bites left, the server picks my plate up and then stands there staring at my partner waiting for him to eat his last few bites. My partner takes his sweet time to savor the last few bites, while this server is literally standing a few feet away watching my partner. WTF? I have never seen anything like that before, so yeah, customer service  was not hot.
