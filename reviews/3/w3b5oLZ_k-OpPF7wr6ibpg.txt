Despite the funky location between the smoke shop and the nail salon, Rolibertos manages to  have a fun Mexi-traditional interior with bright colors and engaging music playing. Prices are very reasonable and food is fresh. My personal taste is that the rice and beans are oversalted..very oversalted. The chili relleno burritto I had was scrummy, though, so I'll just stick to the main dishes if I return.
