When I'm on the go and need some quick food, I eat at fast food restaurants.  I recently found this one in Mesa.  It's clean, but not as fast and efficient as most Taco Bells.

I ordered my usual order (7 Layer Burrito, 2 Bean Burritos).  I sat and waited a while to get my order...and it wasn't during the lunch rush.  The food came out and here's where it fell apart, literally.  Whomever was making the food didn't know how to properly roll a Burrito.  Each of the Burritos fell apart as I ate it because it was not rolled "tight" and the contents spilled out the bottom and sides.  That's Burrito 101....

Oh well, I may have caught them on a bad day or some new kid might've been training.  It tasted like a normal Taco Bell meal, so at least they got that right.
