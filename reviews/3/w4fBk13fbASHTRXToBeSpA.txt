Went yesterday 7-12-15 around 5:15 PM.  This Chipotle is located in the McCarran Marketplace, on Eastern between Sunset and Warm Springs, in the far Northeast corner of the shopping center. 
It's teeny tiny compared to other Chipotles.  The line is backwards, too-it goes from left to right.  I'm kind of a Chipotle afficianado....actually just an addict. You ever see a homeless man on the side of the road passed out with a needle in his arm?  That's me with Chipotle.  
I always get the same thing- a bowl with white rice, black beans, steak, mild (pico de gallo minus onions), corn, sour cream, cheese, & lettuce.  Last night I was feelin' real frisky and got some guac and chips to go as well.  
I prolly eat Chipotle twice a week...my bowl last night was just not good.  I think because the guy put just a tiny bit of rice and a METRIC SHIT TON of mild salsa on there.  I still ate it but I ate it slowly and somewhat begrudgingly.  Is begrudgingly a word?  It is now.
