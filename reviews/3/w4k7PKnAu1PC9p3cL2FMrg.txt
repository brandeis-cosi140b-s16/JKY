This was my first experience at an America's Taco Shop and it was just okay. The service was very good from start to finish but the food we ordered was nothing I would go out of my way to go back for.

I ordered a chorizo and egg burrito which was really just okay. My fianc√© had a bean and cheese burrito with a chicken taco and again it was just okay. He said that the chicken taco was probably the best thing out of everything. We also ordered chips and salsa which were very disappointing. We ordered the spicy salsa which was not at all spicy and very salty. The chips were not warm and tasted very generic. I could have definitely had better chips and salsa at home any day, would not ever order these here again. The habanero hot sauces were the only thing that saved the salsa in this case. The chorizo in my burrito had an okay flavor but I mostly found myself eating around it and eating the bean and cheese half of the burrito. Apparently America's Taco Shop is known for their carne asada which we were told later but I did not get the memo. I might come back to try the carne asada but I would rather go to Espo's or even Rubio's over ATS.

I am just not feeling this chain. It may be great for others but this isn't my spot. I would rather take my $17 for two combo meals and drinks elsewhere. Return factor 30%
