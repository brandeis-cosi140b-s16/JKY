We just had our first experience with BE and I'm writing this with mixed reviews. The prices are not bad at all. We called for delivery and were given the expectation for an hour. I called them after an hour and a half and they knocked a considerable amount off the tab, which was amazing and the doorbell rang literally a couple minutes later. The sauces were outstanding and the rolled tacos were out of this world! The guac was on point! The nachos were yummy but most of the chips were soggy because of the beans and ground beef weighing them down while being delivered. I appreciate they they served the cheese on the side, but an even-better-if would to be to put the meat and beans on the side as well. It would have been kind of fun to construct them ourselves! The burritos were what was a little bit of a letdown. We got the steak, cheese, and bean burrito and holy cow was it salty! I'm pretty sure that the meat was machaca instead of actual steak. It had the taste and consistency of of Taco Bell steak but was slightly more shredded. Overall, it was a mixed bag. On the website they boasted about a mesquite grill, so I guess that gave me an unrealistic expectation for the meat. I could see where this place would be the shit after margarita night!
