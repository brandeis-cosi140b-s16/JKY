La Canasta is close to work and has an excellent chips and salsa bar.  The breakfast burros are fabulous too.  But the lunch part, not so good.  I need to remember to just go for the breakfast burro (they have a drive through!) and be done with it.  I ate on the patio once for lunch with a group and we were attacked by pigeons, some found it funny, I was not humored by it but in fact scared, I hate pigeons!
