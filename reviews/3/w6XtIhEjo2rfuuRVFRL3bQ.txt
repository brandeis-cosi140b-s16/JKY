I had no idea that Agave, the restaurant that was in this space before, had closed until my good gal pal invited me to dine here.  What I liked about Agave was the cool decor and ambiance, including the huge wooden doors, the patio, even the bathrooms; all these things are intact with the change in ownership.  What's also the same, to me, is that the food is just OK.  What's different is that Dos Caminos is a small chain with locations in New York, Atlantic City, and Ft. Lauderdale and the prices seem to be more expensive than Agave.

We had:
traditional guacamole
crunchy veggies for dipping
Dos Caminos Bocaditos trio

We were served complimentary chips with three different kinds of salsa:  tomatillo (watery), a red salsa (had a slight kick and tasty), and a spicier orange salsa (can't remember the ingredients, but I didn't really eat it).  
Gal Pal had the guacamole and veggies as her meal and she liked it just fine.  I had the trio, which consisted of two chicken taquitos topped with some kind of cabbage slaw, two plaintain empanadas, and two molotes potosinas (corn masa turnovers with roasted red pepper, spicy cheese, and salsa).  This trio was listed on the menu as priced at $16.50, so I was expecting six bigger pieces of food. When the platter was served, I was surprised at how small the servings were for that price.  I liked the chicken taquitos after I nudged the cabbage slaw off (didn't like the taste at all-sour) and I liked the plaintains, as well.  I did not care for the molotes and only ate one, hoping it would get better; it didn't.  It was just kind of spicy tastelessness (is that a word?)
When the bill came, my trio was only $8.25, so it must have been priced for happy hour, which is a good thing because that dish is not worth $16.50.  I do have to say that the service was great and we sat on the patio, enjoying the late afternoon sunset.  I just wish the food matched the environment.
