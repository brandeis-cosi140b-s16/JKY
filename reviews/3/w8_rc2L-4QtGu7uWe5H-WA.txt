Ok, here's the problem. I really like their food. It's good. However; when I went to pickup an order they had placed my food in the microwave to melt the cheese in a styrofoam container. I asked them if they knew you aren't suppose to do that and they replied it was ok and they had never heard that :-/ Needless to say, the styrofoam was melted and had a small whole in it. The first time I had seen my food container in this condition from them I assumed it was from dumping food in the container that was too hot. Now I know what really happened. So, I don't trust that they know how to handle food. Which is sad because I like their food. This was however a while back, maybe they've wised up since then.
