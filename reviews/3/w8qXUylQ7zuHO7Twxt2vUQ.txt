Great location in the Peoria Sports Complex. Kinda reminds me of a locals type beach bar and grill. Good happy hour food and drinks. Huge area with horseshoe pits, volleyball net and beanbag toss games. Fun place but beware lots of kids running around due to the young family draw of the baseball complex. 
Only had hot wings (not very hot), cheese quesadilla and nachos with beers and margaritas. All just ok.
