Not sure how I feel about Qdoba.  It's one of those things that are up in the air for me.  I mean, I like me some Mexican food every once in a while, and when it's prepared fairly fast I'm down with that.

Even though, I always end up feeling less than fulfilled when I leave there.  I always get my burrito naked with the tortilla on the side.  I think this is the best way to eat it, saving a person from a soggy mess.

Anyway, the inside of this spot is, well for lack of a better term, spotless.  Not much else to say on this spot.
