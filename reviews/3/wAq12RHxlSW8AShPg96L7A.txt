I'm quite particular when it comes to Mexican food. Having grown up in Phoenix, I've been exposed to a lot of Mexican food both good and bad. This is my first time visiting and I do plan to go back. The server seemed almost scared of me, which was weird. She was very nice and polite but seems a little timid. I'm sure she'll get over that. Chips and salsa were better than average. I had carnitas tacos and pollo tacos. Chicken was fresh and juicy as we're the carnitas. The server never checked back after I got my food which is a big pet peeve of mine. They are only two months old and I'm sure will continue to work through their growing pains. I'll come back and give them another chance in a month or two to see how they progressed.
