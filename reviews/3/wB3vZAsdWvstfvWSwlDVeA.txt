The first time I went here, I got the shredded beef burrito ($6.29) and thought it was just ok (it was HUGE).  However, I LOVED their warm chips ($.99) and guacamole ($2.69)!  

Although I've revisited this location, I haven't tried anything else off their menu...I just run in for an order of chips and guacamole.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the lightly salted chips and tangy guac.

BTW, although I prefer Qdoba's chips, for burritos, I prefer Baja Fresh.  As others have mentioned, Qdoba is just like Chipotle.  It's even located across the street from Chipotle...go figure.
