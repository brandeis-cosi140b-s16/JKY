My second time here and with the same gaggle o'boys! And I would happily return. 

The service here is AMAZING!! The entire staff is so attentive, and enjoyable! 
The staff really makes this place above average! The outdoor patio is awesome!

The first time I was here was during the day, and I have to say oddly enough the food was actually much better. Maybe the day chef is more experienced? Or it was slower? Not sure, but we were all in agreement that.

The second time we went was for dinner, and it was busy! The food was still great, but not as perfect as the first time. Everyones dinner was a bit off. Meat cooked a tiny bit too long, some things hot, others only warm. And the $14 drinks was a bit of a shocker! Over all we had a great time.

Taking into account the pros and cons, I would go back.
