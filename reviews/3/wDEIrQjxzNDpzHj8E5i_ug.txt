I don't think this place is worth the hype about food. Each taco here is usually a fusion of flavors from different cultures which I usually love but to be honest, I don't think they paired the flavors well. It's not bad but definitely not even close to amazing. 
The atmosphere is cool so I'd recommend coming here for the atmosphere and drinks, not the food
