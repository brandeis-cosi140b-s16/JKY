Killing time after dropping off a movie at Blockbuster, I decided to find some place new to eat. As a rule of thumb, any of the ...berto's are best left for the end of a heavy night's drinking. But this was 11 a.m. on a Saturday morning and I was stone sober. With a bit of apprehension, I decided to give it a shot. Besides, I'd only my intestinal fortitude to challenge. 

After being impressed with their large, and vastly photo-depicted, menu, I opted to keep things simple with a breafast burrito. Bacon, eggs, potatoes and cheese. Nothing out of the box, conceptually. But what do you expect from a ...berto's? How about some of the freshest tasting eggs, strikingly flavorful bacon and a tortilla that wakes up your taste buds? Yeah, it was rather surprising. And I didn't experience those post-berto's blues anytime afterwards. So, I'll be making it back here.
