Stopped by at 2 in the morning with the homies. I ordered the Carne Asada 1/2 Fries and 1/2 Chips and a Dr. Pepper. I spent just under $10. It was just ok. I guess everyone else who yelped about these Carne Asada Fries was eating these while they were drunk so it tasted hella good. I was sober and it was just ok.
