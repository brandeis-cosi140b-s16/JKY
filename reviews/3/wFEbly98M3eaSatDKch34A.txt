I'll readily admit that I miss Luna pizza being here, but Dos Amigos isn't too bad of a replacement.  That statement might be different, though, if I didn't live very close to where Luna is now.  Situated in the plaza across from school, I kind of feel like it's part of MWU's unofficial food court.  It's also certainly a better option than Panda Express or Subway.

The restaurant is clean and well-lit, always a good start to anywhere one plans to eat.  The staff has always been, if not exactly cheerful, very pleasant.  I've never once met one of the dull-eyed dead souls that haunt the registers of the big fast food pits here.  It's surprising how much that can affect your perception of a restaurant.

What I really like about this place is the open line behind the counter.  I know it can be gimmicky in a lot of places, but I like to see what goes in to making my food (I'm sure it comes from the time I spent back there myself).  The workers back there are focused and definitely not slackers.  I've never waited longer than I felt I should have for food.

And the food itself is good.  It's not great, but I'm becoming jaded to ever finding truly amazing Mexican food.  It's a decent meal that will fill you up and not break the bank.  It's another place that may not be worth exactly what it costs, but overall, the whole place is nice enough that I'll definitely keep going there whenever I need a break from Hot Bagels.
