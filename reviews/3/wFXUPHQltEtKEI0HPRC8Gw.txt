Okay....

So if you're looking to find reviews on fancy restaurants in Mesa, you won't find it here.

I'm kickin' it with mostly guys afterall, and us girls are either:
a) a new mom who's busy tending to her almost 2-wk-old,
b) a nursing student,
c) and me, saving up for an upcoming wedding and trips like these to see all my other friends and families who just had their first babies.

So, what to eat, what to eat during Lent on a Friday??  What will leave us satieted after spending a measly few bucks??  

We go to Del Taco.  Now, you all know I don't like Mexican food but the shrimp tacos were actually decent.  They're battered and fried and loosely stuffed in a small tortilla along with lettuce and cilantro.  Each small taco comes with its own slice of lime.  Add it to the soft taco & combine with the mild sauce, the flavors will offer your mouth their own rendition of a fiesta.  All for around $2 each!!

Ole!!!
