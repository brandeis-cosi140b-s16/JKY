After church, family and I decided to try something new! We have heard the locals talking about My Favorite Martin's in Sun City/Surprise. The restaurant is located in a adult community and a stop at the guard house is a must before entering the premises. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, the menu at this restaurant includes a variety of offerings. Traditional breakfast items are available along with sandwiches, Caesar salad and daily specials. Look for ground sirloin, pecan-crusted trout, steaks, spaghetti with meatballs and fried fish. Desserts are made daily by the owner and may include Jack Daniel's pecan pie, bread pudding with whiskey sauce and coconut custard cake. I had the eggs over easy, bacon, and the herbs potato. (I do recommend the hash browns instead). With a 1/2 side order of biscuit and gravy. Eggs and potato's wasn't that bad at all. Bacon needed to be cooked a little bit longer. Biscuit and gravy was good, wasn't the best but I have tasted worst! Wife had the breakfast burrito, they do not put the hash browns in the burrito. So if you want them in the burrito! She thought it was very tasty! Daughter also enjoyed her burrito. Now, if you order OJ! you will need about six of them. For a $1.75, they will pour you a glass about the size of a shot glass? So be prepared. Over all we really did enjoy this place,The employee's are very friendly!! They are right there to get your drinks and your order is prepared and at your table quickly! We especially enjoy that 2 people can eat for only $11.00 plus tax and that includes your non-alcohol drinks! We all agreed to come back here at another time for lunch! So! I'll be back for an update!!!
