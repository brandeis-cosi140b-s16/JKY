Pepe. Can I call you Pepe? Here's the deal. 
Salsa squeezed out of a bottle. Not so great. It runs all over my plate making it difficult to scoop up. In a bowl or ramekin would be nice. Chips were good however. 

Service. Well. Let's just say I had VIP service as I was with three hot Latinas. Yep. Gay gringo + Hot Latinas = stellar service. Excelente!

Tamales? Why are they a reddish orangey color? Sad. They were dry, not very sweet (like I imagine Nicole Kidman would be) and well, did I mention sad? The pork filling, however was succulent and tasty. Kinda what I imagine Ryan Reynolds would taste like. 

My friend's chicken soup was ORGASMIC. Or as they say in Spanish. ORGASMICO. You see. You just add an O and you're bilingual. Order the soup my yelpitas. Be. The soup. 

And. The margaritas. Well, when you're day drinking and starting at 11:30 am (hey it's 5:00 somewhere, right?) it doesn't take long to catch a buzz. I mean, I''m still tasting my vanilla mint crest with the first sips. But the margs were very smooth, tart and just enough kick.

Cut to me floating in my friends' pool after lunch. Happy. Feliz I should say. But wishing I had stuck with my first choice of carnitas or had ordered the chicken soup. 

Next time. Or. El tiempo proximo. Pepe. I don't care if you're in the hood. I felt so street and edgy. I'll be back. And thank you for commenting on my Hello Kitty debit card Jose! You rawk mi carnes y quesos!
