I had dinner here about two weeks ago. First off, I am Mexican therefore I don't tend to eat Mexican food at restaurants, since I have high standards. But, I happened to be very hungry!

So I ordered the chips and salsa and the Enchiladas del Mar. The chips and salsa came out instantly and the salsa was surprisingly good. Not spicy, but not necessarily mild. It was perfect. I devoured the chips. 

Next, my order of enchiladas came out. They looked so good! I put a bit of the salsa from the chips on the enchiladas along with the black bean salsa that came with the entree. IT WAS AMAZING. My mom had never made any seafood enchiladas, therefore these were the best. The shrimp, scallops, and crab made an excellent combination. Craving them right now...

Needless to say, I enjoyed my dinner very much. I would definitely recommend the Enchiladas del Mar and the Chips and Salsa. Yum!
