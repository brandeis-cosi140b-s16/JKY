Okay so I slowly and cautiously came back to this spot. It's a good quick option by the house and good when they keep it fresh. I just won't come during a slack time/ right before closing again. I don't think it was food poisoning, but definitely something was off and upset my stomach enough to reject it. The past few times, I've been absolutely fine. 

I appreciate they do brown rice now, I prefer that in my bowls actually. I normally get steak or carnitas but have been getting the chicken as a better option.

Keep in mind that while they tout "healthy" there is still a rather crazy amount of sodium in their food for a "fresh" concept. So if you are watching what you eat, you should probably look online at their nutritional information.

Chipotle is one of those chains that I would begrudgingly say is rather good and is kinda a genius concept for fast food.
