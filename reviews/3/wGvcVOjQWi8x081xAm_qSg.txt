Very average. Tried 3 times. 1st time was some different combos. They were alright. Next time breakfast burritos. Pretty good, but I've had better. Final time was different tacos. Pre-made shells were tasteless as was the chicken and beef. Fish tacos okay, but get better at Rubios. Even though restaurant is close by, we drive farther to get better Mexican food.
