I'm from socal and had to try this place out from the local rants.  Yes my carne asada burrito was good but it just didn't do justice in the flavor department.  However their condiments was quite on par and I enjoyed the pickled carrots very much...maybe I'll try the carne asada fries next time I drive through.
