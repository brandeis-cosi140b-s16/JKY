Filiberto's can be hit or miss depending on the location. This is my second-favorite location. My favorite thing on the menu is the carne asada fries without guac (I hate guac anyway, but there's tends to be super runny... yuck) and it is absolutely fantastic in a really guilty pleasure sort of way. My second favorite thing is the green chile plate (pork) and I always get a second tortilla. My boyfriend gets the two beef taco plate and I really like it too. 

One thing to note is that if you order a burrito or a quesadilla (one of the plain ones, not one of the fancy ones likes the carne asada) they usually don't come with ANYTHING in them besides meat and the listed veggies. No cheese, sour cream, etc. You have to get it on the side. Which is fine, but the first time I went to filibertos in high school I ordered the chicken burrito and it was good but it is literally just a tortilla stuffed with chicken in red sauce. I need some dairy in my burritos!

I've never eaten inside here. I've never even ordered inside. I find that these places tend to be less clean than I would like so I just don't bother going in.
