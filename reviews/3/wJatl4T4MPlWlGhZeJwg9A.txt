Let's see, our 1st time here and it's okay. It's rather busy so service was slow.   3 of us each had a different meal.  The mini sampler was a large portion of food. Enough for 2. The tacos were by far my favorite.  The ground beef is flavorful,  the chicken is mellow. The only spicy bite I had was a "louie". A mini chimichanga of jalape√±o and cheese, WOW, too much for me.   The enchiladas were drowned in sauce. A mushy mess on a plate.   So if you know how you do not want your food prepared, be sure to let them know!
