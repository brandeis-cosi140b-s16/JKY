Stopped here on Thursday lunchtime, just a fast break for just three tacos al pastor in mini size.  They were okay but I felt they were bordering on too dry.  Pastor is supposed to be slightly dry but these were more dry than I felt could be better.  They were seasoned on the spicy side.  The salsas were spicy and standard.  The place seemed clean and I may go back for Saturday special half a grilled chicken and Peruvian sides for $15 or to try out more options. The only thing that kind of grossed me out was no hand soap in the restroom.  I am hoping it had just ran out because everything else was really clean in the place.  I do not suspect cleanliness to be a problem.  At least I hope not.  I hope to edit this review after I've tried more food items on a future visit.
