We come here almost every week and it's a very busy location. They are friendly, but almost every other time we come there is a waiting issue.... I get the tacos are in demand on Wednesdays lol but Today I waited 26 minutes for 3 tacos "to go", and the guys behind me as well as people who were not even at the restaurant when I placed my order were getting their food before my tacos were even made. Accidents happen, but it's just a little annoying when you're on a limited lunch break.
