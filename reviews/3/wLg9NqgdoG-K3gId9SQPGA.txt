Dos Gringos is what it is and what you make of it. It's a frequent stop on our Old Town Scottsdale Bar crawls because it has a huge outdoor patio and can easily accomodate all of us. 

I love taking pictures of all the crazy signs on the walls, ceilings, and doors. There's usually a DJ spinning tunes on weekends nights and people dance in the back by the bathrooms.

I recommend taking your out-of-town guests here so they, too can experience Old Town at it's finest. The crowd is usually in their early to mid- twenties, at least until me and my friends invade the place. Like I said- "It is what it is".

UPDATE: I just learned that Dos's patio is leashed dog friendly until dark.
