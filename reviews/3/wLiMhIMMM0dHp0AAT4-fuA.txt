The restaurant is very nice, cool patio, and plenty of parking.  As Mexican resturants here go I think it's fine. The food is not at all spicy so it's a good place to take those friends and family members who can't take the heat.  The lunch portions for the combos are huge.  So on the Yelp system we should be at or around a 4 star review, but the last time I went the service was painfully slow.  We were the first in the restaurant and I think the last to be served one day for lunch.  So I have to take away a star for spending an hour and fifteen minutes getting lunch here. Maybe I should have told them I was a Yelper like the other reviewers :).
Hopefully it was just a one time thing.

Try:
- Lunch combo ( be hungry )
- Bean Dip and Chips
