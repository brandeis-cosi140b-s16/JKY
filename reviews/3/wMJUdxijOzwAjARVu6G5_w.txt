First time here, came for lunch.  I  ordered the scallop ceviche but was told it wasn't ready to be served so I settled for plain ceviche,  it was good,not great.  Their chips are NOT made in house, from a bag. My shrimp puffy tacos were incredible and my husband had the philly burrito, he says it was good but again not great.   The restaurant is a beautiful work of art.
