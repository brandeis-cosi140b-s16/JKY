Had dinner here with friends for the first time last night. Overall, I was a little disappointed. The chips and salsa were pretty good. I had the veggie burrito as my main meal even though I really wanted to try the baja shrimp tacos! Anyway, I should have gone with my initial gut menu choice as the burrito was just so-so. They put some kind of pico in the burrito which I do not believe was mentioned on the menu (I could be wrong), but it was not creating a good taste for me. The rice seemed pretty good but I only had a few bites. I got a salad as my other side (instead of beans) and it was a fairly large salad but mostly greens. There were some tomatoes but they were chopped into very small pieces and there were only a few. I would like to give this place one more try but so far, I'm not all that impressed!
