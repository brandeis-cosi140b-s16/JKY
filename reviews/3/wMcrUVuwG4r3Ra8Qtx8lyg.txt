We ate here as a family with some out of town guests. Everything about it was fine. The food was fine. The service was fine. We ordered the guacamole app and everyone liked it. My son and I split the fajitas and the chicken was decent. Overall, I would go there again if someone really wanted to but felt like I could make better Mexican at home. The food was far from authentic and it is a Mexican restaurant for people who consider The Olive Garden to be real Italian food.
