Went here for a late dinner. The atmosphere was stylish and cool looking and while the lounge couches and little tables may look hip they are super annoying to try and eat at. The tables are so low you're practically bending over at the waste to eat.

The food was great. It was upscale/hipster Mexican food. The service was terrible. 

First, I asked for a glass of wine and some water and they brought out my partner's drink but not mine. When I asked another waitress about it, our waitress came up behind her and was kind of snarky about it. Um, it's not my fault, so don't be rude.

Second, my cousin ordered a glass of sangria and not only was it terrible, they charged her $14 for it instead of $6 like the menu says. When she questioned the waitress she got super rude about it. In the end the manager adjusted the price but it left a negative impression on both of us.

Terrible service. Food is good though.
