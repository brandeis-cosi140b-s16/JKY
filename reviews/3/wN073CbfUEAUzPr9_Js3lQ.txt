Think of it like all of the Albertos, Albertacos, Ralibertos and the rest of the restaurants with the same menu and flavors. 

We love all of these restaurants - but this one didn't give enough rice in our burrito (we ordered a bean, rice and cheese burrito, but it was by far beans - disappointing).
