Out to lunch with 5 of my co workers, seated on the patio and served chips and salsa quickly. The salsa was great although several in my party requested one with a bit less heat, go figure. From that point on our service was spotty at best. The appetizer I ordered was forgotten about and was comped by our server ( A Nice Touch ). The entrees arrived and received a mixed review from our group. 

A chicken salad that had no dressing ? 

A chicken taco salad that also appeared to be missing something, 
salsa maybe ? The tortilla bowl was limp and soggy. 

Whats with the guacamole ? looks like they cut it with sour cream. 

Also, our drinks went unfilled. The server was very rough around the edges, not very knowledgeable and seemed too busy to serve us properly. 

Overall. an average experience. My 3 stars is a generous rating for this visit.
