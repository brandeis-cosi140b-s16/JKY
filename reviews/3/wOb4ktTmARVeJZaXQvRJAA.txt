Went back last night for our end of season kickball party.  I had a beer and a dozen spicy hot wings.  The wings were mediocre they were spicy but a bit too much on the vinegar side for my liking.  I like my wings hot and full of flavor.   My beer was a 20oz. for $3.25 which was a decent deal I just wish they offered that on all beers not just watered down domestics.
