The tacos were A-OK. Nothing to write home about, but decent none-the-less. Great selection of tequila, although the word "tequila" is in the namesake so you'd expect that. My girlfriend had one of the fancy pants mixed drinks, but it was horrible and the waiter asked if she wanted another one, so good on them. Oh, the chips they give you when you sit down are de-li-cious.
