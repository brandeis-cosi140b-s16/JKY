This place is worth 3 stars at most , bland no flavor fry bread tacos... The fry bread was too doughy and soft and thick for me , I like my fry bread more airy and a little more crispy. The beans were dry and the cheese wasn't even melted. The staff was very nice , the  atmosphere is very cool , bikers everywhere :) it's next door to a biker bar. I love that it's a hole in the wall kind of place which usually has the best food ... 
I'd probably try it again after a few drinks next door .. Food always taste better then ! Maybe that's why all the high reviews !?
