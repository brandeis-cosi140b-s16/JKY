I thought I would try this restaurant again after seeing a Group-On for it... Probably have eaten here 4 times now and I just can't muster 4 stars.  In the past, I have enjoyed the margaritas but not really cared much for the food.  This last time, even the rocks margarita came out lukewarm and was unsatisfying.  The appetizer salsa isn't spicy, the appetizer beans are flavorless and the guacamole was really only tasty because of the onion in it.  My entr√©e was passable, as was my date's.  One positive aside form the friendly server is how fast the entrees arrived - FAST!  Overall, the portions are great too, but the food quality is on par with Macayo's - lots of cheese, but not much flavor.  If you like the food from that other restaurant (and many do) then you'll probably like the food here, but nothing about it seems particularly authentic or even vaguely interesting.  Probably will be my last visit here.
