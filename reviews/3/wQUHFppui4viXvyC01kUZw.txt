I just ate here for lunch today. inside and out was clean including the restroom.

the food: nothing special i ordered a taco and tostada combo plate, it seemed average nothing special but i would eat it again. the beans where good, better than most places. the beef in my taco was moist and slightly greasy (not as greasy as some other places but still some grease) i wish it came with a few more veggies like tommatoes or offered some freash salsa at the salsa bar but it was only standard red and green sauce.

I also ordered some horchata (SP?) little pricey for it but i wanted it badly, again nothing special you can actually see the little bag that pumps the premade mix into the machine. for soda, I always order the smallest size if i'm dinning in free refills so why pay extra for a bigger cup. 

I was disapointed that people decided to tag in the bathroom, some folks decided to tag on the table they where sitting at while i was in there... some people have no respect. the casher was nice and I chatted with her a minute about the tagging. 

It is really close to GCC and since i work and go to school there it is an obvious choice. I believe there was an aditional charge for using my debit card but i'm not sure. I will try other menu items and leave reviews when i am able.
