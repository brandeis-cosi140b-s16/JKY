Gadzooks is a new taco joint in the Phoenix area, only their main staple is enchiladas not tacos. Sorta like Chipotle, but different. Overall, the good was pretty good but heavy for lunch. The issue this with Gadzooks is the choices, simply way too many of them. I counted a total of 7 distinct choices you need to make to get your enchilada, And halfway through the process, they pop it in the oven to heat. This maybe viewed as a positive by some, but not me. Why, takes too long to get your food! 

Long story short, decent food but the long wait will keep me away.
