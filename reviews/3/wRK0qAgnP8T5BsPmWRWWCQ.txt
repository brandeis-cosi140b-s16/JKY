We took a family friend here for some dinner as he was traveling from New Orleans to LA. I've heard good things and I've been wanting to try it for sometime. I can only speak for the Pollo Especial I had, and it was very good. Service was good, and our server even made sure we were squeezed in at the happy hour prices. 

If this were located in someplace besides the SW (say Indiana or Ohio) then I think people would be giving this 5-stars. But here in the valley, there are much more flavorful and authentic Northern Mexican places to eat.
