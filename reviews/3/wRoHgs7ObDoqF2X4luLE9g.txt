The food is gonna be what the food is gonna be, you know that.
So I judge a FFchain on a few things.
Is it clean.
Are they friendly.
Do they fahqew in the drive thru?

This Taco Hell scores consistently mediocre on all counts, except that they are quite friendly.

It is refreshing to pull into the drive thru, and even if there were a line of cars ahead of you, to hear the mechanical voice in the box say, 
"Hi, How are you?"
...and then pause for an answer!

They do it all the time, so must be made to say it, but it always seems sincere.  It catches you off guard at first, but now I have grown to really dig the tone it conveys.  I don't think that the couple of seconds it may delay the order is a big deal at all, compared to the warm fuzzy feelings I get when I respond, 
"I'm fine. How are you?"...and get a genuine response back.

I'm not here that often, but more since they demolished the Del Taco across the street to build a CVS freestanding location (good call, since the strip mall CVS in that shopping ctr is gross).

I have noticed that there are several employees that seem to have stuck around and worked here for well over a year, maybe two -- good sign when you're judging a FFchain, since turnover = non-caring employees.

So in summary:
It's clean enough.
They're quite friendly.
They haven't yet fahq'd me in the drive thru.

Edited:

Meh for food.
Yay! I'm a fan for friendliness.

According to my personal rating system that's much too complicated to show here, this equates to an A-OK overall.
