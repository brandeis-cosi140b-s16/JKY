Was here for a meeting that didn't happen.  Nothing to do with the restaurant. 

Decided to stay for lunch.   I have eaten here once before.

The food is mediocre,  which is too bad considering they use family recipes.   Essex the food is bland.  I am sure they could do a lot better if they wanted to.   Also, the portions are a lot smaller than most Mexican restaurants. 

They did NOT change for more chips.   Probably would be doing me a favor if they did.   The chips were very good 5. Almost seemed like they were baked instead of fried.

Service was a little slow but very good and friendly. 

Would I come back here?   If I wanted Mexican food and I was in the area,  I might.  It would never be a destination,  however.
