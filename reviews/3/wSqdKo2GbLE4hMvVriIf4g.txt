Tried this place for the first time yesterday. I had the pork taco and the fish taco. The tacos range from $1-1.50, they are the tiny shell tacos like you see with street vendors. The pork is diced small and the flavor was delicious. The fish taco was good, but mine wasn't to die for. The shells in either taco were not heated. Liked the homemade salsas that accompany the tacos. The owner and his staff were very friendly. My brother had the carne asada burrito and really enjoyed the flavor. He also ordered the tamale but was not very impressed with that. Not much meat and small. The prices are great. We fed 3 people w/canned cokes for $12! If I'm ever in the area again, I will definitely go back to try other items, but won't make another special trip. All in all, a good experience! It's a small place with about 6-7 tables. At 4pm on Saturday it was busy, the patio didn't have any seating out there. Wouldn't recommend large groups unless you're doing takeout.
