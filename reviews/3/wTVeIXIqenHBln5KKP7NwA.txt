This is much like Robertos with a slight difference in taste.. after a great workout at the gym I had a craving for the tacos and enchiladas.. It's amazing how this stuff taste so much better after a few beers/cocktails. I know I wasted my workout for this stuff.. and this time I agree.. after I ate it, I felt the gut bomb sitting in my stomach. So I will have to push the craving demons away and only eat this stuff after a night out. Roberto's seems slightly better.. but it could be the same exact recipies.. who knows?
