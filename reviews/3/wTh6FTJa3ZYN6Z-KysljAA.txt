Some like it mild.  If so, they should come to this location of Los Dos.  

I tried this Los Dos recently for the first time, and all I can say is that is was mellow.  No wait on a Friday night and we had over 20 people.  Crazy.  Another thing that was mellow was the heat.  I had been talking up how hot Los Dos is to the newcomers and warning them about how spicy certain dishes are (the Adovada ribs in particular), and nothing was hot.  Well, the salsa was pretty warm (and actually quite tasty), but all of our dishes were not spicy at all...adovada ribs, Victoria's chili chicken, nothing.  It was kind of a bummer.  

Maybe since this location is new, it is still working out the kinks, but they need to work on the heat level if they are going to call it a Los Dos.  

That said, I enjoyed the new location (right on the light rail), and I look forward to hopping on the light rail and heading down there in the future, but they need to spice things up a bit first.  For now, I am going to head back to Central...where it is never mellow.
