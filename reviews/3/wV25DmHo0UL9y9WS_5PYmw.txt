Food was decent. Went there for lunch and had a good Caesar salad with average tortilla soup. My friends soup didn't come out at the same time however. When I asked our server, David, when my friends food was coming he gave me attitude and walked away. I think that reaction from him was absurd when I merely asked a question. I might go back, but I won't have David serving me.
