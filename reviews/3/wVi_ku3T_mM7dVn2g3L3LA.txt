I've been to a number of El Pollo Loco locations and this one is about average.  On the day I came is was clean, which is important, and not overly-crowded even for lunch on a weekday.

For those who don't know, the claim to fame of the El Pollo Loco chain is grilled chicken, marinated in citrus and cooked over an open grill.  Although the breast can get a bit dry, this is a great way to prepare chicken.  You end up with crispy tasty skin and moist meat.

One problem - sometimes a bird is undercooked.  The wing in the one I got had a small uncooked area.  It is hard to get the entire chicken cooked properly, and a lot depends on the skill of the one doing the grilling.  That is going to vary from day to day and location to location.

The chicken may be 4 star, but the sides are disappointing bland and just not tasty, and about all that is left are the tortillas and sodas which are ... well, they're just tortillas and sodas like anyplace else.

I did notice a list of interesting desserts, including tres leches cake, but was too full to try it.
