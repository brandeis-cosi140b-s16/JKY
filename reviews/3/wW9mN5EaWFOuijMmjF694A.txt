The food isn't bad, and the prices are okay.  Maybe the food is even better than "not bad"--3 1/2 stars, maybe?  Everything looked and tasted fresh.  The reason I'm not rating the place better is that it's built so that the sound just amplfies and echoes, and this is bad for someone who is hovering on the edge of a minor migraine.  When I wasn't picking at my chicken burrito, I was wondering how many people I could stab to death with my plastic knife before the two cops having lunch at the next table stopped me.
