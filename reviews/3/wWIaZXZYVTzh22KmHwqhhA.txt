Good but not great.  The fella and I went to San Gabriel last night for an early dinner.  We sat out on the patio and noshed on delicious chips and salsa while we waited for our veggie burritos.  The burritos were really good, filled with an assortment of veggies like carrots, zucchini, potatoes and cabbage.  Much nicer than the standard peppers & onions found in most veggie burritos.  Huge portions too.

A few disappointments...
- the menu at the restaurant was significantly different than the one online and didn't have the helpful "V" for vegetarian symbols next to the dishes
- they don't serve horchata any more
- the standard Spanish rice is not vegetarian, so we had citrus rice, which was kinda weird
