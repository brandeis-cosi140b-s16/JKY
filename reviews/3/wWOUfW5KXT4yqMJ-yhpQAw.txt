Was in Tempe on business this week. Living in Florida where Mexican food is just ok I was anxious to checkout some local joint. My hotel concierge recommended this place and I wasn't disappointed. Chips were warm, salsa was ok not great. Ordered the chimichanga on the waiters recommended and was not disappointed. Ate in the outdoor area  on a balmy night watching game 1 of the World Series.
