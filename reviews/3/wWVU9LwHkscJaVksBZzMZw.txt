Former location of Luna Pizza at the SW corner of Beardsley & 59th Ave.  

New location so I'm aware they may still be working things out.  Service was a little slow, considering that I was the only person "in line" to order.  Atmosphere was somewhat sterile/clean, with obvious traces of the old pizza location that was here.

Tortilla used for the burrito was just right in texture and flavor.  Beans & cheese were good as well.  Tortillas chips seemed fresh made, especially as they have some of the natural bubbles in them still from drying & cooling.  Salsa bar was alright.

Prices were a little high compared to other fast food Mex places such as Rubio's, which is right across the street.  Most hungry patrons will easily spend $8-11 for lunch.
