A little down the Boulevard, probably stumbling, was Diablo's Cantina. We were there for the bar only, mind you. 

Here, we also just sat and talked to the bartender, who seemingly understood the glassy eyed look I had and gave me Jack on the rocks immediately. 

We sat off to the side because the main bar was way too full for enjoyment, and faced north, but once the soccer game cleared the people out, we turned and people watched while they judged up for judging them. The bartender, again, made us random drinks that he wanted to test out, so aside from the normal beers and Jacks, I have no idea what we drinking. 

But I loved the atmosphere and the staff behind the bar. That's usually what makes it worth it for me. Although, I don't care much for their closing hours. Too early for Vegas.
