I find it amazing that the separation of only 110 miles between Tucson and Phoenix causes the difference between the mexican food to be so drastic. This place isn't bad so let me first say that. But it is so far from the Mexican food in Tucson that I kinda felt disappointed. I felt like being in Arizona the Mex food would be equal but it sure isn't I enjoyed my food and had my Mexican fix but it wasn't nearly as good as I assumed it would be. I think next time I'll stay away from the Machaca and get some enchiladas or something.
