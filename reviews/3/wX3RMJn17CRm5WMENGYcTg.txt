Zaba's Mexican Grill is a small chain of  convenient Americanized Mexican fast food eateries, all located in the Las Vegas area. There are about 5 -6 of them now.

Zaba's is like Chipotle, but browner. 

No, not browner as in darker Mexicans, ones with more indian blood than Spanish blood. Not at all. Browner because instead of white floured tortillas or white rice, they offer healthier brown. 

Zaba's concept is very similar to Chipotle, even the line and service process at the counter is similar. But Zaba's offers more variety. Such as brown rice, wheat tortillas, or fish and shrimp tacos or burritos. 

They also have a more colorful decor than the tin can aluminum decor of Chipotle. This one is also larger than most Chipotles, with booths and tables and about 2 to3 times the seating capacity.

I came here to order lunch for a group I was visiting in a nearby office, a lunch and learn session. They had faxed the order in, but the manager was so anal, he couldn't fill the order unless they used their official fax order form! WTF? He faxed back the official form and said he called. Meanwhile, I had talked to him several times about the order, and he didn't tell me this. So I had to call the office, confirm the order, and told him to fill in the blanks that weren't on the order. He had difficulty with this, being a bit OCD or something.

We finally got the order put together and delivered the food. It is pretty tasty, even when it is browner.
