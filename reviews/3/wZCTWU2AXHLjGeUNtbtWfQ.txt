It's been mentioned, however it's extremely true. The bean dip rocks. Lots of Mexican restaurants start you with chips & salsa, but warm bean dip? Leet.

The location of this place is really nice, situated on a lake in the corner of a large complex. For some reason, I like how they are set way back in the corner and their front door is not immediately in front of you at the curb. 

I've only been here twice, and I sat in the bar both times. Got pretty decent service, refills took slightly longer than I like but it looked like our server was the only one running around the bar and she was prego, so I'm not really going to fault her. Plus she was super sweet.

I'll be back because of the notable perks I have experienced so far: 
Mmm, warm beans. Yes please!
They have good happy hour specials, even on weekends (the mini burritos are YUM!) 
And they have Michelob Ultra on draft.
