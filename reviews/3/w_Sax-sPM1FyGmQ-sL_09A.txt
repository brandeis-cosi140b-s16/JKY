We love Serrano's. Even had them cater our wedding.  We were regulars @ the Dobson location before it closed.

Really not a fan of this location.  Service is poor.

Today my mother and I tried to walk in with the remnants of our coffees and before we were even all the way in the door were told by two employees that we'd have to leave our drinks at the front. Rude.
We left and spent our $40 @ Valle Luna. It was delicious!
