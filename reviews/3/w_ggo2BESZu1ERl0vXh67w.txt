Tonight I had a new experience. I feel like there are very few times in my life that I experience new foods for the first time; i eat a wide range of food but i'm so used to it that it's not exciting. Tonight I ate new food. 

I was a little nervous about going to Huauchinango because although I love  mexican food, when it is "authentic" there might not be anything for vegetarians to eat. I went in and there were plenty of seats. Alright, no vegetarian tacos or burritos. no bean and rice platters. oh, oh, okay here are the quesadillas...mushroom, okay good, well lets keep looking. That's when I saw the huachitlacoyos, my choice of bean or garbanzo. sounds safe, let's do it.

A Tlacoyo is an oval shaped fried cake filled with mashed beans and topped with fire-hot salsa, chopped cactus, cilantro, lettuce and queso oaxaca. The $5 dish came with 2 Tlacoyos and they were really yummy! totally new food! I was thinking they were like arepas, except not really because they aren't made of corn and aren't pan seared. Wikipedia says they are like Salvadoran pupusas but i've not had one of those either.

So don't get my 3 star rating wrong, I really enjoyed my meal and it's wallet-friendly price tag. I wasn't surprised that there weren't more veg options. It's just not a place I will be frequent, unless i'm on a tlacoyo binge.
