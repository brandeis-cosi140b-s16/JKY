I was visiting Home Depot and went to Taco Bell as they are next to each other.  I waled to the counter to order and saw 5-6 employees taking care of drive through customers.  

There was a Taco Bell management meeting in the lobby with 5-6 other people having a planning meeting.  Unfortunately, there was no one to take my order.  I would give the rating a 1-star except for an employee from the back contacted the person who was supposed to be working the counter.  The person that came to take my order was obviously a trainee and did not know how to enter my order.  That explains why he was hiding in the back.

It was not a good experience.  I live near this Taco Bell location and will not be back anytime soon.  It was really a case of poor store management to leave a shy trainee in charge of taking customer orders.
