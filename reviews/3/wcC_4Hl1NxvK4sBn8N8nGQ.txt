Update:  Well, I still go to this location almost every day, you guys know who I am :).  I understand that places go through ups and downs, at this very moment, this location is not at its best.  Rushing on the service line has lead to some messiness -- I saw one associate put a piece of chicken that had fallen on the counter back into someones bowl.  Another time, a different associate was talking while flinging guac on a bowl and proceeded to get it all over that bowl, the counter, and the outside of my bowl that was in line behind... yuck!  The quality of the food on the line especially at opening time is spotty -- some meats are cold, no fajita veggies, sad, dry looking sofritas.  I get the impression that they don't really try anymore to be ready to serve the best food right at 11am.  I have seen some faces change, including managers, and I assume that these personnel changes are the root of the problems.  All this said, Chipotle is still miles better than most fast food in my book, and the staff here on the whole is still provides friendly service.  I hope someone reads this and tries to get back that total excellence this location had mastered in the past.
