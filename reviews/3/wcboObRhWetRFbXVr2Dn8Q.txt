Chipotle is one of my all-time favorite fast food chains for a variety of reasons. I went to this particular location several times while on a 2 week vacation to the area. Overall, I was a little disappointed as they messed up my ordered multiple times. I ordered a salad bowl and never received salad dressing. On a different trip I ordered guacamole and chips and never received the guacamole!
