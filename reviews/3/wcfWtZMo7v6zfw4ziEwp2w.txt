Bland. If you enjoy chain restaurants with watered down Mexican flavor, then this is the spot for you. Ordered a chix chimi, which had a small amount of chix which was barely seasoned; the verde chille sauce was watered down. The sopapillas, save your money & calories. The plus - convenient location off freeway, outdoor patio, a "sports" bar and the food was fresh.
