The food is fine (yes, a bean and cheese burrito can be screwed up, but I imagine it's not easy), but seriously, the employees lack in personality and ability to communicate.   It's not going to stop my visits to this place (a girl needs a burrito), but I won't spend any more time than absolutely necessary.
