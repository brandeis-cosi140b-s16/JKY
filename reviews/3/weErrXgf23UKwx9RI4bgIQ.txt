Pepe's Tacos makes a great torta. They start with a soft roll, and add your choice of meat, beans,lettuce,tomato,avocado,and salsa. Mayonnaise also comes standard, but I skip it since the sandwich doesn't need it. (I ordered the carne asada torta)

The beans and rice are average-- nothing too special. My son ordered a cheese quesadilla and really enjoyed it. This place is a good alternative to Roberto's which seems to be on every corner.
