This is good mexican food for phoenix standards (Im from SoCal) but just satisfactory overall. Serviice wasnt very friendly, but for the accomidations the the prices are reasonable.

The management made a bad decision for this restaurants value offering to customers. They should either be a fast food diner with cheap prices or an affordable alternative for dine in eaters with better service and atmosphere. They are somewhere in between and the concept just does not work well.
