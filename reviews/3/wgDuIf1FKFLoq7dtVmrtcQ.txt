Beautiful night, huge patio?  Let's do it up!

I brought some friends here who had pretty much never even been on this side of town before around 10:30 on Saturday night. Unfortunately they were not impressed with the wait for a table outside.  (Refer to first sentence. Everyone else had the same idea). After about 20 minutes of waiting and coaxing a table from 6 guys we finally sat. Beware!  Outdoor service is notoriously slow. If you're extra thirsty, grab a drink at the front bar before having a seat. 

Otherwise my Dark and Stormy really got me going!  The Sangria leaves a lot to be desired however.  Frijoles dip? Gross. Do without it. But I have to say the guacamole was fantastic!

Overall, it worked for us. Will I be dying to go there in the near future?  Probably not. But it's worth a try!

Oh, hey Mr. Security Man!

I hear there is great karaoke on Thursdays though. My opinion might change!
