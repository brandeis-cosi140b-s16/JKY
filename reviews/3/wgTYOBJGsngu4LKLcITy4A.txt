We stopped here to get a few appetizers before seeing a show at Luxor. The lady behind the bar was aware that we were in a rush and recommended which appetizers were faster to make so we could just hurry up and eat. Our food came out quickly! I had a few nachos and there were very delicious. I do recommend making a reservation of you have a larger group. There were 6 of us and we had to squish in at the bar. Overall I though the ambiance was nice and there was a little photo booth in the front of the restaurant. I also had a very drinks here and the bartender was nice enough to poor mine in a plastic cup so I could take it to go. I would like to come back when I'm not in a hurry and try some other items.
