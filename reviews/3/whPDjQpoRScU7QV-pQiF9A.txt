KoMex is a solid restaurant if your looking for a quick meal. They are located in the same parking lot as Baby Stacks on the corner of Flamingo and Buffalo. The service is pretty good and so is the food...but don't expect to be blown away. Ive been here three times, and each time has been the same...average.
