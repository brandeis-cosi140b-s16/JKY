I've come to this location several times and never had any problems. They are always fast and have my order right. Even during their happy hour.

Just took a bite of one of my tacos and got a mouth full of clear, ice cold lettuce. It's one thing for cold lettuce, but frozen lettuce? Really Taco Bell?! I had to take a star back for that one.
