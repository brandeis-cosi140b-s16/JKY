This is like one of the school cafeteria places, where there behind the glass, and they ask you what you want.  Well I got a salad, with shrimp.  My problem with this is, I think almost 10.00 for a salad is wayyyyyy over priced.  It was good, but I doubt it if I ever come back.  Unless someone else is paying for it.
