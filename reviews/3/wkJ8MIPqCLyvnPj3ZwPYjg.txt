It's cheap Mexican food.
It's hard to really mess up Mexican.

Nothing was particularly bad or good about my visit here. The fish tacos were entirely "meh" as was the guacamole.
I wouldn't say no if I was in town again and my friend wanted to come here again. But I have to believe that there are much better Mexican places on Mad-Town.
