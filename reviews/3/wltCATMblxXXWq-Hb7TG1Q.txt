Food is OK, people watching is great, drinks are good
I've been to this place a few times, only when i was in Scottsdale on business. This place has good drinks and is great for people watching. Some real lookers come into this place for happy hour. Just a good place to hang out. Food is alright, more of a nightlife place. Saint Patricks day was pretty fun here in 2006.
