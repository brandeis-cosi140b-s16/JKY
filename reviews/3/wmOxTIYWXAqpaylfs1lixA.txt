I went to El Hefe yesterday with Gare. The decor is a bit over-the-top but cool and different. Think DÃ­a de los Muertos meets Electric Ladyland. 

We sat at the bar and had the Pork Belly Torta and Carnitas Tacos. The food was tasty and even impressed my boyfriend the chef. 

I'd go back again but avoid ordering anything off their drink menu without finding out the ingredients--who knew that Four Loko is a flavored, colored alcoholic soda-like beverage that tastes like otterpops with cheap vodka? And who would want that in their margarita? 

Maybe it's a sign of the times; I'm getting old not keeping up with what's what in the world of flavored liquors. Our server was nice to comp the drink that I wasn't a fan of -- this is always a good move in the service industry. Kudos on good customer service to El Hefe.
