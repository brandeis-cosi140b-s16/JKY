The meat in my torta carne asada was dry. chewy, tough to eat and very salty. The fries that come with it were good- hot and crispy.

My companion had the Chile relleno & green chicken enchilada which was pretty good. The side of refried beans is salty, the rice is dry, and tasted like it's been sitting in the counter the whole day. Maybe it was late when we came (we went at 5:30PM) or the cook was having a bad day but this visit was not a very good experience. I'm giving it 3 stars since the server is friendly and the place is clean.
