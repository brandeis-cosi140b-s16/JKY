A nice place to have a lunch and get away.

The staff and atmosphere at Nino's is friendly and inviting. This is a calm place to have lunch, not a noisy place, mostly due to the customers and location (Sun City).

I have eaten here a few times and its worth the stop off, but it's not worth going out of your way for. Another reviewer said it best  - this is old people mexican food. The salsa lacks kick, but still has good taste. All of the food I have tried is nothing special at all and the Mexican Pizza was depressingly bland and greasy. The one shining star here is their cheese enchilada. There is just something about the quality and flavor put into the filling that surpasses more well known places.

Give them a shot if you are in the area and want to try something new. It's nowhere near 5 star quality or even 4. Unfortunately service alone can not make a restaurant for me. Food quality needs to be original and superb and this just averages out.

This is a place I will go back to, just to explore the menu and hopefully find another hidden gem in the menu.
