Funky decor; friendly, fast service. Like the casual atmosphere & open, airy dining room which is great on a nice day. Great salsa. Mixed drinks are unique and taste good but a little weak. Food is pricey.  If you're looking for untraditional flavors this is the place to go. We ordered carne tacos, quesadilla and chicken salad. Carne was sweet, which was interesting. Chicken wasn't all that great - I would almost score this place a 4 but chicken ruined it.
