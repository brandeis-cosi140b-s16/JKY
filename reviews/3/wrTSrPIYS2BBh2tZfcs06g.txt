Like Helen, below, I'm from TX... I however left here feeling very underwhelemd. We got a platter with all sort of fried things, and some tacos. The tacos weren't good.. they lacked flavor. Sadly out of the platter thingy of 5 different items, we didn't actually like any of them. I do think their crispy taco shells are top knotch though.. Service was just ok.
