Carne Asada Burrito W/ Potatoes, verdict: For the price and quantity I think your ordinary or local taco stand would do you more justice.

The service is top-notch, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere and facility looks great. The food is delicious, and actually quite different from what I'm used to.

The price is fair, for the overall experience. But in the end, my stomach is the final judge. I guess I'm just used to being served in larger quantities, because I like the idea that I can eat half of my burrito and still have half for later.

This place is great if you want an awesome place to eat, friendly staff to interact with, and get great authentic flavors out of your food.
