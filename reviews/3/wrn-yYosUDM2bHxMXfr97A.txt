I can never go wrong with Chipotle. I usually get a burrito bowl with steak which is almost always cooked a PERFECT medium rare. Add fajita veggies, pico, red salsa and guac and I have a good lunch.

I work a few blocks a way and was diasspointed that, after ordering online, they had not even started on my order. So it is usually a time saver to just walk in and order. They usually turn out your meal quickly so lesson learned:don't bother ordering online.

Other than that, the food is fresh and it's a hell of a lot better for you than McDonald's.
