My wife and I arrived about 7:15pm.  We were sat immediately and our waiter appeared shortly after.  He took our drink order and dropped off chips, salsa, and I believe a spicy sour cream dip.  The drinks arrived quickly and he took our food order.  The chips are thick and they were good as was the salsa.  We weren't sure about the sour cream stuff.  My wife ordered the steak fajitas and I ordered the Carne Asada tacos. And then we waited....and waited....and waited....it took about a half hour or more for our food to arrive.  My wife ordered hers with no lettuce and no guacamole.  They serve those items with the beans and rice.  The plate arrived with both and she told the waiter who said he would take care of it.  He was back quickly with a "new" plate on which they had just removed the wrong stuff and replaced it with sour cream.  We were unimpressed.  Also not too many of the items come with cheese.  My wife had to ask for a side of shredded cheese.  The Carne Asada was seasoned ok and there was plenty of vegetables and meat on the fajitas.  The beans were very runny.

Overall it was just an average experience.  The I don't think we'll go back.  We will stick with Abuelo's.

Maybe your experience will be better?
