Small place painted with day of the dead figures on the outside.  Inside clean and typical Mexican decor-a sombrero, some Mexican paintings and dark, hand carved furniture.  I had the enchilada and shredded beef taco lunch combo.  Also had guacamole on the side.  It was good but not outstanding, the enchilada was my favorite.  The taco shell was greasy and the shredded beef slightly dry.  The service was very good, my food came out in 5 minutes.  It was filling and a good value for the money.
