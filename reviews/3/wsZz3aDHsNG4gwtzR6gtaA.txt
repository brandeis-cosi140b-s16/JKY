Great authentic Mexico City food.  Great chips and salsa (three types of salsa arrive with your chips)

Their queso and chips appetizer is awesome, and I'm rather partial to the  Chimi.  Not the best Mexican food, but by far not the worst.

Their Margaritas are also an excellent way to stave off the Arizona heat in the summer.
