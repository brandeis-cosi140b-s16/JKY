Generic, prefabricated and typical... That's what you will experience when you visit El Monterrey. It's not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but Jesus, we need another Mexican-themed restaurant in Charlotte as much as we need a minor league baseball team downtown!

When you walk in you will feel a sense of deja vu. You've seen this place a million times in hundreds of cities around the nation. The same shitty decor, the same shitty Budweiser and Corona ads plastered tackily all over the wall. The mass-produced, made-in-china imitation "papel picado" and the cheap dining tables and chairs. You have definitely been here before. Sometimes I wonder if the same guy bought all the restaurants in the US and recycled the theme and look and simply changed the  name to keep up a false sense of diversity.

Went with Mother Dearest for lunch today and had a very unremarkable experience. Service was good and fast, food was very nice and tasted as decent as any other of these types of restaurants.

The only thing worth mentioning, and it's not really a good thing, is that with your chips and salsa they also give you a little dish of a white dip. I couldn't place it exactly but it kinda tasted like ranch and bacon. It was very artificial tasting too... maybe from a powder and cream cheese? Who knows? It wasn't horrible, but it just did't mesh well with the other stuff.

Also, for what it is, generic Mexican-themed food, it's kinda pricey. You really won't find a decent dish for under $8 on the menu after 3pm. Just thought I'd throw it out there.

All in all, going here is like going to McDonald's for a burger. You go because you're close by and it's there.
