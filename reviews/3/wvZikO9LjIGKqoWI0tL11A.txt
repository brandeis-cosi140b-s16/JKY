So the food is good but the consistency sucks. I am working on a house nearby and stopped in for lunch got an order of tacos, the cashier asked if I wanted cilantro and onion, i also ordered cheese on the side, all was well. 
Later I went when I left my job site I stopped in the second time, they added hot sauce and salsa to my tacos, I'm allergic to tomatoes, so when I complained this cashier took my food back with much resistance and the presentation for the fixed food was less than desirable... It was basically labeled GTFO
