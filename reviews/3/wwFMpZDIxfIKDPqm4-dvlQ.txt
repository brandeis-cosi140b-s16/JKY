Went for happy hour to order margaritas. Our server, who we couldn't tell if she was being overly nice or if she was patronizing us, brought us back lime juice with simple syrup. We could barely notice the "great tasting" silver tequila she was describing to us before we ordered them. Another thing I didn't appreciate was the lack of check ups she did with our table. We saw her three times during our dining experience. The food though.... Amazing. I highly recommend this place for the food. I had the veggie tacos and they were to die for.  Giving three stars because of the poor service. Would recommend this place for the food for sure. So good!
