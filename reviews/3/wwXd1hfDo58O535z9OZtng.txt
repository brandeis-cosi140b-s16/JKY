Other than those of the "-erto's" name, I haven't had much luck finding good late night burritos in Scottsdale. 

Sure, during the day there is Chipotle, or even Taco del Mar is pretty good, but the missing ingredient to my recipe for constant access to quality Mexican munchies has been the late night burrito shop. 

I tried this place last night, hoping it would close the deal, and, for a minute, I thought it had. An abundance of sour cream and melted cheese goes a long way in my book. I had all but decided when I got to the chicken inside my Texas burrito (containing sour cream, cheese, french fries, chicken, sour cream, cheese, and sour cream) I was thoroughly disappointed. It was grisly. A steak can have a knot or two in it, but chicken? This was no knot. These were chicken grisles. First it was one, then another, then another. 

The burrito was good size and cheap and was so close to perfection if it weren't for the main ingredients' shabbiness. I may give it one more go 'round with a steak burrito, but my recommendation is to avoid the chicken.
