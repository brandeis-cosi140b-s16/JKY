Good authentic Mexican food.  La Palapa started at the Public Market and moved with the Public Market to this location.  The tamales are good with the homemade mole.  Nice flavor.  Only one tamale left so decided to have a taco with it.  Tacos are good too.  The menu is limited but some good Mexican food at a good price.  The server mentioned that La Palapa uses Clarion foods beef for the beef tacos.
