3.5 stars.

We had some of the big wigs at work today, so they decided to get a couple of food trucks.  We had this one and a burger one.  In N Out is like 2 minutes away from work, so if I want a burger, I will head there.  I decided to check out Queso Good and get myself a quesadilla. 

I went with a Carne Asada Quesadilla.  Pretty simple...huge flour tortilla, melted cheese, plenty of carne asada, sour cream and guacamole.  It came with about 10 chips and I had some churros for dessert.  All of this was free because work paid for it.  Regularly priced, I think the quesadillas are about $8.00 or so.  It was pretty fat and tasted really good....especially for Phoenix (San Diego Mexican food is still far superior!). The churros were a tad skimp.  It was really like one small churro cut into about 6 pieces.  Tasty enough, but far from great.

The only reason why this place doesn't get higher than 3 stars is because of 2 things.....
1.  They were selling Cokes for $2.00.  We can buy cans of Coke at work for .25 cents.  So whoever purchased a Coke from them, is not too great in math and got ripped off!
2.  My friend had an order of their nachos.  About an hour later, they were bowing to the porcelain God.  Something in those nachos messed them up,  big time!  

If I saw them around town, would I come back?  Probably.  I would have to be in the mood though.  It was pretty tasty, filled me up and the lady working in front of the truck was pretty nice.  Can't complain!
