This place is Soooo good! Have been here a few times, but have finally decided to write a review. Aside from the chips being stale ( I always send them back for a fresh batch) and the white queso dip being really thick and cold, the service is quick and friendly. The veggie burrito is fresh and a guaranteed palate pleaser!  It comes with plantains and AMAZING slaw. This entree could easily be shared for a light meal. Boyfriend always gets the chimichanga and is never disappointed! $27 gets you two delicious entrees, chips and queso and two sweet teas. They ARE in the coupon book... so look for it to save BUY ONE GET ONE FREE ENTREE.
