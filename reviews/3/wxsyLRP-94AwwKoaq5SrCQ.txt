This is a new restaurant that's located where the Cheers used to be in the Charlotte airport. This is okay, nothing special. If you're in a hurry, it'll do -- hey, it's an airport. On my way from Asheville to Phoenix I snagged a chair at the bar where the bartender proceeded to recommend the most expensive thing on the menu. I, instead, ordered what the heck I wanted. 

Lots of TVs and a long bar, and just remember -- you're in an airport...
