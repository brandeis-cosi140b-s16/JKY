I have to admit that they're not super-consistent, but when you get a good veggie burrito it'll make your toes curl.

I actually asked what was in the special Baby Bandito sauce; while they can't exactly say, it's definitely a heart attack waiting to happen.  Worth it once in awhile.

Make sure to buy a pint of their salsa to-go...yum!
