@Rubios_BeachMex  at Red Rock Casino #Vegas

I'm always up for some Mexican Fast Food at the food court and Rubios' in one of the better choices. Located right near the Movie theater,arcade,Kids Quest and Bowling Alley its a great option to take the kids before a night out at the Resort.

Their Fish Tacos are the BOMB but this time We choose to share some of their nachos with NO meat but fully loaded with all the good stuff. $4.99 Cheap Eats Alert!!
