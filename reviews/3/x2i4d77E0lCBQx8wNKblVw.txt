Decent Mexican but far from Top Shelf.  

They are a bit overpriced for what you get as I got one taquito with beans and rice for $8.  

Salsa is a bit watery for my taste and not spicy enough.  

Rice and beans were good and that is more than a lot of Mexican places can say.  

Service was great I got a drink refill before I even asked for it and that means a lot to me.
