We'll had a bad experience with co/workers at this office the cashier and cook was talking badly about me and my son. I had to call another Roberto's in summerlin in order to reach someone. We'll the manager return my call but I could not see my self going into that store. One the manager didn't believe how much I paid for my food which i can prove. Then got talk about in Spanish by your employees. I can get this off my mind when will this Racist stuff will stop.
