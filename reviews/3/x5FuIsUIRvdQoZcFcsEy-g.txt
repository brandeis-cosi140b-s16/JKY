We are frequent diners here and love the food, but what is happening with the service?  Appears there are staffing problems.  Last time we visited was Monday following NASCAR weekend and waited a good 45 minutes for our food, after waiting 20 minutes to order. Food was still good, but just not enough staff to cover the crowd.  The staff has always been friendly and courteous, no complaints there, just not enough of them.  Is this a result of opening a second location?
