We went here for my boss' birthday dinner. The margaritas were excellent (from what I was told) & the service was descent. We had a very large party of 14, and the food still came out in a descent amount of time, and everything was hot which is always difficult to get when you come in with so many people. Overall the food quality was good... I was disappointed with the desserts however, so my only recommendation is do not go here for fried ice cream because  you will be disappointed as well.
