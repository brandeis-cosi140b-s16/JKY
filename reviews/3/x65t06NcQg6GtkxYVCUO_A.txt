Was visiting from out of town and needed to kill time, I spent several hours here. By myself. No literally, almost no one came in. There were 6 servers to every one person I'd say. I had the chips and salsa which I thought were very good, and the chicken quesadilla. I'm from the east coast, and the quesadilla wasn't anything better than what I would have at home, but it was a lot of food. The rice had undercooked pieces in it that were very crunchy. The white peach margarita is killer! So good, however, the other drinks I tried were just so so, and anything with the real lime juice was just way too sour. 

The saving grace of this place was the bartender. Sweet as could be and very accommodating. 

Over all this is not a place I would rave about, but being that it's brand new, and this is the owners first restaurant...I'm hoping there will be a lot of learning and implementing to make this place phenomenal.
