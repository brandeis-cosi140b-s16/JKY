Though this place truly looks like a dive, I had high expectations - for the food, at least - because of a glowing review I read in one of the local journals. The place looks a tad decrepit and while the tables look clean, their surfaces did have a bit of a sticky feel to them. On one occasion I had the huaracha recommended by the review I read. It was a generous portion of food and it tasted good, though it was a bit on the dry side. On a second visit, this time with my friend Rand R., I ordered a variety of street tacos - al pastor, carne asada, carnitas, and chorizo. They were very good, especially when you add the salsa offered on the side. The horchata I ordered with the tacos was good and was the perfect  accompaniment fo the tacos. In all, my dining experiences here were A-OK, though I'd rather go to Tacos Atoyac for similarly-priced  but higher-quality food ... and tables with a cleaner feel.
