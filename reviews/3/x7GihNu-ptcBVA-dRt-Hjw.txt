My main reason for the new rating is for effort. I have realized with this place too it is very important when you go there to eat. If it is during college football season when they are busy you will get a much better dinner. Other times not as good and service may not be as good. The owner is a very nice man who seems to truly care an love what he does.   

I will try this again in the fall :)
