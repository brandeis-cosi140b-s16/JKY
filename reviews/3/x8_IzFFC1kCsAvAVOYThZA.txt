There is a lot going on at SumoMaya which mostly is good.  We had a party of 6 and it was lateish for lunch but the staff seemed pretty accommodating.  My husband and I had early dinner plans and had joined 2 other couples for this outing kind of just to get out and about in Phoenix.  It seemed at first tlike we weren't going to get the best service but once we all got settled our server was on top of everything...and my anxiety of not getting to our dinner at another friends house went down.   
Anyway, the decor is really fun, bright colors and patterns, eclectic and cool with a lot of the latest (ghost chairs, ethnic striped backs for the booths, wood and metal) accents.  Two really cool decor items are the breathable walls made of faux ivy and the mirrors in the bathrooms made out of succulents.  Really fun.
The food was amazing.  We didn't eat a lot (early dinner) but we tried everything the table ordered.  Two of the best:  Rock Shrimp Tempura and Shaking Beef.  
It's lively and fun which always makes for a better experience with friends.
