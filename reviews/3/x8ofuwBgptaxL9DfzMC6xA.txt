We've eaten here about 3 times the food is good I'm able to eat gluten free this is what has brought us back . Today was a different visit the waitress made it a point to know she was just about to get off early but then we sat down. The restaurant was still supposed to be open for another 2 hours. She messed up my husband drink  order 3 times and when she would walk away she was rolling her eyes. She made us so uncomfortable for us. The bus staff was great the buser was the person  who actually helped us more then the waitress.  Because of them I'll give them another shot, but I'd definitely not go with the same server.
