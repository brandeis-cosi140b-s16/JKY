Ok, this is the first review that I have felt the need to update on Yelp. It looks like Nacho Daddy has achieved the impossible... they blended chips and cheese!! Actually since I wrote my initial review (rated them a 1) they have hired a new GM (#4?) who knows what he is doing, they have a new kitchen manager (# who knows) and have cut down the menu to a point where they can actually achieve a high level of execution. I think they have finally reached a level of competency in which a business can begin to win over customers and become successful. 

For this I will move them up to a 3 of 5... but that is because I still hold my breath when I walk in and order. I keep expecting them to mess up my order, but they seem to have a renewed energy and I think its because they are finally on the right track.

Lets be clear. The service was never the issue here. It was always that the Management staff (GM and Kitchen Manager) could never find a consistent formula that worked. Now that the issue seems to be solved the food is reflective and its worth giving them another chance.

 Its now save to eat the Nachos!! 

PS. Keep it up and I will have no problem changing the rating to a 4... its that much better these days!
