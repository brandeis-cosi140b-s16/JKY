This place was pretty good. It's worth going for lunch or a quick dinner. It's a casual, fun place with tons of different nacho options. I got tacos and my girlfriend got nachos which were both good. The margaritas were way too sweet though, I wouldn't recommend those unless you love really sugary drinks.
