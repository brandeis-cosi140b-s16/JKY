Came here for a birthday party. Immediately ordered a margarita. Was not impressed. Very watered down, could not taste the tequila and the mix they use was way too sweet. Not worth 9 dollars so I switched to beer. For dinner I got the taco plate and chose the BBQ pork and the falafel taco. Very good. Would order again. I wish the pork had a little more vinegar taste but was still good. Service was okay but slow. Took 10 minutes to get another canned beer but the waiter was nice. It was a better experience overall then the food and drinks.
