I have to compare Panchero's to Chipotle because that's exactly what it is in almost every aspect.

I ordered a steak burrito and loaded it up with just about everything that didn't cost extra.

After it was said and done, I had a $7 burrito that wasn't bad, but was lacking in a couple areas. I don't think the portion size is as large as chipotle, and I also think the meat quality isn't as good either, but it was hard to tell as my burrito had a lot of rice. I did like how they mixed everything up before rolling, I feel that sometimes the ingredients are too segregated. Veggies are also extra whereas at Chipotle I do not believe they are. 

Panchero's might have a better quesadilla than chipotle, though. It was interesting to see how they quickly they heat it up like that!

I was also a fan of the salsa verde, as well as the free sauce they have on the condiment table, surprisingly spicy and good.

Overall I liked it but still think Chipotle might be better. I didn't know this was a chain until I looked it up, but it is. I was also given a punch card where when I buy 10 entrees I can get a free one. This might be useful if it was in a better location, at least for students!

3/5 just OK but still way better than most fast/junk food garbage.
