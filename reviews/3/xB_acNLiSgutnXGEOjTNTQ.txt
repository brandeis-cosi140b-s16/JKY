Decent.  Not great, but decent.  The flautas were over cooked, and it looked like the chimi was also.  Very friendly, attentive wait staff, who took care of us when the food was delayed due to kitchen issues.  Beautiful two-story interior with rustic decor.  Wound up here after walking out dissatisfied with Toby Keith's, and do not regret the decision.  Matta's is a family place with roots going back in the area decades.  Recommended!
