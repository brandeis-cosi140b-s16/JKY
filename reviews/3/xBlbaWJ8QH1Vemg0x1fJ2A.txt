This place is a great local spot where you can see a lot of the same faces.  I wouldn't recommend the food as much as the atmosphere and drinks.  I have eaten here several times and it's just okay.  If you sit on the bar side it's obvious sometimes that your food sits for a while before you get it because they have to run to the main restaurant to get it.  

If you stay a while on the bar side plan on walking to the bar to get your drinks especially if it's busy.  The table service in the bar is lacking, unless the bartender named Julie is working and she is great.  I have seen other bartenders stand around and BS with the regulars while people at my table and I have empty drinks.  

They have live music sometimes which is great.  Several TV'S and they are great about having sports on.  The beers on tap are pretty basic with some strange ones taking up tap space like Moosehead and Pacifico.  The complimentary chips and salsa are great .  It's a little pricy compared to other sports bars but I have to consider the location.  

I will be back, maybe just won't eat.
