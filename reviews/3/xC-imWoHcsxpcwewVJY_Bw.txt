It's hard to find a Mexican food spot that isn't a complete hole in the wall or super expensive. Gallo Blanco and Otro are that happy medium. Good food, good ambiance, good service, good price. It was nice to finally go to a restaurant where we didn't have to shout over one another. It was nice and quiet and we could enjoy our time together. The chicken paella was awesome! I would highly recommend it. We have had the tacos at GB so didn't go that route and tried a burrito. We shoulda stuck with the tacos, they are awesome. So next time we will. But get the paella!
