Decided to try Los Compadres since they were mentioned in Phoenix Magazine.  I don't know who they talked to, but the food was OK.  I guess my expectations were higher because of Phoenix Magazine.  I had the cheese enchiladas, and there was nothing unique about them.  This is Mexican food for non-Mexicans.  I give three stars because it was not terrible...but, I can open a can of enchilada sauce and make my own.  Sorry.
