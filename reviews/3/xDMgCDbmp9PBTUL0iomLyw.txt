We used to love Serrano's. It was definitely our go to Mexican Restaurant. However, the last several times we went, the service was poor. It appeared as if they needed more servers. Our waiter was slow (or too busy) to attend to our table.  
The food is good. The salsa is great and it's nice to get the bean dip as well. Overall, I would still recommend it if you're not in a hurry.
