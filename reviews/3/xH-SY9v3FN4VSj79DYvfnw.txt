I agree with other comments that this Chipotle is situated in horribly designed and under-sized parking lot. My advice is to park in the Citibank parking lot across the way and walk over if the lot looks busy. In the long run it is quicker to do that and walk than sit in your car and wait for the constant shuffling of cars occurring in front of the store

The food is pretty good, when they have enough of it prepared. Often times I go in there and they are out of either chicken, steak, or both and as a result there is a long line of people standing there waiting all staring at their phones. All of this is while some worker back by the grill is frantically grilling or cutting up steak or chicken. I get nervous that the usually young person cutting is going to hack a finger off at the speed they are going. 

One time I went in there and both doors were propped open and the place smelled of smoke and the person at the counter said they only had the barbacoa because their "grill was broken." It certainly smelled like it was working to me, albeit a little too well. I tried the barbacoa  and it was way to spicy for my taste. 

The steak can be hit or miss with it being either a perfect medium or tough and well done. The safe bet is usually the chicken.
