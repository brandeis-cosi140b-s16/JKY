Stopped by for dinner on July 7.  It had been several months since we stopped in.  We always enjoy their food.  It's the service that continues to lack and disappoint.  We asked one of the employees to clean some tables for us as the tables that were in the shade were all dirty and had old food on them.  She said "ok" but never came out to clean them.  We barely found a small 2 person table that was semi clean.  We will probably be back but not for a little while.
