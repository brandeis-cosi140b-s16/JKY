I love coming here because I can order a delicious vegan salad bowl with cilantro dressing and whole wheat tortillas! And it's a great place to come with friends after classes at unlv. 

The only reason I am giving this place three stars is that their service is poor. Always rushing you even when there's no line, and have no manners. And I am not judging off of one employee, they are like that every-time, but only at this location.  But it's in such a convenient location so I keep coming back. So if u know what u want in ur burrito, salad,.. Etc, don't let them rush you and get what u deserve! ;p
