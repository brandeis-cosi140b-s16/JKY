The atmosphere is very niche and old-fashioned meets hipster.  Reminds me of a few places I like in Philly.  I dig it.  A lot of the decor seems original, which is good, except for the huge hole in the floor under my bar stool.  The food was tasty and although the menu was short, they had a diverse selection with thoughtful flavor ideas.  I finished my meal without the bartender checking on me to see how things were or if I needed anything.  At the end I asked about taking my chips and bean dip home and the bartender informed me that they don't have take-out containers because they don't serve food to-go.  "Sorryyyyyy" she said as if I was supposed to throw my food away or put in in my pocket.  I ended up scooping the dip into foil and putting the chips in a bag.  I also made a suggestion to a woman with short hair next to me (seemed to be doing managerial things) that they should post their kitchen hours on their site since they differ from their operating hours.  She asked me "WHY?" in a snotty tone and I explained that since they don't answer their phone (their voicemail tells you to email them!?!) I was not sure if I would be able to eat.  I don't drink alcohol and my primary concern on Monday nights is checking out new restaurants.  Had I come down and their kitchen was not open I would be giving RCC even less stars.  She told me she would add it to their site in a still crappy tone.  I may go back but I'm not sure how soon.
