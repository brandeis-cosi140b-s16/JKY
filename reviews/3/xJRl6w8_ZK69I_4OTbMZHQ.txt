When I was here, I got heat stroke. There was a party in the back room, and everyone was crowding the bathrooms and I was sick. It sucked. 

While out in the restaurant, I had ordered a carne asada quesadilla. It sat and waited for me, as did the rest of the group. We came here to watch the last Lakers vs. Suns game. And yes, I did get to see the Suns lose in their home town. That was cool. (Los Suns jerseys or not, they aren't doing much to help end the hate there). 

The quesadilla tasted like a cheeseburger when I finally did get around to eating and stomaching it. I wasn't a fan of that. 

....@#$! AZ and their racist laws.
