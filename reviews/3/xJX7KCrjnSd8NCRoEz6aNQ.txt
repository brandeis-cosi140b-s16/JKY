I guess the one star review are for folk who had their burritos and plates and left hungry.  That was me after I had their Carne asada plate.  They gave me three small corn tortilla and the portions of the meat were pretty small.  Extra sauce and soda refills cost extra.

But apparently their tacos are supposedly cheap and good, which might be their saving grace, giving them benefit of a doubt and good reviews from others, they get another star.  

The 3rd star is for the pretty friendly staff and their really good spicy red sauce salsa.  The owner is an old man and he is very friendly and will help recommend u different items to try, like chicharon tacos and such.  His son is a little more quiet but service with a smile and efficient.

I think I prefer Rivas to this place as they make a decent plate with giant portions.  Only thing this place has above Rivas is their really spicy hot sauce.  The red sauce in a bottle is done right :). Also their asada is nicely grilled and almost every piece is a little crispy.  I guess the right way to do this is buy their sauce and bring it down the road to rivas :)

So perhaps if they improve their salsa bar, Increase their portion size to the price level and touch up some of the paint on the wall, they would come in with 5 stars.  Otherwise they are a 3 star hole in the wall spot with sit down prices.
