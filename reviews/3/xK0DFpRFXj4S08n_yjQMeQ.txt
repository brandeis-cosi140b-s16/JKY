"what would you like for dinner lady?"my hubby asked me and I said "I would like chicken tacos from La Bamba" and he said "ooook",  as you can tell he is not a big fan of this place but we have some tacos from this place from time to time. 

I admit it is a very simple place and the food it is not the best one; however the way I asked for my tacos to be done it convert them to a better and tastier version that I happen to like a lot. Ok, I will reveal my secret to you just because I think it is not fair to keep it all to myself:

1) I asked the guys to toast the tortillas longer (they get a little bit crunchy)
2) I asked them to put cheese in between the two tortillas (you have to ask for it at the same time they put the tortillas on the griddle).
3) I am a chicken lover so they add shreded chicken to my tacos (I think chicken it is the best option here).
4) for toppings, I only ask for lettuce, cilantro and avocado.

Last but not least, ask for hot sauce and some lime wedges on the side. Once I get home I put a little bit of salt to my tacos, some hot sauce and lime juice and for me, it is like a mariachi singing in my ear. I recommend the tacos that way, so buen provecho! ;)
