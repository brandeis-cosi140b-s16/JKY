So once again this would be part of the top five lunch spots that I drive to weekly as the "lunch b***h" for work. I do like that every time I go in, I am greeted by the same shy girl at the front who basically knows my whole order w/o second glance. I have only tried a few things here, but everything I have tried has been pretty darn good. My bosses, and I particularly, enjoy the chicken salad. Sadly they used to have a $3.99 special, but now it is back to the regular 6-7 bucks. They have a really great achiote dressing and the salads are pretty big. But I have to say I have a new favorite with the shredded beef burro. Classically simple, chunks of beef with beans and cheese. Whatever they marinate their meat is awesome, and I am generally not a meat fan. Long story short, skip the Fili B's on every corner, and venture into the strip mall. Can't beat the $1.99 margaritas either!
