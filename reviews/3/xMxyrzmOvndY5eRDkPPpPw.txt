We came here for my bf's holiday work party and got the whole pace rented out. I didn't have high hopes for this spot since they only have a 3 star rating on Yelp. Since it was buffet style, we got to sample a large variety on their menu.

I didn't have anything to drink from the bar, but I heard the drinks were good and strong. 

For appetizers we had taquitos and empanadas. I love fried food so I was hoping that this would be good. The taquitos were crunchy and had a good flavor to them. I enjoyed these a lot with guacamole. The chicken empanadas weren't so good. The chicken was really mushy and it was filled with this weird tasting sauce. I didn't know empanadas were supposed to be wet inside. 

For the main course we had beef fajitas. This was actually pretty good. The meat was tender and had a good amount of spice, but not burn your mouth hot. Their tortillas were warm and soft. I think I ate 3 of them. The rice and beans were typical, but edible. The steamed vegetables were way over cooked and reminded me of baby food. 

I was really excited for dessert since I have a huge sweet tooth. When they brought out the churros, that was the highlight of my meal. These were solid churros! Deep fried, sugary goodness. 

Overall, this was better than I had expected. I don't know if I would come here again on my own, but I wouldn't be opposed if someone else picked this spot.
