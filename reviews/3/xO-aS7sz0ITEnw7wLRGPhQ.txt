So what can you say about a place named Del Taco. For a number of years I have had a very special friend in my life. When he would say he was going to Del Taco I assumed he meant Taco Bell and was saying it backwards.  LOL to my surprise Del Taco does exist. Not in the Midwest but definitely on the west coast. 

So I decided to give this Del Taco place a try. Wow when they say macho they mean it. Not fully understanding I said macho, thinking it was large like any other fast food establishment. Bam what seemed like a pound of fries in a large cup came with my taco. Who knew tacos and fries. Back to the fries though. I am in love. Not only has the food always been hot each time I have come here, the fries continue to live up to the very first ones I experienced. Although they are not made fresh in the establishment like others, they are always flavored just right. They aren't over or under cooked, nor are they greasy. I'm not so impressed with the burgers here, nor the tacos. Guess they are just better made at home. 

I've never been inside the establishment, so I can't speak on the inner cleanliness. I usually just do late night drive thru. The attendant is always kind and respectful. The wait is always less than 3 minutes, a huge plus. 

Three stars do to I don't think I can actually give it more until I experience the inside of the place. 

I'm in love with fries, they don't find fault in our relationship, nor do they check up on me! LOL comfort food at its best.
