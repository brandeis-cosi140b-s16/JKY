Went with a group of 11.  Service was decent, what can you expect with a large group?  Ordered the mixed fajitas and asked for the black beans instead of the refried beans.  Food was ok, nothing to write home about.  Total was $38 including tip for one plate of fajitas and one margarita ... a little pricey.
