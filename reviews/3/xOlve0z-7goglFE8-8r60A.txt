Typical Vegas resturant... big price little food... ordered the three taco plate, it was good, rice and beans were good... BF started with the 11$ spinach salad... it was really tasty and almost worth that high price. I ordered the $5 happy hour wine and it was awful.. Id stick with beer in the future. Was decent but had better mexican in vegas.. the atmosphere was nice sitting on their 'patio' by the water where the gondolas passed.
