The wife and I had dinner at Macayo's last night.  Since it's winter time in Arizona, the snowbirds are flocking to the warm weather and all the restaurants are really busy...including Macayo's.  The service was slow, but adequate...we eat here all year long and the service is much quicker in the summer.  The food was about average.
