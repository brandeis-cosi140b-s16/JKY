KOBE BEEF TACOS!!!! Melts in your mouth, literally. The tacos came with a pineapple salsa that I didnt think was gonna go good with it but they made the tacos and I usually dont like fruity salsas.  Girlfriend got the chicken enchiladas and they werent that hot (good). It had a pablano puree and it wasnt that tasty and didnt go with the enchiladas. 

The staff was really good and friendly, the server knew a lot about the courses and how they were prepared. 

Ambiance was, eh. Personally didnt really like it. 

All in all, I would go again but would be scared to venture the menu and would stick with the kobe beef tacos.
