Food was ..meh. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. 

In the beginning, they serve chips and have a salsa bar where you can get salsa for your chips & more chips. Next, I ordered a seafood enchilada because my server recommended it! It really fell short of any standards of Mexican that I've ever had. Yeah, so overall, Food = not top tier. 

The service that I got here was okay; Since everyone has been using their Groupon, there was a pretty long wait time. But, the staff was super friendly and always coming around to check on our table! 

I think the thing that I got the most excited about was the drink! Garduno's is a margarita factory, and I was pleasantly surprised! They make some pretty bomb margaritas! Some of the fruity ones are a bit too sweet, but they are pretty tasty!!! To get away from the margarita craze, I also ordered a melon mojito :) A little bit strong, but it was delicious! They were damn cheap too! $7 for most drinks I ordered, which made my wallet happy. 

If you don't like the food, try staying for the drinks. Next time I'm here, I'm definitely only going for the drinks!
