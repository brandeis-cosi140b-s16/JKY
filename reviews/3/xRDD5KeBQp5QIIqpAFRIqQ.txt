OK, but don't talk about customers when they are 3 feet away.
I went in for lunch by myself, went in the street door, they sent me back to a waitress/hostess station to be seated.  Other people came in after me ( I was there shortly after they opened) and they let them seat themselves where they wanted.  The waiter seemed upset I was not ordering a mixed drink, I was just looking at the menu to see what they had for future visits.  The food, taco salad was okay...then I waited and waited and waited about 25 minutes for my bill, which was not brought by the person who originally waited on me, I asked for a tea in a to-go cup, the girl said unsweet, I said no sweet, she said okay, unsweet, they brought the bill, which I already had the money out for and left it. Then brought tea, I asked was it sweet, she said unsweet, I told her I had asked for sweet, they finally took the money for the bill, and then the original waiter finally came back and asked did I need the bill.  I heard this girl laughing and telling someone at the station that I kept changing my mind back and forth, no I ordered sweet tea from the beginning.  If you are going to laugh at customers and complain, you should not do it three feet away from them.
