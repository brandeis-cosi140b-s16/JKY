This place is a hit or miss. Unfortunately, it's a miss for me. I came here for brunch and I had 2 tacos + rice and black beans. The food was decent. They serve it really neat and pretty compared to a regular Mexican place. I was so disappointed you had to pay for chips and salsa :( For the size I think it's a little bit overpriced - although it is understandable due to the location. 

The drinks? For a tequila bar I think the drink menu is underwhelming. I've tried the sparkling pomegranate and perfect patron margaritas - they're ok. I've had better and cheaper margaritas before.

The nice thing is they have outside seating in the summer!
