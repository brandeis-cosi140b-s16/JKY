price- reasonable
staff -helpful and attentive
portions - huge(enough for two, if you get the chimichanga plate)
food- too salty, as u know when you cook or add anything with cheese, it has it's own salt, no need to add more to the meats...pls kill the salt and then you can taste the goodness of the food...ty
