Went there 2x last year.  Terrific food.  Bread pudding dessert was incredible.  Attentive service.  Beautiful courtyard in the back.  Magical and romantic.  But then the negatives...inside was so dark I could not see the food.  Wait staff carry flashlights so customers can see what they are eating...ridiculous.  waitress said they get complaints all night about the dim lights but the owner refuses to turn them up!!!  It is a little pricey...but ok...I'll pay because the food is really that good...but if they don't turn the lights up so I can see what I am eating then I will not be back.  There is no excuse for such a poorly lit restaurant.  Cannot read the menu, cannot see the food.  Wake up owner...whoever you are...turn the lights on please...you ruin an otherwise amazing dining experience.  ...It was so dark I could barely find the silverware...no kidding!
