If you find yourself in Scottsdale and want a decent choice of margaritas, check this place out. The drink list alone was like a mini-encyclopedia of margaritas with all sorts of tequila and flavor options. The strawberry one (the Skinny Dip) was very tasty and not too sweet and the happy hour house margarita was decent too. In addition, the guac was just right and it came with a huge bowl of warm salty chips.  Can't say I've done a lot of comparisons around town, but I'd be up for tying out the Salty again if I'm in the area. The bonus is that that service was superfast and friendly.
