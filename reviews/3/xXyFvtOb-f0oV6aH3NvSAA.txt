Returned for another dinner with friends last night... 
While the food was still A-OK, the service was not.  Our waiter didn't check on us very often, and we waited several times for water refills, salsa refills, and to pay the bill.

I don't recommend Julio's if you are in a hurry, but it's still a decent place to fill the Mexican craving!
