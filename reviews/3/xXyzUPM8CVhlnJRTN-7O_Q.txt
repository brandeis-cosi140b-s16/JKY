If they could just be consistent I could give more stars. It's complete yin/yang here. The gal that makes the tortillas, she is the most consistent. (Delicious by the way) but the people that plate the food seem to lack training in what the Cafe Rio standard portion size is. I say, go at lunch time. About every 3rd person in line gets screwed. Hope you aren't that person.  if you are lucky, great portions. If your not, well, you'll be upset when you see the plate in front as well as behind you.
