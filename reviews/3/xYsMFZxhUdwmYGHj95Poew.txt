The first thing to remember is that the portions are huge and the plates are always burning hot. Every time I visit, I come away with a plate full of left overs. Do not expect to find any fancy dishes here, the food is what you may find at a comidas caseras type of place in Mexico. The Mexican food here has the tastes of Sonora and is full of flavor.

There have been two items that have been ordered that I really did not like. The chilaquiles during breakfast and fried fish for dinner. The fried fish was almost burned and super oily. The chilaquiles are smothered in sauce, which I had never seen. It must be a Sonora thing. You can not go wrong here if you order something that is grilled, whether it be tacos de carne asada, pollo asado, or a parrillada, etc. The enchiladas and chile rellenos are good, but again they are smothered in sauces which is not typical from the part of Mexico my family is from.

Bottom line, this restaurant serves good Mexican food, the portions are huge, and is inexpensive.
