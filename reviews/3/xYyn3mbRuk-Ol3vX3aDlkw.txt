Miguel's is definitely not a hip place, but the people know how to make a proper fajita! 

They have cheap drinks and wine. My Merlot was what you'd expect for just over $3, and it was chilled, but it washed down some good steak, chicken and shrimp fajita (the highlight of my dinner, for sure). The salsa was also kickin' (mild!), although I think the chips were bland. I also splurged and got a fried ice cream, even though I was stuffed... Big mistake , but it was tasty. 

I would give 3.5 stars, but it's not an option.
