I had never been to a La Salsa before, but my friend who lives in town convinced me to join him for a bite to eat and some drinks the other night.  He said La Salsa's are located all over town, and that they are pretty consistent.  I decided to give it a try.

The food was surprisingly good, but the woman serving at the bar was a character.  We asked how her day was going and she replied with "I am torn up".  I didn't ask if she had eaten the food.

The carnitas were very good.  I had a beer.  My friend (a bartender) ordered a drink that required a snifter.  It was funny because he watched the bartender wash his glass in a sink with dirty plates in it and then dry the inside of the glass with her bar rag.  He was grossed out.  I reminded him the alcohol killed any germs.

My advice is to get a table because what you don't know won't hurt you.
