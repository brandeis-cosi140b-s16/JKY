My husband and I were at sportsman warehouse and decided to grab lunch before heading back to tempe. I had been wanting Mexican food we decided to try it. We stopped in on a Saturday morning around 10:30 it took a couple of minutes to acknowledge us before someone greeted us and offered to seat us. The outdoor patio looked really cute but there was not an open table so we choose inside. We looked over the lunch menus and sat for several minutes before being greeted. We order water and my husband asked about breakfast. He was brought a breakfast menu to look at. A few more minutes passed and we ordered our food and was brought a basket of chips and two salsas. The chips were slightly warm and had good flavor. The salsa was ok at best. After 10 or so minutes we were checked on and we asked for more water. Our food took about 20 minutes to get. We were seated outside the kitchen and it sounded a bit unorganized. We were brought our food and then left. Husband had pancakes and strawberries which he said was pretty good. Ordered a crab relleno  with rice and beans. The releno  was small but not greasy like most. Inside was just lots of imitation crab. The rice and beans were okay but nothing special. No one checked on us until we were finished with our meals. And then we were just given the check no offer for desert or anything. We were in a hurry at this point as we had an appt. to make. The tab was almost 17.00. Not wanting to wait any longer I left a 20.00 and we left. 
Would I go back again? Probably not. Perhaps if I was in the area and not in a hurry? The food was pretty decent the service lackluster and overall atmosphere just ok.
