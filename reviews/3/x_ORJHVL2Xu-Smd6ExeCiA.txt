Not too shabby. This place has burritos, tacos, tortas and breakfast options. They are pretty reasonably priced as well. Ordered a Chorizo Torta and it comes with refried beans and Spanish Rice. $8.49 for that was incredibly fair. The Torta bread was soft and allowed the meats and veggies to shine. The bummer was the chorizo because it was carnitas. Oh well didn't realize the mistake until I was In the air over Dallas. The meal was good just be sure to check your order.
