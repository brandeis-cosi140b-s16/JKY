Okay, let me start out by saying the food and drinks are definitely 5-star worthy. The service is not. As everyone is saying, I hope and expect it to improve quickly (I was there the opening night) or I will be very disappointed.

Pros:
SANGRITA! I could drink this stuff all day, it's amazing. Really.
Chips and salsa - dig the tomatilla
Tequila flights - good selections and inexpensive
Margaritas - some really creative ones there, I got honey BBQ
Flavors - I ordered the enchiladas de verduras, and it was probably one of the best enchiladas of my life, no lie!

Cons:
An HOUR AND A HALF wait between the appetizer and entree
The entree was way too small for $15, regardless of the taste. And it was served lukewarm instead of hot, after an hour and a half wait.
Beer list - I get that it's a tequila bar, so I find this acceptable. Still a bad list though.
The staff...

Probably the most disappointing aspect was the complete lack of interest in the wait staff and bartenders. Not once did anyone mention that it was the opening night, to please excuse the wait, to ask what we thought (really??), or even "how is everything?" but instead was only asked "would you like another drink?" I was expecting some more spunk and personality from the staff but was sadly received with some kind of fake peppiness and a total disregard for us for a full hour while we waited for the food. No apologies, no excuses, no explanations, just asks for refills on our margaritas. I wish someone would have asked what we thought, because it would make me more confident that some of these problems would be ironed out.

Regardless, I WILL be returning here, and if the service stays slow and the food doesn't totally meet it's mark, I'll still be back for drinks and chips here, for sure. The food isn't cheap so I can't see the prices justified as long as the wait is slow and the staff is inattentive. We'll see, because I really want to like this place.
