This is good hole in the wall Mexican Food.  It can be hard to find if you have never been before.  It is located inside a Mercado that is closed off from the street.

The food I have tried here is all solid.  If you are into Menudo (can't say I've tried it) they serve it on the weekends and I heard it is really good from a couple of regulars that live in the area.

I wouldn't say I would go out of my way to visit this restaurant, but if you are in the area and want solid and cheap Mexican food, check out Del Yaqui.

Oh, and the owners are quite nice to top it off!
