I've had so many friend hype up Roberto's to me for so long. I've been told that this place is the ish after a long night of drinking, particularly because their open 24 hours a day. But I can't say it really lived up to my expectations. While yes, this place was good-- it just wasn't anything special. It isn't fair that the day I went here was while I was on my cross country road trip, and had the best burrito of my life in Arizona. For this, I would go back and give them another shot. 
I had a vegetarian burrito, my go to order, with beans and rice. My theory on Mexican food: you can always judge a place based on their rice and beans, and the chips and salsa. Green salsa was really good. Burrito was good, just nothing great. Beans and rice, again good, just nothing to fall in love with.  
The service wasn't anything outstanding, but very efficient.  
Would I try it again? Sure.  But, I feel that there could be better out there.
