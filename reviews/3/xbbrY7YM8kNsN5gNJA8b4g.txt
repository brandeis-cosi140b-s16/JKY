They load you up with food here, it's a buffet of beans, cheeses, and salsa.  I still prefer Chipotle, but they do have good Mexican beers here and that is always a great treat at lunch.  I can really never finish my platter in a single setting, so I save it for a midnight snack.  I have noticed that the food gets a little soggy later, but that is expected in a Tex-Mex dish.  I thought their guacamole tasted extra fresh and delicious, but overall it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.  Good place for a quick lunch on the run.
