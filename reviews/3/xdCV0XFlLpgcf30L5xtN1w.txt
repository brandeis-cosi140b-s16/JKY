This place is clean and the servers friendly. The beans are lard free! Plus for vegetarians like me. The burrito is standard... it's nothing special, and the flavors don't pop... but if I'm craving a burrito filled with beans and rice and guac, I can walk over to TDM. I like the price on the combo special, and the punch card for every $5 spent. (Double punches on Mondays!)
