This is a pretty okay place.  The food is Americanized for sure; it's decent but a bit bland.  I had to douse my burrito with hot sauce both times I was there.  Major thumbs up for running with the notion that one should be able to sit at a bar and eat a taco that doesn't taste like bar food, though.  They are open late, which makes me happy, and never seem to be very busy during the day.
