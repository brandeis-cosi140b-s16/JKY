Great food, service, atmosphere, and margaritas... ruined by horrific lighting.. awful/bright fluorescent lighting!  Too bad..., such an easy change would make the ambience so much better!

Glad the place has not been updated!  Love the authentic feel.. there's already too many 'new' places in Scottsdale, we don't need another.

Hated the salsa served in a carafe to pour on a plate!  Who thought that would be enjoyable?!!

A Mexican restaurant with only three margaritas on the menu?  Where's the silver coin?

Loved the food and great service!!
