I visited this restaurant while in the Charlotte area. Seeing that it is in a shopping center, the restaurant has a pretty good size--they were able to accommodate my 30+ coworkers while there for a business dinner. I was not impressed by their beef or chicken impanada or their saled (the ranch did not taste like traditional ranch dressing). My chimichonga was ok, but if you are used to your chimichonga shell being soft, make sure you tell them NOT to deep fry it. The Chimichonga is a very big portion. I tasted their lime(house) margarita and was not impressed. But I also had the strawberry and a mango & pina colado swirl margarita (VERYYYY GOOD). You can ask them to mix the flavors if you like. I am not a fan of tart margarita's, so I would not recommend the house margarita but I would recommend any another flavor--mango, strawberry, etc. The Chips, salsa, and queso dip were RIGHT on the mark and did not fail me! Salsa was not to spicy and queso was sooooo good! If you go on Monday nights, they have drink specials so be sure to ask your waitress! If I was to go only for chips, salsa, queso and margaritas-- I would give them a 5 but due to their food I would have to say a 3!
