I had no idea this place existed in Caesars. I had no idea the forum shops even went back this far!

I actually stopped in here on my birthday for a margarita and some guacamole with friends. Guac was fantastic, margarita was strong, service was there.

Menu looked standard, food looked standard, place looked like a solid, standard choice for Mexican, but no great shakes.
