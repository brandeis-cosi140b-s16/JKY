Recently visited Border Grill for lunch due to it's close proximity to the Mandalay Bay Convention Center. Overall, the food was good. I ordered the grilled fish tacos and while good, they really were not anything special. The service was great though and the bar area had nice ambiance. I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again but definitely one of the better places near the Convention Center if that is where you find yourself :)
