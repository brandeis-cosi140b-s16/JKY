I ordered the half-and-half, which is half of a sandwich and a cup of soup. My sandwich was the Mexican grilled cheese, and my soup was sweet corn. The half-and-half is $12, which is ridiculously overpriced for the portion size. My sandwich was teeny (about 4 x 4 x 1 inches (who says food reviews can't have math?)), and the soup was about a full 8-oz cup. I was still hungry at the end of my meal. For $12, I really don't want to be hungry after I polish off my food. 

The service was pretty good, and the food itself was decent tasting, comparable to Panera Bread and other sandwich chains. 

The decor and furniture were also really, really cute, but I won't be returning.
