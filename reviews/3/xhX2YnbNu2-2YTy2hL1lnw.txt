I really wanted to like this place. It's a great concept and it seems family owned.  I think with a few tweeks they can actually get it right.  I've been twice and both orders had the same problems. 

First,  the burritos are small.  On top of the already small burrito,  most of the scant filling is veggies or rice.  The amount of protein is relatively small.  Several bites had no protein at all. I was still hungry after both meals. 


I had the Seoul, a pork Korean inspired burrito.  Barely any pork.  A LOT of cabbage which made it rather bland.  Then I had the Seattle, a fish burrito with barely any fish and lots of cabbage. 

For the price (around $7) the should be a lot more meat in them and the meat is it what contained the flavor.  It would solve the bland problem.
