I really enjoyed the atmosphere of Carlsbad Tavern.  We chose to sit outside where it was cool and isolated from the rest of Scottsdale, although the inside looked cozy and inviting.

Our service was great as well, unobtrusive yet on the ball.  Our iced teas were refilled quickly and our waitress always seemed to be right there when we needed her without hovering.

But the food wasn't that impressive.  It wasn't bad, and I probably made a bad menu choice: I ordered a steak at a place specializing in New Mexican cuisine.  For $21 I expected a steak of a bit higher quality than what I received.  It was difficult to cut and had none of the grilled flavor that I was anticipating, but it was smothered in a decent creamy peppercorn-laden sauce.  However, the mashed potatoes and veggies were great. The potatoes were loosely mashed with good amount of spice added that was noticeable but not overwhelming.  The veggies were a nice variety and not overcooked.

Again, the food wasn't bad, but not as good as I was expecting for the price.  I would go back for one of the menu items that is more in line for a restaurant specializing in New Mexican cuisine, but I'll go elsewhere when I've got a hankerin' for a good steak.
