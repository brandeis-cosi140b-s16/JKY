Fellow Yelper & co-worker Nadia C convinced me to give Aya & Peilas a try, and I'm glad I did.  I can now add it to my list of good Mexican food joints near where I work, bringing the total to five.

I've tried both the green & red chile burros, and both were great!  The sauce is very robust and just spicy enough for me (for some probably not spicy enough).  They've got a lot of other offers too, along with lunch specials, and even gringo food. 

It is a pretty small place, but you can takeout and the wait is very minimal.  

All in all, another great Mexican restaurant find for those who work near the Capitol or are okay with traveling a bit West on Van Buren.
