Zapata's, tu es OK, amigo.

No muy bueno, no muy mal. Tu es asi asi.

Seriously folks - Zapata's is great for those people who don't love Mexican food. Or who don't like spicy things. Or who have 5 kids to feed with the purchase of 1 entree on Tuedays (or whatever day that is).

But for those true Meh He Cano cuisine lovers out there, skip Zapata's and come to East Charlotte to party with the authentic places. If you don't want to drive that far, head to Stonecrest and enjoy some Cantina 1511. But don't waste anytime here - you'll leave saying "Eh... it was alright" and to be honest, life's too short to eat OK Mexican food.
