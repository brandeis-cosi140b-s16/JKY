I have been here several times and I think it's pretty good.  I like the bean dip that they bring with the salsa but I wish the salsa was spicy!  I like to go for lunch since they have a $6.95 lunch special and there's alot of choices on the lunch special.  Would I say it's my favorite place?  No....but it's decent and the service is always good.
