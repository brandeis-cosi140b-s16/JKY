Three Amigos is Okay.  I've been here about 4 times so far, at least twice with coupons. I don't have anything very bad to say, but nothing very good either.

The restaurant is very small and dive-ish which is kinda cool. I've had servers that were decent, but this past Friday night our server was horrible. She forgot the queso we ordered, our beers, and left us without water refills for way too long (which is just cruel when you're eating spicy salsa!)

The quality of the food is simple. It's definitely NOT hyper-processed and packaged... but it's not super fresh and top of the line either.

There's not a lot of vegetarian things listed on the menu, but they can alter most of the options to be veggie friendly by substituting zucchini, onions, and tomatoes. No special seasonings with the veggies, just chopped and seared. I don't like the refried beans. I do like the chips and salsa. The mole sauce is good.

On the whole, I might come here again, but Three Amigos is far from my first pick of Mexican fare. Thumbs up for being local and NOT a chain. But thumbs down for terrible service when they're busy and boring food.
