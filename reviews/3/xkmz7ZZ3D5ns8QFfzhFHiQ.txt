I was surprised by the interior. It doesn't look or feel like a typical Mexican joint. It's also a lot bigger than I was expecting!! A friend of mine, who is Hispanic, told me that this place was better than Tacos El Gordo. SWEET, I'm always down to trying places especially if people say it's better than some other place. Well sorry to disappoint it was mediocre at best. 

So we'll start off with food. I got the Carne Asada Fries and Al Pastor tacos. The tacos were pretty decent and I'd say would be on par with Tacos El Gordo, if it was a little spicier. That was a little disappointment to me. The carne asada fries were completely disappointing. The meat was pre-cooked and put in storage containers on the side for the Fries station. So the meat wasn't even hot at all. It was luke warm, maybe. Maybe the fries were not enough to make it luke warm. I'm not to sure. The overall taste of it was very disappointing!! 

I was too hungry to remember to take pictures =[ oops. I'll definitely come back to try the other tacos, but definitely skipping the fries. 

Oh, it was pretty dirty. Which is really a big no no for me, hopefully they clean up. The fans looked like there were years of dust on it....yes I said years. Maybe it was a few months, but it looked pretty bad and gross to me. 

I did like the condiment bar, lots to choose from which was nice! 

The soda.....skip it, most of it was flat or tasted weird =\ ugh I hate flat soda! But the horchata was really good! 

So yup, overall it was mediocre. I'll come back again in a few weeks and see how it fairs. I always say give a place three tries before you completely throw it out.
