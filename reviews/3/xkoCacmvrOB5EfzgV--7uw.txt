Went to Dimas Tacos with the boyfriend 'cause he saw decent food reviews for the place. 
This place looks sketchy - plainly decorated, yet it wasn't dirty. As customers, we couldn't tell if they were closed until we saw someone in the kitchen area. Another person came in later in the night, and they couldn't tell as well. 
Customer service wasn't horrible, but it wasn't spectacular either. The chef/cashier somewhat looked like it was an inconvenience to come into the restaurant. 
The food was good though. The boyfriend said he had a couple chicken bones in his enchiladas, and my steak for the carne asada tacos were a little overcooked, but it was still yummy. Good guacamole. 
Would I come back here on a regular basis based off my first and one experience? Probably not.
