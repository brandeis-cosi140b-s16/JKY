This place was super busy during lunch, but the food was decent and came out quick. I went with the tacos al carbon which are just chicken with onion and cilantro, a litle bland but oh well it was only 5 bucks for the combo. You could always load up your food with salsas from the condiment station they have. 

While we were eating, they shut down the dining area and locked up at about 1 pm and I'm not sure why which made it a little awkward when they locked all the doors and put signs up saying that only the drive thru was open. Meanwhile all of us are still sitting and eating inside with no explanation whatsoever...
