This place is A-OK!  I don't think it is as good as the Raul & Theresa's that is south of I-10 but it's decent.  I definitely think it's better than some of the other Mexican food establishments in the area.  Our point of reference would be we are more Tex-Mex kind of folks.  It's not really Tex-Mex at R&T but close enough.  Friendly service.
