Can't judge a place from the outside. Comalapa is a friendly little place. And the food is good. Yuca and chicharon... great!!! This place is missing the wow factor which I think is the lack of recipes. The 1st time I went here the pupusas were spot on. Then today I ordered the same pupusa and they were not the same.
