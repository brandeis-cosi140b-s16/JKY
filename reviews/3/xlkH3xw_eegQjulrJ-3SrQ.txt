Tony's was reccomended to me by a coworker so I had some expectations going in.  Unfortunately, the food didn't wow me.  The service was very sweet and friendly.  

It's a cute place.  You sit and get served vs. the counter ordering at some other quick Mex places.  

They offer lunch specials, which is always nice.  They also serve a nice variety of tasty Mexican beers.

We tried sopes and tacos.  Everything was A-OK.  Nothing stood out as great.
