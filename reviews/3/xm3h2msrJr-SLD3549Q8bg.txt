We did not experience a long line. Got here early though. Positives - free quesadillas for young kids, watching tortillas be made fresh, self-serve horchata and Agua frescos & other unique fresh drinks (mint lemonade), large portions. Negative - not very different than qdoba or chipotle in menu or taste, $20 for me and my two young boys for lunch (though we do have leftovers). Waive red between 3 and 4 stars - probably 3.5 if I could rate that.
