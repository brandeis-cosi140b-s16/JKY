This has always been my goto Chipotle and great until recently my online orders were getting messed up. Missing tortillas on the side and guac. Not sure if there has been management changes or something but also  a lot less chips are being given in the bag. $1.30 for 25 chips? Might as well go to the store and buy a whole bag of Tostitos instead. Disappointed in recent experiences here when i order at least once a week :(
