I believe in second chances but I'm still wary of eating their meat. So I stuck to my favorite: vegetarian tacos. The beans aren't mushy, the fajitas veggies have crunch and flavor, and they're cheap. My lunch was under $3 (one taco and a water cup). I'm not big on heavy lunches so this was a quick bite and it satisfied me until evening.
