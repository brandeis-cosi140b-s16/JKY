Yum.  Nice casual Mexican....small taco stand type place.  A large menu, ordered a carnitas burrito, which was big like you would expect.  You get pickled carrots and jalapeno peppers with your order, which is popular at many taco stands.  Wish the guacamole on the burrito was bit as thin and soupy, seems to be mixed with a watery sour cream so it is a little thin and soupy.  

Great to have a good Taco shop to stop and enjoy.   If you like Mexican food, you will enjoy CTS.
