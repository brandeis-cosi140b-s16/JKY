I've been on a street taco kick lately..saw the stellar reviews for this place and decided to stop in when I was in the area. I had a veggie taco and an asada taco and they were both good, but nothing over-the-top special. Just another street taco really. Not bad but not 5 stars either. If I was in the area and wanted some tacos I would go again.
