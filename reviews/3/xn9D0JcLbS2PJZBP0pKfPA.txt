I love Moe's, personally I like it better than Chipotle because of the salsa bar at most locations. Since this is an airport location, no salsa bar :( but just ask and they will give you to-go cup size salsa/queso. 

Burritos are my personal fav at Moe's it's hard to go wrong. This location has breakfast burritos, which for me is a great option instead of taking the long walk back down the A gate hallway to less healthier BK for a quick lunch while waiting to board my flight.
