Ordered my food, then about 5-10 minutes later the manager started apologizing for delay and warning customers that food might be further delayed. He communicated the delay but didn't give any timeframe. 20 minutes later, customers started getting food. I got a refund without an issue and the manager was very apologetic. Great manager but unfortunate situation that was very frustrating.
