Nice decor, open space, "ok" vibe, and friendly staff.

The food and drinks were just "ok".. None of the items ordered blew my mind..
*Ceviche - plain, lacked a little flavor, less avocado, more shrimp, pls.
*Salmon Chimichurri - comes with rice and grilled veggies.. salmon was cooked to perfection, not drenched in the chimichurri sauce with the black bean salsa.. though the veggies left a very strong, lingering garlic taste in my mouth, even after brushing my teeth, so maybe a little less garlic on the veggies.
*Mango Thai Basil and Guava Margaritas - waaaay to strong (not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing), tasted very similar, lacked the sweet flavor I was looking for, also no salt rim ¯\_(ツ)_/¯..

One thing my friend and I kept looking for, especially at time of seating was our chips and salsa! All the Mexican restaurants I've been to serves them.. And we noticed other tables around us getting their chips and salsa... but not us..
Was disappointed in not getting that before ordering / receiving main courses.

May come back, considering it's just down the street from the gym and close by work... No rush though.
