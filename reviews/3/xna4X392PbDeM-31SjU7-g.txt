I visit at least once a week.  I get the burritos or tacos -- chicken or pork.  I normally enjoy the food -- however -- every once in a while -- the temperature of the meat barely qualifies as "warm".   This is a big turn off.   I've taken my meal back and they've replaced it every time - but it keeps happening.  I'm going to check out a different Chipotle and see if it's any better.
