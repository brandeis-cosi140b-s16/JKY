I found out about this place due to Diners, Drive In and Dives. I was excited to check it out as it looked delicious and not far from where I lived. I took my family who was visiting from out of town and they were just as excited as I was to try it. We went a week after the episode aired and had no idea our visit would turn out like it did. Although our food was great our experience made our food and trip not worth it. I understood that they had this wonderful exposure however we visited after lunch and the line to order was thirty minutes. There was no seating available to accommodate our party so we had to split up sitting across the hall from each other. Then we waited 45 minutes to get our food. I understood it was busy however people's to go orders (who ordered 30 minutes after I did) were being fulfilled before mine. The restaurant could use an upgrade as while I was waiting for my food, I waited at my table that consisted of lawn chairs. My party walked away not very happy with their experience. I would be happy to return to give it another chance; I would just wait until the hype dies down a little.
