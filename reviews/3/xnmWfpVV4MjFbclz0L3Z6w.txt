We were super excited to find out there was a Beach House opening by us!  The place was clean and the staff was friendly.  We ordered a variety of items and saved the tacos for last.  The food took a long time to come out (they weren't too busy) but you can attribute that to being new as well.  The main issue was I found a piece of chicken bone in my taco.  Hopefully this is all because they are still new.  We will give it a try in a few months to see what has changed.
