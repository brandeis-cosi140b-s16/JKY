I visited Z-Lantro with my son and father when I found a BuyWithMe discount (see  wanna-be Groupon). We visited in the middle of the afternoon (3:00pm) so we got the VIP (read: only customers) treatment.  I imagined another 'Bertos knock-off but was surprised by the creative start this restaurant has taken.  We were impressed with the food (tacos and a bean burrito for junior).  The meat was delicious and the season was right on.  For good street tacos, this is a good place.
