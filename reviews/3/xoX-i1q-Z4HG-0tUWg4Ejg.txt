The food was solid and got the 3-stars, but the staff acted like they couldn't understand anything My girlfriend said. They acted like it was my fault and an inconvenience that I didn't tell them I had guacamole even though the food was sitting next to the cashier. Apparently the guacamole is extra although that was not stated on the menu.
