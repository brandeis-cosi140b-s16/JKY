Overpriced Mexican food!  But we were tired and since it was in our hotel (MGM) we gave in...would not come back just for this place unless it was happy hour and we were staying at MGM again.

$65 total (with tax/tip) for 2 girls that split an entree of enchiladas, guac and chips, Margarita (very sweet), and a Michelada (kind of watered down).

The guacamole was DELICIOUS and "entertaining" since they make it at your table.  If some of your group can't do spicy you can ask for chopped jalapenos on the side.
