The food was great and reasonably priced. It was a little annoying how the owner/cook kept name dropping the Lee family and telling how he was friends with them. He also made several obnoxious racial comments (ie: "I'm an egg- yellow on the inside and white on the outside.") As a Korean American, I found this distasteful. The food was good enough, but if you go, have a sense of humor about the commentary.

Also, the owner of this business is painstakingly flaming/making personal attacks against anyone who leaves a less than perfect review of his establishment. Although I would've come back for the food, this obnoxious response is enough to keep anyone away.
