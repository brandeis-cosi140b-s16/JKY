Nice large family style restaurant with decent service & broad menu.

We visited this spot on a weeknight date night.  We had visited a farmers market nearby and heard this spot was good.

Strip mall spot super duper decorated for the holidays in that fun fiesta grandma style.  We opted for the patio which is big but only an alley view.

We tried the margaritas- of course from mix how disappointing in Arizona!  Just juice a lime people!!!

My hunny had the seafood enchiladas and liked it very much but did not appeal to me.  I had the carne asada plate which was of a crock pot shredded beef instead of grilled steak which I was expecting.  Not a big fan of this- the grilled peppers and onions was the only thing I ate.

My hunny got the homemade ice cream which was had ice crystals and the raspberry topping was the highlight of the night!
