Came here for lunch in the recent past.  Chips were pretty average, but salsa was very good (good consistency/texture and pretty spicy) and bean dip served with chips was also very good.

Ordered the gordita chicharron prensado (sp?) which was very good - fried bread was excellent, fillings were good, if not a little heavy on the onion, and some tacos and other items, which were pretty conventional.  A little pricey at $3.99 for what amounts to a fairly small sandwich sized item.

Only issue was they were very short staffed (I assume the dining room staff were the Owners), so no greeting when we walked in (we assumed we just pick our table, which we did, not much of an issue there in a pretty large dining area), but it took 20 minutes to get a drink order in, chips/salsa/bean dip, and menus, and took 45 minutes to get our food after sitting down (about 30 minutes after sitting down to take our orders).  Service was slow, and not good for a weekday lunch.  This seemed to be the case for most customers, not just my group.

All-in-all, good food, service needs some improvement.
