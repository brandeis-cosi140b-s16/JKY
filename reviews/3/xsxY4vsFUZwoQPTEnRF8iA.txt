One day I was craving some Popeye's mashed potatoes so I headed over to this spot and found out that good ol' Louisiana Popeye's had become Baja Taco.. Since then I have been back a couple times to pick up some quick fix meals and have sampled a little of everything I do like the convenience of the drive-thru, which always moves fast, and the pretty girl working at the window is always very friendly.. 

We have tried:
*Carne Asada Nachos: My bf really did not like these
*Chicken Tacos: They are a little too salty for my taste
*4 Ft burrito: way too much refried bean..bleh
*Chicken Quesadillas: These are very good! My mom makes me go pick her up one every now and then haha 
*Salsa: they only have red... no green!

So I have come to the decision that I prefer Roberto's down the street for all my unhealthy Mexican fast food cravings.. but everyone's' taste buds are different!

HOT TIP: Chicken tacos come wrapped in corn tortilla.. If you prefer flour it is a couple cents extra~
