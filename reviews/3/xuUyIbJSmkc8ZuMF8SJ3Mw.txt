I would have given this Qdoba 4 stars because the food,  like all Qdobas, is good enough, fresh and consistent. However, I have given it 3 stars due to the fact that when I went into the bathroom to change my son's diaper there was no changing station.  Seriously? I would understand if this were a fine dining establishment but it's Qdoba.  Kids go to Qdoba all the time, they have a kid's menu for goodness sake.normally I would just put his changing mat on the floor and change hon there but the floor was grimey too, yuck!  At the end of the day it's pretty expected for a fast-food place like Qdoba to have changing facilities for infants. How irritating!
