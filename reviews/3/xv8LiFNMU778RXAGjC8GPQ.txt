Love the décor! Love the idea in the middle of hot Phoenix. Even love the randomness of it all.

But, it's just too damn hot to sit outside and eat a hot taco. 
Food is average, for an average price. 
Would you expect more from hippies?
HMMM....let me think.

I will come back here just for the smile the décor puts on my face. 
Just driving past this place makes me grin.

We should all be just a little  HAPPIER!!! and HIPPIER!
