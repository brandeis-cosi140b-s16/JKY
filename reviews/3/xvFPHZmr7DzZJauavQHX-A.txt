Unfortunately due to missing my Tamales ; my feelings were hurt, lol. Seriously though I wish I could have tasted it it sounded so bomb. Although the food was good ...  Guess I'll be back to pick Tamales up also to try their tacos.  Also no jalape√±o s.. sad face. Spice lover over here. The cashier was patient and kind.
