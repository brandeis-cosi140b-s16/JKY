This place has great potential, but has quite a few kinks to work out.  Tried two different kinds of nachos.  Very good, but not nearly enough cheese as many have mentioned.  Maybe they should ask if you want more when they take your order as I would imagine most people would.  

This place is more fun in a group too as it doesn't exactly thrive off ambience.
