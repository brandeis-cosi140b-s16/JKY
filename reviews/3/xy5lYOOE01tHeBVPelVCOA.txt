They don't exactly have the best Mexican food around, but the Mexican pizza with steak is pretty good. Also, they have a decent queso that they serve with tortilla chips and soft flour tortillas. But my favorite item on their menu is the taquitos. 

The service is hit or miss but they are always friendly.
