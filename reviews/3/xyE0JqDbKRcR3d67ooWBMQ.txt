I admit it.  I am a big fan of Plain Ole Mexican Food like you MIGHT get at your friends mom's house if you were lucky enough to be invited!

My favorite part of their salsa bar is the thin strips of FRESH jalapeno with a little bit of onions and seasoning.  Tried it multiple times, NEVER disappointed - always perfect!
They also have fresh made chips you self-serve for fifty-cents, NICE touch!

Clean. Cooked to Order. Kids like it.  I like it. What's NOT to like?
