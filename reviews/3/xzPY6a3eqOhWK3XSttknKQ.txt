My friend and I were craving Mexican food so I found this place on yelp. We went for lunch & it was okay. We started with coronitas which were very tasty. I had the shrimp fajitas and my friend has the fish tacos. Over all the food was good but nothing amazing to where I have to come back again. I liked their chips and salsa that they served before the food came. Wish they had a better selection with fun alcoholic beverages or fresh Mexican waters.
