This franchise location lost two stars for messing up on my order (twice) during a single situation. The food tastes good; the facility looks clean; and the service is both prompt and courteous.

I ordered an item off the menu and asked for two extras, paying for the addition. I drove off and was already several blocks away when I discovered  their mistake--they'd made my order wrong(!), including a LOT of a food item of which I am allergic(!).

I returned to the franchise double checked the menu, confirming the mistake was theirs and not mine. I went in to address my concern, the manager saw me and asked whether I received the wrong order, to which I replied yes. The manager responded promptly to 'correct' the error. But...

I waited for my replacement, hopefully correct, order. Unfortunately, they still got it wrong. They failed to include the items for which I had paid extra $. (But, at least my order no longer contained the product of which I am allergic!)

Summary, always take personal responsibility to double check your order(s) in all circumstances--and accept nothing less than accuracy when receiving your order(s).
