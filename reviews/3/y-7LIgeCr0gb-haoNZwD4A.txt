Baby girl was feeling tacos so I checked my trusty Yelp app & found Taco4U close by with decent reviews. Easy to find and the location is clean. The lady who helped us was very pleasant & personable. She recommended the green chili pork so I gave it a try. I actually got it in the burrito-enchilada style so I can try their red sauce too. Baby girl got the 2 hard taco place with beans & beans. Our experience here was pleasant but the food is kinda blah, it was good but nothing to break the heavenly trumpets out for. I wasn't too impressed with the hard tacos even though they looked appealing. The red sauce though was pretty authentic so if your looking for "authentic red sauce" this place has a pretty good grasp on it. When we roll all Mexican we like to flavor the culture so a horchata & a Jamaica did the job for wetting our whistles. Unfortunately, they aren't freaking awesome so again-no trumpets gloriously playing to their awesomeness. Last but not least the bill. Kept it under $20 for 2 meals & 2 drinks which is always good. Checked in w my phone app so I had a 25% off $10 or more bill to use. Not exactly sure but the way the bill reads I got 25% off 1 item. Hmmmmm.......this is me scratching my head. Still in search for the most amazing, horn tutting, authentic Mexican fiesta I can find. This close to the border & I can't find good grub, WT........
