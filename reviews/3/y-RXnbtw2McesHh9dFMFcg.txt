Taco Bell and I go way back.  It is not the greatest food by far, but at 2:00 in the morning after a hard night out, there are times I would kill for some nachos.  

This location in particular stays open until 3, so I have a good hour after last call to make it.  And it is walking distance from my apartment so that makes me extra happy.  During the recent remodeling, the drive thru stayed open every time I had a need.  And for that, I give 3 stars.
