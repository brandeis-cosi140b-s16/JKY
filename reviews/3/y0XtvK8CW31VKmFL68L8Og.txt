Staff is great. The restaurant is clean, yet the food is missing something in comparison to Chipotle. Location is awesome (across from Wells Fargo)!

My boyfriend loves this place(only one like it that offers buffalo chicken), but despite multiple attempts I never finish it. 

Normally I love the bowl, yet I've tried the burrito too. I want to love this place. 

Favorite item is chips and cheese dip. They've never let me down there.
