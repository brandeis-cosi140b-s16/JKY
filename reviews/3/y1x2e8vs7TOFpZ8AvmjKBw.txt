We had a meeting there and I really enjoyed the place. It was nice to find something a little more upscale but not stuffy over in PV. The design and decor is great. We all really loved the Mambo Jambo super huge ceiling fan.

The apps and the food was great. Prices are moderate to high. The only thing that was really strange is that their draft is much more expensive than their bottle beer. Never seen that before. All in all, a nice experiecne and we will return.
