La Fonda has cute charm. We got combo platter, cheese crisp, and spicy shrimp burrito. The combo platter was delish! Cheese Crisp ice cold and shrimp burrito yummm. The beans are really good!!!! Overall the food was pretty good. Don't think it was worth the $30 but on the other hand will go back because there isn't anything else that close. One compliant that you had to buy salsa! Hot sauce free salsa you buy. UGH
