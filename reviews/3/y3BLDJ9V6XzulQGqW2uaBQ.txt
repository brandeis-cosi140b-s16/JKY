This place is a just ok Mexican spot to grab lunch or dinner in the Met area. We came on Saturday for lunch because we were in the area Christmas shopping.

The chips and salsa were actually pretty good. The chips were overly salty but we just wiped off the salt and it was no biggie! I actually really liked the salsa.

We decided to split the Mexican flag enchiladas. Basically, it was a spinach enchilada, chicken enchilada, and steak enchilada with refried beans and coconut rice (though, I am 99% sure that it was just regular rice). The food was good. The enchiladas kinda mixed together so it was a big old mix of cheese, sauce, and meats......hey, count me in! I believe the enchiladas were around $14 or so but it was plenty to split! The refried beans were kinda burnt tasting so I just let my garbage disposal of a husband eat them!

Overall, standard Mexican style food.
