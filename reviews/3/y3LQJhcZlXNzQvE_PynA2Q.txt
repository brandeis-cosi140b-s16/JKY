I have to say the restuarant had a great atmosphere. The entire Tempe Marketplace is very cozy. I enjoyed the chips and the three salsa dips but I have to admit I was slightly disappointed in my meal. I ordered Chile Releno and it didn't look very appetizing. I ended up eatting my dates food. His food was much yummier. I will have to try this restuarant again to determine if it was just a bad menu choice. The waitress was friendly and nice. Therefore I will give the restuarant another opportunity.
