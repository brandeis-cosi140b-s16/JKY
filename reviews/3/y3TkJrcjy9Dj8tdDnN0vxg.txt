Decent alternative to all those expensive ACYE buffets...

My friends and I tried their all you can eat tacos for only $7.99.  You get your choice of ground beef, shredded beef or shredded chicken.  On your first plate you get 3 tacos, side of rice and choice of either black beans or re-fried beans. There's also lettuce, tomato and cheese on the side so you can make your taco however you like. I ordered the shredded beef and it was surprisingly good and pretty juicy.  

The meat is pilled on high so the three tacos are pretty filling. But if that's not enough for feel free to order more tacos since it is ALL YOU CAN EAT.  The tacos will come two at a time and the rice and beans are given upon request. 

Chips are also served along with a bean dip and 2 different types of salsa.  The Cabo Mexican Restaurant is a solid deal!
