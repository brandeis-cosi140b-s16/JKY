It's ok...not really good but passable Mexican or, to be honest, what they called when I lived in Texas:  TexMex.  To translate:  watered down mediocre Mexican.
If this is your gig then go for it.  If you want really great Mexican go somewhere else.
How this chain has been around since 1945 beats me, but they've been in Phoenix that long looks like.  Well, as Grandma said, there's no accounting for taste...just not my taste if I have a choice.
