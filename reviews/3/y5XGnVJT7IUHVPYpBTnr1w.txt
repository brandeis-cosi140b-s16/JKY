Great margaritas! Really great. Strong. Too many will give you a headache though because they don't use the highest grade tequilla or anything. Still, it's a yummy buzz-giver. 

The chips and salsa are mediocre, and I assume the food is nothing special either... I haven't eaten anything here though, so I can't judge it on that. 

The ambiance is pretty nice - upstairs and downstairs is laid out pretty well and the lighting and furniture is comfortable. It's not too loud in there to have a conversation. They have a few crappy tvs playing basic cable sports usually. The crowd is slightly on the douchy side, but it makes for good people watching because everyone is pretty good looking.

It's a good starting point to have a margarita or two before heading out somewhere fun.
