We love this place, a standard choice for us a couple times a month for happy hour, late night eats or breakfast.  The brunch/breakfast fair is outstanding, if you enjoy a bit of heat and southwest fair in your food.  Unfortunately the breakfast starts late, so if you're early risers it is hard to wait 'til 10am for opening.  I regularly take my house guests or out of town friends here for the experience; they've done a great job on the design and the food is always great!
