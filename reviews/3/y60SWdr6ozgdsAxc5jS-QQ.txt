I have been here several times and recount flavorable memories.  So, I eagerly anticipated my return.  The tradional chips were on the table, but with several salsas.  Each were good in their own way, but none of them were very spicy.
I ordered the spinach enchilada.  It came with rice and beans on a huge plate.  I have had this in the past, but remember it having more flavor.  The spinach needed salt, and it all just tasted bland.  I did put a little salsa on the food to perk it up. 
I noticed in the menu, desserts was spelled "deserts."  I did not order any, but it was not because of the misspelling. The waitress brought us a complimentary sugary treat after our meal, which was a nice touch.
I will try it again.  An off night can happen anywhere, even in my own kitchen.
