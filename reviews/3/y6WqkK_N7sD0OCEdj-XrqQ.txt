unlike my friend RZ i somewhat like this filibertos...somewhat

i somewhat don't mind the yelling of numbers. hispanic girls yelling is usually a turn on to me. so she can get huffy and yell numbers, names, insults, oh papi's  i don't care. i like it.

what it is lacking is a good carne asada burrito. i don't know why all the drive thru ones i have gone too get it right..this one is just wet and sloppy and missing some flavor...dunno. plus the pico gives me heart burn.
