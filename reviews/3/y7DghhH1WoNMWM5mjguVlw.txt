this review is based on two weekday visits, seperated by a time of six months. 
first visit, I was practically ignored by the bartender. the crowd was modest, easily could have been covered by one server or tender. my son spilled my modelo, and the bartender noticed the incident, went off to retrieve a washcloth and then never came back. I was sitting about 5 feet from the bar in the large table. I finally had to walk behind the bar and get the damn towel myself. and, she never did bring me another beer, as I requested. 
Plus: the menu for happy hour is limited, but the 3 taco sampler I got was mouthwatering. very very tasty, cooked right and appearance was 4 stars. 

second visit: enjoyed a warm welcome from the manager, seated promptly, again, happy hour menu did not dissapoint. still, the bartending staff here has their heads up their asses. too bad, as well, since they have great variety of real tequilas and decent prices for good mexican beer like Bohemia and Negra Modelo. 

the salsa variety is decent. when the weather is nice (7 months out of the year!) the patio is a great place to enjoy company who has passion for real mexican food OR a great place to bring your visiting friends and family. 
Food, atmosphere, staff 4 stars
Bartending skills, 2 stars
