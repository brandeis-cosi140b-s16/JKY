Well, I went here not wanting to spend a lot of time, but hoping for something better than fast food. The food was what I could have hoped for, but it took an amazing amount of time to get it. I didn't order anything fancy, just 3 tortas and I was the only person there. So, I'm not sure what the problem was, but I believe it took about 20 minutes which as anyone who's in a hurry knows seems like a lifetime. So, 4 stars for the food which was good, if unspetacular and 2 for the service. Incidentally, no explanation or apology for the incredible wait time...
