On our cross country journey from San Diego we stopped here for lunch after making it to Wickenburg. The food was as to be expected.  I did not think there was anything special, but it was good and if I was back in Wickenburg would eat here again.  I was not too pleased with guacamole appetizer (not a fan of cheese on my guac.). The chicken fajitas were solid.
