This Mexican joint on the West side is pretty tasty overall and fun to visit for lunch.

Pros: vegetarian options, authentic Mexican cuisine, friendly service, free chips

Cons: geographic location (not close to anything), physical location (it's in a strip mall), could use a renovation

Try this place out with a friend but save it for a lunch date when you need a quick cheap bite!
