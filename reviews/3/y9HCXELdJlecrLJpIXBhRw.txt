This place is ok.  It's not great, but it's solidly ok.

I was there with my father, sister, and brother in law.  Our dinner came to $110.00.  We had ordered 6 margaritas (between four of us) and the drinks were $45.00.  Given this was a strip mall mexican place, we were not expecting this so I want to mention this as a word of caution.  I dont think it's over priced, but we just weren't expecting it to be over $100.

I hate when people complain that local mexican restaurants dont serve authentic food.  We live in Pittsburgh, not El Paso.  This was pretty good!  All the cheesy beefy spicy goodness I crave in Mexican food was present.  I ahd dinner #2.  It was one fajita, one taco, one burrito, and one quesadllla.  Needless to say, I brought most of it home.  The quesadilla was just meh, but a quesadilla is just cheese on a tortilla.  The taco was good but very salty.  If I got back, I'll try the fish tacos.

The service was good but disorganized.

My father had the sapapillas for dessert and was expecting little pillows of fried dough--chi chi's restaurant style.  We got fried tortillas w sugar and ice cream on them.  He wasn't very impressed.  My brother in law had the flan and said it was great.

The margaritas were excellent!  Certainly worth $45.  Very strong, we were all feeling a little bubbly when we left dinner!  I tried the frozen mango margarita, and I loved it.  It was like alcoholic candy.  Highly recommend.

I'd go back, and I'd recommend it if you're hungry in the South Hills.  It's not a fancy restaurant; but its a simple Mexican joint with pretty alright food.
