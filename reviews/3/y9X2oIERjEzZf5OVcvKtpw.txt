There's a ton of hype around RuRu's, and it took me long enough, but I finally made it. I will say, their patio is really nice, but does the food live up to the hype?

I'm really glad that there's a late-night full service restaurant with this much nightlife around the Selwyn area, it's a much needed amenity. I enjoyed the environment, although the inside was LOUD! Like you couldn't hear yourself think, loud), and the service was... well, it was a little strange.

We were promptly seated (I called ahead about 30 minutes before and asked how much of a wait there would be and I got the answer "you should be good"), and then brought a...serving of chips and salsa? I knew these weren't complimentary here, so I told the guy that these weren't ours. Person #2 came up to our table shortly after and filled our water, and person #3 then came along and said that the chips were "on them" for the wait. What wait? Uh...what's going on? The chips were dense and suspiciously crispy, but I knew not to be impressed coming in. Salsa was good though!

We each got 3 tacos. We each loved one of them, and the other two were relatively plain. I enjoyed my crispy chicken and the lady enjoyed her tofu taco. 

I want to come back to hang out on the patio, and I regret that I didn't try any drinks, but it was a cool experience to check out. I'm glad I did.
