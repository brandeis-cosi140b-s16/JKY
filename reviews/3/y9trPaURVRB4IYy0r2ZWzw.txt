First time I came here, it sucked so bad I told myself I didn't want to come back. Food was terrible and unappetizing.
BUT my boyfriend wanted to come back here for Happy Hour so I grudgingly went. We both got margaritas which were OK, nothing awesome but what did we expect for cheap-o margaritas. Chips and salsa never disappoint and they are served with some yummy beans as well. I did noticed, however, that they updated their menu (not updated on their website yet) and I decided to try one of the new items. They have a new taco platter that you can get either as an appetizer or as an entree. Getting it as an entree means you get a side of rice and beans and two tacos. HOLY CRAP THESE TACOS WERE AWESOME! They give you a choice of either chicken or steak and I asked if I could do one chicken and one steak and they said yes. So out comes our tacos and they were topped with chorizo and some crumbled queso fresco. Was I in the same place I came before?? The quality of the food was great and nothing like the rubbery little pieces I was served before. Rice and beans were good too. I want to come back and try the other new menu items they have. Hopefully they are good too.
