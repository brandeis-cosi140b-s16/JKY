The grill reminds me of the simple formula that pervades too many places today.  This formula states that cheese, cream, grease, or heavy sauces are required to make any dish serviceable. I'm not saying that this isn't a bad formula, but it does show some laziness for hiding behind those things.

Everything that I've had there is decent...it just follows that formula.  The Shrimp Quesadilla, for example, is good but completely saturated in their heavy seafood sauce.  Really too rich and overdone.  The same can be said for the 2-3 other things I've tried there.

Good service, bad ambiance, incredibly awkward place mens room, and a decent place if you live in Gilbert and need an alternative to mom's casserole.
