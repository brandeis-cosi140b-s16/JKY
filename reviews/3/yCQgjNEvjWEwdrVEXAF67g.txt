This place is a bit different than the one in Tempe.
They have on the menu Hot Tea, but when we asked the girl for Tea she said, we don't have that! But, it is on the menu, she said, it is???
Their  menu is up on the wall.
So then we said, ok how about coffee? (also on the menu)  She said, well, we have to make it.
OK never mind.
Other than that the food is very good, the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is nice and clean.
it is worth the visit, their salsa is great!
