The food here is good but for what you get, in my opinion is a little too expensive. They also serve their food in paper/styrofoam plates. Makes this decent restaurant seem cheap. I'll go here again if someone really wants to, but will never go here just on a whim. Especially with so many other good Mexican establishments to eat at. Other places give you so much bang for your buck.
