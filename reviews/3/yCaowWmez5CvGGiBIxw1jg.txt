This La Salsa Cantina is the one located on the strip next door to the M&M store across from New York, New York.  It's a great place to catch a quick drink while the kids are next door.  The place has been there for years and still the bartenders still poor a mean drink!  Yummy.  The problem at this location as in the past, is that the smell of vomit permeates the bar area.  You'll know why after having one of their "Margaritas by the Yard".  If you don't have a seasoned stomach for the large3 foot funnel tube drinks made here, don't drink one.  Most people who don't drink can't handle one.  Nachos are good here too!
