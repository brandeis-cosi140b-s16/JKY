Unfortunately like most things in Aria, this place is way overpriced for what you get. The restaurant does have a cool ambiance but the food is nothing special, especially for $30+ a plate. The drinks were good and food was decent, but I wouldn't come back here. I can't say I know a good Mexican substitute in Vegas, but I know there are many better restaurants on the strip to dine at.
