I love the 3 complimentary salsas and their chips are awesome, super light and crispy.  We tried their fajitas for 2, which were tasty, but mostly veggies and less meat than the competition.  Guacamole was good, but they don't offer table side preparation.  Their Mexican corn was a fantastic little surprise that I never see on most other menus.  Whatever you do, DO NOT order a bloody mary here.  This was without a doubt the worst bloody mary I've ever ordered.  They politely agreed to swap me out for a beer when I explained the predicament.  I wouldn't be surprised if they get similar requests frequently.

The atmosphere is nice, the decor kinda looks like it used to be a Chili's or something like that.  We visited on a Sunday evening, and the place was hopping and fairly noisy.  

Overall, this is a 3.5 star review.  There were some high points such as the salsas and menu variety, but the bloody mary, meat quantity in the fajitas, and no homemade tortillas left more to be desired.
