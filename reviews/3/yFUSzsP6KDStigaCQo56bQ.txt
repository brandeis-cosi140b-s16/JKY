I happened to be in the area, so figured I would stop into the newest Three Amigos location, purely for comparison purposes. From the outside, it is much simpler to park - no worries about finding a space if there are more than ten people there. You just have to park a bit further away.

Once inside, the atmosphere is definitely newer and shinier than on Central, and it suffers a bit in comparison (but only in comparison - if you go to other Mexican places, it's fine). The staff is great, as always, and the bar area is a bit nicer than on Central. There are perhaps twice as many tables as there are on Central.

Most importantly, I am happy to report that the food seems identical to that on Central - the salsa verde, the mole, the tomatillo, everything tastes just as good in the new location. Hope that the crew can keep things going and expand even more in the future!
