The best thing about this place is the atmosphere.  They really do have a nice setup in there, and the food is stylish.

Unfortunately, if you're going to the restaurant to eat (but really, who does that?), it's nothing special.  I had the Chimichangas (which they for some reason spell with a 'v'), and while it was certainly edible, and enormous, it didn't really have much flavor.  It seems they think dousing something with spicy hot sauce is enough.  I like spicy food as much and anybody, but spice alone is not enough to make a good dish.

The portions were more than enough, but I'd rather have great tasting food that satisfies my hunger than a boat load of passable food.
