For some reason, this location doesn't map correctly.  It's located in the strip mall just across from the Fish Hatchery.  I eat here when I'm in the mood for a big lunch burrito, reasonable price, and fast.  If you go at noon, there will be a line to order, maybe 10 or 15 minutes.  Otherwise, it's pretty darn quick.  The food is normally fresh and burritos are very large, a decent value and good, quick, clean lunch option for work.  Outside dining on the deck is very nice when the weather is good.  They added dining room space about a year ago because they were always running out of seating.  Parking can be difficult at peak times as the lot fills up fast.
