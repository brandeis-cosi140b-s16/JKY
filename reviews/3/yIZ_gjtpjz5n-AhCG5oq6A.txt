Official rating: 3 1/2 stars (if I could)


Start to Finish:

- Visited approximately 2 weeks after their official grand opening. All the paint and decor looked almost identical to Firefly (restaurant in this space before it became nacho daddy). 

- Great Mix of 80's and 90's music playing with accompanying music videos, but was weird to see/hear at Nacho Daddy. 

- Very large menu with only 1 page of nacho dishes. I was disappointed in the selection of different nacho dishes and the fact that the rest of the menu was simply a Mexican restaurant menu. Also, the nacho dishes were listed as appetizers. I was told they would be enough for a meal. I was hungry when I finished my plate of nachos and was hungry when I left the restaurant. 

- Purchased the Florentine and Nacho Average Burger Nachos. The Florentine were absolutely delicious and were a play on an Italian dish essentially with prosciutto and some other goodies on top. The burger nachos were not too bad. We had the snores dessert nachos to finish things off which were pretty interesting/tasty.

- The prices were a bit high for nacho appetizers $12-$15+.

- my wife was excited about their extensive/diverse, coffee menu. Unfortunately, they staff was not trained on how to make any of them and only regular coffee was available. A let down.

- Our server was nice and the service was decent. We had to wait a long period to get the check as the waitress seemed to disappear for a bit. Not the do all end all, but not the smoothest so would have liked. 

- OVERALL, the food was yummy, prices were a bit high, and it was a cool place to go as a novelty.  It seemed to have some identity issues with the mix of music, videos, etc. I don't think I'll be returning although I recommend giving it a try if you want to go somewhere different and are in the mood for Mexican. 

Enjoy!
