While in the - general - vicinity, looking for someplace else to eat, and trying to avoid going to Nona's, we decided to give a try to Los Arcos.  How can you not, with those nicely-appointed windows?  It looks like they built it just for you!

Unfortunately, the service isn't terribly good, and that's when no one is there.  I can't even imagine what it's like when they get busy.  Perhaps they don't.

As to the food - the portions are decently sized, and the ingredients seem to be reasonably fresh, but put them all together and they seem to be utterly average.  I really don't know how that could happen.  I think that we were just spoiled by Don Juan's in Mint Hill, and those wonderfully fresh chips...
