Agree with everyone else here that the atmosphere was great. Staff was very friendly. The food was OK. If they charged anymore I would say it is not worth it. 

I had the chicken enchiladas, my wife has the fajitas. The enchiladas tasted bland, and would not recommend. However my wife's fajitas were very tasty, and I ate more of those. 

For dessert we had the stuffed sopapias and they were very good.  I tried some of my friends chicken quesadilla and they were also bland. 

Overall, I would say its worth a try.
