I have to say that I am pretty disappointed. Service tonight was very slow, and frankly the food was totally unremarkable. I had the Tres Azteca, and while the flavors of the steak and chicken were almost alive, the shrimp was DOA - clearly overly freezer burned and rubbery, and had no discernible flavor.
I asked for *HOT* salsa to liven things up, but their offering was, again, fairly flat.

The flavors did not excite me, the service was tepid, the price was reasonable - but I won't be back.
