Run-of-the-mill location in the heart of Oakland on Forbes. I avoided it like the plague for many years before finally stopping in because I feared the long lines of college students; however, they people working on the line are well equipped and work like a well oiled machine to deal with the high turnover (especially during lunch hours). Food is par, still I think a bit overpriced for the quality (plus the additional price for guacamole is insanely high).
