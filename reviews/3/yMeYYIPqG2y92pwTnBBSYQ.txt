I was just there yesterday (my usual place across the parking lot was packed).  Let me start by saying the food was good....  I ordered two Cabeza burritos, the board said $6.00, however if you want cream, cheese and guacamole it's an extra charge (pricey!!).  We agreed to the extra cheese, and cream (no guacamole).  Our total came out to $15.00 and change.  No drinks, nothing else, just the two burritos!!

The burritos were smaller than I thought, given the price, but man, they were really tasty.  The cabeza meat was clean, no fatty or chewy parts anywhere, and it was well cooked and seasoned.  The whole burrito composition was on point, it had onions, cilantro the usual suspects, and our extra charge ingredients cream and cheese, all of that together and the scrumptious meat tasted like heaven!! The red salsa we got on the side was really good it complemented the burrito perfectly.
