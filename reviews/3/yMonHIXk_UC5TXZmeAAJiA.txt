I love that you are always there for me, all hours of the night, less than a mile from my home. I always get the bean and cheese burrito with extra cheese. I am no thrill seeker here. I really really dislike just about all Mexican food, but the bean and cheese stays close to my heart. I get bean and cheese burritos every time my husband drags me to one of these shady little Mexican establishments, and I would say that Filibertos does not do it best. This particular location is one of the biggest I have seen, but still a little too sketch for me to sit and eat there. Also, the drive thru takes FOREVER. Just run in - it will be much faster. Good burritos, and I will always be back for you, Filis!
