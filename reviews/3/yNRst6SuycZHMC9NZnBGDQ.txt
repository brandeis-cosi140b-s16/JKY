I'm no stranger to Chipotle and this location was sub-par at best. Granted I've only been to this one twice now, neither experience was a good one.

I just recently moved to Tempe and had to leave my beloved Gilbert & Warner Chipotle, where they always went beyond the typical "Hi. What can I get for you?" 

At this new Tempe location I was hurried through the line to a somewhat grumpy young cashier who proceeded to ring me up without a word and sent me on my way. Not even a "Thank you, have a good night!" I always get my guac on the side and to my surprise realized it was not in my bag when I got home  :(  That's my favorite part!

All in all, not a good experience but that wont stop me from going again. Maybe they'll be able to win me over eventually. Who knows?
