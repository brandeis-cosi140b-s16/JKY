My husband and I went here for Valentine's day dinner. We saw it advertised on tv and the food looked really good. They all gave it great reviews. The food was alright. My husband had the enchilada trio and he said he really liked the shredded beef enchilada. I enjoyed my meal of spinach enchiladas.  It would have been better of the spinach was cut up smaller. I felt like I was eating a salad. The margarita was refreshing and pretty strong. We got there during happy hour so the beer was only $2.50. We finished sinner off with fried ice cream.  Oh man, that was the best part. We will be back to try something else at a later time.
