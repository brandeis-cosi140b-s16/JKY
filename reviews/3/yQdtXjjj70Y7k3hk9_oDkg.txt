2.5 rounding up

My dinner companion and I went for some take out, he ordered the chili rellano burrito which is exactly what I wanted to order. When I said "make that two", my friend suggested we just shared. Okay, I  thought. I  have a pretty  healthy appetite so I ordered a side of chips and salsa. When we got back to his place and started to eat, I noticed that the chips were greasy and stale and the burrito was swimming in sauce, making the tortilla a soggy mess. I was hesitant to try it, but I did and it was pretty damn good. 

The burrito was indeed big enough to feed the both of us and the excess sauce went great with the chips.

If I were in the area and craving mex, I would possibly go back, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.
