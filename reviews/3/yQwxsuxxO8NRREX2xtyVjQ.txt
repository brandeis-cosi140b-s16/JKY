When I first saw the place from the outside I was expecting it to be just another Mexican dive. 

I was wrong. The inside is nice, the staff is friendly and the food is good. I'm not usually a fan of tortas but these are an exception. 

Even the Mexican music they played wasn't the annoying polka sounding crap you find in other places. 

Very pleasant surprise.
