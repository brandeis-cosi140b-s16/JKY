This place is still just "okay" in my book. 

I met some girlfriends here on a rainy afternoon. I decided to go with the lunch special chimichangas. You get two chimis with your choice of chicken or beef and your standard sides of rice and beans. 

It's not that this food is bad by any means; it's just all very average to me. However, the portion sizes here are good and the food arrived hot. 

So if you want to get rid of that Mexican craving this place will hit the spot.
