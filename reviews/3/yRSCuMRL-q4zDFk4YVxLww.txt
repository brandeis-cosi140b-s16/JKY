Because chipotle is normally my favorite place ever to eat I will still give it a 3. But this has to be the worst experience I've ever had at chipotle. 
I have to tell them 3 times I wanted a lot of sour cream. Annoying. Anyway the big deal is they must have let the guacamole sit out and turn brown and then mixed it up to make it "unnoticeable" but it was so brown I instantly knew. I wouldn't have gotten it but at this point chipotle isn't good without it for me. So I paid the extra money and tried to hint to the cashier it wasn't right but of course he didn't do anything. I'm way too nice to say anything serious or cause a scene. 
Anyway. Got home and even though I'm sure it was fine after one bite I couldn't take it and had to take it out of my bowl, I tried to eat the rest of my bowl without it, but the first not 1,2,3 but 4!!! Pieces of steak were complete fat. I trashed the entire bowl. 
I have never been so grossed out by chipotle before. 
Being new to Scottsdale I will be driving the distance back to the chipotle at Tempe market place for good.
