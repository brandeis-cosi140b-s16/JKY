Americas is a place that I had to visit more then once before I reviewed. 

It is good. The carne asada was tender and had a nice charred flavor. 

The bean and cheese burrito was good. 

The chips and salsa were bland, the salsa was "tomato sauce" as one of the 10 year kids said. 

The price was a little high esp $1.50 for each can of pop. That is $9 a six pack....
