Had the Ancho Shrimp Burrito today with chips and drink for  $8.99 which is not to bad.

Little skimpy on the chips and the burrito was not bad. Could say it is white man's mexican food but not bad for fast food. The tortilla is not of the home made authentic soft type but it is a chain.

The burrito looked better on the advertisement than in reality. Had a few shrimp but was expecting a few more.

Hard not to compare to the more authentic mexican restaurants because we live in Arizona but maybe not fair.

Will probably be back but if I want a more authentic mexican food experience I will eat at my go to places but considering time and location it is what it is.
