Is this place closed now, or just "under renovation"??

I've been many times for lunch, and have decided that the barbacoa torta is my absolute favorite menu item.  Nothing else on the menu seems very special.  Actually, I tried the breakfast burrito, too....a little disappointed in the proportion of potato to chorizo, especially considering the price and size.
