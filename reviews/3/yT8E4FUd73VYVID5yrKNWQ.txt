Oh dear. 

First of all, yes, the burritos are enormous. Not quite as big as my head, but definitely as big as a venti frappuccino, and much more filling. 

This was not the first La Bamba, as asserted. It was the first one in Champaign, but the chain started elsewhere. 

This place is open late into the night, and that is the best reason to go there. In daylight, there are better choices. 

That said, I still get a hankering for these sometimes. Fortunately I live in the land of great burritos now. Yay burritos!
