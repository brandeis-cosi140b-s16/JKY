Person 1: "So, where do you want to go to lunch?"

Person 2: "Hmmm.  I'm not sure"

Person 1: "Want to go to Paradise?"

Person 2: "Naaah, we've been there three times recently."

Person 1: "What about Subway?"

Person 2: "I'm so damned tired of sandwiches. . ."

Person 1: "Well, here's Qdoba."

Person 2: "Qdoba?  Okay, I haven't been there in a while.  We can get in and out pretty quickly and get back to work."

That's pretty much how it is.  Nobody really plans to go out and eat at Qdoba.  It's one of those places you decide to go to on the fly or because you've eaten everywhere else.

The Mexifood is fair.  Nothing special, nothing bad, nothing to distinguish it.  There's tons of Mexican joints within ten miles that are better, but Qdoba's here in this strip mall.  Haven't eaten here in a while and don't want to drive any further?  This will make a nice alternative, and then you'll be good on this place for another six months or so. . .
