Table side guac and great city views.

The service was good and the food was good.

Right away we were served a huge portion of chips, salsa and beans. All delicious and helped hold us over before we got our food. We ordered the guacamole and it was made fresh, table-side. It was delicious. 

Up next we had the veggie fajitas, and a combo plate of chili rellenos and a chicken taco. I liked the flavors of the fajitas full of tons of different vegetables and I like that the tortillas are made fresh. 

The views of the city can't be beat.
