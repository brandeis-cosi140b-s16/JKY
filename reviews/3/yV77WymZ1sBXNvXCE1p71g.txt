I have a couple friends that love this joint. I thought it was pretty good but had a few small issues. First my order was wrong. Well okay the fixed it right. Well it seemed like it. 

I ordered a the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. I don't think the meat in my enchilada was chicken. If it was supposed be chicken I am still not sure it was chicken. They overall taste was good but not great on this item. 

I did enjoy the tamales though. I can see myself giving this place another shot in the future just based on the tamales.
