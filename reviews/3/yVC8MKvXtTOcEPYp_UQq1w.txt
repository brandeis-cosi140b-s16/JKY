people in phoenix will think this is a cool idea and the food is good, but as chinese, it's really just mediocre chinese food with tortillas mixed in.  i can't be a fan cuz the value is not there.  you know you can get those kinds of chinese food elsewhere for cheap, but when you're in the phoenix area, what can you do?
