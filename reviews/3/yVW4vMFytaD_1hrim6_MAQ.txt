I was craving Guacamole, as usual. We decided to try Z'Tejas since they make the table side Guac. 

Service was Extremely SLOW. 

By The Way, I think they should serve complimentary chips and salsa instead of the complimentary cornbread. 

Any how, I ordered the Guac and the Chips and Salsa. The 3 salsas were, House salsa (tasted like spaghetti sauce, too sweet, yuck) Verde with avocado and tomatillo ( good but really bland, I had to add salt) and Fire roasted ( most decent of the three but still on the sweet side and I had to add salt.) 

The Guacamole was the most disappointing of all though. I did order it with out cheese and onions but that shouldn't have made a difference. It was completely lack luster and flavorless. No Lime juice or seasonings were added to it at all, except Salt, by me.  And I rarely salt anything.

The husband did enjoy his breakfast enchiladas. 

The only reason they are getting 3 stars is because I do appreciate them having a small V/GF/VEG menu. Other than that, I wasn't impressed.
