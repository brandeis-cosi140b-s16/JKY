Tres Pesos is tasty, cheap and chill. The chips are homemade and delish, and they have a choice of 3 salsas: a chunky tomato and onion mix that's closer to pico di gallo, a traditional red salsa with cilantro, and a fiery green salsa that they'll bring if you request more heat, which is perfecto. The fishbowl margaritas come with fresh lime and the food, pretty standard Mexican fare, is what you'd expect: hearty and tasty, if not especially healthy. A reliable bet.
