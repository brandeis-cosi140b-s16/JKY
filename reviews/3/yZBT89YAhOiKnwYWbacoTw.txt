The food here is amazing!  When it comes to their service though, do not sit in the dining room. If you want your chips salsa and drinks refilled along with having warm food, that will not happen in the dining room. If you want good service sit in the bar. The service in the bar is amazing! I don't know if it is because the servers in there are better at their job or if it's  because they have less tables. Overall great service in the bar.
