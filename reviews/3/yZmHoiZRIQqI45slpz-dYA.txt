It's an ok place to get some ok mexican food.

This has been my 3rd time here and each time the quality of the food and service has been lacking.  The place use to be full of customers and on my recent trip, there were only 7 of us in the restaurant.  Evidently, this did not increase our chances of receiving a hot plate nor the correct order.
