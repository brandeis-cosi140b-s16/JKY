I'm not jumping for joy. I really thought I would LOVE this place but I didn't.

First, it's small inside, maybe 10 tables. No big deal but it sucked when we went because it was hot inside. It was like eating a meal inside a backpack. The "burritos" were good. They had a great flavor however, it was a snack, not a meal. My husband had a Ja-burrito and I had one and we shared a drink....$24. YIKES!!! And we were still hungry afterwards 

I would rather just get all you can eat sushi somewhere else and get my monies worth. I'm not returning.
