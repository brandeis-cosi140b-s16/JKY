This filibertos is nice and clean! How do I know this? Well it always smells like Mr. Clean!  ha ha! It's not so bad and it doesn't seem to stop others either.    My favorite is the chickent taco combo! Yum, I like the hard shelled tacos like my mom use to make.. The rice is pretty darn close to being perfect!  We order the horchata and jamacia for drinks - nice an sugary! It's open late and the service is always friendly and fast. Can't go wrong with fast food Mexican!
