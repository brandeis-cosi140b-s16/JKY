It would be hard to distinguish the pedestrian, south of the boarder offerings at Leticia's from those at Chevy's or On the Boarder.  I like the bean dip they served with the chips, but other than that, my two trips have resulted in frustrating, slow service and mediocre Mexican food.   I miss Vega's Caf√©!
