I've eaten here a couple of times, both pre-carnivore and now as a pescatarian.. or whatever you want to call it. I love seafood.

The tacos are great while everything else is pretty standard fare. The al pastor and carnitas are fantastic, but the carne asada was too fine in texture for me. They chop it so it's almost like a ground beef it's so small. The fish tacos are made with tilapia which in my opinion taste kind of like dirt. The thyme in the seasoning on it didn't help with that. The beans are rice are meh.

They have a good salsa bar with fresh citrus, spicy pickled carrots and cauliflower, your standard red and green sauces. But the highlight of the place is the frescos.

The juices they have available in the glass jugs up front are fantastically fresh and cold. Yes, they are stupid sweet, but during summer.. there are few things better than these sweet icy cold fresh fruit concoctions. Come for a couple tacos and the frescos!
