The food is pretty good here. Unfortunately the staff speaks little English. For example, today I called in an order for two potato tacos and a quesadilla (I know junk vegetarian at best) and I arrived almost 15 minutes later. They were not ready. I had to reorder them because they never got ordered.  I ordered in Spanish, but I had started in English so she didn't ask my name, and must not have actually taken my order. It's frustrating because I've now waited an additional 10 minutes and it's still not ready. Don't get me wrong, they are busy on Tuesdays, and I'll still eat here again, but this is not the first time I've waited an unbelievable amount of time for food. 

If I was rating food alone, I'd give closer to 4-stars, but not quite.
