I ordered tortilla soup and a green corn tamale for my lunch.  

The green corn tamale was okay.  There were not any visible green chilies or corn, but it had a nice corn-y flavor.  What made it was the green salsa that they served on the side.  Delicious!

The tortilla soup was not good, in my opinion.  It was simply broth, whole tortilla chips (which were hard to eat/cut in a soup) and what seemed to be store-bought guacamole.  The broth was good, but they'd be a lot better off if they skipped the guac, and just added a slice of lime, fresh avocado, and maybe some cilantro.

The hardest part about the visit was the service.  While the server was super sweet, she was obviously overwhelmed, as she was the only one servicing tables at lunch time.  They were out of a lot of things in their cooler (iced tea, specific kinds of tamales and empanadas), and they made the soup on the spot.  Some might see the soup thing as great service, but soup can be made at the start of each day and be just as good.  We'd prefer to get more efficient service than wait for soup.

I hope this restaurant can smooth out their kinks, because it seems like they have a lot of potential.
