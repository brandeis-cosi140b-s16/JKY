I was excited to try Maki Taco for the first time at the Chow Down Uptown on Thursday. I went with high expectation. I was a little let down. I got the Korean bbq with spicy kim chi (sp?). The flavor was good, not as spicy as I expected. Nice crunch on the veggies too. The problem was the amount of veggies and sauce. It was hard to find the tacos in there. The first one was really good but by the time I got to the third taco, it just fell apart (soggy) due to the excessive amount of sauce. It made for a messy experience. I've got to go back & try them again.
