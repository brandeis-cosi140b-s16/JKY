After a night spent in the airport, my dad and I were on the hunt for something decent to eat. We decided to try Salsarita's because the line was short, the prices were fair for airport food and the food looked fresh. Overall, it was an alright experience.

I got a breakfast burrito with egg, bacon, lettuce etc. and it was good. Apparently, they don't usually warm up the burritos because when I asked one of the ladies she said they only do that for quesadillas. My dad got a quesadilla and I had to watch as his was done to perfection. Luckily, another server offered to warm mine up. She was without a doubt the friendliest person I met on that trip, and thank goodness for that because based on the experiences I had in the NC Airport, I would not want to visit the city.
