We ordered 2 enchilada dinners and guacamole.  

Not crazy about chips and salsa.  Chips too heavy and warm salsa just not my thing.

Chicken enchilada in red sauce-  didn't really care for too much.  

Veggie enchilada in green sauce was pretty good. 

Guacamole:  pretty good but again the chips kinda didn't work for me

Pricing a little on the high end but we unknowingly got lucky and hit happy hour for enchiladas

Atmosphere was cute and felt like a like neighborhood place.
