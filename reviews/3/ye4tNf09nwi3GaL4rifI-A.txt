This place is not the cleanest, and has been known to score pretty low on health inspections. However, I love the little street tacos and have never had any problems myself. I'd say it is as sanitary as getting a street taco in Mexico, of which I've had many. 

They have all kinds of tacos - beef, chicken, pork, al pastor, goat, cow head, tongue - u name it. They have a lot of other stuff, too. I just get the tacos. 6 of them, because they are tiny. 

They have TVs for watching Futbol, a game of pool will run you 50cents and they have 3 video games in addition to a jukebox. No AC, so watch out for that in summer, but I usually use the drive thru.

If you are looking for a "hip" taco joint - move along. If you are looking for street tacos, hit this up.
