So, in search for another restaurant, that I was unable to find, I decided to check out Don Pedro's.  It was around noon on Sunday afternoon and I was seated at a nice booth in the bar.  I was immediately greeted with chips and salsa, which probably was my least favorite part of the meal. The chips were just okay, not bad, but definitely not good.  However, the salsa, way to runny for my liking, and it had somewhat of a tomato sauce flavor. I ordered a house margarita, why not, it was after 12 on a Sunday, and the lunch chicken fajitas. The margarita hit the spot and definitely had a good kick of tequila. Honestly, I debated a second, ha ha! The fajitas came out sizzling with peppers and onions and just the right amount of chicken.  I received rice, beans, guacamole, lettuce and sour cream with four flour tortillas. The entree was great and I loved the beans and guacamole.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal, but do wish the salsa and chips were better, fresh and more salsa like. And, other Yelpers raved about the service, which I thought was just okay.  Maybe it was being in the bar, but there were other tables around me and I felt the bartender was overwhelmed.  If I am in the area I would definitely give Don Pedro's another visit, especially for the margaritea.
