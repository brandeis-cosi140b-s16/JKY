Got home late from work on Friday didn't feel like cooking yada yada yada.  When you have young children you have got to find a place that is "child friendly".  Zapatas fits the bill.  Now, in my single days I used to go here all the time and the food was great, and I like that it is a step up from the places that you order a #14 and they bring you a plate of mixed crap, rice and beans.
They have a nice menu at Zapatas, kids meals are $3.99 which is a plus since my kids hardly eat anyway and we wind up throwing 1/2 the meal away.  First I noticed that their chips are different from the days of yore, they are thicker and don't seems freshly made.  You might say to yourself "Self, why does chip thickness matter", well I'll tell you why, if the chips are too thick and hearty and you eat too many because they're coupled with the most AWESOME white queso cheese dip you're too full for the meal! 
I ordered the Street Tacos which were just meh.  Nothing special and they hardly had any flavor.  The chicken was flavorless and there weren't many caramelized onions to add to the mix.  They used to have pulled chicken which was simmered in some kind of sauce which made the dish much mmore tasty.  The rice was terrible and the refried beans had a bitterness about them which made me leave them alone.  And for the love of Christmas, why they put the dollop of guacamole on top of lettuce baffles me.  They all do this and it doesn't allow you to use the full amount of guacamole on your dish since it gets caught up in the shreds of lettuce STOP IT!!!
I don't know what else to say.  Zapatas wasn't like the good old days last night, I fear they have gotten into the same pitfall as other restaurants of cheapening their product to save money in this crazy environment
