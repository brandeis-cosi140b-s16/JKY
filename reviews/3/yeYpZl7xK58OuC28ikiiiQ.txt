The building itself is nothing special. The service is pretty bad most of the time. But, for the price, the food is really good. The Super Mex margarita is worth going there for. I'm a huge relleno fan and theirs is the best I've had. Beware: if you order extra condiments, like sour cream, they may not let you know but an extra charge will show up on your bill.
