We've been going to Gardunos for a while. Their food isn't much to rave about and neither is the service. Our busser was so much more attentive than the waiter. I only saw him when he took our order and brought out the food. Other than that, the busser did everything. Maybe that's how it works with them. I do like the salsa bar, though. You can go up and get your own salsa and chip refills so you don't have to wait for someone to get it for you. 

My burrito wasn't all that great. The beef was kind of dry and the beans tasted like they had been sitting there for a week. My rice was good, though! 

They're not amazing, but I guess it suffices if you're hungry.
