So sorry Falisha that you assumed that I was lying about not getting my guacamole. Having to drive all the way back after getting home. "Maybe she put it on the inside of your burrito." Really? Because I told the gal "and can I get a side of guacamole?" Thankfully the other employees there outshine you. Believe me I am not a believer in "the customer is always right" motto but the next customer you do argue with probably won't end as nice.
