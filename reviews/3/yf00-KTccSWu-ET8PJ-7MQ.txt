Just visited Espo's for dinner and give it the following varied rating...as the deliciousness was inconsistent:
Salsa: 5 stars....yummmm...spicy and good flavor 
Chips: 3 stars...fresh, but a little too thick for me
Beans: 4 stars...hearty, fresh, and nice flavor 
Tostada: 5 stars...lots of fresh lettuce, cheese, and beans.  Would order this again.
El Jefe burrito: 1 star...Booo!  :(  It is Carne Asada with green sauce + cheese + pico.  It was waaaaaaaayy too salty.  Neither my husband or I finished it.  Would not recommend this even though the cashier did.  My husband said he'd give it a 2, but I'm writing the review so...
Portion sizes: 4 stars...large

All in all, I may go back for the bean tostada and salsa.  Nervous to order more meat given the salty carne.
