Okay so where do I start. I kept debating about two or three stars for this place as I border on "meh" and "A-ok" Very cool vibe in the place, sort of hip dive bar.Music was a little loud but it was music I like at least.  I think thought the food is overpriced, I paid about $10.00 for a machaca burrito, enchilada style with no sides.  The flavor was good but it was really salty and this coming from a person that loves salt.  Also, we had the habanero salsa and chips - also good but had to pay for it, I think around $4, whereas most mexican places chips and salsa are complimentary.  I liked the mild salsa, had a good smoked chipotle flavor to it - that might have been my favorite part of eating there. Also, had the pork belly beans, again good flavor but the pork belly was indistinguishable and pieces were so small they could easily put in salt pork and it would look and taste about the same. On the up side they sold Joseph James beer, so kudos for supporting a local brewery although I am not a huge fan of Joseph James in general but they are local. Ended up being $25.00 for lunch for two people with one ice tea. I noticed we were the only people in there eating food from Desnudo, the other two groups had pizza from Moon Doggies next door. A employee of Desnudo kept walking back to Moon Doggies and picking up the pizza to bring over for the other patrons, good service I guess in that respect and it made me wonder if they are owned by the same people. Either way, for the money I think I will try elsewhere next time. On a seperate note the plates for the burrito and the chips were both chipped in multiple places (no pun intended) - no big deal to me for a divey place but I am sure the health district might ding them on it.
