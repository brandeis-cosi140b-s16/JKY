Stopped in here while killing time before seeing a flick at Sundance because the cuz was in the mood for fake Tex-Mex. Overall, quite good! If you're looking for Tex-Mex or legit Mexican, I hate to break it to you, but: you're in the north. Stop being so hopeful about every little dumpy joint you come across. It ain't happening.

The chips were alright, but nothing special and not worth $3.95. I wouldn't have even taken the time to talk about them if they were complimentary, but since it was $3.95 for mediocrity I'm gonna call them what they were: mediocre.

I had the fajita chicken wrap, which was so, so good. The spiced mayo was spread evening, making it all just right. I ate half and saved the rest for a later meal because I liked it so much.

Not a terrible place to stop at while shopping around Hilldale or waiting to check out what's playing at Sundance, but not a destination in and of itself.
