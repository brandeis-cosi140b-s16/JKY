My brother raves about this place all the time so we decided to take a large party there for dinner. The food took a while to come out and when it did a few of the orders were mixed up. The waiter apologized and did what he could to quickly correct it but it did take some prodding. The food was really good but I actually do like Tia Rosas more. The prices seem to be a little high and the service needs to up its game a bit (if they can't accommodate  larger parties, they just need to be up front). Overall, we didn't mind too much because it gave us time to catch up and the food ended up being good. I think in smaller parties, I'd give rosas a 4 star instead but time will tell.
