Went for Cinco de Mayo drinks and was totally underwhelmed. It wasn't that busy, but the service was horrifically slow, the chips tasted stale, there was no music, and they overcharged us for happy hour drinks. 

They get an extra star since their salsa and margarita's were decent though. I'd agree with the other reviewers here that this place is just okay. There are certainly better restaurants out there.
