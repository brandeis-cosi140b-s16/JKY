So this is my second attempt for this location. I love Chipotle but the first time they dropped my food and got the salsa wrong. 

The second time they charged my food and someone else's. Even though I told her what I had. 

It might be because it seems really busy but it just makes me sad. There's another location less than 10 minutes away. I will probably just go there.
