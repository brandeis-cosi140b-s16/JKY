My boyfriend and I went here on Tuesday, December 1. The tacos themselves were decent, we did like those. The problem we had with them is the fact that they dole out hardly any meat but a TON of toppings. I asked for a taco, not just toppings. This needs to change. But like I said, it was pretty tasty. However, the service is extremely slow. Luckily we were the only ones in line at the time we ordered so it wasn't so bad for us, but right after, a large crowd came in for the dinner rush and it was SO. SLOW. The poor guy was bombarded, and didn't have help, but he could have also worked faster! He was just slow in general and didn't seem to be pleased to be there nor did he want to work hard or any faster. He, and the restaurant itself, needs to step up their game or they will lose all business for good.
