I will give them credit for the Salsa that comes with the chips.  It's very tasty.  Smokey, just a "tad" runny, but chock full of nice-sized onion chunks.  My two kids and I both loved it.

The rest of the food - nothing too special.  We had a chicken torta, and it was "OK" - nothing to make it stand out, yet nothing to complain about either.  Thus the 3 stars.

I want to give them another try and see if they can improve my view of them - and to give myself a chance to try more items.
