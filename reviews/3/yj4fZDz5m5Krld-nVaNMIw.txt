I like the atmostphere when it's busy but other than that I dunno!! They also if i must ad a have great happy hour. I have come here a few times and I have the same impression every time. The food is too expensive but I mean what do you expect it's vegas I paid 3 dollars for gum. Great place to grab a drink but I didn't like the food
