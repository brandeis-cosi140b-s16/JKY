decided to try last night as the place was busy which is usually a good thing . I ordered  a beef taco and a green chili burro togo in the drive through.  The service was quick and the food looked good. I started with the taco which w√†s crispy using an in house fried shell but the shell tasted like the oil was old an! the dark color showed the same. It had a nice amount of shredded beef but lacked any flavor at all, even the supplied hot sauce could not make it better. It did look good. The burro was a good size and first bite had a nice green chile flavor with a lot of pork. It was tasty although very salty. I will try again in hopes this visit was just an off day.
