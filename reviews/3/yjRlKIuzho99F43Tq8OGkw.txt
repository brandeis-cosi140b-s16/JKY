I've been wanting to try to place out for a while but never had the chance cause during Vegas trips I usually don't wonder out too far from the strip. Decided to finally try it out for lunch while I was out there. It's sorta a small place very casual. Since I am a pescatarian I was sorta limited to the menu and wish I could have tasted the meat items. But I did try their fish taco and that was pretty good . I order a half order of kimchi tofu fried rice. My boyfriend order the bulgogi fries that was really good the sauce that they drizzle was really delicious. But honestly I thought it was just another Korean Mexican fusion place that many places attempt to do in LA.
