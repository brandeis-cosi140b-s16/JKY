Well I promised my husband we would eat out less.  We, meaning him and I.  By myself, there is no we, just I, and I made no such promise.  I had to go to Staples, (never go to Staples hungry), and there was El Molino.  Calling to me like a beacon in the night.  Except it was day, and I wasn't navigating the sea.  And I figured, it has to be healthier than Betos.  I'm rethinking that call.

I had the special of two machaca tacos with rice and beans ($8).  The machaca was good, very spicy.  But the tacos shot a stream of grease every time I took a bite.  Beans and rice were alright, nothing special.  All in all, still just okay, but I wasn't scared of the beef like I sometimes am at Betos.
