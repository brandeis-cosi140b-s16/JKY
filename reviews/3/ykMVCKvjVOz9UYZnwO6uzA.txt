We eat Sunday lunch here several times a quarter. 

As many of the other reviews note, sometimes the service isn't the best in the world. 

Food okay, I especially like the Arroz con Camarones. Plenty of good, fresh tasting shrimp.

One thing I have noted in all of our visits there:
        If one is cold natured, make sure to dress suitably. There's always a cool, drafty feel to the restaurant. 

Not the greatest Mexican food in the world, but certainly nothing here has to be negative as some of these reviews are.
