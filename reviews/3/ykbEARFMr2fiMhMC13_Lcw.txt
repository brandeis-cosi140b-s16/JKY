On The Border...seriously sucks when it comes to service. It's bad. Very bad. It's so bad a pack of Hollywood script writers couldn't dream up some of the mistakes I've seen made here. But slap a bowl of salsa and hot chips in front of me and I almost forget that the waitress has been gone for 12 minutes and hasn't taken my order yet. Set a big lunch plate or dinner plate down with a mix of tamales, enchiladas, and chile rellenos and it's gone before I know it. 

I hate the service but when I'm at Ann & the 95 and hungry my car keeps finding it's way here. And I have a hunch it will again, and again, and again. 

3 stars...gotta drop a star as I'm not patient when it comes to slow service, and another star gets dropped because dang it, I wanted cheese enchiladas and cheese doesn't sound the same as chicken. Yet I sure seem to get a lot of chicken when I go here. Oh and the email sign up deal doesn't get you a free sopapilla until your next visit and they send a lot of email.
