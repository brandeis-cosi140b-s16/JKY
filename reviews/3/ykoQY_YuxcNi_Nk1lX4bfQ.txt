It's pretty good. Not excellent. Some drunken bar fly kept trying to get into the bathroom while I was using it. After announcing loudly that he had to (explicit term for using the restroom), he decided to use the ladies room.  He walked in on a woman who screamed. He walked away chortling. Kinda ruined the experience. The bartender should have kicked him out right then, but instead served him up another red eye. $77 for two adults and one 9 year old before tip is pretty pricey for Mexican food. La Pinta margarita is a must try, really good and not too strong. Posole is pretty good. They give you a lot! We'll come back based on location if we ever need a quick Mexican fix and don't mind paying extra for the convenience. The waitresses were all very polite.
