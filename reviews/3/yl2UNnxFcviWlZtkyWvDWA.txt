Come to Pink Taco on Tuesday nights between 10pm and 2am.  And never at any other time.  Dont eat, just get hammered off of $3.00 3 Olives drinks.  Bring a large group of people and only talk to them.  Follow my simple instructions and you will love this bar!

Apparently I should have written this memo earlier, since then you would have been spared the miserable experience of eating at PT, standing in line at PT, breaking your bank at PT, or meeting assclowns at PT.  

Thats really all I have to say.  The bar is fun when youre drunk and can stumble around, dance and hang out with your friends.  Perfect for the birthday party I was at a few Tuesdays ago.  Other than that, the food sucks, the people are idiots and the drinks are weak.  

Ya dig?
