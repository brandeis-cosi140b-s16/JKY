So with all the reviews that I read I didn't know if I should try it or not and opted to give it a shot since I had never been. We got cornbread, chips and salsa, Diablo pasta with shrimp and the New York strip.

My husband seemed to enjoy the cornbread, I think he was hungry.  The chips and salsa were chips and salsa. The steak was cooked perfectly at medium rare but needed a lot of salt. My first bite of my Diablo pasta I made a face because it was something about the flavor. It was Rosemary. I don't like Rosemary. The pasta was not overcooked it would've been more enjoyable if I like the flavor. 

So we discussed if we would ever come back and probably not. But if we did we would probably order something else. 

Our waiter was friendly!

It was noisy but not too bad. I could still hear my husband talking across  table.  So we gave it a shot and onto the next.
