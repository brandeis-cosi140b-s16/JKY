This is a hole in the wall Mexican place like you might find out West; the decor made me feel right at home.

Rating a place like this is somewhat difficult; if I were rating it amongst other similar Pittsburgh establishments, I might give it four stars instead of three since most Mexican places around here are so horrifically bad. The three stars represents the overall rating of all similar restaurants I've experienced including ones out West.

Friendly service, and the tacos were decent but not incredible. I had a chicken taco which wasn't too bad, although I wasn't too impressed with the quality of the toppings. The guacamole, for example, was not very good. I also got a breakfast burrito with eggs, potatoes, and bacon. The bacon was undercooked and rubbery and they didn't even bother to chop it up.

Overall, I would say this is a decent place, but nothing special. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if I was hungry and nearby I might try it again.
