Verde is pretty solid. I walked in thinking they really needed to showcase some local artists on their bare walls. Hopefully that will happen soon enough, it's a prime downtown location and the place could use a little warming up.

I tried both the Red Chili Beef and the Green Chili Pork. The green was good, but the red really got my taste buds popping. I could make out smoked chili, cloves, cinnamon, the distinct flavor and mild heat will definitely bring me back for more. The tortillas were amazing and served piping hot. They were out of horchata the day I went so there is razone n√∫mero dos en regresar.

Try it you won't be disappointed.
