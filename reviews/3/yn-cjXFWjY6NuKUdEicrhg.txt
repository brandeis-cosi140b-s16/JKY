the hubs and I went here this past Sunday for breakfast. 

Our waiter was realllllllly slow, like we sat down and sat and sat for a good 10 minutes when a lady walked by and asked if anyone had taken our drink order, we said no she asked what we wanted. When she came back she gave us the drinks and said she wasn't our waiter but would go find him. 

He arrived and was nice. Took our order that was it. 

The food came out pretty quick. I had the biscuits and gravy. The biscuits tasted frozen but the gravy was good. The hashbrowns were lacking. 

Hubs got the special which had the most heavenly pancakes ever! Soooo good and so giant! Also I stole one of his sausage links which was very good as well! I will order this next time. 

Also at some point a freaken lounge act started playing! They weren't any where near amazing, BUT they totally made the experience awesome, we totally dug on the live music while eating our breakfast. 

Its not the worst breakfast joint, but not the best. The prices are really cheap, we would go back again.
