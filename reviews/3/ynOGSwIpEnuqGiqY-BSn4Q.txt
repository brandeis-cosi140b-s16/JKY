I love going for breakfast. Huevos rancheros is one of my favorites. Service is on the slow side. None of the servers have a smile on their face and it takes forever to get your check. Hostess is always in the back and you can stand at the front without anyone acknowledging you. Managers never seem to pitch in and help. Furniture needs to be reupholstered. Go for the food but nothing else.
