The drive thru is more cordial than the counter service.
Okay, this probably isn't true all if the time but it applies to tonight.
The food is inexpensive, portions large, taste generally good too.  
I like the green chili burrito.  It's filled with shredded pork in a green chili sauce and it's got some spice but I still require hot sauce.
Salsa bar has good variety and there's a place where you can serve yourself chips.
Crazy hours -they're open 24/7.  Perfect for the bar crowd.
