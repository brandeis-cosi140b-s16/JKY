Picante is basically Chipotle without the higher end ingredients, but it's good, and there are a lot of deals usually during the week. I know for sure that they have $2 tacos on Tuesdays, and some other ones that I can't think of now.  I've had both burritos and tacos and they're just like Chipotle, but not quite as good IMHO. I think they just don't taste quite as fresh, which may be a function of the fact that it never seems too busy in here so the ingredients might be sitting out for longer.  I'll keep swinging in here when I'm hungry and need a quick meal.
