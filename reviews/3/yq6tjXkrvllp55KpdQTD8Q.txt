It's easier to think about the things that I don't like about Rosita's than it is to think about why I eat there every now and then.  Pretty much, I only eat there when I'm either extremely hungover and don't want to drive any further than I absolutely have to or when I'm in a hurry because it's so close to my house and the food comes quickly.

Basically, this place has got two things working in its favor:

1. It is extremely close to my house
2. Damn good salsa.

However, this is a Tempe Hotspot for some of the ugliest and weirdest people around, including some old drunk dude I always see staggering around University and Hardy with the same look of bewilderment.  One time, I'm pretty sure he was being thrown out because everyone looked mad at him and he walked out with an air of indignance.  Another time, I heard a different old man cough, then fart, then cough again.  These are the kinds of people you will see at Rosita's.

Overall, the food, though not great, is not bad.  Yes, it's greasy, but if you're hungover, you'll feel better.  It's fine for what it is.  I really enjoy the chimichangas.
