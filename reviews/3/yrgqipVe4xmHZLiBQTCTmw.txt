I went through the drivethrough at about 10PM and got two tacos. (1.99 each) they were good, hot and fast. Its the kind of place I would hit up when you have a severe case of the munchies or have a late night at the bar. I cannot comment on the dinning room service or the food during the day but it was good enought to warrant a day time visit for sure.
