Place is now closed-   The service was excellent.   The chips were fine, salsa ok.   I had chicken mole. I would rate it as better than average.   My date had enchiladas suizas.  They were not the best I've had.   We had a long island iced tea which was very good.  Overall, this place is ok.  I wouldn't rate it better than Azteca.
