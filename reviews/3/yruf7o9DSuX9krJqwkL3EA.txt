Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday for happy hour. It was a weekday and hardly any guests inside or on the patio. We  sat on patio & hostess was prompt in bring out menus. However the wait service was not good. Guacamole & nachos were delicious. Sad that food was so good but service overshadowed the overall experience. Might give it one more try in case the service level was a fluke.
