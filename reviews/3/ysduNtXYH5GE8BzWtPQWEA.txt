Nice place with a fun ambiance. The tacos are good. I've had better but I would recommend this place if you are in the area. The best meat was the carnitas. Lots of flavor and juicy. Definitely do the carnitas on whatever you get. The Asada had a nice grill flavor. The Asada could have been slightly juicier but it wasn't dry. The pastor was good. Had a hint of spice and overall pretty good. The Asada and the pastor would tie for my second favorite. The chicken was nothing special and my least favorite. It didn't really have much flavor and was on the drier side. All in all pretty good but if you are willing to drive about 20 minutes there are a number of places that I would choose first. The price was right for the tacos at $1.50 each. You can fit 8 adults at the booths and there was plenty of seating otherwise.
