Sadly food just OK - Nice service & view. We were hoping for greatness based on some internet reviews - But our experience was very underwhelming with a  good view.  There is way better Mexican food to be had at other restaurants  here in Las Vegas.  Our beef fajitas were not sizzling (not even hot)  and flavor just OK -- and our friend's ordered shrimp fajitas which hardly had any shrimp  Seriously, it was chintzy.  Flaming Fajitas on Tropicana really does it right. Our orders here were very ordinary.   We wanted to really love it -- but our food experience was very so-so. Got tableside guacamole -- and it was fun to watch, just OK.flavor.  Best guacamole we've had in town found at El Sombrero Mexican Bistro (not made tableside but excellent ).
