I personally like this Taco Bell a lot it's in a perfect location for me.. Inside is not really updated but that's alright it's pretty clean...
I been going since I was a child..

But...


The past few times they keep forgetting to get all my items in the bag at the drive through first it was the cheesy roll up missing... Glad my 2 year old didn't miss it, or else that would have been hell.. The next visit my husband gets the nacho cheese chips and they did not put the cheese in the bag.... 

Taco Bell sauce packets for the chips I guess... 

Come on Taco Bell pay closer attention to your drive through and making sure you get ALL the items in the bag. K Thanks....
