Came here on a Sunday night Waited max 10 minutes for a table and was dropped off  with waters and chips. I counted four servers who seemed a bit over whelmed. Super rushed to take my food and drink order, she wasn't rude, just kept it moving. I couldn't even get her name cause she never introduced herself, like I said, staff seemed like they were overwhelmed. The place is small so didn't see why they felt this way. Food came out quickly. And it was very tasty, nothing to write home about, but the atmosphere is cool and modern. Music was way too loud, I was practically yelling trying to talk to my company. Overall I would come back, for a quick bite to eat.
