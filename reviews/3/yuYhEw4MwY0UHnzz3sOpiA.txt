Macayo's Mexican restaurant has been a favorite in our family for years. For some reason we were told when we stopped in today for lunch that they no longer serve red or green chili except on the weekend. I don't have any idea who thought this up but I think it's crazy. If you people have forgotten you serve Mexican food which includes red or green chili.
