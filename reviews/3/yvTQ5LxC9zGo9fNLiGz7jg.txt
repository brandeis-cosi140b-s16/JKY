Located in a shopping area west of town, this restaurant has little to offer in the way of ambiance or atmosphere, but the food was good, and the service prompt and friendly. The menu has the usual expected entrees; I had an acceptable chili relleno combo, which was satisfying, but not exceptional. It was about the best I've had in Wickenburg, which maybe isn't saying a whole lot, but still. No alcohol, so no beer or margaritas.
