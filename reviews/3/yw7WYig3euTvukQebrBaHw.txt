Roberto's is a pretty decent place for Mexican food in North Las Vegas. My friend lives just down the street from this place and I go here to feed the friends when I'm in town and everyone is craving something greasy. 

I've tried the carne asada fries and they're pretty decent. There aren't too many options for Mexican around these parts so Roberto's is basically your only option.
