Tried Salazar Bros. for the first time.  Service was great and friendly.  The prices were average to Filiberto's or the like.  I was a little disappointed with the food.  I ordered the Chorizo and eggs breakfast platter.  The chorizo was very bland and dry and the rice and beans are just OK.  I ordered 3 rolled tacos with guacamole as well and those were tasty.  Would I eat here again?  I would but with Filiberto's just a mile away, that would be my first choice.
