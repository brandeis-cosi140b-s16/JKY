I went in for karaoke on two different nights, Friday had some interesting characters and was very entertaining. There were fewer people on Saturday, but it was still fun with my group of friends, and we were able to get through the rotation pretty quickly. 

On Saturday, I had the MLF margarita and shared an order of spinach artichoke dip. Both were good; I would order them again if I went back. Service at Top Shelf is terrible. Our waitress on Saturday told us there wasn't a drink menu, even though I ordered from one on Friday. She seemed genuinely confused by our requests for a pitcher of margaritas for the table, and brought two glasses for the four of us. Then, she had to consult with her manager to figure out what the pitcher options were. We waited about a half an hour for her to come back for my drink order, and walked past us several times. Finally, we literally had to yell at her to get her attention. When it came time for the tab, we planned ahead, knowing it could take 20 minutes for her to come back. Friday's service was slightly better, but not by much. On neither night was the bar area packed with people. 

I was happy with the value for my money; a 17 oz margarita was $6, I assume that at a bar, a small margarita would cost close to the same.
