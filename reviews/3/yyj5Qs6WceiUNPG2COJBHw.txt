To start this place is in a sketchy neighborhood and only accepts cash. That said it looks a little run down when you walk in but the did just score an A on a health inspection in August. 
The caramelo was mediocre - it needs more cheese and to be crisper. The tacos are boring! The carne adasada was ok flavor wise but a little dry. The Sonoran dogs- not the best in the state (head to Tucson for that) but for sure the best I have had in the Phoenix area. 
The service was a little slow (about 15-20 minute wait) and since I don't speak Spanish there was limited interaction. 
At the end of it I say go but just got the hot dogs!
