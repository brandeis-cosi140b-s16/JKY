The new location opened up 2 weeks ago and they still have a lot of issues to work through.  The microphones weren't working to notify people that they are ready to seat you, the wait times were way off as they told us 30 min and it took nearly 50 min.  The server who was employed with them for over 10 years was over worked.  She wasn't attentive, never came back to our table once we were served until finally we flagged her down for more water and tortillas.   Although after asking she never showed up with the request.  Finally she came back to drop the check and we asked her for the tortillas again and she slammed her hand on the table and took off.  She came back but dropped to go boxes at the same time as the check but we were not done eating.  We provided some constructive criticism to the manager who apologized and took 50% off our bill.  The food was excellent as always but the service struggled.  The new location is smaller than the old location as they have less tables.  The manager stated that the computers have glitches and the bussers are all new but the kitchen and servers followed them.  The atmosphere is loud as there is no fabric or carpet throughout its all wood and echoes.  So if you want a quiet dinner or want to hear the people at your table forget it.  They were very crowded and obviously were not ready.
