Thankfully I don't get the urge too often to eat here, but when I do I usually end up putting a good dent into one of their 1,000 calorie burritos. 

With so many burrito places in Phx, Chipotle is a once and awhile spot. The chicken is always well seasoned and juicy and the rice and tortilla have that oh too much butter taste. 

Overall I would say that this Chipotle is perfect for the business crowd it caters too. Nice burrito at a fair price and good service.
