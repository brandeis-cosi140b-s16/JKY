Well, after all of the buzz, we finally tried it out. The place was jumping. All the tables were full and several people in line. Luckily we got a table. The place is indeed clean and the service friendly and fairly quick. I had the carne asada burrito. It was just ok. The meat was nicely seasoned but it was super small and the meat a little tough and for $6, not a bargain at all. For less money I can get a local carne asada burro that is probably twice as big and better tasting in my opinion. The Mrs. had a bean and cheese burro and said it was good but again, pretty small. The chips and salsa are fine but not anything special. Might try it again for something else but all in all not super excited.
