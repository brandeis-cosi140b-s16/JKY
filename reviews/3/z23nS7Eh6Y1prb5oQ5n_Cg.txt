Was looking for someplace new to try best home. Andale got great reviews & recently opened so we gave it a try. It is a hole in the wall hidden in the back of a shopping center. It was empty & there was no one there other than the owners kids keeping busy after school. The prices were very reasonable, cheap in fact. Good variety of choices of food. I tried a few different items. Fajita plate: had to ask for tortillas & all they had were street taco size tortillas. It was ok. Pork tamale: not bad. Pupusa: decent. Wife had a variety of street tacos & she said those were excellent. Very friendly waitress.
