You know, as much as Cabo lives in infamy for so many, I can't really see it through the same lens of "amazement" or "culinary nirvana," but I can land on it being a solid choice...if the wait isn't too long. I've been coming here for years and even used to frequent the other location in Blacksburg, VA. Where's Cabo's menu isn't s strong point for my taste, it's a great spot for a few margs, decent fish tacos, and perfect for street-side seating in the summertime. 

*Sigh*...the menu. Some of the items here just don't really push past the point of being worth the dollars. Believe me, the blackened tuna or mahi tacos are great. Love the slaw, the tortillas work well, they are piled high with goodies, and the flavors abound...but the rest of the plate? No thanks, brosef. The sides are ever-so lackluster. Jalapeno mashers? Ick. They never end up coming out right. Also, every time I've ordered a side of beans, I regret it. Also, for the veggie-lover, DON'T order the veggie burrito. The addition of zucchini and yellow squash inside the tortilla is an atrocity. But hey, if the sides are the worst part of their game, I think they are doing just fine for a NoDa staple. 

Also, be prepared to wait on a Friday or Saturday night. The addition they have on the patio is awesome in the spring or summer. If you have a large group, you might end up with at least an hour wait on a busy night. I'm privy to heading here for lunch. Much more accessible. 

Cabo, you are welcome in my book. I'm not a huge fan of your side items, but your space is killer and I'm a sucker for fish tacos. Cheers!
