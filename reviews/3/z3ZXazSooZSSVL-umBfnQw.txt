Have seen this place for years and we decided to try it this past week. We walked right in and they gave us a table. We got excited when we seen it was a family restaurant of Azteca, which we love. Services was good and the waiter was very friendly. 

But the food was just so so, nothing great nothing bad. All and all not a bad dinner but we will probley try somewhere else when we are in the mood for Mexican.
