Great homemade tortillas but meat was bland. Needed to use outside sauces and salsa to flavor, but maybe that's deliberate. Floor needed to be swept a little but appeared very clean otherwise. Very casual/simple dining, almost like fast food. Not a sit-down and be served by a waiter place; you stand in line and your food is handed to you on a plastic tray. Other reviews I've read seemed to have been expecting a traditional sit-down restaurant and that's just not what this place is. It's very laid back but the food is real good.
