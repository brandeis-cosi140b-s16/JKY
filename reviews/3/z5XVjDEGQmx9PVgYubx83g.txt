I went here for the Breakfast Club on Saturday morning and will have to say that the company was 5 stars, but the food and experience was more like a 3 star. We all sat out on the patio, which was nice. They gave us chips and salsa...the salsa was a little odd (had olives in it) and the hot salsa was not hot, tasted like slightly spiced tomato sauce or something. The chips were really good though, they were fried flour tortilla chips, not the typical corn. They also give you a free trip to the chocolate fountain, which was pretty good. The fruit was fresh and the chocolate was....chocolate...seriously, can't go wrong there. With breakfast, I got a mimosa which was only 3$, so that was pretty good. It was nothing special tasting, but it was cheap and alcohol. For breakfast I got the benedict with chicken. This is where they kind of went wrong. The chicken was dry and did not seem to be cooked fresh, or if it was, it was overcooked. The eggs were messy, the person poaching them let the whites go all over so it wasn't one cohesive egg and the eggs had slid off of the chicken by the time it got to me. The hollandaise was ok, but nothing special...it is supposed to be jalapeno hollandaise and just had maybe a slight spicy taste. The plate came with some dry looking beans that I did not eat and some potatoes that were nothing special. The BF got the pancakes, which were dry and tasted like they came from a package. I wouldn't say 'no' if I were invited back here, but I wouldn't come back here for breakfast on my own. I would like to come here for drinks one night as their patio is nice and they have a bocce ball court (which is awesome!), but I probably would pass on the food.
