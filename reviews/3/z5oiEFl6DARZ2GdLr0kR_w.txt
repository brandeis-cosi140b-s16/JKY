I'll give them 3stars because there is so much potential, but it was really just okay.  I'll start with what I liked: The Aqua Roja, a very yummy raspberry mixed drink. Also liked the style of the style and decor of the restaurant. Now for the average part of the experience: the food, the service, and atmosphere. There were about 10 customers in the whole place. Granted, it was the coldest night I think we've had all year, but it was a Saturday night and there was an NFL pllayoff game on. Anyway, I think this place is a victim of a bad location. They are too far from Scottsdale road and in a business area with no residential close by. Good luck to El Santo though because I really wanted to like it more. I love their ads with the little Chichuchua.
