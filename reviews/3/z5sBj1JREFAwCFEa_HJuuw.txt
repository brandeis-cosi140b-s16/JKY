Great place for a quick fix of Mexican food. Can't say it's the best or the worst but it's cheap, close, and satisfies my hunger! 

The portions for carne asada fries big and it's only $8. The adobado & carnitas plates are also descent. I'd stay away from the rolled tacos and tamales as they weren't that great. 

Just remember, this place isn't world class dining...it's just fast and cheap!
