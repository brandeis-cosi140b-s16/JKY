Came here from the airport. Ordered the carnitas burrito which was okay.  Had salsa and gucamole also in the burrito. I should have ordered sour cream, rice, cheese, and beans to put inside which I saw on the menu later on. I like they have a salsa bar with 2 different types of salsa and lime. Another plus is that they are open 24 hours.
