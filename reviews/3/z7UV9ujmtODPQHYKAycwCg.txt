Meal:  Good portion and pretty good lunch combo deal. Love the chips and dips they provided.  The churros were really good.

Service:  The food was really good but the service was ridiculously slow.  We came here for my coworker's birthday so we have a large party of 11.  I understand that with a large party food sometimes take longer to come out.  However, it is not a reason to make the lunch a 3 hour event.  We looked around and saw that they were a bit understaff so we were a bit patient with waiting.  I was the only one in the group that ordered a margarita because a lot of people said they were great here.  But they managed to forget my drink, it was even harder to wave someone down to remind them.  Alas, I never got it. I'm just going to assume that it was never in the system.  With all the waiting and how long the meal was, one of my other coworker just got up and flagged down the waiter to get our check and paid the bill so we didn't have to wait for split checks. I don't even want to imagine how long that would've taken.

Conclusion: I would tell people to try this place but please only do it when you know you do not need to be somewhere after the meal just because you never know when you can leave.
