Our family ate here a lot when we lived in AZ.  Last night I was in town and my folks wanted to go.  It has not changed a bit!  

Outstanding salsa (you have to ask for the "hot" if you want it).  Great thin chips.  Prices seem to have gone up which is disappointing but you get plenty of food.

Nothing great to look at, not the best Mexican food in AZ, but good solid stuff.
