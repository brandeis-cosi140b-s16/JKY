Decent Mexican food.  Actually not all that exciting.  The burrito chicken is a little rough, though the other parts of the burrito/meal (cheese/wrap/guac/beans/rice) helped make up for that.

Also they gave out chips and salsa at the beginning and a cinnamon chip at the end, so that was nice.

All in all, ok.
