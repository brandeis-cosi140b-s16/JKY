There isn't really anything for me to say about this place. It's not bad, but it isn't great either. The primary reason that my girlfriend and I keep going back is that it is literally right next to her apartment complex, so it is as convenient as it gets for us. 

It's the same greasy, fast, mexican food that you get at all those other generic places around the valley. You know, the ones with the giant, colorful menus on the wall that all look the exact same? I won't mention any specific food that we had, because there wasn't anything really special, good or bad, worth mentioning.

The people that work there are just that, there. I've only ever seen the same girl, but she looks like she doesn't enjoy it there, as I have never seen her smile.

In conclusion, the only two things that really make it worth going here are that it is very inexpensive, and, for us, the location is unbeatable when we don't want to cook and don't want to go anywhere. I won't tell you not to go there, but don't expect anything special when you do.
