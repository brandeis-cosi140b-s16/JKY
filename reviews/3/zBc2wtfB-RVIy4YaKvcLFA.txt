While stuck in Apache Junction for Ren-Faire, we decided to try this place out.
The service was good and the patio was nice.  Both of us ordered the Carne Asada was actually very good in taste in quantity. For the $16 they were charging, it had better be.
However don't waste your time on margaritas, unless you go during their 2-5 'Fiesta Hour' we got the 'big' house margaritas and they were the WEAKEST I've tasted in my entire life.  And trust me, I've had my share of margaritas in my time.  
Even after drinking the whole thing and half of my gf's, i didn't even feel buzzed.
So thumbs up on the food, thumbs WAY DOWN on their margaritas.
