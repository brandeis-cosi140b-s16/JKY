3.5 or so

I like Chino. I always have. YET I have only been there about 6 times in my life. It is just something I do not crave. 

I had Jade Red Chicken. It was mildly spicy but still had a little flavor. The white rice was cooked perfectly. The snicker doodle was the highlight. 

Service is always great and the place still can use some cleaning.
