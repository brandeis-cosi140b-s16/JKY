I have only been to Cafe Rio once. Wait, that isn't quite accurate... I have only EATEN at Cafe Rio once, at this location. I tried going to another location a while back while on my lunch break and ended up walking out due to a very long, slow moving line. 

Allison S. and I were planning on getting some take out and decided to give the new neighborhood Cafe Rio a try. When we walked in the line was insane, but for how many people that were waiting to order and pay it moved fairly quickly. It took us about 25 minutes total to get through the line, order and pay. It was also quite loud, which made hearing the employee while ordering difficult. 

I ended up ordering a grilled chicken salad. Not a fan of places like Cafe Rio that charge more for "fire grilled chicken" versus "chicken" but I still paid the extra buck to have fire-grilled chicken. As previously mentioned, the ordering process was chaotic so when asked, I said I'd take everything on the salad. Total damage for the salad only was a little over $10. A bit steep, but the serving was quite large. 

The food itself was good. Not great. Comparable to Chipotle (which I am not a huge fan of either) or Qdoba (which I prefer to this). That said, I still plan on returning to try other menu items.  Hopefully by the time I return some of the 'new business in the area' hype has died down.

P.S. For whatever reason, this location isn't showing up on the website, so online ordering is not currently possible.
