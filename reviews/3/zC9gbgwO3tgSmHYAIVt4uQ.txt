After two additional visits- one on the Foodie Tour where we made mojitos and guacamole and dinner friends I have slightly elevated my thoughts on the new La Paz. Thursday night is $4 margaritas. Which are served in a hefty water glass. Sundays means $4 sangria which I would like to try. I had the Mexican Flag enchilada trio. The best being the spinach and goat cheese one. Everything else is pretty middle of the road. I would go back for more spinach and goat cheese enchiladas. Sit in the bar area for tons of extra large flat screens.
