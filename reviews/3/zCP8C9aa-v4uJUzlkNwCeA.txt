Food: 3 stars. My 'naked' grilled veggie burrito tasted fresh and flavorful, but 'grilled veggies' was limited to zucchini and squash. Also the assembly line system makes for a very uneven burrito. My veggies and beans disappeared under huge scoops of guacamole and cheese. The selection of salsas, however, is great and is sure to satisfy everyone.

Staff: 2 stars. Unfriendly and are obviously just there to get the job done.

Atmosphere: 3 stars. Standard fast food setting. Lots of windows. Attracts a usual business and school crowd, and gets very busy at lunch time.

Price: 2 stars. Expensive for a simple fast food burrito! I could go to a sit down Mexican restaurant and get something much better for about the same price.
