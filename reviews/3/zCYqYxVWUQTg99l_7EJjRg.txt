Food: 3.5
Service 2.5-3.0

Pretty good food overall:  tuna ceviche was light and fresh, blue corn and plaintain chips were good when served fresh, (otherwise the stale were inedible), steak tacos with handmade tortillas were pretty good, and the cochinita pibil was tender.  

Service was friendly, however, severely inexperienced or lacking communication between the FOH and BOH.  Experienced long waits even for drinks and forgetful orders.

Other notables:  prices are fairly high, great patio, relaxing dining area, and nicely designed bathrooms
