Decided to give this place a shot one fine Saturday after many recommendations and the positive reviews here on yelp, which left me with some pretty high expectations.

Now, I need to preface this by saying I am a Mexican and have eaten alot of carne asada tacos in my lifetime.  I love them.  And I'm open to trying them "as they come" from different establishments. 

When ordering tacos, the price is usually an indicator of the size no?  Like an average lunch should be no more than $10? Especially when we're talking carne asada tacos.  I don't think that's too much to expect especially from a place calling itself a "taco shop".  So when i saw the tacos were just shy of $3 each I figured two would suffice.  Nope.  I'm guessing maybe four of those suckers might have filled me up.  More than I'm willing to pay for simple carne asada tacos.  But its good to support small local business right? Right.

The tacos here were good. Tasty.  And I understand their "shtick" and all.  Good service, nothing out of this world but by no means bad.  They had a couple kids working up front.  The horchata was tasty.  Food came out promptly.  I'm sure they used quality ingredients and at no point did I feel the possibility of contracting some food-borne illness from my food (which would have made the experience more authentic in my opinion, heh)

I just didn't think it was "all that" and the size/taste, to me, did not justify the price.

This place is like "street tacos" for suits, families,  or people who are scared of going into Mexican dives. 

On a sidenote: the photo treatment they use over and over again on "America's" photo is ill-suited and miss leading.  I thought that was the "vampiro" I saw mentioned.  Guys if you need a menu re-design hit me up.  :)

I will probably be back at some point since this is in my neighborhood and the food was tasty after all.  I'll either order more tacos or something else.
