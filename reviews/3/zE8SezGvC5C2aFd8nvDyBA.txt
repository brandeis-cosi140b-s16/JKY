We slept late this past Saturday and wanted burritos for breakfast.  I was feeling to lazy to go to the store for the essentials and then cook and clean up; so we decided to try Armando's on Carefree Highway.  I headed out the door w/ the orders and the $$.  

Armando's is on the south side of Carefree Highway at 7th street, behind the Discount Tire; it's at the west end of the strip mall.

When I went inside, the place was neat, clean, and empty!?!?  I know it was a little later in the morning, but I was still surprised that I was the only one there.  The young lady at the counter greeted me w/ a smile and was pleasant and helpful w/ the order. 

I ordered a chorizo and egg burrito, a "Mando's" burrito for my wife; and as usual, a bean and cheese burrito for Jr.  I also ordered a side of rice.  Before I knew it, I had my food and was heading for home.

The chorizo/egg burrito was good.  The tortilla was soft and it was stuffed w/ a nice mixture of the spicy sausage and egg.  My wife enjoyed the "Mando's" burrito; it had egg, potato, bacon, and cheese.  Once again, the tortilla was fresh and soft.  Jr. liked the bean and cheesed burrito, but it was a little to big for him.  I had a small sample of it, and must say the beans were good.  The side of rice was very good.  The rice had a lot of flavor, and was moist w/out being sticky. 

I can't find my receipt, but I want to say the entire bill was about $13, and we were all full and happy w/ our breakfasts.  

I am giving Armando's 3 stars, since the only meal I have had here was breakfast.  We will try it soon for lunch or dinner; and if it's just as good as breakfast, I'll up it to 4 stars.

I'm glad that Armando's is in the area; it is a welcome addition.
