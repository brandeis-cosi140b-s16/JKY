Chris and I decided to try Cafe Carumba on a Saturday night before meeting some friends at a nearby lounge. I made reservations via OpenTable that week, but they were not necessary at all because for 7:30 pm on a Saturday, Cafe Carumba was not busy at all. We were seated at a table in the corner against the windows...it was kind of an awkward spot. 

We had the chips and salsa for an appetizer, which was $5. The salsa had just the right kick for my taste. I had the Mediterranean flatbread pizza as my dinner which was delicious, but how can you go wrong with mozzarella and pesto? It was just the right amount to leave me satisfied but not super full. Chris had the chicken oaxaca as his entree and liked it well enough, but was not blown away. Prices were very reasonable and there were a lot of small plate options. Our bill was $41 before tip which included 2 beers, chips and salsa, the flatbread pizza, and 1 entree.

I would go back to Cafe Carumba for a casual meal to sit at the bar and share some of the small plates.
