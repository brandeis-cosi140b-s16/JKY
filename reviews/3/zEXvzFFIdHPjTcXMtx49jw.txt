Weird location, inside a sports bar.  Anyways, my cousin and I got there at around 12 on Sunday. It was empty except for two workers. We ordered chips & guac, carne asada tacos, and carne asada fries. Everything needed more salt except for their salsa. Their guacamole is made fresh but still under seasoned. I was disappointed because I expected more from such a highly rated place on Yelp. It tasted mediocre.
