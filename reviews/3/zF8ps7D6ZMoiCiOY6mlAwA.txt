This place was really good. A little pricey, every time we ordered something shed put in one number which was on the menu and then add a few more cents-a dollar which was kinda shady since we actually removed stuff from what we wanted (no sour cream, no cheese etc) 

The staff was not friendly. I talked to two girls neither one even spoke except to tell me my total, or that our order was ready. 

The chips were pretty expensive $3 something but really tasty. Salsa selection sucked. They have one red and one green both liquids, no chunky salsa or any other kind, just super hot red saucy stuff and green saucy stuff. There were a lot of other condiments, there were green onions, radishes, cucumbers jalape√±os, and carrots. 

Overall I really liked this place and I'm glad we found it and that its 24hrs!
