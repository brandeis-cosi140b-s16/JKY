We have come here many times before and these guys are usually very good but they missed the mark tonight. In their defense, they were VERY busy but......
We had to ask for drink refills several times and the food order came separately and very slowly. The restaurant was clean and had a nice atmosphere. Staff was friendly. Food was "OK" compared to previous visits which I would describe as "very good". We will come back, but not soon.
