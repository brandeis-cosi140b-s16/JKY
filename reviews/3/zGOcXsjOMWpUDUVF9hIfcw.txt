I've visited this location twice and both times it was the same.  Good service, fast service, and service with a smile.
I'm not huge on Chipotle and I rarely eat there unless someone else is (as in both of my cases).  
It's Chipotle, and in saying that, it's like saying "It's McDonald's", which comes with a certain familiarity and consistency that you expect associated with the name.  That said, It's decent, quick, and somewhat cheap.
I had the barbacoa tacos on one visit, and also the new Fritias(sp?) soybean meat burrito.  I was not blown away by either, but it was both palatable and is more than enough for one person.
