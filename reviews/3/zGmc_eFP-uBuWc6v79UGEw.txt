The food was good, my sangria was good.  The prices were cheap.  I did notice they charged me wrong for my sangria, it was $2.75 on the menu and they charged $3.75 on the bill, I wasn't too concerned about the issue though.. my bill was only $20 for two of us (definitely can't complain).  

My problem was the service.  We got the chips and salsa pretty promptly(Great salsa by the way -really fresh taste), slight wait for the drinks, a little more of a wait for the food order.. the food came out pretty quickly (total plus) but after receiving our meal the waiter never returned to see how things were going or refill our water or ask if we wanted another drink.  We sat there with our food and beverages gone waiting for the check for a good chunk of time... finally he came to take my boyfriends plate and as he started to walk away we requested the check.  Over all I may return because the food was good but if you're looking for a more relaxing atmosphere this probably isn't the place for you.
