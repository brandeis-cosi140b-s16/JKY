Today was definitely an off day for El Pollo Loco. I thought I was grabbing a quick lunch...well not today. If the food wasn't prepared so well I would have given them 2 stars. But the taste factor saved them. Maybe ill just use them for last minute catering and stick to something more typical for lunch like tropical smoothie or jack in the crack...today my friends you have given me the lunch time sad face :(
