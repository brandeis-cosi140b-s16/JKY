The Yelp reviews might mislead you.  Tee Pee is not great, but it is good.  Located right across the street from Chase Field, Tee Pee is convenient for a pre-Diamondbacks game meal or a beer, and offers reasonably priced parking if you are going to the game.  

Food was surprisingly good.  I read the reviews and wasn't expecting much.  What I got was decent home-made salsa with good enough chips, and main courses that were plain good.  Prices are a fraction of what you'll find at the ball game.  Service was fast enough, though not exactly friendly.  I didn't mind.  Tee Pee exceeded my expectations.
