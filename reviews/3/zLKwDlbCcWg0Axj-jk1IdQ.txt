When I lived in Tega Cay, I would say we ate here about once a week. It was the closest and best Mexican place around. While I was visiting this weekend, I just had to go back and eat here. 

Their chips and salsa were just how I remembered. Crisp, fresh chips and a mild, spicy, chunky salsa. They give you individual cups for the salsa so you don't have to share. We also ordered some queso dip, which was a little bland for my tastes. 

For an entree I got two tamales with rice and beans. Beans= excellent, Rice= perfect. Tamales= sooooo good. It was just how i remembered from 6 years ago. 

Their prices did seem a little higher than they were before and our waiter was....pushy then ignored us, then wasn't the brightest crayon in the box. Then again I cant expect too much. The owners name is Adrian. Nice guy and he always remembers me.....even from that long ago. He just says I looked older! 

For a local spot, this place is perfect for families!
