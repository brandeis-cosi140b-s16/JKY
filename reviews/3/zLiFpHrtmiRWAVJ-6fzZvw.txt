The waitress was extremely helpful! I liked that we could eat on the patio right on main street but it got kind of cold and we moved inside to the couch area way in the back. There were TVs with sports games on and a live mariachi band playing. That was cool. Best part again was the friendly staff.

The food was ok. We were served chips and salsa but the menu was a little pricey and limited selections. The drinks we got were about $14 each which is quite a lot. It's probably one of the only Mexican places in downtown Mesa so it's convenient if you are trying to stay in the area.
