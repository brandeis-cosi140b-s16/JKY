OK,  So Hubs and I stopped in based off Yelp reviews and while we really liked it, I guess I was expecting more based off the reviews.

It is a hole inthe wall which is a good thing in my book.  The best restaurants usually are.  So ordering can be confusing but the gal at the counter was very helpful and offered up samples - big plus - to help us decide.  

I settled on the Emerald Chicken with black beans and Hubby got a combo of the carnitas and emerald chicken burrito.  I really liked (not loved) the Emerald chicken, lots of garlic and spices - yum.  Plus all white meat chicken.  The carnitas aere not so good in my book.  A little tough and dry.  The tortillas for the burrito were awesome though!  Tasted like homade with no lard spared!

I do have to agree that the black beans were a highlight.  Very flavorful and I couldn't identify what it was.  Now they aren't whole black beans like you get in many other restaurants but some sort of re-fry so I'm sure they are fat loaded, but that is probably why they are so good.  The rice, both white and jerk fried were just meh.  Nothing special and quite greasy - even the white rice.  Also the cookies were nothing great.  Took one bite and tossed it.

So overall we had a nice lunch but nothing I'd go out of my way for and definately off the list if you are watching your diet!
