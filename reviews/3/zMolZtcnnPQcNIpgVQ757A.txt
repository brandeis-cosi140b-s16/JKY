HUGE tortas compared to a few other popular places. Choices are few and covered usually with fried meat options. Sadly there is no straight up carne asada type of torta. 

To be real when i go i wont get a torta, not because they aren't good, but because i found something better on their menu.

Their quesadillas are bomb, and their machete's are equally as delicious and enticing. Go for these instead trust me, they be HUGE!
