Food was ok...pretty typical of a college taco shop. The cheerful young man working the register came over to ask how we enjoyed our meals as he was cleaning up tables (he knew we were first-timers, as he had helped us navigate the menu). When we told him the chicken enchilada was missing the chicken (lol), he realized the kitchen had made a mistake and had them box up the correct meal for us to go. Nice gesture. Not sure if I would return here again, but my college kid really enjoyed it!
