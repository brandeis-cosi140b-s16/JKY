3.5-4 stars

While waiting for the rest of our group to arrive in Vegas, the boy, my best friend and I decided to grab some dinner. At 9 p.m. the place was packed but we were seated after waiting a few minutes.

Our server was really nice but took awhile to take our drink and food orders. My friend was checking-in and I went with her to find her room and help her get settled. 15-20 minutes later and they still hadn't taken our order! They did give us chips and 3 different kinds of salsa - pico de gallo, tomatillo, and salsa verde. Anyway, here's what we ordered:

-Regular Mojito's
-Grilled Steak Quesadillas
-Tacos Baja
-Isla Rice & Refried Beans

The mojito's were okay - they were a little too sweet for my taste. They also came in a smaller glass so you couldn't really see all the fresh ingredients. I had the steak quesadillas and I thought they were okay, a little on the dry side but that was easily fixed with adding some of the salsa on top. I had a bite of the tacos baja, or fish tacos, and they were really good - I wish I had ordered those! The side of rice and beans was pretty basic but really good when paired with the tacos. 

This is another great option inside Treasure Island to grab some dinner. It's also really nice and dimly-lit inside so you kind of forget that you're in a casino.
