We chose this for Cinco de Mayo. Food was very good, $5 house margaritas were decent and potent, but the service was extraordinarily slow. We were there over an hour with no sign of appetizers or food, but hopefully that was because of the holiday. I would rate it higher if service were faster. I'll come again and see if they do better.
