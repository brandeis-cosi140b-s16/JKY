This is the best Manuel's I have been to here in the valley. It is nice and clean, has a friendly staff, a great location, and decent Mexican food overall. You won't find anything here too adventurous - nothing to burn your tongue or gross out your Mom. The food is well prepared and the rice and beans are perfect. Their Margaritas looked pretty good, though we behaved ourselves for once. *"Ajo Al's" down the street might be a better choice.
