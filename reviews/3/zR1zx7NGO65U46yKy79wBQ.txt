Since the last time I've been here they really redecorated. Doesn't look like a hole in the wall anymore and the floors are clean :) 
I always get plantanos and papusas and it's always good. My daughter is allergic to everything and loves that they have yucca fries here.
I see why people complain about how long it takes or servers not speaking good English. It feels like they make everything from scratch when you order it. Also when they served our food they mixed up our papusas. And didn't even announce what's the last plate she put down was so my husband an I had ours switched which is really irritating because I hate beans.
