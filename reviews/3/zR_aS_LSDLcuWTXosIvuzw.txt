The first time I ate here was wonderful I ordered the Carne Asada salad it was really good, today when I ate here I was let down by the Carne Asada Quesadilla, I was on the skimpy side for meat and I took it back up to the counter because I thought they forgot the cheese that's how much cheese was on it. My husband ordered the shrimp Quesadilla and his had too much cheese go figure...lol. I think the thing that got me the most is if i am thinking there is no cheese on it most would of asked if i would like more added right? He just said yep it's in there it all the meat hiding it(which was not the case) and handed it back.The taste was good but I think it should of been toasted longer when I ate it it did not make me feel like i was eating a Quesadilla. I gave this 3 stars because the food was tasty and fresh but not satisfying my Quesadilla craving.
