I would give this place 3 & a half stars if I could but cant bring myself to a 4 star rating for this place just yet.  I came here this morning and had the Chorizo & eggs plate.  Couldn't figure out why this place doesn't have breakfast burritos but it worked out well anyway.  I ordered it for take out and the food was great!  I was a little disappointed that the tortillas were not home-made.  Although you could tell there was a little preservative smell to them but did not taste to bad (just not home-made taste).  The salsa tasted fresh and the beans were great.  The atmosphere is a little scary but it looks pretty new still and it is pretty hard to find since the sign is pretty small.  I knew about it because they came by my office and dropped off a coupon for take out.  I will go back for sure but I am not in love yet.
