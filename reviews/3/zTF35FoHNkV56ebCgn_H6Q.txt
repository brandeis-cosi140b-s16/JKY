I really enjoy the tortilla soup, it's pretty simplistic but oh so tasty. I usually order off of the a la carte menu - I'm a huge fan of stuffed pablano peppers sometimes they're overly greasy, but other times they are done just right...I will admit that this place lacks consistency but the personable staff, chill atmosphere, and the chihuahua cheese keep us coming back.
