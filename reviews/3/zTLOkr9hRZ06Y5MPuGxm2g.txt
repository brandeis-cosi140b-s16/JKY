The chips and salsa were good here.  So was the service and the flan.  Wasn't impressed by the entrees though.  I had the al pastor tacos and my s/o had the mole trio.  The al pastor tacos were ok.  However, the meat didn't taste fresh.  The mole was ok, but only one type of preparation.  Also had the mechelada, which was ok.  I would go to Tacos El Gordo for good Mexican.
