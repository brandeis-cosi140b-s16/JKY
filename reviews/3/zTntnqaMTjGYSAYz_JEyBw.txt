This used to be "Mas Amigos", but for some reason the name changed. 

The staff/cooks seems to be the same. The menu is definitely the same.

I love their  chips and salsa, which are made in house. 
This is my go-to because the food is consistently tasty, but don't expect sophisticated food. Everything is very cheap.
Portions are large (I usually take some to go). 
I would recommend getting the enchiladas mexicanas. 
Their margaritas are pretty tasty and just strong enough. 

 
I gave it a three because: 
I think the service is a little disconnected since management change, I had to wait a while for the check and had like 3 waiters. 

I wish their menu had some variety from time to time.  tostadas and queso fresco would be nice :(
