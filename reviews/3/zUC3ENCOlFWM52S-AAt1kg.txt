This is a typical weekend stop for the family.  I didn't like it much when we first started going but the place has really grown on me.  It is always clean, the kids working there are friendly, it is fast and the prices are good.  

My wife always gets a veggie burro that comes with what most places call pico but they call chunky salsa.  Their pico comes with avacod so we always grab a cup of that.  The kids eat rice and beans with the chips and also and always enjoy it.  Their regular salsa is more like a hot sauce.

I rotate through several dishes, the rod burro (probably my fav), the poncho villa, crudo, burracho burro.  All are good.  I don't care for the carna asada burro  - it comes with rice inside and I don't care for that.  The carne asada taco plate is great with some pico or guac.  The pollo fundido is good but not a flavorful as the other burros.

plain and sweetened iced teas are fresh brewed and good (at least the plain tea is I never drink sweet tea).
