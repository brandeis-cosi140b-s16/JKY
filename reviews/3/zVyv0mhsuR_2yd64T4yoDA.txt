Somewhat Disappointed This Time


My co-workers and I go to El Pollo Loco because of the tasty and healthy roasted chicken.  I say healthy because it's not fried like most other  fast food restaurants.  EL Pollo Loco gives guest the opportunity to order dark meat (leg and thigh) or white meat (breast and wing).  The chicken goes well with their Spanish Rice and tortillas.

I was just quite disappointed in my most recent visit.  I order the grilled chicken salad  and to be honest the salad juzt wasn't very good.  The lett e was wilted and the chicken was somewhat dry.  However, my co-workers really enjoyed their meals.

I think I will go back and try a burrito or maybe even a bowl.
