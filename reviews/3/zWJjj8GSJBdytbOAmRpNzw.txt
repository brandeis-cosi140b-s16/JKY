Honestly, my experience at the Scottsdale location was mainly for drinks at the bar - which were quite strong! So I won't complain. Although, I do need food when having cocktails, so usually order the lobster enchilada (the portions I've had at the Vegas & Century City locations were fine). Been there twice now when visiting Scottsdale, and while not as huge as the Century City location, it's not a bad place to hang for a while before moving on. Take it with a grain of salt.
