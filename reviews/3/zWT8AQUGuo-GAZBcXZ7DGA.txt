There is nothing like some rolled tacos to full the stomach on my way home from a night of debauchery.

Roberto's is just around the corner of my house. The food is good, the staff is friendly, (even in English isn't their strong point), and the salsa bar with cucumbers is a nice touch

There are better places to eat Mexican in vegas, but late night it's hard to find anywhere better Mexican than Robertos
