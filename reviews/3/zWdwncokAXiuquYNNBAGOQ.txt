I have been wanting to go to this restaurant for months if not years and finally got the chance the other day. My husband and I shared the fajitas, half chicken and half steak. The onions were cooked nicely but a little too oily for my taste. It came with about a cup size of beans, rice, sour cream, guacamole for about $25, which is not too shabby. The chips and salsa were good but not great. I really wanted more authentic food but the tortillas were those rubbery ones that you get at taco bell. It was disappointing. I would return only with a large group because of the patio and live music in the evenings.
