Good neighborhood spot.  Service is fast and friendly.  They serve a mild and a not-so-mild salsa which is tasty.  I ordered a soft shell chickent taco which was more of an enchilada but pretty tasty.  Also enjoyed a glass of chardonnay which was very reasonably priced.  The decor is bright and cheerful.

Good place to stop in for a quick lunch or dinner.  It is tiny and it does fill up.
