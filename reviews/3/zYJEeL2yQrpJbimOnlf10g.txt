Probably the cleanest TB I've ever visited.  It looked like pretty capable staffing with actual adults running the place.  I was actually a little confused when I didn't have an obvious stoner giving me the lazy stare over the counter.  It's a slightly hard to notice corner location, but still, good location with access from 90.
