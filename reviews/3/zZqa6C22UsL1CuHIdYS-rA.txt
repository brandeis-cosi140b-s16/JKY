Looks a bit warehousey on the outside, but it's really nice on the inside. Clean floors, clean booths and a stage at the front where a band was setting up as we got ready to leave.

I went with the steak fajitas. A good portion of steak and a lot of onions and green peppers. Enough that four burritos weren't enough. Of course, served on the usual sizzling metal platter with sides of pico and rice and beans.

It wasn't any more special than a dozen other Mexican restaurants within five miles, other than the fact that it appeared way newer and way cleaner.
