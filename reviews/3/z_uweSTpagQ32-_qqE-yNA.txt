It's airport food, either owned by or using a famous person's name -- you are going to overpay - just deal with it! If the high prices at the airport bother you... eat BEFORE your come to the airport!

Bar service was friendly, and the food was ok. Don't expect the high end experience - but definitely better than most airport joints.
