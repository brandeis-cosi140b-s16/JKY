Great Place to eat for a quick lunch. Lunch specials are always good. Service can be a little slow at times if you have a pressing schedule and need to make it back to the office on time this may not be your best choice.

It's also a nightlife party bar for the younger crowd in the evening with a full bar both inside and out.

Not my favorite place to eat, but not too bad either.
