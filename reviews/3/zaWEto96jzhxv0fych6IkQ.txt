I think the prices are a little high but the outside patio is fantastic. I think happy hour here is good, but it only goes until 6 pm. I've had a good number of things off their menu:

- Tacos: Three tacos for $14 is a little too pricey to me for what they are, but the same dish for $7 at HH is spot on. The black beans are incredibly tasty (lots of spices and vegetarian), and the tacos are traditionally what you would expect. They subbed in vegetarian mexican rice for the meat for me, which was great. Love the guacamole on them, but otherwise standard ingredients for tex mex.
- Chips, salsa, & guacamole: Good but I hate paying for chips & salsa at a mexican food place, especially one whose prices should afford a free basket. The guacamole is delicious. The salsas are pretty good, nothing to write home about but good all the same.
- Nachos: My friends love this dish, it's giant and enough to feed two. Unfortunately there aren't much of toppings on it besides the meat, beans, & cheese.
- French fries: These are AMAZING! You get a heaping amount with a burger and they are perfection. Soft on the inside, beer battered or otherwise some kind of crust crusty on the outside, and perfectly seasoned. I'm pretty sure I'd be happy to make a meal out of their french fries, guacamole, and beer. 

So I recommend it for an outdoor happy hour if you can manage to get there early enough to enjoy it, otherwise there are a lot of good places at the same or less price in Old Town.
