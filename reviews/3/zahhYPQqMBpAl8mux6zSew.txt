Hmm, this is the first expensive mexican restaurant I've eaten at.  The downloadable menu online doesn't list prices, so I was a bit surprised at the restaurant.  Two entrees, guacamole and tip checked out to $60.  

The food was good.  As every other review mentions the olive tapenade was a tasty surprise.  Addictive actually.  Entrees were the pipian verde and fish taco platters.  I adored the presentation.  The plates looked appetizing (quite the opposite of platters at other mexican restaurants where refried beans, cheese, and sauce are spilled all over like vomit and diar...you get the picture).  

Not so sure why everyone is raving about the guacamole.  The extra ingredients just made it too crunchy and overly tangy.  Yuck!  Not worth the price.
