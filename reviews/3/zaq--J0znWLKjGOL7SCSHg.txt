We receive welcoming service every time we go there. The cashier is always friendly and even though it's not really a place with wait service, we've always had someone stop by our table to ask how things are going. 

It's a bit pricey for tacos, but the burritos are gigantic. They are generous with guacamole and cheese. I ordered the chicken burrito, which was nicely seasoned, but you either have to have a giant mouth to eat it properly or be prepared to eat bites of onions, bites of cheese, bites of guacamole, and bites of chicken.  

To be on the safe side, make sure to carry some cash. We've had the credit card machine flake out on us more than once.
