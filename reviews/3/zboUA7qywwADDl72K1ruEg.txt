3 1/2 stars. I saw this place and stopped in for b fast. The bf menu was limited so I ordered a lengua burrito with beans & rice. The friendly waitress asked if I wanted onions, cilantro and salsa which I advised her yes.

When I received my burrito and coffee the size was generous. The lengua was tender and the mixture of all the ingredients was yummy.  I added additional salsa to really give it a spicier kick and the burrito was filling. Coffee here is decent too.

Enjoyable bf and I'm glad I drove by McDonald's and into this place.
