Super Cheap and Great Deals! 

The food is not the most flavorful but oh it is cheap. Tacos for .49 cents and burritos for .59 cents you cannot beat the price if you are hungry and on a budget. They have good deals too like 12 tacos for 5.88 and trump Taco Bell on food size. Also they are the only Fast Food place I know or that offers Mr. Pibb!
