Food is decent but customer service from the girl that works the cashier is horrible. Everytime I go in there she is rude and looks pissed off. I noticed a difference in how she greets and interacts with others depending on race and/or gender. She charged me a fee to swipe my debit card also which I don't ever remember having to do before. Though its probably the cleanliness out of all locations, I try to avoid coming to this location solely because of service.
