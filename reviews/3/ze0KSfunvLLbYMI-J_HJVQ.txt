Strolled in after a 9pm session of bingo. Got a Boarding pass earlier in the day and utilized it to get the fajita dinner for 8.99... Only 3 dollars cheaper with the cars but oh well. Had to buy a drink with the deal. Margaritas were below average.  Small glass   Tons of ice.. Not strong at all.   We asked for salt on my glass and i got sugar. She wanted sugar and got salt.  Wouldn't have been a big deal if we had gotten the same flavor.. Food was food tho.   Bean dip comes with chips and salsa complimentary . I wanna try all you can eat tacos
