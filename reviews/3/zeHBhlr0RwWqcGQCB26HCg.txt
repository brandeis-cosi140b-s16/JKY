I'd heard pretty mixed things about it from people I know, but the reviews on here are positive for the most part. I went there last week and found the food to be just OK. I got the beer-battered fish taco and and a carne asada taco. The fish taco had a good-sized piece of fish on it, but it really had no flavor. It was pretty much a giant fish stick on a tortilla. I'm not even a huge fan of fish, but this seriously had no fish flavor to it at all. The carne asada seemed a bit more like big chunks of ground beef sitting in juice. The flavor was good, but not really what I've come to expect from carne asada. The tortillas were good and the toppings and sauce on the tacos had a nice taste. 

The last part I took issue with were the chips: All I could smell when they were anywhere near my face was the grease that they were fried in. I like fried foods as much as the next person, but the oil smell was so overpowering I couldn't eat more than a few chips.

The best part of this place - and what sets it apart from any other place I've ever been - is that they have Gringo Bandito hot sauce on the tables. If you don't know what that is and you like hot sauce, you really need to check it out. It's such a flavorful sauce and goes well on pretty much anything. Well done, Chronic Taco staff, for having great taste in hot sauce.

I might come back to try some more things if I'm in the area or some friends want to check it out, but I don't think I'll be making a special trip by myself.
