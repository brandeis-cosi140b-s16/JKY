The good: I want to say the food has a more authentic Mexican taste than Chipotle. 
The bad: They seem to be...disorganized. Twice now they've been out of something very basic (tortillas), and the wait time for them was...45 minutes?

The good: They have a wide assortment of fountain drinks, and some very interesting flavors.
The bad: Their original beverages are inconsistent in taste. Sometimes perfectly sweet. Other times, flat and hard to drink.

The good: The prices are reasonable, especially on Taco Tuesday wherein their pretty stellar tacos are $1.95 each. 
The bad: They charge extra for too many things. With Chipotle, it's the guac. We've come to terms with that. At Cafe Rio, it's the guac, the sour cream, their house ranch sauce, the verde sauce, and a few other toppings that shouldn't come with an additional charge.

The good: The service has been great at times. Offering a free large beverage for an order mess-up on their end, and another time comping half our meal for that ridiculous 45 minute wait.
The bad: The service had been unsatisfactory at times. We'd arrived shortly before they opened one day. The front door was wide open. So we sat at a table and waited, but were asked to sit outside in the scorching Arizona heat and wait instead by an employee. Why was the door wide open if customers waiting inside is an issue, and what difference does it make are fair to ask, right?
