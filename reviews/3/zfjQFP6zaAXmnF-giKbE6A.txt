My friend brought me the chimichanga combination plate which comes with rice and beans (no Mexican meal is complete without beans and rice). It was lovely - not superb, but it gave me just the right amount of satisfaction for the start of the day.

The chimichanga had way too many mediocre green peppers in it for me to give it anything more than three stars. The rice and beans were of a solid good quality; this would be approaching a 3.5 star review if only these were available in larger portions. Unfortunately, the chimichanga was HUGE and the sides were tiny tiny.

If you're looking for a quick and greasy Mexicano meal to fill you up, this is the ticket. Looking for something great? Pass this place up and head to Fiesta Burrito.
