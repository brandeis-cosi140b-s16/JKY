If you are under 30, a student, and in love with tex-mex, you've found your Mecca. They have very great drink specials at night and half off lunches for students during 2-4 (check with them though...) 

The food is nothing remarkable (okay tex-mex that is nothing you will find in the south), but good for taking someone to lunch if you want to talk in an open and cheery environment in the summer; they have a kind of garage door that opens up the large industrial south of the border restaurant. 

This place is definitely focused on the drinks and happy hour.
