We stopped in on a Thursday after a recommendation from my brother. The first thing we noticed was that this is a very small restaurant. The second thing we noticed was that the musician was very talented, but the music was far too loud. We could not hold a conversation across the table with one another without literally shouting. The servers were very attentive about refilling drinks and chips, but took forever to bring the check even after I had asked. The chips and salsa are exactly like Some Burros which is not much to write home about. My son did not like his enchilada, one daughter did not like her salad and the other didn't like her nachos. My wife and I thought our dishes passed for decent food, but it is over-priced for what you get. This is essentially a hipster, wine tasting version of Some Burros so don't expect too much.
