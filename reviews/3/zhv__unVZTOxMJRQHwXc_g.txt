As I wandered around the airport trying to find a seat to watch the US v Belgium game, I finally stumbled across the Barrio Cafe. I was so happy to be seated at a bar and watching the game that they could have served dogfood and I would have been OK. Rest assured they did not serve dogfood. This wasn't as salty. I am kidding of course but the food was not memorable. Ordered the Torta Cochinita Pibil. It was a big sandwich of pork marinated in achiote and sour orange. That sounds great but it was rather bland. It was topped with pickled onion and pico de gallo. Those were nice but the strong flavor of the torta bread overpowered. The fries were decent and I enjoyed the spicy chipotle ketchup. Ultimately, the pork was underwhelming and a torta cannot recover if the star fails.
