Should be 3.5 stars.  

Been here a lot because it's right next to where we play soccer.  Many weeks we walk next door to have a drink and some food.  The salsa and chips are complimentary and sufficient.  They serve a chunky and a hot sauce style.  The chips are thin and made in house.

We often sit in the bar and the service is great.  The manager has gotten to know us so he greets us every time we go.  The beer is cold and they have a decent selection.  The place is always clean and the atmosphere is good.  They have a large room in the back for huge groups and a large patio for when the weather cools off.  

The food is standard Mexican fare; adequate but nothing spectacular.  I love the cheese crisp extra crispy topped with their shredded beef.  I have found the shredded beef has better flavor than the machaca.  The mini chimis with the jalape√±o cream chese are good and so are the mini tacos.  

Like I said this review is a strong 3.5 stars just not quite 4.  I will be going back often.  It is convinient, friendly, clean and quick.
