I've been here a few times now, but never to sit down and eat; I just get takeout. Each time I call, the employees are friendly, and my orders have always been accurate. The estimated times they give are accurate as well, so I've never had to wait more than a few minutes to pick up an order. The food itself is good but unimpressive. It's definitely good enough to be my go-to Mexican takeout place in the Mint Hill area, but if I want to go out for Mexican food at a sit-down place, I'll head somewhere else.
