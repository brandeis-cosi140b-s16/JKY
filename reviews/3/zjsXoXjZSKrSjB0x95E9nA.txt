Went there once with my friend, I ought when they opened. I got a steak and rice bowl with salsa on top. My friend got quesadillas, she said they were good. But my Steak and rice was cold, but I was good just cold. And over priced. I work at a food business and seeing the guest service employee on her phone made me laugh. Nice, clean place, average food.
