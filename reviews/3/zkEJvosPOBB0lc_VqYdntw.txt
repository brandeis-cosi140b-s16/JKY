I was in the mall today running some errands and decided to give Rubio's a try. It was just okay. I had the grilled chicken soft taco with chipolte cream sauce and avocado and it was pretty good. The flavor of the chicken was just so so but the chipolte cream added to the flavor quite a bit. They do have a salsa bar at this location in the mall but it is not the greatest. The mild is a bit watery and has way to much cilantro and the picante is way to peppery. The only salsa I really enjoyed was the chipolte salsa which really complemented the grilled chicken taco.

I might try Rubio's again if the mood struck me but it is not somewhere that I would seek out specifically. Not that there are many other great options in the Chandler Mall food court. It's just okay.
