Ate as a group of 5 on a Friday night. Waited 45-minutes for a table, at least margaritas were a tasty way to pass the time.

We were seated in a booth off the main-dining floor. A couple large rowdy parties surrounded us, but it fit the party atmosphere.

Fish tacos, steak and chicken burritos, and spiced grilled shrimp were ordered. Everyone was pleased with their entrees. 

Service could have been friendlier or more attentive, but it was acceptable.
