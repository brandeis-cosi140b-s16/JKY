Diablo's Cantina is another newish addition to the Monte Carlo, really reasserting it's image from the strip with a bikini-clad devilish vixen with a pitchfork standing on the roof. It's a pretty dull place to stay unless you're pumped about Lance Burton or ecstatic over the deal you scored on the room. Who knows if the poor place will go under once CityCenter is entirely built and it covers the Monte Carlo in with its omnipotent shadow.

From first glace, the food is no different than Chevy's in that you can order appetizers, sampler platters, sizzling fajita platters and the like. It was really kind of bunk that you can't just grab a table in the bar area because you actually have to check in with the hostess. However, the lunch wait wasn't that bad actually.

I ordered the 44oz Sancho which is their $19 margarita that comes in a collectible cup with a lid and a straw. Trust, the lid was needed as we got a ride right after and I was totally taking advantage of the Nevada allowance of open containers in moving vehicles. The blonde bartender hooked me up with extra tequila, and gave me more change than necessary. I gave her $100 and I got $89 back, so I upped her tip a little. Thanks!

We had just a few appetizers for a light lunch (saving ourselves for the Village Seafood Buffet). Beware, the guacamole comes in a huge mortar with a Sancho cup full of chips. The serving only looks big, until you dig about halfway down and discover that chips are used as filler for about half of the volume of the mortar.

Here's a tip, keep an eye out for the promoting ladies in the lobby of the Monte Carlo by the elevator and by the cashier cage in the casino because they're often handing out two for one coupons for margaritas. Sadly, I don't think these coupons are valid for The Sancho.
