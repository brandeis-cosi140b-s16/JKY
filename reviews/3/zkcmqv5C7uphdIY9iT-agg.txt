Go to a tamale restaurant and not get tamals?  Well, the plan was to try a red and green tamal but that ended when I saw the special for the day - shrimp ceviche tostadas.  There were two to the order.

The citrus used to create the ceviche was excellent.  It was tangy and gave the shrimp a good flavor.  The pieces of shrimp were small in size.  The tostadas came with two lemon sections for extra citrus flavor.  The waiter also brought a bottle of Tapat√≠o without asking.  Great!

Service was very good if not too good.  I was going to get something for dessert but when he noticed I was finished, he brought the bill over and said, "No hurry.  I'll take that when you're ready."  OK!  So I was off to the Mirage for a show and I stopped in my neighborhood for a Baskin-Robbins.  Their loss.

I am going to try the Dona Maria's on Cheyenne nearer home and I will get some tamals.
