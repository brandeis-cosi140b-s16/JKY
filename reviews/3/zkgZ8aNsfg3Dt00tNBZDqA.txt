First let me say that I am particular about Mexican food, but I can appreciate different variations from gourmet to street tacos.
Upon entering the restaurant, we received a delayed welcome. We were quickly seated and I immediately noticed the seat was soiled with food. I wiped the mess up with a napkin. The menu has calamari, which instantly makes me question the authenticity. Upon receiving chips n salsa my suspicions were confirmed. The chips were warm and festive red, green, and regular. The salsa was strikingly similar to La Victoria. I ordered tacos with carne asada and carnitas. My date ordered chicken enchiladas. When the plates were delivered, the enchiladas lacked the crema described on the menu. He requested sour cream and was charged $1.50. My carne was good, but had too much fat for my liking. The carnitas were average. Rice and beans tasted like they came from a box and can. Again, I am aware that I am especially hard to please when it comes to rice and beans. Maybe because there isn't much nutritional value, therefore it has to be worth the calories, right? We ordered a sangria and agreed it was more like a cocktail made with Tropicana fruit punch. It wasn't bad, but it didn't seem to contain any wine. 
In a nut shell, the ambiance was fine, service good for a newly opened establishment. The prices are a bit high for the quality. Were it not for the Groupon, it would have received 2 stars.
