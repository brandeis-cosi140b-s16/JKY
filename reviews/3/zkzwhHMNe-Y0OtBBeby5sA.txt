Today is Administrative Assistant's Day, YAY, so our school's parent club took us all out to lunch here.  There were about 20 ladies all together and we arrived pretty much the second they opened.  They had a table all set up for us and ready to go.  We were immediately brought chips and salsa.

The chips were very plain, but I kept eating them.  Our bowls of chips were never empty.  We only had one girl taking care of our whole table, but after a couple rounds of refilled sodas she seemed to be getting the hang of it.  We kept her pretty busy but she handled it well.  The kitchen however, had a little difficulty and there was about a 15 minute difference between the time the first person was served and the last person.  Oh well, we all got our food and it was all correct.

I ordered the cheese enchilada and chimichanga (a mini one) combination plate.  The beans that came with the dish were sprinkled with cheese and very tasty.  They were surprisingly smooth and buttery, I'm not really picky about the beans.  The enchilada was a big fat disappointment to me because there were onions inside.  I thought it would just have cheese, because everywhere else I have gone and gotten a cheese enchilada it was just plain inside.  The chimichanga was actually really good to my picky palate.  The shredded beef was flavorful and juicy.  It was also covered in cheese, and that is always a good thing in book.  I could also do without the shredded lettuce on my plate.  I'm not sure what purpose it served.

Overall, it was a pretty decent experience.  The food was fine, the company was fun, and the service was pretty damn good considering our large numbers and needy ladies.
