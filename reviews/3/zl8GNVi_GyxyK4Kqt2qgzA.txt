My spouse and I recently hit Garcia's about 5pm for happy hour. The food and drink here are very, very Americanized so diners looking for a more creative or authentic Mexican food experience will definitely want to go elsewhere. Having said that, I thought both of our meals were decent enough for the price.  I had the grilled chicken burrito and my spouse had a three-item platter with chili relleno, sour cream enchilada, and tamale. His combo plate was definitely better than my burrito, which was a bit dry and underfilled with chicken.  Still, compared to other Mexicanized restaurants out there, this place seems pretty good.  The service was as efficient and attentive as can be expected, and the both dining room and bathroom were clean.  The bean dip along with the chips and salsa is a nice touch at this place, too.
