Very cool spot if you're looking for a pool/bar/restaurant. Wasn't there to sit outside in 105 degrees, so me and the girls sat at the inside bar for HH. Although the bartender was a nice enough girl, she was definitely not the best in terms of spot-on customer service. I was seated for at least 8 minutes (joined girls already drinking) before I asked if she was able to take my drink order. Oh, but wait...may I see the drink menu first??!! The "politely" put me off and said one second. Mmmmm! 

The HH is basically all day until 7pm. I had the El Escobar run drink. So their cocktail HH means buy one-get one free. Escobar was deeeelish and had a nice kick. I noshed on the Desert Tosdada app. This app is definitely for the pork fan (ME!). Its got both pulled pork AND seared pork belly on top. Frickin awesome. There are 3 and were perfect for a small meal. But greedy me also ordered the Green Chili / Oaxaca cheese quesadilla. Topped with arugula, this app was also pretty darn good. HH apps are 1/2 off so can't beat that! 

Service: 1.5 stars
Food: 3.5 stars (the pork belly tostadas are innovative)
