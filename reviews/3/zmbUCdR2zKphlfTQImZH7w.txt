Looking for a new place to grab a beer, finally stopped in here after driving past multiple times. There were a bunch of people there playing card games and a mix of college kids and a few grizzled veterans. They have a huge patio which nobody was using due to the night heat. The best deal is the $2.50 corona's and then I tried a chicken burrito ($7.45) to go. Big chunks of white meat chicken and beans, rice and cheese were inside. There was no sign of the promised sour cream and guac though. Served with a side salad, it was a good burro, but nothing over the top. They did melt some cheese enchilada style over the burro. Seems like a friendly bar - think I even saw Flicka there - he was the one yelling we got the best mother bleeping wings. (those wings were 40 cents each on Wednesday).
