Just visited the place for the first time and it was eh. The food was good and the prices were good, just very small portions. I got the quesadilla and it was delicious, but it took me about 5 bites and it was gone! 
As everyone says, the carne asada was tasty, but my boyfriend and his friend complained of tiny size also.
The people there were kind and we didn't have to wait too long, but we are all still hungry. I guess we're used to gigantic food servings.
