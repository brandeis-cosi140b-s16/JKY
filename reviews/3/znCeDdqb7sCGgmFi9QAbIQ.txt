Pretty much the same thing as Chipolte. I usually get a bowl with either chicken or shrimp. 

The last time I went, it took them forever to come serve us in the line. There weren't any patrons in there when we walked in and by the time we sort of stared at the menu and wanted to order, they were still dilly-dallying around in the back and had even made eye contact. Didn't even get a "hey, I'll be right there" sort of thing. It still took them a good minute to finally walk over, put in their gloves and ask us what we wanted. The customer service with the exception of that incident is usually pretty decent.
