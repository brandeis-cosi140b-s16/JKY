Pray to the taco gods at Taco Guild!

I came here recently for happy hour. We'll get to that in a minute. The first thing you absolutely notice when you walk in is that this place looks like an old church. And that's because..... SURPRISE! It is! They have amazing stained glass windows, high ceilings, and anything else you could think you might need to have a religious experience involving tacos.

We ordered a few tacos, street corn, some guac and queso (which I remember coming as a duo appetizer type thing). Everything was delicious, albeit somewhat unconventional. Who knew peking duck would be so delicious in taco form?! The coffee braised beef taco was also delicious. I remember we had a taco of the day as well - it was alright - nothing worth writing home about but not bad by any means. 

The real standout was the STREET CORN. Granted grilled corn is always a winner in my book. But whatever they smear and drizzle all over the top really makes it outstanding.

Overall we were quite pleased. It was a pricier than other happy hours I've been to with similar menu options, but none of us left feeling dissatisfied.

Raise your corn cob in the air and pray to the peking duck taco gods!
