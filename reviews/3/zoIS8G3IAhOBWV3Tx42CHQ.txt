The food is good.  I had the queso with bits of meat.  It was good.  It was something you could grab at other decent Mexican restaurants.  The food is not necessarily the problem with this place.

This...my friends....is another tourist trap.  The prices are in the stratosphere for the food you get.  The location is smack dab in the middle of the pyramid.  

Imagine this:  You are eating a taco and enjoying your meal when you look up and see an ad for the Bodies Exhibit...with the dude's guts all hanging out.  Pretty bad right?  Now imagine you see the Bodies Exhibit ad and so you turn around to see....gasp....an ad for the Carrot Top show....with his ugly mug staring right back at you.

I lost my appetite after seeing Carrot Top, and I paid a fortune for ok mexican food.  That is what is wrong with this place.
