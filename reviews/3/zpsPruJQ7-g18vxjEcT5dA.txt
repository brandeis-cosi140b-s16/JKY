The service at the bar was horrible, my boyfriend and I stood there for about 15 minutes without anyone saying we will be with you in a moment, then we saw them pour about 5 beers all with a bunch of foam in them. Once we sat down at the table service was a lot better, the margaritas were really good, the tacos were just alright. I had the tamales, which were delicious.
