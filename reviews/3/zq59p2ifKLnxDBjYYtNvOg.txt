Being from SoCal, I'm a bit of a Mexican food snob.  Taco shops are on every corner and most are really good.  I have been craving good mxn food in Vegas but still looking.  This Robertos had a good tortilla and the hot sauce was alright, but the carne wasn't what I hoped.  More like boiled steak that was sitting around with little flavor or seasoning. Service was decent and overall just OK.  May try again and get something else
