At dinner here three times while in town. It was close to the hotel and open later than other places. Food was decent, but needed a little more flavor.

Service was a little slow, but that seems to be the down. Everyone moves much slower in Wickenburg. 

Lastly, did take out my last night - there is a $0.75 take out charge. Not sure why, as they're not lying a server. They're not providing chips and salsa. Overall, it's not a great place but it what is there. Not much competition so not a need to improve.
