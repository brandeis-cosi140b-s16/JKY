Food is okay. It's chicken. With tortillas. Expecting anything else is like picking your nose and hoping for gold. Average service, average food, average everything. Is it a boring Tuesday and you haven't had chicken for a while? Need to pick up dinner on the way home? Stop by. Oh wait, it's a busy intersection.
