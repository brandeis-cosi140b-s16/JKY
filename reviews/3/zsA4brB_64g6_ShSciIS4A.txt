I love their taco loco. It's a mouthwatering fajita/taco salad concoction that I
 a. can't get enough of and
 b. can't finish.

I have tried a few other dishes and nothing ranks near the crazy taco.  Warm, thick chips and a mild salsa are served bountifully. The chips aren't greasy and are not heavily salted which makes me happy. I like to add my own anyway.

They have three versions of guacamole. Yesterday we tried the most basic which was delicious and simple. We also tried an appetizer with cheese and chorizo. It was good, but quickly coagulated which resulted in an undip-able dip.

MARGARITA ALERT- their house margarita... not a traditional margarita. In my opinion, it tasted like watered down orange soda. And the color is a light peach color. If you want a classic, lime margarita I have yet to find one I love here.  I'm not your typical margarita drinker.  The aftermath of too much sweet margarita mix and I do not get along.  I admit,  I'm kind of picky about margaritas, but these, these should have a warning when ordering.
