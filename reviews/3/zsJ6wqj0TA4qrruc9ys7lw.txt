I am giving this establishment three stars because the place was very clean and the people who was working there was very nice and they tried very hard.  The tacos was okay,  I had the chicken and it was very dry.  I also got a taco chille relleno, should have ordered a regular one.  The taco did not have much flavor.  I tried the red and green sauce and I liked them both.
