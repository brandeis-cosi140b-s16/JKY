I like this better then Chipotle BUT they have some easy things to work on. 

1. Not everyone there knows exactly who , what , where and how to make a burrito the way you do. A little coaching, questions and helping you customer goes a long way. 
2. Have the food ready more then a 1/2 hour AFTER you open your doors. 
3. Train the staff before throwing them on the line. 
4. Offer samples when you know they have no idea what they want. 
5. DRAIN the darn meat before throwing it in a tortilla. NO ONE likes mush.
