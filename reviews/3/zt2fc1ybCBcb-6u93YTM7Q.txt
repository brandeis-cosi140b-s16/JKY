Three stars because it was just eh.  We went here for happy hour.  The empanadas for HH are made with ground beef.  Flavor was good but not wow.  My husband ordered the pulled pork sliders.  Kinda lacked flavor.

I really don't have to much to say because there are a lot of other places I would suggest downtown over this place.
