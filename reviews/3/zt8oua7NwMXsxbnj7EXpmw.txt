I made my way to another place ending with "berto's".  There's not much to say.  Some people hate these places, some love 'em, some are indifferent.  I think they're pretty good and hard to distinguish between them.  Don't go out of your way but if you're in the area, go for it.

I ordered the beef taco and enchilada combo and washed it down with the Jamaica drink.  Good times.  Not the best of times.  Good times.

The food here isn't going to blow your mind but it won't leave you vomiting either.
