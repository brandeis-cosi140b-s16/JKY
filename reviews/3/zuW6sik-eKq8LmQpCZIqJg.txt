Are you drunk right now? Are you in the area of Maryland Parkway and Sahara? Stumble on down to Chuy's Tacos! This is the perfect food for those party hard nights in Vegas! Nothing is better than having some greasy food truck Mexican food after some drinks! The food is prepared to order and fast! There are some seats outside of it so you don't have to balance standing up. It's pretty good for a food truck and is posted right outside of a mini mart. The scrolling sign out front will draw you in, but the delicious food will bring you back!
