Great place for a quick un-healthy lunch. 
I ordered the Jerk Chicken, Red Chicken and Jerk Fried Rice with veggies -
The jerk chicken and fried rice were great, but the red chicken and veggies can be forgotten. Red chicken was mostly fried breading than actual chicken and the veggies were a couple pieces of raw broccoli, tomatoes, iceberg lettuce and onions.
Husband got the carnitas and jerk chicken with rice and beans. 
Both his meat selections were fantastic. The beans are addicting! They are more of a bean puree but the flavor is exceptional. 
To top off a pretty decent meal you get a delicious cookie (snickerdoodle for me) which makes the trip to Chino Bandido even more worth it.
