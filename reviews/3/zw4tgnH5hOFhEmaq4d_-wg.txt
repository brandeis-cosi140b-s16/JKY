A fairly new addition to Scottsdale Fashion Square, Blue Burrito has seemed to have reinvented itself before. Whereas before, you could order items like salads, enchiladas and tacos off the menu, BBG now has a Chipotle-like setup that lets you pick burrito, bowl, salad or tacos and choose your ingredients. Much better than what they had before because before they had a tendency to mess up my order. 

If you're lucky, the salsa will be good on the day you visit. Some times it's watery and upsetting. Other times, it's thick and flavorful.

I'm told the rice & beans and both vegetarian, unlike many local Mexican joints, so that's a big plus. You can add things like corn, cabbage, peppers and guacamole to your item of choice if you like, too. Although, the guac could be kicked up a notch w/ some cilantro and lime juice.

In the future, I'd like to see a vegetarian "meat" option but I'm not going to hold my breath. It's easy for a place like BBG to add grilled eggplant, or tofu, or strips of grilled portabello mushroom or mock meat at very little cost to the business. The additional costs could be passed on to the consumer, in so gaining the heart of the vegetarian community, expanding their customer base, and giving vegetarians a heartier, more satisfying burrito.

And I think that about wraps it up.
