I came here today at around 7:30 am for a quick breakfast.

I ordered a carne asada burrito, which came out awesome. The meat was pretty juicy and the burrito definitely wasn't lacking any ingredients. I ate half and saved the rest for lunch.

I asked them to deep fry some green onions for me, which he did. They were great side dishes along with the pickled carrots, onions, and jalapenos. The red sauce was also good.

However, I only gave them 3 stars for three reasons. One, when I showed the cashier my 10% off card, he said he didn't know how to do it. I told him to just take 10% off my bill, but he just said the same thing. I just said whatever. I would have only saved 57 cents.

Two. There is no bathroom in the place! I mean, it is pretty small, but since there are seats and tables available for eat-in customers, I don't understand why there wouldn't be a bathroom. It's an essential in a Mexican restaurant.

And three: there were no plastic utensils at the condiment area. I'm not sure if I needed to ask for them, but in other locations they have them ready for you. I had to attack the entire burrito and stop halfway to save the rest for lunch. A knife would've been helpful in this case.

But otherwise, the food was just as I expected of a Don Tortaco's. I'll come back, but only if I really need to.
