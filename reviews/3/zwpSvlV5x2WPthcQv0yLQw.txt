Beautiful place and ambience. Server and table side guacamole was great, must try the Guac! I came here with my fiancé and it has the whole romantic feel to it, however our entrees and drinks failed to impress us. Drinks were expensive and weak. My steak wasn't that enjoyable had a weird taste to it, however the little bread it came with was good. My fiancé ordered 2 diff tacos, and wasn't impressed. We've been to taco stands in Cali & Philly that was way better. Presentation, atmosphere, the Guac and sever was on top.... so for that I give 3 stars. However I've been to plenty of higher end restaurants with better tasting food that I didn't mind pinching pennies for. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing but I don't think I'd come back.
