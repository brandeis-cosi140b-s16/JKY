I've been here three times. The first time to check it out since it's new. My friends and I ordered chips and salsa to share. I remember they served a few tablespoons of salsa and a small amount of chips. It was barely enough for one person. Not only was it a child's portion, they charge for it. I must have been spoiled by the other Mexican restaurants that I've been to where chips and salsa are unlimited. 

For my meal, I ordered three lettuce wrapped carne asada tacos. (I was trying to be healthy). The tacos are small, more on the sweet side and not spicy, just OK. Also, sampled my friends' shrimp, mushroom, & swordfish tacos. Not bad but not amazing either. I was still hungry after. Apparently, I didn't order enough tacos.

The second time, I ordered two types of ceviche. I can make better ceviche at home. The crackers that accompanied the ceviche were awful. I made a mental note to never order this again.

I only agreed to come back a third time because my friend had a 50% off industry pass. I was too hungry to pick a place to eat. I ordered the cheese enchiladas and chips with three types of salsa. I enjoyed two of the salsas-tomatillo and habanero. I liked the cheese enchiladas because it came with a lot of cheese and the green sauce was good.

I would only come back here with my friend on 50% off industry day. I think it's overpriced and overhyped as I keep seeing this place mentioned in the Vegas magazines and newspapers.
