Pedro's used to be a 5-star for us - back when they were on the West side.  The East location has never been as good, and it seems to be slipping. 

In all, the food was good.  Considering we were there at 3pm on a Saturday, and were mostly alone, you would think the food would have been piping hot when served.  It wasn't.  Granted, it wasn't cold either, but just not that "fresh out of the oven" kind of hot you would expect when there's nobody else there.  It tasted fine, and the chips and salsa were a trip down memory lane.

Service was excellent.  Brooks was on top of things.  Being his only table probably made that easy, but he was super nice and willing to get us anything we needed asap.  

The restaurant itself is aging.  A little work could be put into it to make it nice again.  There were more flies around than I prefer to have - that was a turn-off.
