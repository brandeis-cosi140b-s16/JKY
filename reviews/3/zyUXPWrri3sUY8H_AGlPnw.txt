after not eating half the day & getting off the flight & the shuttle....vennie & i stumbled upon this place b4 getting our carrot top tickets....yes carrot top people....hes still around & is worth the addmission....i dunno why i wanted to try the ceviche but it was a bad idea...i really did dip my chips in only twice n pushed it to the side....ceviche was too watery & the fish didnt seem fresh =(....luckily veenies nachos made up for it....u can tell the carne asada was fresh off the grill....free chips/salsa is huuuuge plus....the nachos were soooo good that we returned the night after & ordered again after the carrot top show...i say 3.5 stars...the dj & mc screaming in my ear n playin wack tracks didnt help & kinda ruined my meal....i came here to eat & not get annoyed
