The happy hour menu was really good. I appreciated the kid menu as well. My husband had a really greasy meal which grossed him out but I had a carne asada quesidilla that was to die for. The place was super quiet during the beginning of supper but shortly picked up with lots of families. The decor looks italian but don't let that fool you! I would try it again to see if we can all get a great meal!
