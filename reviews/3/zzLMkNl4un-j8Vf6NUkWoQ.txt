My wife and I go to Ocho Locos on a regular basis, mainly because we really like Mexican food and it is the only place open for dinner in Anthem that serves after 5pm. The food is hit or miss.  Most nights we like it well enough and other nights it is quite plain. The top shelf margaritas are pretty tasty.  We will be back...
