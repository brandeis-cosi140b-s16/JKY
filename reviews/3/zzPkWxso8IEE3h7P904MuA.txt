A little higher priced than I expected for such a divey place, but the food was great and definitely hit the spot. I got a chance to try the breakfast enchiladas with eggs on top of them and there were perfect! Something about the yolk and the enchilada sauce really won me over. I also tried the green chili and shredded beef burrito. It was really good and filled with authentic flavors.Lastly, there were the chips. They were about average for chips here in the valley, but I really liked the salsa verde...I kinda couldn't stop eating it. 

I'm excited to go back to this place and ask for a recommendation. I have a feeling that I will find something here that will keep me coming back again and again.
