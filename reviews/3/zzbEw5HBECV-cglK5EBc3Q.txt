I've been going to UNLV for four years, and have never once tried this place. Finally, a friend of mine told me he was performing there so I decided to give it a try. I was excited when I first walked in because of their awesome student special. $5 gets you four tacos, 2 sides, & a drink. It's a great deal and fills your tummy enough so you aren't longing for more food. The taste of the tacos, however, didn't live up to expectations. The tacos were mediocre. 

They have a pretty extensive beer selection which made me happy. The prices on those beers however were overpriced. I understand paying more for beers that most other places don't carry, but I thought their prices were a little too steep. 

They have local singers and what not play there, so if you go on a good night - you at least get some free entertainment with your meal.
