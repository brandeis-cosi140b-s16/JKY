I enjoy their chicken burrito or chicken bean burrito. Shredded chicken and a tortilla. No cheese or anything else is on it, but I can have big lunch for $5. Pretty simple but a good flavor. The chicken appears to be a decent quality. I've tried the chicken fundido which was excellent but so bad for you (deep fried plus spicy sour cream sauce) that I very rarely order it.  
That being said, I've tried other items and didn't like them at all. My husband can't find anything he likes here so I only come here if I'm out shopping and get hungry for chicken other than Chick Fil A. 
Their salsa (maybe better called a red sauce rather than salsa) is very bland. You can ask for a green sauce that's hot and spicy but the request seems to confuse them. Sometimes they charge us, other times they flat out refuse to give us any and other times we get it without issue. Weird! 
Anyway, if you want traditional Mexican don't come here! If you want bland Americanized Mexican food, you might like it.
