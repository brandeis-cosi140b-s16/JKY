Spring Training.  So how did i start my Spring Training that fine morning? Enchiladas, taco, Omelet, Rice, beans, Chilli Relleno, some BBQ, a gang of Mimosas and some chocolate cake.

This place is in a strip mall sort of complex.  From the outside you would think its a little rinky dink joint but its fairly good size and nicely set up in there.  Good size bar top and two dinning areas.  The buffet was really good and I will certainly do it again next time I find myself in Surprise, AZ
