One of my very favorite places to eat in Las Vegas. This place is in Summerlin, about 15 miles off of the strip in a suburban neighborhood. If you are from out of town, go here, and then go to the Red Rock Casino across the street. There's more to Vegas than The Strip!

This place is a great experience. All the furniture and silverware and plates and even the bar were made in Mexico and imported exclusively for this restaurant! The walls are pink/green/red and very colorful with a high cieling in the bar area. There's an awesome patio for drinking margaritas on the cool(er) Las Vegas nights.

The food is Mexican, but tries not to be Tex-Mex (though it still is sometimes). They have duck quesadillas! The winner is the free chips (fresh) and salsa (three kinds - all awesome - all free!).

It is supposedly open 24 hours a day though like many places in "locals" Vegas, there is probably nobody in there from 3AM until lunch.
