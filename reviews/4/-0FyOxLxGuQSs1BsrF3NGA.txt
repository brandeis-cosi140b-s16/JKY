After reading a review in one of the alternative newspapers, I had to give this place a try.  I had the chicken/beef combo molcajetes.  It was superb!  The place is a small bungalow-like building with parking in the front and sides.  It's in a small commercial area, but it's a stand alone building.

The tables have 5 or 6 bottles of different hot sauces you can try.  It seemed like that had one waitress for Spanish speaking people and one for gabachos like me.  

Give this place a try!  You won't regret I'll be back to try more soon.
