I've been to Mando's about four more times since my review...not much has changed as far as the quality of their food goes.  The horchata continues to be great.  So are the crispy little tacos.  I haven't ventured too far out of the box, pretty much sticking with tacos, burritos, and chimis.  Its just something about the heftines of the chimi that you can't help but smile about.  Service continues to be friendly.  Only thing I'd like to see is an update for the interior, but money is tight, I'm sure.
