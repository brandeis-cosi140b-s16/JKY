Sure, they are a chain. Sure, it is not authentic Mexican Food by a long shot. Still it isn't bad. 
I had a Taco Salad which was humongous! I barely finished it all! It tasted good though and fresh. The toppings of salsa, sour cream and guacamole tasted like they were supposed to! Steven's tacos were tasty as well!
The chips and salsa they serve before hand were good too! Sometimes you can be fooled with good chips and salsa and get a meal that is inconsistent and bad but that is not the case here! I have no complaints here.
