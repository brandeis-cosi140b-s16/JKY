Came here for date night last night and it was amazing. We got sat right away and our server brought us our chips and salsa and our drink orders almost right away. We ordered and our food was hot and amazing! The only thing I would complain about would be our server being too attentive. I mean it isn't bad it showed he cared but we saw him at our table every 7-10 minutes. 
Other than that. Everything about this place is great! Fast and great food
