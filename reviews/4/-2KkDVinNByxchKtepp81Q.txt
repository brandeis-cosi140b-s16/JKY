We just moved here from California.  My husband is a native California boy and I lived in the Bay Area for seven years.  We know a good burrito when we see one.  While I doubt I will ever find anything as delicious as our beloved taco truck in Petaluma (we actually composed a song about them once), Phat Burrito is extraordinary.   Super fresh ingredients, great spice blends, yummy beans and some terrific handmade salsas set Phat Burrito apart and put it ahead of the other joints we've tried both here and in California.  Way to go, Carolina!!
