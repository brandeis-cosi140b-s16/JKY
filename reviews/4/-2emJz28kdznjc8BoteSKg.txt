Lunch time couldn't be better int he summer than at Pink Taco. Sit out on the patio and order one of their many specialty margaritas and watch the action at the pool while being in the shade. 
There are a plethra of great things on the menu, such as the rock shrimp, the enchiladas with green sauce, and the guacomole with chips and salsa. Pink Taco is always busy, the food is always consistant, and the service is good. 
For a big group make a reservation and they'll hold it with a credit card, great for a casual birthday!!
