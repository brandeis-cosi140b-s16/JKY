Glad we stopped by.  Were already downtown and decided to give this a try. Glad we did. Service was great. Wasn't very busy so we received plenty of attention. I had the carne asada plate. Big enough to fill me up and have some left overs. Rice and beans were delicious. Meat was decent. Overall great experience and will surely return to try your their lunch menu.
