The food was ok, enjoyed the guacamole that is made right in front of you by a server.
Chips were fresh and refilled quickly and include salsa.
Me and my party had Enchiladas & Chimichangas along with the tasty beans & rice. 
You get a choice of refried or black beans here. (plenty of cheese is included here)
The cadillac margarita was not as good as other ones i've had. Just was not mixed right.
Servers were nice and attentive. We were seated about 5 min. after arriving.
Prices were fairly good and we found the restaurant quickly in the New York, New York hotel.
