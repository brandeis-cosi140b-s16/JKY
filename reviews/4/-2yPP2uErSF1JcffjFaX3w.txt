Walking in it looks like your typical mexican food joint. Vending machines, small video game arcade.. The colorful decor and a large Pacifico Beer billboard on a wall. 

I was a bit skeptical when I saw an older white gentleman at the register taking the orders, but it didn't stop me. I'm glad I stayed!!

I ordered their chorizo & egg burrito and carne asada tacos. The burrito was very filling and well wrapped in a flour tortilla. It had the right amount of chorizo & egg combination. The carne asada tacos were delicious. The meat was tender, and they  were topped with Pico de gallo, lettuce and guacamole. Very fresh ingredients!!

Great, inexpensive place for 24/7 Mexican food! I shall return.
