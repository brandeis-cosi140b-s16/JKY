We just stopped in while waiting for our flight back to JAX after ten wonderful, amazing days in AZ. We had a fun bubbly waitress that was eager to share about the GRAND FALLS, also known as Melting Chocolate, Chocolate Falls or Mud Falls is northeast of Flagstaff, AZ in the Painted Desert. Which I am very sad to say we missed this trip. We had been an hour away when we stayed at the Twin Arrow Casino. Shaking my head that I had not known of this beautiful place. SO...back to the TDT review.. 

We just drank but the Margaritas were good, fairly prices at just under $9 bucks a pop(cheaper then so many places we had stopped at along our journey). The food coming out looked good and was quick (as it is a rush rush airport kind of need) 

I would so recommend this place if you are flying out of Phx Sky Harbor. We were flying Delta Terminal 3 gate 25 for point of reference.
