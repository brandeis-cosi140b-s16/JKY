I love the food at this restaurant chain so I would eat there no matter what the service was like, but I had a positive experience that I want to share. Yes, there are lines. Yes, sometimes the staff is inefficient and slow, but I guess I've come to expect it so that doesn't phase me anymore. 

What was unexpected was comping my guac when I had to wait a little extra while they refunded the guy in front of me because they charged him too much. I believe it was the manager that did it. It was totally unexpected and appreciated. There was another time where the cashier decided (since I am such a loyal customer and come in at least once a week) to comp my entire meal including guac! This was several months ago; not sure if it was the same manager. This is the only location that has ever done this and I have been to quite a few in the Phoenix area.

Maybe it's the fact that I don't expect this to happen that makes me seem more appreciated. I certainly don't expect them to do this to everyone all the time, but it's a nice gesture that makes my day a little better and as cheesy as it sounds reminds me that there are good people in the world. :)
