Food and service is excellent! Salsa is fresh and delicious and the guac is equally delicious with a hint of jalapeño. They must've included a bit of jalapeno in the fajita veggies in my chicken quesadillla because my mouth was craving milk.  Our server brought my hubby a free fried ice cream since it was his birthday. :)  They also have gave me 2 free dinners for buying over $30 in gift certificates.  We loved Jessie, our server!  However, they don't have jalapeño cream cheese and the women's bathroom is old and little gross.  Just go to the bathroom elsewhere.
