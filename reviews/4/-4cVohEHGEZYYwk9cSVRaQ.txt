Love love love me some Monterrey. 
Great prices, great service, and great atmosphere. 
I enjoy coming here for a quick mexican fix for lunch or dinner. 
They are very consistent with their food (which I swear has crack in it....it's so good and keeps people coming back) 
Drinks are on the pricey side...thats the only pitfall here. 
Otherwise, whenever I leave Monterrey I'm a happy camper and it is always on my "go to option" list for meals. 
Also, food combinations..... good prices and huge portions! love it.
