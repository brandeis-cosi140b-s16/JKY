Their food is absolutely amazing. Here is the cons: its a little pricey! The drinks dont come with the food. Its a extra 2 dollar something per drink. Their employees dont seem to all be on the same page. Sometimes my food comes with dressing and sometimes it dont. Depends on who is there i guess. And there is this one gentleman who always seems to be in a bad mood. He makes my food with so much unhappiness i can almost taste it. Lol.
