I love chipotle, I always order sofritas and no matter the bowl, burrito or tacos its fan-fucking-tastic. The tofu is beautifully marinated and cooked so perfectly its ridiculous that anyone could be afraid to try it. I've only ever had ONE bad experience from this shop where a piece of chicken was in my bowl and I accidentally ate it. Which made me sick and that's the only reason I'm not giving five stars. The restaurant itself is very clean and the workers are friendly
