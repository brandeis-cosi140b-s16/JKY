Came to grab a quick bite. Had the lotus chips, enmoladas, caldo, sui mai beef, fried rice, refried bean taco, and grilled fish taco. Some dishes were fusion, some were not, all are good. Those giving this place a bad review probably had the wrong expectations. Service was great, no wait, food came out quick and fresh, ambiance was chill.
