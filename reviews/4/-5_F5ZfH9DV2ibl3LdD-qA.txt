I tried this place after reading all of the reviews here on yelp. 
I'm glad I did. 
The first thing I felt when I drove in the almost-vacant strip center is a sense that I had come to the wrong address. Alas, there it was...
Walk inside: clean, comfortable, friendly service, and some of the freshest Mexican food I've eaten! 
I had 3 tacos--grilled fish, carne asada and barbacoa. 
Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of carne asada, but you all rave about it, so I tried it. 
It was good, and very fresh. 
After devouring my barbacoa taco, I was miffed as to why no raves on it? 
It was absolutely fabulous. Fresh, tender and perfectly seasoned. 
The grilled fish taco was really, really good, as well. Very fresh, slightly spicy seasoning and oh-so-yummy. 
Did I mention how fresh the food is? 
Remember to try the barbacoa..it was AWESOME! 
And fresh!
