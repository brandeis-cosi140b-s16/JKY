Mixed review here. First, the idea is unique to Chandler and I think it is needed in that area. The taco selection is superb and the ability to order a taco combo plate that I create is a nice aspect. The salsa is medium heat and very flavorful. I have eaten at Rock Taco 2 times and I have been pleased with the food and the price.

This place is new so I give it some leeway, but the food took forever both times. Also, the servers are not knowledgeable yet they are attentive. Finally, while I like the concept, the vibe and ambiance could use a little work. The bathrooms especially need to be more hip and "rock" ish.
