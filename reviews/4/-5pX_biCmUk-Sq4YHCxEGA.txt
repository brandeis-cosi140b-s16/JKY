Three way burro. Enchiladas. Chile Relleno. Beans and rice. Cheese crisps. All delish. This is my first stop when I come into town and it never disappoints. Can't attest to ambiance or service for dining in because we always take out, but food is always hot, ready when they say it would be, and we always have an ample supply of home made hot sauce to take home. Can't beat the prices or the authenticity.
