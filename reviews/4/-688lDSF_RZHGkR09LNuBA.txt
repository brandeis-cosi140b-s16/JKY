So apparently, I happen to go during the busiest time around 6:30-7. Minus one star for a disorganized line system.  I knew what I wanted and waited in the "burrito/nacho/fries" line right off the bat.  My friends wanted tacos and waited in that line.  It was so busy that I could see how this would be a problem for others who are not used to ordering from the counter this way.

This is what my friends & I ordered:
- Al pastor fries
- Carne asada nachos
- Al pastor tacos
- Carne asada tacos
- Beef burrito
- Chicharron taco
- Corn on the cob (mexican street style)

Everything was a hit and tasted delicious and flavorful.  The only "miss" was the chicharron taco.  My friend thought it might be the crispy pork skin version, but ended up to be chewy.  Yuck! We weren't very adventurous, but they do offer a variety of meat options and body parts.  Besides meat, there is of course vegetarian options.  The salad/sauce bar was good, but none of the sauces were labeled.

The new location is very spacious and looks like an upscale taco joint.  The food though, stays true to authenticity. There are also extra seating upstairs.Happy hour daily during 6-8pm ($1 off beer).

Overall, great food & location.  For about $10 you can get a satisfying meal.  Whether it is 3 tacos + drink, or fries + corn.
