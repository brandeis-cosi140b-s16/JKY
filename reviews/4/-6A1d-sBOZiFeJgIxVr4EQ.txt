This is my favorite 'bertos.  It doesn't hurt that it is conveniently located near my home and school, so I can have it coming or going.

The 24 hour service 365 days a year make this place a standout. It also doesn't hurt that the staff is super friendly and will happy take your 'when Harry me Sally' style order.  Prices are cheap and unlike others, I've never had an issue with slow drive through service.

The nachos are my favorite thing on the menu.  When they pass the bag to me it must weigh close to two pounds.  The clam shell could not hold one more ounce and if it were not for the extra red and green hot sauces that I always request because I like my food spicy, I swear that the lid would not have a chance of staying closed.  I also like the cheese enchiladas.  They aren't nice restaurant good but they aren't bad and a great choice for non-meat eaters.  My BIL loves the carne asada  here and I'm pretty sure he's tried just about every 'bertos in the city.

If you're in the area and you need a quick eat, this place is clean... the food is good... and the staff is friendly. Give Eribertos a try (even if it's at 3:30 in the morning).  :)
