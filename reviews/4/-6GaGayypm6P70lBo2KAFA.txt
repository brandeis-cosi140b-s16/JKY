My husband and I just moved here from California and after having our share of California burritos we were open to trying Zapata's. The food was really good but what impressed us was the service. I've been here twice already and each time the service was great. They are very attentive, we went on cinco de Mayo and as busy as they were we still got excellent service. My husband is hard to impress since he loves Southern California Mexican spots, but he really liked the food at Zapata's, we will be visiting this place more often.
