I love the legit places in the downtown neighborhood that have seen it through all of the transitions and still are respected and are staples in the community. La Tolteca is one of those Phoenix restaurants that has been there for decades. My grandmother used to buy her corn husks from them to make tamales, which is so amazing to me. 

I first went here for a burrito and fell in love with it's legitimate Mexican street food taste, and it filled me up and made me happy! The atmosphere is festive. You order at the counter, gaze at the bright colors surrounding you, and watch the wide array of people eating and talking. It's festive! There are no frills here, it is just simple and delicious. I have been back for the huevos rancheros and love the runny eggs and beans and fresh tortillas, aye! So good. I will keep supporting their authentic menu and spreading the word!
