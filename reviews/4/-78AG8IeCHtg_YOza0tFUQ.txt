We ate here for Sunday brunch, which for $13.99 buffet you can't beat. I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. A mariachi band was performing live, which added to the fun vibe. My only complaint was the service. The staff was very nice, but our server wasn't very attentive. I saw other servers offering drinks to their tables but we were not. We also had to wait quite a while for our check. Overall, I would definitely return.
