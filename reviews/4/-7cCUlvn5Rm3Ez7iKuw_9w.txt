Welcome to my side of town! Best Breakfast Burrito in town made better at being able to get one any time during the day. Not to say the other food is bad but sometimes you succumb to the cravings. This, so much so, we would drive down to Alma School at 8:PM on as weekday just to get one. (Or several, depending if it was dinner time.) 

New owners are nice, not as Ghetto as the other place. (Is this a franchise?) Kid friendly, good food - reasonable prices and close by my house - win win go on in!
