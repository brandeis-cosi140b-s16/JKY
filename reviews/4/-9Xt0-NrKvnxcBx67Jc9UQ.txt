I tried the shrimp cocktail and four tacos special with the cowboy beans, shrimp cocktail was awesome and the street tacos were yummy.  The salsa bar was really good to put it on it was all fresh and their tortilla chips didn't taste like they were a week old they were great I'll definitely go back there
