We stopped by after a day trip down to Charleston knowing there was nothing in the house to eat.  I had been wanting to give this place a try, but I had also heard that there had been some difficulties when they first opened, so we went in not knowing what to expect....

I was not dissappointed.  I had the Texas Burrito with grilled shrimp, steak and chicken.  The shrimp were plentiful, and tasty, not overcooked.  The steak and chicken both were well seasoned.  My wife had a veggie chimi, which we had not seen before, and some sangria.  She was very happy with both items.  Lastly, my Mother-in-Law had a grilled chicken quesadilla, which looked great, loaded full of chicken.

The service was good, but I can see that if they were super busy the wait staff could get overloaded.  I'm hoping they are a success.
