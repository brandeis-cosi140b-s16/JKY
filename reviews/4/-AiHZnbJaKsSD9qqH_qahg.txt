MMM Chicos. I have been coming here for years and it has consistantly been delicious. It is one of the places we bring out of town guests to.

This is a pay-at-the-counter type place, but much much better than any type of ____bertos. 

They have lard free beans and a salsa bar with several different types and they give you chips to munch on before your meal.

The portions are extremely generous, especially if you get the california burro. I weighed it and it was literally a pound.

The tostadas come in a shell, and are kind of a mix between a tostada and a taco salad, but the veggie tostada is my favorite. get the guac and sour cream and you have the best mexican food around.

The California burro and the quesedillas are also really good. My boyfriends mom will drive from Apache Junction just to get the steak quesedilla.

The restaurant is brightly colored and has upbeat mexican music playing. Good location with lots of parking, and its right next to a Starbucks.

And if my review wasnt enough to convince you, I can almost guarantee that you will see cops eating there if you go. I think that says something :)

PS I think they are closed on Sundays
