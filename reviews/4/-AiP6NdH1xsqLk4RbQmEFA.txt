So it's my sisters bachelorette....I'm the maid of honor. My job is to organize activities/dinners for 28 women. YIKES, and PANIC!!! Luckily, Kori Zornes (Catering Sales Manager) for El Segundo came to the rescue. I contacted her a couple months ago and she was a major help in making the dinner portion of our weekend go smoothly. Kori responded to all of my emails/calls very quickly. Initially we were going to do a "set" menu and then switched to a la carte. Kori was very accommodating in making this change. 
When we arrived on Saturday we had the "Ventana" room reserved. This was awesome, as we had the entire room to ourselves. The glass walls allowed for a perfect view of the strip. The wait staff was awesome as well. Quick to take drink and food orders. I had the tortilla soup which was delicious. Even had a little flair, as the waiter placed a bowl of the "dry" ingredients in front of me. Then poured the soup from a separate pitcher into the bowl. Most of the girls ordered tacos, and everyone was pleased with their meal. I was pretty stoked that they sold tall cans of beer, so that's what I had for drinks. Others in our party ordered margaritas and said they were good and strong. Which is great....because we knew when we got to the clubs drinks would double (if not triple) in price. 
The staff was also spot on in separating the checks. We pretty much broke into small groups rather than have one big check. With as many people as we had in our party, all checks came out correctly. 
I really appreciate the staff and Kori for helping us have a great time. I definitely recommend coming here with any size group!! 

THANKS AGAIN KORI FOR ALL YOUR HELP!! WE HAD A GREAT TIME...I PLAN ON COMING BACK WHEN IN VEGAS!!
