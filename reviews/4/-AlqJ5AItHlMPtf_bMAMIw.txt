Soooo the best part about this place is the 98 cent tacos! I got some carne asada tacos, some al pastor, and tacos de papa. I was SOOOO excited to try the tacos de papa, I love them!! Well here theyre not like traditional ones, they deep fry them which I didnt like. 

The carne asada tacos are ace! I love them! You can get them plain or with beans, oinions and cilantro atop... or any combo. Plus I always put hella lime on it! YUM!

The tacos al pastor were not my cup of tea, I wasnt digging them. They were WAYYYY too sweet!! 

All in all I'd go back!
