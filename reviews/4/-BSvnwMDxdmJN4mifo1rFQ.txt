My new favorite Burrito and menudo.  I used to have a place I enjoyed but they have destroyed their burrito so I needed a new place.  I LOVE the burritos here the meat is marinated perfectly they burritos are made to an authentic Mexican way.  

Of corse I need tons of the home made green sauce to drench the top. 

My Man loves the menudo here, it is one of the top 2 we have found for him in town.  You can ask for the Ham Hock or get it without, don't forget your onions and cilantro!
