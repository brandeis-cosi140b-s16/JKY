There are not many restaraunts in Apache Junction that are clean, not packed wall to wall with snow birds, and serve decent food.  I realise I may be missing out but I tend to avoid restaraunts in older buildings with dirt lots.  There are a lot of those in AJ,  That being said, Los Gringos Locos is a new building in a nice parking lot, with lots of nice clean things inside and out of it.  That gets me in the door.  The food is ok there.  I have never had anything great there, or anything even better than average.  It is normal "chain" restaraunt mexican food.  It's ok. I think a lot people go there because of the building, and service.  Top notch.  Not because of the food which is mediocre.
