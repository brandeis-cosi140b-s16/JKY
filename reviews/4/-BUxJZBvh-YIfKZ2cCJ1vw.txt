I was happy to see a Javier's opening in Las Vegas.  It is not the same without the ocean views, but it is still good.  The crowd is also very different, not quite the Newport set.

The food is just like the other locations as you would expect.  The service is pretty good as well.  It fits nicely in Aria.

I was not too creative with my ordering.  I started out with the queso fundido as always.  I did vary a little with my order.  I ordered the beef taco plate instead of the enchilada with a taco.  Both items ordered were tasty.
