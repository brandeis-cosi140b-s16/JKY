They have very good taco shop food. They are the only place I can find in Vegas that will make me, potatoe rolled tacos. If your a vegetarian this is a great option. The staff is very friendly here and always get the orders correct, even with how complicated my order is. This is my go to taco shop, being from So Cal I am very picky.
