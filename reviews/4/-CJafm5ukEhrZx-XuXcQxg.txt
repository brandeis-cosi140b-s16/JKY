Best BBQ in the Phoenix Area,
Move over Honey Bears and those fans of Stacy's.  "slow cooking is the true artform of tender bbq." 

Could I be more bold than this review.  This place defines a hole in the wall restaurant and produces the best food and experience it can offer with out selling out.  From the employees that will try their best  to learn your name to the love in the food with the Texas feel.  

I put my credibility on the line for this "hole in the wall joint" What an experience.  East of Broadway and 24th St. this building has proved to be a destination location for greatness.  One of the hardest things a business can  do is stand alone and not become successful because of traffic rates or marketing investments.   At anytime you can see that people drive and walk far to support the location.  

Take my advice if you want the Best BBQ and respond with a review of your own.
