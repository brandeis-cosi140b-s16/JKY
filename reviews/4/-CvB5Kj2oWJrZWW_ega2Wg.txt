The fry brad place we wanted to eat at was closed so we stopped at this place to eat before getting on the road back to san diego. Their menu has 11 combos, tacos , burritos and tortas. The meat options are carnitas, chicken , barbacoa, asada, pastor, lengua, and lengua. Oh, they also serve menudo, pozole , and tamales. 
We ordered the enchilada combo which included 4 (chicken or cheese), rice and beans. The tacos are small tortilla tacos. They have a salsa bar with salsas and condiments. 
Customer service was friendly and efficient. Food taste was good  The enchilada sauce was restaurant made, not canned like most places. Beans were very good and restaurant made, not canned. 
We ordered barbacoa(beef) tacos and the meat tasted great! No heavy seasoning or condiments. 
They sell american soda, mexican soda and freshly sqweezed lemonade. 
Ambiance was cool. Mexican music playing, simple tables with metal chairs. The place looked like its going through a make over. It had new orange paint on walls. Oh, they do have ceiling fans and a/c!
