The burrito bowls are excellent!  And large enough that I'm pretty sure I'm going to be eating it for lunch and dinner tomorrow.  Sort of disappointed that the elote Loco wasn't grilled. I feel like it would add so much flavor to the corn; but it was good still without being grilled. A must try if you haven't been!
