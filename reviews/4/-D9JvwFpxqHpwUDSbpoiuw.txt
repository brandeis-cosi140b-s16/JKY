Back when this place was in Minneapolis, I was a cook there.  We had fresh great recipes and it was "new" - quality mexican food before Qdoba's and all the big chains were around.  The food was fresh, lots of good flavor and unique beverages and treats.  Well...Pasqual's ended up in Madison and, it's just as good as I remember from when I worked there.  We go for work lunches.
