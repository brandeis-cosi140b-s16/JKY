I am a big fan of the taco stand on Saturdays.  I'm an even bigger fan of the restaurant below the store.  I ordered the chips with two salsas, chorizo tacos, and mole enchiladas to split with my friend all of which were great.  One problem is that you can't mix and match the tacos.  Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu, the hostess who seated us was friendly, and the host was gracious.   With drinks and tip, the dinner for two was less than $50.  Word of warning: If you're under 5'5", your feet won't touch the ground when you sit in the chairs.  I chalked it up to the charm of the restaurant.
