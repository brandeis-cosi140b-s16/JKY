the red hot sauce is so great here, I would tend to overlook some of the service/appearance issues noted in some of the other reviews. it is amazing to finally find home-style, no frills, no damned 'southwest' or 'tex-mex' style, basic tasty mexican food....at a very decent price! this is the kind of gem that is so easy to find in my hometown of san diego, but has proven very difficult to locate here. EXTREMELY happy to have found SUSIE'S!! we will be regular patrons..
Just a review update, as we just ate there a few days ago again....and everything was PERFECT! Our food arrived in under 5 minutes from ordering, and it was just great. We cannot ever leave Susie's without taking home a pint of their red sauce....it's too good not to bring some home. Thanks again, Susies, for being so good!!
