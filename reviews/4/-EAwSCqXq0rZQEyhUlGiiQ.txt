Took my daughter and her friend for dinner. 

Our server ("Liz Lemon") was fantastic. She helped make our evening meal a good one.

The complimentary chips and salsa were tasty. The salsa had just enough spice and the chips were crisp and warm. (Though I remember the chips as being a bit too salty and I worried about my sodium intake for the day...) 

We all ordered from the "Create Your Own Combo" section of the menu. 

I ordered chicken tortilla soup (yummy) and two chicken tostadas (also yummy). The tostadas came with black beans and rice. My drink was peach-flavored tea.

Along with the chips and salsa and tea, I was pleasantly full enough to take home leftovers. 

Reasonably priced for about $13 per person, including drinks and taxes.

I think I saw a Tuesday special on the small pop-up table advert...

We will definitely return to this location.
