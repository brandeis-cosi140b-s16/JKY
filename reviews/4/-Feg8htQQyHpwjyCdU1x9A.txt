Much better this time around. Went a little later than usual, which made a huge difference. A later lunch meant no long line. The chorizo burrito was hot to the touch and remained that way 'til the very last morsel. The quesadilla was hot as well and cheesier than my boss's cheesy redneck jokes. Avoid the traditional "lunch hour" here and you are good to go. It's amazing what a difference an hour can make. Between 11:00 and 12:30, you have to wait in a long line and can barely find a seat. The further you can stray from that time frame, the better your experience gets. Next time I'm going to give the chicken tacos a whirl. A co-worker chowed down on some and they looked scrumptous.
