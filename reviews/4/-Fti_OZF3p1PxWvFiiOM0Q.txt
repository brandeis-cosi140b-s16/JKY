What I love about Yelp is that you will find hole in the wall spots that you would never try if not for the "Nearby" search and prior reviewers telling you, "it's okay, try it!"

The grilled chicken burrito I had was delicious. What makes their burritos is the tortilla!  Their tortillas are the best I've had in a long time. Add the great salsa bar (small but fresh) and you have a great local neighborhood gem.

I would warn that my burrito was chuck full of grilled dark meat, which I love but isn't for everyone.  The smoky flavor from the grill makes the chicken extra flavorful.  It also had delicious Mexican rice & just enough melted cheese.

Their salsa was so good I finished every chip!  This place would be compared to a locally owned Baja Fresh, but so much better ingredients and true Mexican flare, right down to the mariachi music being piped in!  You order at the counter and listen for your number to be called.  The staff is great and constantly milling around clearing and cleaning tables.

Thanks Chico's I'll be back.
