This is a solid dive place. Great tacos. Great food all around. Service was good. 

I tried 5 of the gourmet tacos. All were good.  The place is a little dirty, walls and windows but that almost adds to the place. I'll be back for sure. 

The salsa bar is nice. Too many to try on one visit. I like this place.
