I came into Moe's with pretty low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.  My salad was really fresh and I liked that they had some different topping choices, such as cucumbers, black olives and sauteed mushrooms.  (I'm used to Zabas or Chipotle that pretty much only offer salsa and some peppers). My steak was really tender -- juicy enough that I didn't even use any of my salad dressing. 

The facilities were clean and there was plenty of comfortable seating.  I also thought the pricing was fair for the amount of food given.  The staff could have been a bit more friendly, but sadly that's pretty much the norm in Vegas.  I'll definitely head back to Moe's when I'm in the area.
