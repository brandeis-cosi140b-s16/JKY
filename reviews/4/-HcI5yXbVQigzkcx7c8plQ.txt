Hands down, the best Rubio's in Vegas. Great service, great food....and even though I order the same thing most of the time (most of the employees know my order when I walk in the door) for whatever reason, it's the best here....perfect amount of each ingredient. Love it that there's a salsa bar that I can get myself. Wish they served beer here....that would make it a 5 star place!
