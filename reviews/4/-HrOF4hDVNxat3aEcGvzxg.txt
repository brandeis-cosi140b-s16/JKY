I love this Mexican place and find it much better than Roberto's. It is independently owned, and the service is quick and friendly.  

I lived in San Diego for many years and know good Mexican fast food. This place is about the best I've had in Las Vegas. Their carne asada is very good and seems to be from a higher quality cut of meat. What I love most about this place is their fresh salsa! It is not watered down like Robertos; it is thick and tasty! They have a few different varieties to choose from, and all are very good.  

I'm also a fan of the carne asada chips!
