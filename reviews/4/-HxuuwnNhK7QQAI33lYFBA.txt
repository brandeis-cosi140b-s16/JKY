Solid mission burrito spot tucked away in hard to find spot in uptown Charlotte.  Got be here for a while before you here about it, but its definitely a great burrito that uses fresh ingredients.  Best part is that you can build your burrito exactly the way you want it and no BS $2 uncharge for Guac. They also have a great selection of bottled drinks including Mexican Coke and Orangina, which aren't available everywhere.  Reasonable prices and they prefer cash, but don't let them pressure you into it.  They will take your money any way got it.  I intend on being back at least once a month.
