Odele muthafuckas...this is hands down one of the best Mexican restaurants I know of. Gives me one more reason to thank the Mexican culture. I generally order the carne asada burrito,beans,guacamole,sour cream,pico de gallo and a lil Mexicana love. And you know what I love about a lot of Mecican restaurants...they post pictures of the actual food. Compadres, this is muy bueno.
