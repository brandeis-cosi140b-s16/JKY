We went with a larger group to take advantage of their taco Tuesdays ($1 tacos). My advice is to get there early as it was pretty busy  (they also offer this Sundays in the bar area only). 

The server was very friendly - I can't recall her name (Bonnie maybe?) but she had a pixie cut, darker hair, and a tongue ring (weird that I noticed but I am not sure how else to describe her)...anyway she did a fantastic job with the whole group and ensured that everyone had full drinks and happy bellies. 

I tried the Asada (Grilled Steak), Barbacoa (Soft Shredded Beef), and Carnitas (Roasted Pull Pork). I enjoyed them all but the Barbacoa which was dry. The Carnitas was my favorite. I have to say that all of the choices were very flavorful- but a nice squeeze of lime made it even better. Three was a good size for me, but keep in mind they are a bit smaller- but hey they are a buck order another!  I also enjoyed a side of Guacamole which was really tasty. 

I wish they also offered flour tortillas in addition to corn but all and all it was a great meal and I couldn't have asked for a better price. I will return!
