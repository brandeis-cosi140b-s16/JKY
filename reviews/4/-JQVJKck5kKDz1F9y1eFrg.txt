I was in charge of planning our girl's weekend in Vegas last week and that included trying new places to eat.  

Well, I went Groupon and LivingSocial hunting for ideas.  Isla Mexician Kitchen & Tequila Bar came up...so I bought the deal and thought, "What the heck, we'll give it a try."  I was pleasantly surprised.  We walked right in on a Saturday evening, the place wasn't packed but there were a couple of large parties and some families.  Our waitress noticed the deals I had printed out and was still very pleasant and attentive.  

I ordered the barbacoa enchiladas and they were quite tasty.  I like my food a little spicer, but the flavor was great.  My friends order tacos and said they were really good, but didn't elaborate.  We did order the flourless chocolate cake with chilli to share.  It was amazing!!  Served warm with ice cream.  The chili had a nice little back-of-the-throat burn after the chocolate burst.  So yummy!!

I will make another visit to Isla in my future trips to Vegas.
