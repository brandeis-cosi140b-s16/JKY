Came here to grab lunch.  OMG, the line was wrapped clear around the place into the dinning area.  Kinda of crazy, but the line moves fast.  I ordered my usual, chicken burrito but togo.  

The chicken was a little more spicier than normal, but it was good.  

Cons:  parking sucks and getting out of the plaza sucks.
