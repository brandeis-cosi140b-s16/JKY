LOVE this place. taquitos are good, the tortas are phenomenal. Rice and beans to call your abuelita and brag about. $1 taco night is an event at my house. When family comes over, I recommend this place. Especially on late Friday nights.  Priced well and portioned very well. Best in the valley. Although, I am open to suggestions.
