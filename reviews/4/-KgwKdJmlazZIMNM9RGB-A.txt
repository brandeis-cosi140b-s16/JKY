This was my first time here and I must say this place is legit! I got the carne asada burrito and added guacamole and cheese. They did not add the cheese that I paid for, but the quality of the food was excellent. This is the reason for the 4/5 stars. Had they put the cheese on I would have easily given them 5 stars. Burrito, additions and a medium drink was $10 on a Friday. They have specials.... like Taco Tuesday... I'll be back for sure.
