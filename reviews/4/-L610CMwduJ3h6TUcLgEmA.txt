Our whole family loves Robertos! We have been frequenting their restaurant for over 13 years when they started at their first location. They have consistently provided a clean establishment & conveniently deliver when we feel like staying home. It's authentic, delicious, always fresh, high quality & hand made daily. We have never been disappointed & we were thrilled when they got a glowing feature on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives. I firmly disagree with any of these negative reviews on here. WE LOVE U ROBERTOS!
