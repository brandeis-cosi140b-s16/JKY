I thought I would stop by here for lunch because I have never had a Gordita before.  Well... actually... I have never eaten a gordita... ohh wait a minute.  Ok - I have never had a gordita at lunch time.... uhhh.  How do I put this?? I have never had the food product known as a gordita!

It is your basic quick serve Mexican style restaurant, but it has different menu options like Gorditas.  A gordita is similar to a pupusa, a thick corn tortilla stuffed with meat.  I ahd the chicharone, pork, and chicken mole.  The tortilla part is not very big, but it is stuffed generously.  

The pork and the mole had a lot of flavor.  The chicharone was a little plain.  There is a salsa bar with a few options.  Everything tasted better than your average quick serve place, overall it was really good food. 

The place is nothing fancy but it is a good place for quick cheap eats!
