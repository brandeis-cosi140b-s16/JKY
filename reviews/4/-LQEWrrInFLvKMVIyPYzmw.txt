The food here deserves a solid four stars. The restaurant itself is pretty old and grimy, but I come here to eat some good Mexican food, not for the ambiance. They have the best chips and salsa in the area, second only to Mango's (but that's 20 minutes away, vs La Fonda which is 5). I do find it annoying that they charge you extra if you want chips and salsa with your to-go order. Because of that I have only ordered to-go once, and will usually eat in the restaurant, even though I'm always by myself. I love crispy shredded beef tacos and so that's what I typically order here. They are quite good, but not even close to the best. I have to add their red sauce in a jar to the taco just to give it some more flavor. Still one of the better tacos I've had here in AZ, though. I'm from LA so I'm super picky about my Mexican food. I do recommend the tortilla soup here, it's pretty tasty! I like the oily broth based tortilla soup, not southwestern style, and this one it pretty authentic. I think they should add avocado to it though! Service has always been decent: attentive, quick, and polite. North Tempe/South Scottsdale doesn't boast much in terms of great Mexican food, and in my opinion, this is the best place in that area.
