Norm R. and I just had ourselves a mini UYE and He suggested we share an order of the Carne Asada Fries. We both ate till full. For $6.50 =)  I cleaned the plate.. Thanks Norm R. for turning me on to this place! This was a Mexican / American hybrid something like Chili Cheese Fries I have had at one of my favorite greasy American burger joints.... Only Waaaaaaaay way way . . Better!!!
