Came here with my wife, she got the bean and cheese burrito on a whole grain tortilla. It was a nice large portion and tasty. They accompanied it with a side of fresh tortilla chips and they have a salsa bar with a selection of 4 types of salsa which are all delicious too.

Quick service and great prices!
