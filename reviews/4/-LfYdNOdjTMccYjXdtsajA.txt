The ultimate hole-in-the-wall restaurant.The customers were Mexican, and they stared at us as if we were the only non-Mexican customers that had been there in years. And our Mexican GARDENER recommended this restaurant. I knew the food was going to be good.

It wasn't just good. It was GREAT. I had the chicken tacos. To die for. And the beans were fabulous. This is what I imagine authentic, Mexican home cooking to be like. Sadly, I've never had any, so if anyone wants to help me out in broadening my home cooking horizons, hook it up! I LOVED the food, but I HAD to take away one star for the greasiness. Ambiance isn't anything luxury for the snobs out there, but if you can get over that, it's totally worth the visit.
