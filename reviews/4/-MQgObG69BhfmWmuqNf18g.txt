In the tradition of Southern California's Filibertos, we have the new Federicos here in Scottsdale. Gotta' say- Very solid! We had a 2 for one combo coupon, so we got 3 combos and shared. Enchiladas were pretty good, but the 2 burrito (carne asada type meat) combo was fantastic. The 3 combo plates ended up being lunch, dinner, and snack for the 2 of us. The portions are HUGE here. I didn't really care for the carne asada fries, as I am not into the American version either: chili cheese fries (a pile of greasy mush, to me). It was prepared all right, just not my thing. The place really needs some decor, a TV, ANYTHING to liven it up a bit! It's very boring on the inside! They do have a few tables on the patio, and there is drive up service as well. As in other places of this sort, they have a fill your own salsa bar, with delicious & spicy red and green salsas. It'd be nice if they had 2 more flavors. Food is really good, portions are gigantic, so overall it gets 4 stars from me. Just needs some ambience... Tunes, TV, wall art, etc.
