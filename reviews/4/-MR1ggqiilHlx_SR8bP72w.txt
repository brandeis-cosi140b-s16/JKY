Torn between 3-4 stars, but have to give this place a 4.

Located right in front of our hotel, it's convenient. We were seated right away, and given 2 large baskets of tortilla chips for our party of 5. I really like how they give us our own bowl of salsa per person, double dipping time! The restaurant wasn't too crowded, so service was fairly good. I had just landed from SFO, so wanted to unwind with my jack and coke. Others ordered the huge frozen margaritas that were very tasty! Very addicting!

We ordered guacamole, which came in a huge molcajete, those stone looking bowls. Lots of guac but a bit bland for my taste, had to add salt to my portion. 

Flipped through their book of a menu, and everything is fairly cheap! I wanted variety so went for the chicken tamale, ground pork enchilada, and chile releno with refried beans and mexican rice. All this for $10! And the plate was huge!!! The enchilada was bleh, tamale was decent, but was blown away that their chile releno was so tasty. It's really hard to find a good one, but this chile not only had a kick to it, but lots of cheese.

Coworkers also all enjoyed their dishes for the most part. The food is good, but not out of this world. Towards the end of dinner, service was...gone. I waited 10 minutes for another jack and coke, and he totally forgot so had to ask another guy. It basically came as my dessert as we were all done. They do give a mini dessert to all, fried crispers with whipped cream on top and a bunch of cinnamon.

Decent tasting food and huge portions for a very low price.
