What a fantastic place! This was my first time and certainly not my last. Tacos are so tasty and enchiladas (chicken and ground beef) were YUMMY. Their chips and salsa are also good!

The service was top notch. In fact, it made my day. It was great to sit out on the patio with a cold beer and not feel rushed. Looking forward to another great meal there!
