Its a out of the way taco joint but worth the walk.  3 tacos for 7 buck and meat you want and toppings.  If it tuesday 2 tacos for 2 bucks.  Its very good and fast for people on the move but a nice sit down to relax.  Music playing all the time.  Like it a lot me and my wife make it a definite stop every time we are in vegas
