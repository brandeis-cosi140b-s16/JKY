Yum yum yum...
Got this delivered last night... While it may have been the most I have spent on delivery ($35), it was good food, especially considering it is fast and cheesy, greasy Mexican fare.
I got the cheese enchiladas and while they bordered on being too cheesy, I finished them quickly! They were really good.  My man got the burrito.  I don't remember what it was called but it was huge and packed with beef and he really enjoyed it.  We also got chips and dip and the bean dip stuff was really good, just wish we would've gotten more.  They also have really good guac and pico.
I will definately be ordering from here again!
