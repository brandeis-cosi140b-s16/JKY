This place's food is pretty dang awesome.

I ordered the "Rolled Taco Supreme" which is four (I think) rolled tacos piled high with cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and liberally topped with chopped, tasty carne asada chunks.  With a little pile of lettuce and a "superior grade" pico de gallo on the side.

The first time I had this, I literally INHALED IT.  It was that good.

My kids usually have the "rolled tacos with guacamole" plate and they dig on it.

Rivas' food is a step above the "'Ertos" places if you ask me.  And I've lived here 15 years and eaten at a lot of 'Ertos.

It's not fine dining by any stretch, but it's above average for the classification, and WAY good for a 24-hour joint.

Try it.  Go ahead.  Really.  :)
