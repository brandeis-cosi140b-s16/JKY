If you like real authentic Mexican food, Haciendas is the place to go! They have only been open for a couple of weeks but we have been serveral times now. One of my favorite dishes is the Mole Enchiladas and they also have a great salad with homemade blueberry vinegrette. Great Happy Hour menu as well!! Love Flight Night on Thursdays! We will be back:)
