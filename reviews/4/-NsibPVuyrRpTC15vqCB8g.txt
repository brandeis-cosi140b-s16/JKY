Well-run Mexican chain restaurant. Attitude of employees goes a long way here. They act like they actually enjoy serving food and drink to customers. Who wants to have delicious food served by grumpsters. Our clan had a long wait at the bar and even though only one of us was having alcohol (me!), the bartenders were omnipresent and friendly, handing out bountiful baskets of chips with salsa and making cherry Cokes for the little one. Decor and seating were above average, with a roaring gas fireplace and interesting art on the walls. I think the menu is perfectly fine and a bit more inventive than local chains. Brisket and taco-stand tacos are standouts. The guacamole tasted like fresh avocados and the lager beer was fresh. I usually run far away from chains but when in this part of town there isn't much choice. I'd recommend this place unless you absolutely hate Tex-Mex food, in which case I feel sorry for ya, buddy.
