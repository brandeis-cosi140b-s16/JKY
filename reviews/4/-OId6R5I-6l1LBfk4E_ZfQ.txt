Bibiano's was a good stop on our way home from Surprise tonight.  It is a little strip-mall based Mexican joint that is clean and simply decorated in the traditional Mexican restaurant fashion. My son was happy because they had the football game on TV. The service was excellent. 

The food was above average.  My daughter loved the flautas and enchiladas. Pork adovada got mediocre reviews from my hubby. And my carne asada was very good...good flavor and no tough bites.  Overall a very good experience.
