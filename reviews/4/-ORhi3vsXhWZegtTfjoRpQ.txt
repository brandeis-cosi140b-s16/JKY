I'm pretty sure this is the original Mad Mex, so it's almost like I'm not writing a review for a chain!

Upsides: Blue cornbread that will make your heart melt.  Half price after 11.  Generally awesome food.  Wacky fun wall art.  

Downsides: Loud.  Crowded.  Seating uncomfortably close to other tables.  Not enough menu options with queso.  And definitely skip their cheese dip for their nachos... it's pretty lame.

I always have a really tough time deciding what I want at Mad Mex, too.  The menu is cute (though bordering on obnoxious,) but I don't know if it's really laid out that well.  It might be a problem on my end, though... maybe I just suck at reading menus.
