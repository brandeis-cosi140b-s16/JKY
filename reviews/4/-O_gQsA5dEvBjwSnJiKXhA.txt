I live within a few miles of this place and have pretty much ignored it. This morning my place was too busy and I have to go out of town today. 
Chips and salsa were nothing to write about, I like good spicy salsa and this was nothing close to hot or spicy. Surprised me with all the staff and authenticity when you walk in. Code for hole in the wall. 
I ordered the #13, chile verde with eggs and hash browns. Wow, very tasty green chile, eggs and hash browns were great too. I got there at a good time because it got busy. You can tell they get a lot of regulars, and for good reason. Breakfast was filling and very good. I would come back here, yes that's if my other spot is too busy.
