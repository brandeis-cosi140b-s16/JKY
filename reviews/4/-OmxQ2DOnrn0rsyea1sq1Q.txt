Not bad :) Not bad :) I'm obsessed with Mexican grills.  Portion size was good.  Meat was good.  Guac was Fabu!  But I would still have to go to cafe rio and rank that my top pick, but I would definitely come back here.  The service was great!!  The dude at the counter was incredibly chipper.  I was happy to see how HIGH the ameba sneeze glass was which made it a little hard to hear them as they took my order, but I'll take that any day over having peeps highjacking my grub with their infected germs :) :)  Anyhoo, all in all, the black iced tea was delish, and I would like to request a larger offering of faux sweetener - splenda please :)
