Dined with a good friend of mine while in town, so the slow(ish) service was no bother. Actually, we had good service. They were on top of my need for water with lots of ice.

Lisa had the chile rellanos and she said they were good. The portion was large and she took about half home.

I got the chimichanga. It was a delight. The meat was done perfectly and was very flavorful and not at all bland. Usually my rice goes uneaten, but this rice was about the best Mexican rice I've ever had. The beans were as I like them; full of cheese. 

They have 2 sauces that come with the chips, one a chipotle, which I'm not a fan of, the other a spicy red which I slathered on top of my food.

I'm sort of shocked at the low stars this place has gotten. My experience was grand and that's no bull! (Matador; bull; get it?)
