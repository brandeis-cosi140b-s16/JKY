My girlfriend and I went here today for dinner and got the Cilantro Lime Salmon Burrito and Blackened Ono Burrito. They were both appropriate sized burritos (not gigantic like Chipotle's) and the fish was cooked to order. Both were more delicious than we expected--especially since they came with guacamole. We are locals so we come here often and their fish items on the menu never disappoint. 4 stars because the chips were nothing to write home about.
