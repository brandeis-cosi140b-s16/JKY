Wait staff was friendly, we were served very quickly and the menu/drink specials were explained well to us. Had a great margarita deal on Thursdays. Margaritas were good, a little sour so drinking more than one is hard but good for the first one. Love how you are able to mix the tacos, I tried the wood grilled chicken, shrimp, and calamari and all three were delicious, and I had a few leftovers.
