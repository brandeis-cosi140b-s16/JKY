This place is a favorite of mine and my little sis, a little haven for fresh mex-americano:)  

You can't go wrong with the pastor tacos, guacamole, salsa, and iced tea!  
The food is prepared very authentically, but very fresh--i love the pico de gallo they top the tacos with, and the mango salsa is fantastic!

Have to park around the corner sometimes when parking lot is full, but what are ya gonna do??  I love this place.  

There is also another one in central phx off 7th ave, better parking there...still good food!
