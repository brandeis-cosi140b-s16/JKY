This place sells some darn good tamales considering it is challenging to find places in Phoenix to buy them. You can pick them up at local Farmer's Markets during the week or pre-order them and pick them up at the store.

I am a vegetarian so I went for the Vegan one with corn, spinach, and mushrooms. It was pretty fantastic. My carnivore friend says the pork one is the best one out of the meat selection.

Make sure to have exact change if you stop into the store..and yes, it is slightly difficult to find. 

Buena suerte! :)
