I have had these guys swing by and drop off some burros on a couple of occasions and I was more than impressed!

Hot fresh tortilla wrapped goodness. Most recently I had them bring a carne asada burro and a bacon, egg, 'tater burro for the next day. They have a $15 minimum order for delivery (which I totally understand and think is fair) so ordering a couple things is needed...which is great cuz everything is delicious.  

Somehow when I started grubbing it was still steaming hot and fresh. BOMB flavors, salsa was good'n'spicy and I didn't have to leave the house?!?! yes please and thank you!
