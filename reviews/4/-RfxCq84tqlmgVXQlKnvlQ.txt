The carne was good, but not al carbon... As close to real Mexican Street tacos as I have found here in Phoenix. The tortillas however, excellent. Real hand made tortillas helped push this from an above mediocre meal to pretty darn good. We had carne asada tacos and the chicharron, my husband got the carne asada burro. The chicharron was better than the carne asada. All in all, pretty good. What would have put this over the top would be if they had really grilled the meat. In the end though, we'll be coming back for more.

Oh! One last thing, for 1 burro and 6 tacos, the bill was around  18 bucks. So not bad.
