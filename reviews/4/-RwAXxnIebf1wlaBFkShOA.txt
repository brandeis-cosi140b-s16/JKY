Just had lunch there for the first time. Loved it. I had a steak burrito, my husband had a chicken burrito. The meat was really good quality, tasted marinated and grilled, the veggies, salsas, pico, all great. You order at the counter, they make it right in front of you. Friendly staff, clean place, lots of different beverages, all priced fairly. We will be back!
