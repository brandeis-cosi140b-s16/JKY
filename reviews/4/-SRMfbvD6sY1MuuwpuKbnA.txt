Love the Forum at Caesars and after craving some mexican food, I was happy to find La Salsa. We started with a salsa mix of 4 different salsa's-all very good as well as some queso which was piping hot and very delicious. The fish taco's I had were really great. I liked the sauce, the grilled fish with cabbage and huge slices of fresh avocado. My husband had soft taco's, requested on flour tortilla versus corn. Came with three so he got one of each-chicken, carne asada and carnitas. All delicious. It was a lot of food and very tasty. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. The indoor seating is small but we didn't have to wait long. You can sit outside with some misters but wait for the summer months to end.
