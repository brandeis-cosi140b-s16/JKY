This is one of the better "Americanized" Mexican restaurants.  Famous for their fish tacos, which are very tasty (on Tuesdays, they are only $1.25!).  I've also tried their Burrito Especial - not bad, but can be dry at times.  They also have a salsa bar you can choose from.  Restaurant is clean, roomy, and service is quick.
