Sometimes you just got to get yourself your sausage burrito fix... and it can't just be any burrito it has to be los betos! So a friend once told me that in order to judge a good burrito it has to be greasy, messy, and stuffed. Yea, los betos is damn right greasy! Once you're halfway done with your burrito it get's really messy, and I think they really fill up those burritos. I gotta admit that we Phoenicians are spoiled with our many drive-thru mexican fast food places and I'm spoiled knowing the greasy goodness of los betos. This is the place to head to after a night of drinking in old town, or simply craving carnitas with the pico and guac. So, these are my recommendations at los betos - try the carnitas burrito coz it's damn greasy and good, and if you're extra hungry, the carnitas supreme with all the fixins. If you want a breakfast burrito, go for the salchicha (sausage) burrito... the eggs, cheese and sausage is mmmmmmmmmmmmm YUM YUM... and finish it off with some horchata or jamaica... oh heaven.
