We have been there twice and have been impressed both times.  By far the best mexican in madison.  We used to thoroughly enjoy a southwestern restaurant called Pasquals but their quality of food at Hillsdale has declined immensely over the past year.  Laredo is always consistent, efficient and tasty!!
