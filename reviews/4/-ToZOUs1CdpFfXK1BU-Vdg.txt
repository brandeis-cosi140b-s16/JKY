My first trip to the new location. Despite the parking issues I really prefer the old location. 
This new one is an open space and LOUD!!!!
You have to yell across the table to converse. This is the concept that many places use to attract the younger crowd although we boomers are a much larger market. 
  We had reservations but had to wait for a table. After making an ass of myself about this I was informed that a reservation only moves you to the head of the wait list when you show up. This used to be called "call ahead" whereas a reservation should hold you a table. It was a good thing we got there early on a Wednesday evening because at 730 when we left the line was out the door. 

  Thankfully our waitstaff was excellent as was the food!  chicken chimi for me and crab quesadilla for my bride.
