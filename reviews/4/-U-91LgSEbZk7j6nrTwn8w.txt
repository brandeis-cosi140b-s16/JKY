At least chipotle didn't disappointment me on this trip to Vegas! Food quality is consistently good (nothing off about the steak burrito), and the guy noticed immediately when the tortilla ripped when he was wrapping up my burrito and exchanged it for a new one. Would've been a pain to have started eating it and then realize the tortilla was ripped. Employees there are super friendly, I know the guy was probably being polite when he said I looked nice but hey, if someone gives you a sweet compliment as you're buying lunch it's an added bonus and makes me feel good so why not? :) 

Located inside the Fashion Show Mall next to a few other food places (Panda Express is right next to it), it's a convenient location within walkable distance from many hotels including the Riviera. Although packed, we were still able to find seats!
