Great atmosphere, great service, amazing margaritas!

It was just 2 of us and we made a reservation about 2 hours before dinner (dinner at 6:45) which was a smart choice.  It was definitely busy on a Friday night.  We sat upstairs and the service was fantastic!

Highly recommend the guacamole and queso to start with!  Enchiladas were good; however, the rice and black beans weren't so good.  Overall, great meal!
