Over all it's not a bad place. It was clean and the staff were fast and friendly. Food is moderately priced and tastes pretty good. My wife liked it a lot more than I did. She is vegetarian and they do have good options for that. 

With that being said, I personally like the taste I get from similar food by caf√© Rio. This was a convenient place to gab a bite to eat. If in the area and hungry, stop in :-)
