Cute place!!! My husband and wanted a sweet treat and this was in our neighborhood. Lots of people enjoying themselves. I am not sure what I got...Sambores I think. Fresh mango ice with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yummy!  Wes got a strawberry sundae...which was gone in 5 seconds!! Check it out for a place to beat the heat.
