Friday night dinner with my Husband and Son.  We were seated right away. I had the combo plate with a cheese enchilada and chicken tamale. I substituted more rice for the beans. I also had a regular frozen margarita. Everything was very good and tasted fresh. We had pretty good service. I asked for a side of guacamole which was forgotten twice but I finally got it. All in all we had a very good experience.
