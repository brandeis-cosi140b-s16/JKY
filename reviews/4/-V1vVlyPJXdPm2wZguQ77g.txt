They had a buffet when I came here for lunch. Good selection - my favorite was the red chile beef. There wasn't as much flavor as I was expecting, so I dock one star for that. The waitstaff was very friendly and attentive, though the restaurant was far from full. The best part was that the buffet includes guacamole - that can cost up to $3 on the East Coast!
