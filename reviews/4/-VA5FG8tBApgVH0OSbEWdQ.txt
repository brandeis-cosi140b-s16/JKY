I have lived in Maricopa for more than 4 years and have driven by Tacos N' More numerous times but never ventured in until recently.  Of course, we again chatted with one of the owners, Mercy who was just a terrific hostess and down-to-earth great person.  Since then I have patronized them several times and the food is priced reasonably and TASTES GREAT!
