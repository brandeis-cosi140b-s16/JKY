Love this place! The Deer Valley location is 2 minutes from my job and it's a good go to for breakfast. I always order the egg and bacon burrito and I'm always super satisfied. I don't even know how many eggs or how much bacon they put in it. All I know is it's fabulously delicious. 

The restaurant itself is a hole in the wall, not a place you would go for a sit down dinner or on a date. The drive through is convenient and it's obvious the food is made fresh to order because you'll sit there and wait for your good forever. But it's worth it! Freshly made food combined with 24/7 hours and super cheap prices makes this a good alternative to your 'traditional' fast food breakfast. I can get much more food here for the same (or less) than what I would pay at McDonald's across the street for a satisfying meal.

The employees are all very friendly, which is awesome.
