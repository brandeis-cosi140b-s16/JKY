Great 'street' tacos.  After cruising around downtown, I decided to finally stop here for a quick dinner/snack.  Three tacos and a lemonade came to $7.50.  I ordered the Carne Asada, Pork and Fish tacos.  I could only eat two at that time.  I tried the pork and the fish.  Both very good!  The carne asada (several hours later) was also very good, and probably would have been great had it been fresh and warm.  No frills, limited seating.  The owner (??) Andy was super nice and chatty.  I've driven by at lunch, and seen the place packed.  Dinner last night was not the case.  Food still seemed fresh, though.  I will be back (wish they were open later, though)

Just had lunch here again today!  The fish tacos were actually better then I remember!  The pork was also very good, juicy and tender.  I was less impressed with the carne asada, though.  Still, a good experience, and still highly recommended.  They would get 5 stars if they had alcohol and were open later...
