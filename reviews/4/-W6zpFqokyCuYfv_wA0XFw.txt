The sign proclaiming "best breakfast burrito" lured me in.

"So you have the best breakfast burrito?" I said to the dude at the counter.

"Well," said he, "we haven't tested it against all other burritos."

I assured him this was okay, as I wasn't doing a scientific study. I ordered the chorizo burrito, which is $4.40.

It is a large burrito, really more a burro, containing chorizo and scrambled eggs. No nonsense with onions or tomatoes -- you got your chorizo, you got your eggs. This is how it should be. The tortilla tasted fresh, and the chorizo/egg ratio was generously tilted toward chorizo, though the chorizo had a few odd gristly bits. As served, it was a better-than-average breakfast burrito... and with a drizzle of the salsa verde, it was a truly fine breakfast burrito. If I lived down in this neck of the woods, I'd be back to try more flavors.

The place is a little dive hole-in-the-wall in a rural plaza where there are hay bales in the parking lot and the shop next door sells live chickens. You can get the free Gilbert newspaper from the rack out front and entertain yourself with the police blotter and the local restaurant inspection grades.
