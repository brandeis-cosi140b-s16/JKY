I've only ever had breakfast here so I can't speak to the rest of the menu on any given day.  That being said this was the 3rd time.  I love their Chorizo and eggs, flavors o'plenty.  Yes I am a fan and will continue to be.  The place is very clean and the servers gave me all the attention I could possible stand.  Parking as with any downtown eatery could be a little problematic but quite doable if you allow enough time.  This is one of those favorite places that you go to again and again when your coming from out of town and you don't want to eat at a chain establishment and want some local fair... I travel a fair amount an you can't get a breakfast like this in the mid-west or back east.  It's always truly enjoyable.
