We were excited to try this new place which was to be the third restaurant in this location. If word travels, and it will, it will be Milagro Gills permanent residence.  

We started out with the Cadillac Margarita which was excellent. The chips and salsa aren't complimentary but once you taste the fire roasted tomato salsa, you forget about that. We ordered the Grilled Chicken Balsalmic Salad, Steak Tacos, and Pork Tacos. The salad was fresh and the chicken amazingly tender and flavorful and the cilantro added to the lettuce gave it a nice flavor. 

Both guests with the tacos were impressed with their flavorful meat, but disappointed with the size of them. If you are familiar with the size of Chipoltes tacos, they are actually smaller. So needless to say, they were looking for more food as the tacos didn't come with anything else. Really our only complaint, and I would have given 5 stars had it not been for this. 

Desert was the Chocolate Churros which we couldn't get enough of! They are small crispy Churros with chocolate and cinnamon sugar and you have caramel and an eggnog type mousse to dip them in. So delectable!

We will absolutely be going back and we were pleased to find that our out of town guest thought it was a great choice as well. Can't wait to try out the patio come October.
