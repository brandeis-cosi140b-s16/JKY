The best thing about this place is their salsa/salad bar. Everything was clean and fresh. They even had little to go containers for the salsa if you got your food to go. We ordered fajitas and ate it there. The fajitas was better than I was expecting since the photos didn't look that good. They served us and 3 other groups after mid night even though they close at 12, which was nice. I liked this place and I will definitely come back!
