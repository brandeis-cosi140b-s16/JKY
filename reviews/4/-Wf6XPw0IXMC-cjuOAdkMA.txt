UPDATE:  La Comida does not allow separate checks now.

Overall, nothing about my rating changes (still 4-stars), but a quick update to my previous review:  my last visit for lunch was last week with co-workers.  Five of us went in and before any orders were placed we told our waiter we wanted separate checks (one couple, plus three individual checks).  We were told "we're not allowed to do separate checks anymore".  I've been to restaurants that won't allow separate checks for parties over a certain size, but we were a group of five asking for four checks.  Separate checks were never a problem in the past.  Not allowing a small group to have separate checks suggests a willingness to inconvenience the customer for the convenience of the restaurant.  I still love La Comida, but be prepared to divide the bill yourself if you go with a group.
