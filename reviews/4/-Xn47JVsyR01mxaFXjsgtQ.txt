Right next to my favorite Dutch Bros so I wanted to give this place a shot. I got 4 tacos because people said they were really small and they were actually. I was still hungry after 4 and I'm an average sized male. Kinda felt sad because that was like 15$ right there. So I didn't wanna get more. The tacos are amazing the pricing is a little high for the small size. Still a good place to eat at.
