The chicken in the tacos is shredded and high quality and the corn tortillas are amazing.  Love their warm chips and thick salsa and the guacamole holds its own with the best restaurants in town due to the freshness and simple, clear flavors.  The churro dessert was also a fun if somewhat heavy finish to a very reasonably priced meal.  

They don't speak completely fluent English so be patient. It will pay off. The menu has pictures, which means you could even get away with pointing and smiling!  Booth seating is super cozy and the bathrooms are clean.  House of Enchiladas rocks!
