Natural margaritas... bingoooooooooooo. They make them from fresh limes instead of the standard pre-mixed margarita mix. They're not bitter or anything like that, in fact they're extremely refreshing.

We've lived nearby for a couple of months but haven't tried this place until now. The outside looks a little intimidating if you don't think you're very good at speaking Spanish, but I couldn't have been more wrong. Great staff and the salsa was amazing. They actually brought out whole jalepenos when we asked to spice up the salsa... I'm a customer for life now.
