This is certainly not good news for my waistline that 3 Amig's has now opened in my neck of the woods.....not good at all.  I've already gone 3 times and they've only been open 2 weeks:-)  I was so excited to see that 'opening soon' sign.  The food is just as good as the central avenue location and I've even tried a few new dishes but I still love the enchiladas.  One of the nights I dropped in was a Friday and they had live music.....sweet!  I am so in love with this place, it's the perfect replacement for that awful Loco Lime that did the area a favor and closed.......
