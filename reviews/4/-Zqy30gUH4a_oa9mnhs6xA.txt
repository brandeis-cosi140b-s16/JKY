We loved this place when it was up the street.  I thought they had closed for good and was so happy to find them again!  Sadly, i didn't know they had moved for over 2 years.  2 years without their wonderful cheese/beef dip!  Went back for a pick up order today of super chimichanga carne asada, and it was one of the best chimi's I have ever had, with fresh diced red tomatoes on top and guacamole!  We will definitely be going back to this one every time we get the urge for Tex Mex food.  (I was born in LA, so it is difficult to compare since back west the Mexican restaurants were true Mexican with more heat and usually better guacamole.  I even have eaten street vendor beef tacos in Baja California and in Mexican restaurants in Caborca, MX, and most USA Mexican is Tex Mex.)  But still berry, berry good ;-)
