I love this place! Every time I come here, there is no wait, the staff is very friendly and I am always happy with my meal! Our last visit our waiter was very nice and sweet with my little boy and even gave us a coupon code from online to save us a few bucks on our meal! He was very nice and went out of his way to help us, that doesn't happen much these days! My taste buds go bonkers for their jalapeno cream cheese (fendido) sauce! It's cream cheese sauce with a kick of jalapenos, makes any Mexican dish ZING! Whenever I am in the mood for Mexican food, this is the place I think of first! Mmmmmmm delicioso!!!! 

This place is good if you want Mexican food and want to watch the game, for they have a full bar section away from the dining part, or if you and your family or friends would like a nice meal, they have the dining section away from the bar that you can sit at.
