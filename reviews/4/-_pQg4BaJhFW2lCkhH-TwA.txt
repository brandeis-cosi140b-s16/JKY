When I don't know what to do for dinner and want something quick, but healthy, this is where I go. I usually get a salad (all are great) or the skinless chicken breast combo with veggies and a side salad. The chicken is always delicious and the service is great. Every time I've gone, the cashier is suuuper friendly. The drive thru is always packed when I go, so I just pop inside, which is usually faster. Either way though, it's served up fast!
