Excellent Mexican food with lots of flavor. I appreciated the vegetarian option and enjoyed the spinach enchiladas.  Very nice people working there, all were helpful, and the service was good.  Casual atmosphere and an interesting spot to see and watch the surrounding activities in this truly fun western town.

I look forward to my next visit to try a few other choices on the menu.
