This was my first exposure to New Mexico cuisine.  I was really impressed.  

I had the New Mexico sausages for an app and the Carne Adovada roasted pork shoulder in red chile sauce.  Both were really, really good.  Complex spicing and good heat level, tastey but not over burning.  This was both a unique and delicious experience.  And a learning experience too.  I'd go back in a second.

The service was good.  Both the hostess and waitress were stunningly good looking in a "recently graduated from ASU" sort of way.
