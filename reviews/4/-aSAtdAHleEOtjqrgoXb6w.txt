This is a nice little Mexican place-  the food is good and pretty authentic.  I really like the chili rellenos, and the make your own combination platters.  The staff is friendly and the portions are huge.  There is a mariachi band on Friday nights that is great but they are REALLY loud, so don't go on Friday's for a quiet evening out.
