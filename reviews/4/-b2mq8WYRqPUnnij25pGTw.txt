I pass by The Stand a couple times a week, but the missus isn't a big fan of burgers so I normally have to suffer a burgerless meal when we're out and about. I know, it's pretty terrible. Today I'm off work and flying solo, I finally take my chance and wander in. I'm so very glad I did.

I was immediately greeted by the friendly girl behind the counter, and she took my order deftly. I was pleasantly surprised to find my food ready mere minutes after ordering, and my special-ordered burger (no sauce, tomatoes, pickles; add bacon and onions) was exactly right. The patties were cooked well but still juicy, the lettuce was fresh, and the onions were perfectly grilled. The strawberry lemonade was tasty and just the right amount of tart, but I do feel like they added way to much ice to my cup before pouring. The fries looked a tiny bit underdone, but were still tasty and delicious. I asked for a couple sides of their hot salsa for the fries, it was exactly the right combo. 

I'll be back, and I'll even try to sway the missus with promises of what I'm hoping are tacos just as tasty as the burger I ate today. Hooray for another awesome small business successfully making my tummy happy!
