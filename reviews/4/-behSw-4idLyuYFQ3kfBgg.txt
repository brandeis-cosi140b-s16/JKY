Pretty neat place, with a lot of unique dishes.  The tacos al pastor were excellent, very flavorful, very fresh all around.  All of the flavors were somehow both powerful and not overwhelming, a great balance.  Service was very good and friendly.  When you tell them you haven't visited before, they give you good useful information about the menu, options, sides, and the like.

The only down-side was that my wife specifically asked about one dish being spicy or not, and she was told it wasn't.  But she's very sensitive to spicy foods and found that it was too much for her.  However they offered to take it off the tab as soon as she mentioned it.

I'm a salsa fiend, and found them to be far better than average.

Prices were reasonable.  Not super cheap, not expensive.
