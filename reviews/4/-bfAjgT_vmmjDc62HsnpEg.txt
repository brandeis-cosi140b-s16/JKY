Authentic as it gets north of the border.  Little cafe that doesn't try to be anything it is not.  The waitress was lovely and nice, even as her daughter was in the table in front of me doing her homework eating soup.  I ordered the chicken burro and it was fresh.  Flour tortilla was hand made and not store bought... spanish style rice was homemade.  salsa was fresh and home made.  Refried beans are def. NOT from a can.  

The only thing that I believe was store bought were the chips... but they were amazing!~

Food was great.  9$ for a plate

Tip-  This place is not in a well known area .  It is somewhat hard to see and find, even with my gps on my phone, I had trouble.  There are no other businesses around. 

Seriously, some of the best Mexican food I have had in a while.  I am a pretty tough rater, so 4 stars from me is phenomenal!
