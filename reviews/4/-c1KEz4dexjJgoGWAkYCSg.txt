Cheap n cheerful. Good food with a simple but interesting menu. I'm a huge mole fan, and found their mole poblano (served over a la carte chicken enchiladas) very good but a bit too sweet. Tasty though! Also the ambiance very bright with fluorescent lights. Their salsa is rich and good, but the chips taste bagged--not bad though. Excellent friendly service. Very cool metal plates! Stop in when you're in this part of Vegas. Oh and my meal price? Under $8.00 with no drink.

Also--note that if you're eating in, they have table service with menus. The design of the place will make you think you're supposed to order at the counter (which you also can).
