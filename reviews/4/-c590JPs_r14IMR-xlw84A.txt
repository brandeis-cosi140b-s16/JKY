Good food from southern Mexico.  It's not your uncle's Mexican food.  Order at the counter, and then table service.  Relaxed atmosphere, including outdoor seating --but on hard benches.  I've gotta say "authentic," even though it was 40+ years ago that I was in Oaxaca.  A beer & wine license is "coming soon."
