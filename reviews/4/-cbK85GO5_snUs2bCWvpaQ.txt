Ate here while staying at the Red Rock -- it's on the casino level of the hotel. OK, so I'll say up front that I was already a little drunk when we got here... but it was still good.

The wait staff was attentive... perhaps a little too much. I felt a little rushed through my meal. I'm a slow eater, especially when it comes to fajitas and talking to my friends.

The sangria was good,  but not the best I've ever had. 

But still, 4 stars for a solid plate of food and good drink.
