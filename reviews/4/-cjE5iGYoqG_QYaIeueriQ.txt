I always visit this place every time I'm back home from school. The food is very tasty and the restaurant is clean. I usually order shredded beef tacos or the shredded beef chimichanga, and I am usually always very pleased. The only slight con about this place is that their prices are quite a bit higher than more Mexican restaurants that are a bit more authentic.
