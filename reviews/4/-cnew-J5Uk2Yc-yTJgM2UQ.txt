I know this place is still pretty new,  but I was really amazed by how clean and bright the decor was.  The staff was very friendly and cheerful,  and helped me navigate the menu with ease.   The Carne Asada burrito I had was also top notch,  as was the Carne Asada Vampiro my wife ordered.  However, the salsa served on the side was kind of bland,  and the portions on everything were small for the money.   Overall,  I really liked this place,  and it's definitely someplace I'll recomend to friends and family
