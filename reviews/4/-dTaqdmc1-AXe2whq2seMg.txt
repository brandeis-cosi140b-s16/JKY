I'd really like to give this place 3.5 stars, but I decided to be generous and round up to 4 since I'd gladly go back again.

I had the chicken enchiladas with Verde sauce which came with rice and re-fried beans. I also ordered a side of guacamole. All of it was pleasantly average, no complaints.

The chips and salsa that they bring out were OK. The  salsa was the soupy kind some places make, instead of the more pulpy/thicker sauce-like stuff I prefer.

Service was nice and I felt well taken care of. This place met my basic standards for decent Mexican food for American eaters. I'd go back again.
