Anita's was recommended by the host of our hotel along with a couple of other restaurants so after attending the morning session of the Bluegrass Festival we went here for lunch.  I have seen some negative comments but we found the food quite good. The chips were fresh and we liked the salsa and they were complimentary.  Someone on a previous review said they charged for this chips but not while we were there.  I had a taco salad and my husband a burrito and tamale.  We liked it all.  The service was friendly however, it took a little longer than most Mexican restaurants we have been to but it was very busy.  It was a Saturday at  lunchtime.
