At 2am this place seems like the best idea ever! The line can be a bit of a deterrent and the line barely moves... but if you're going at 2am, you probably don't realize how slow time is moving, so you'll be fine. One of the few places that makes a legit Chimichanga and that's why I go so often. Maybe I should try it sober or for lunch to really test this theory.

But yes, drunk food or munchies - this place is a winner in my book. Call a cab from here, wait in line, get your meal (eat it) and your cab will be there around the time it's all over (give or take). It's like clockwork.
