Went here last week with a co worker and this was really good! Like other users have posted it's a mom and pop Chipotle, but better. I had a chicken burrito with sour cream, guac, chicken, rice, pinto beans and the mild salsa on the side. The chicken was very tender and had a great flavor. The staff and owner were very friendly and very helpful in explaining the pricing, combo's, etc. Will be back again very soon.
