I hadn't been here for a couple of years but remembered how good it was the other day when I passed by.  I was dubious of some of the reviews based on my experience, but hey, that was like I said a couple of years ago.

What my girlfriend and I experienced was fantastic food, wonderful service and just as I remembered it, a great atmosphere.

I had a tasty margarita, just the classic.  We ordered the guacamole to compliment our chips and salsa; which by the way comes with two salsas, one that is chunky and sweet with a small hint of heat, the other seemed to be tomatillo based and was equally good.  The guacamole was just as I remembered, chunky and delicious.  My girlfriend tried the Enchiladas de pollo.  She loved the flavor of the smoked chicken.  I had Puerco en Chipotle, which is slow roasted pork in a tomatillo-chipotle sauce.  It was darn good.  I didn't eat to much of my sides because I had consumed so much guacamole and the pork was just too good!

We were there on a Saturday night about 1900 and were seated immediately on the patio.  Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.

Overall fantastic, just as I remembered.  Sure you may have to park on the street (we did); no worries, it's a great place.

Â¡Buen provecho
