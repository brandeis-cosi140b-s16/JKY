First time at this location & the service was great! Someone is at the door greeting you when you walk in asking if it's your first time there & directing you where to go. The food came out fast & when you eat in they bring it to you. The staff is constantly checking to make sure your okay & if you need drink refills. Nice place for lunch or dinner and prices are very reasonable.
