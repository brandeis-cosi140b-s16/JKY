I tried my first torta years ago at a Baja Fresh and fell in love with Mexican sandwiches.  Surprisingly enough, Baja Fresh had extremely good tortas and most of the other places I went to couldn't compare.  Man Versus Food introduced me first to the original location in Phoenix and I couldn't get enough of the place.  Then my prayers were answered last year when a location opened up near home in Tempe.  Hallelujah and pass the chips and salsa.

The menu is slightly overwhelming, but the food, from the salads to the beans to the wide selection of tortas is of very good quality.  Yes, I love this particular LRDLT because it's close to home, but more importantly it's an actual restaurant that provides chips and spicy salsa (unlike the Phoenix location) when you first sit down.  Service is friendly and it's fast.  I think I may have gotten my Del Rey Torta before I ordered it.  That's fast service!  Pork, hot dogs, egg, ham and cheese and I don't know what else all in a sandwich?  Yup, that's the magnificently tasty Del Rey.  

I highly recommend this place.  If you're a fan of quality Mexican food at extremely reasonable prices and you're not sure if you want some seafood, a salad or a torta, LRDLT can satisfy a variety of cravings.

**Tip 1**

This place serves booze!!!  I love the aguas frescas at the Phoenix location, but without booze, I was left missing that extra something.  I need miss out no longer

**Tip 2**

Do you like grilled veggies like it do?  Order the side of grilled sliced onions and jalapenos and the cucumber slices and radishes.  Oh the humanity!!!
