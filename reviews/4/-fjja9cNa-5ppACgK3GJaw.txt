We ate here for the first time last night, thanks to the Yelp search!  Happy to find it on our way back from the outlets in Anthem.  We weren't at all sure what to expect, but it is as everyone says.  
We were greeted by the friendly staff and redeemed our free chips and salsa for checking in on Yelp.
Everything was Flavorful and simple.  The chicken tacos were fantastic!  Just meat, lettuce, cheese, and a few tomatoes -- nothing fancy, and yet completely satisfying.  
We sat in the outdoor area and enjoyed the cool evening.
We will definitely be back!
