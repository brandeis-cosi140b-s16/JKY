This is one of the few places open 24 hours near my place. I've had a hit/miss love/hate relationship with other Roberto's in LV so I was expecting the same for this location, but this place has more better days than bad. 

I appreciate some standards and consistency because not all late night people are drunk as fuck....I'm just a night person who is hungry. I've gone quite a bit since moving to this area a year ago, and have had only a few times where the food was just okay, but most of the time it's good and the rare occasion it is quite yummy. 

I normally go for carnitas or adobada burritos, chorizo&eggs, supernachos or rolled tacos. I don't delve that often from the favorites, but the other offerings I've had are not bad at all. Only thing I won't order again is the tortas....wasn't toasty or dense enough bread to withstand the wet guacamole, meat and pico in it...big soggy mess. 

 There are tables even though this is in a gas station's convenience store. Decent for a quick, late night dinner or when you've been hanging out with Mr. Sauce too much.
