SuperMex is one of those good, authentic, Mexican restaurants and has always been consistent when I've dined with them. I've tried several items, but for some reason, always go back to the simple bean and cheese burrito. Their beans are what I would expect from a Mexican restaurant, not like the "out of the can" garbage that most Mexican restaurants out here seem to serve. 

The atmosphere is nice...kind of dark, but feels like your south of the border on vacation. While in the restaurant, you forget there's a busy city outside and just enjoy the food, atmosphere, and the company you're with.
