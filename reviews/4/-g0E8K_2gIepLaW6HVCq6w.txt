I have not been here in years. I was very happy and excited to find that it is still as good as I remembered. I had a green chili burrito. It was a man's man sized burrito. It was packed with meat. I did not need to order sides, as this was very filling. The habanero salsa was just like Nana made back in the day. Good stuff. I left with a full tummy and my eyes rolling in the back of my head. Yummy. You have to try it.
