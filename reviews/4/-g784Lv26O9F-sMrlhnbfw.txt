Came here tonight with some friends and so glad we did! It wasn't a busy night for them, I don't know if it's just because it's a weekday or in a bad location. 

But anyways, service was great the entire time we were there. No complaints at all, and thanks to our waiter for being so patient and giving us recommendations. We got 5 rolls for 5 people and we were stuffed. Here's what we got: (I might have forgotten some names...)

Guamuchilito Roll- SO GOOD!
Gila Monster Roll- Very good, too rich to eat the whole roll by yourself though
Mileno Roll- Ehh...It's alright. Didn't know what I was eating really, and too cheesy
Vegas Roll- SO GOOD!
Mexican Roll- Good, a little spicey

The Vegas and Guamuchilito were my favorite tonight!!! MMM yummy rolls :)

Their credit card machines wasn't working, so they had to call it in, so it took a while for them to check us out, but we weren't in a hurry anyways. Also, it would be nice if they offer happy hour..I would go much more often! :)

I would definitely recommend this place! Go give it a try!
