To be fair, I was pretty hungry at the time but the salsa with the chips was really good. I ordered a carnitas burrito w/out really reading the full description. It had sweet potato puree in it which is some evil genius sh**. I work at a burrito place and kind of have a thing for trying burritos. This was defo the most interesting/memorable one I've ever had. It took a while to make, but when it came out it was like a perfect temp. Just overall very solid. I've been to a ~5 places in Madison that make burritos and this is #1 w/ El Jalapeno on the west side close #2
