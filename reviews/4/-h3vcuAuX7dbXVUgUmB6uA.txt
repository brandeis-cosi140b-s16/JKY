How can you beat tacos for $1.25 and burritos for $2.50 Monday thru Wednesday. The tacos that I get are the shredded beef along with the shredded beef burrito or a green chili burro. 

The small street tacos are pretty good also and there is a special 5 for $5,99. 

I love the breakfast burritos here,  generally get the country burrito with potatoes or the the chorizo burrito which is my favorite but unfortunately my stomach doesn't do well.

If you want inexpensive quick good Mexican  food you can't beat the price.

Is there better Mexican food that this probably but for something quick to you can't beat the price.

Will keep coming here again and again.
