When I visit my brother and him family in Vegas they always rant and rave about Roberto's. My fiance and I decided to try it (since he is an authentic part mexican). I ordered the enchillada and taco plate. Overall pretty good! I was starving so anything that came into my path would get demolished. It was pretty clean which is one of my biggest fears of any place I eat. The food was a little oily but what am I thinking?!?! It's mexican food! Very tasty and friendly to your wallet. A must try.
