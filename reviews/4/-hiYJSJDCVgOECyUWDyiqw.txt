Tried this place for the first time. I am a big Chipotle fan, and will probably remain a Chipotle fan. This place was pretty good, just not as good as others. The enchilada style is kind of cool, but this place is trying to gain a buck around every corner. Their burritos are expensive as it is, then they add extra for things like sour cream or making it enchilada style and the drinks are pricey as well. The steak was burnt, but the pork was sweet and very tasty. The tortilla's are sub par compared to Chipotle's as well. The rice isn't as tasty either. You might be thinking, why did they get a four then. Well the food was good enough and plenty enough. The service was fine, not much they could do for fast food mexican restraunt. They had a lot of choices for your drink. Lots of interesting teas, lemonade, and all your standard sodas.
