I'm going solid 4 stars, but with a caveat....:)

The chips were hot and crispy - 4.5 stars.
The "hot"salsa was nicely done - 4.5 stars.
The "green" salsa was one of the best I've had - 5 stars.

The show-buster which gets 6 stars is the "Spicy Chicken Soup."  I read the review of this soup in the New Times 2007 "Best Of..." and have to agree that it's one of the better chicken soups around .

Perfectly salted (meaning not overly salty) and with the right amount of pepper.  Nice big chunks of obviously 100% "REAL" chicken breast (no fillers, nothing fake about it ) and zucchini and whole baby carrots.  Sprinkled with a touch of corn and rice and small slivers of onion.

Very tasty combo of flavors. Hits the spot on a cold 50 degree day.

The caveat?

My other friend had the lunch combo with a taco and a cheese enchilada, refried beans and rice.  Absolutely nothing special or very tasty about any of the stuff on his plate.  Bland.  Boring.  Cheap-looking and cheap-tasting.

So if you are in the mood for some good, decently flavored chicken soup, and some above-average chips and salsa, give it a try.

If you're gonna order a combo meal, I'd say take your business elsewhere.
