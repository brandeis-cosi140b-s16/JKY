Surprised about how good this place was. Had the macho burrito which had carne asada, poblano chiles, refried beans and sour cream. It was awesome.......and the tortilla was really good too. 

Also tried the cheese enchiladas and although they were pretty tasty, they were a bit too salty for my taste. 

The little salsa bar was good and the green, tomatillo sauce was great. I will definitely be coming back.
