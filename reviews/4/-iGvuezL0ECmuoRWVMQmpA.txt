As did others we drove by the first time but the two room cafe lived up to its best Mexican restaurant rating for the past five years by the AZ Republic.  During the day the guacamole with olive oil, vinegar, onions, cilantro & pomegranate seeds is not made at the table and includes delicious (not calorie free) topopos (round, fried chip like tortillas). For a side salad we had an unusually tasty spinach salad with a hint of sweet & spicy vinaigrette and toasted pecans, roquefort, apples and slow roasted tomatoes. For the entre we had  Enchiladas Suizas (Mexico City style) with chicken and tomatillo cream sauce which fit our mild taste buds.  Cafe Barrio is a step up in a culinary experience from our usual default Mexican restaurant of choice, (i.e., Macayos)  and would definitely be worth a repeat in the future.
