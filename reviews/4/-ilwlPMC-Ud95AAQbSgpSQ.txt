I didn't really want to eat here when I first drove by to be honest .    But , my family decided to go and I went along.....I was greeted extremely well at the entrance and immediately felt comfortable.   Then I ordered a number 22.   I have to say this place is a great place to go if you are starving ! The plate was HUGE!!! I was so stuffed and satisfied.    Also its nice to get well cooked rice and refried beans.    That actually have taste.   I would have liked everything a little spicier , but I'm kind of a spice head.   All together I would say I would go again.
