All that kept this from a five-star review was their rather weak chips and salsa.  Otherwise, great service (both times with different servers in a two-week period), great margaritas and really good food.  I had fish tacos from the lunch menu during my last visit, and they were very tasty (and a bit spicy).  My wife had shredded beef / chicken enchiladas.  The time before, I had flautas and my wife had the pollo asado dish.

I had mentioned that it was my wife's birthday, and when we were finished, they brought out a big-enough-for-two-people helping of deep fried ice cream, on the house.

If in the area, we would definitely return here for lunch or dinner.
