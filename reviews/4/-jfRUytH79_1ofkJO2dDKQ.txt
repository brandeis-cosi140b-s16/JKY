The White Salsa is the name of this restaurant in English.  With that said this is a very "American" style Mexican restaurant, if that makes sense. Not very authenic, but this should not steer you away from this place in the slightest.

Located in a somewhat boring strip mall like the rest of Phoenix suburbia. This place is neatly decorated and super clean, which I appreciate. The owners and trained staff seem to take pride in this place by its appearance.

There are many choices of entrees, combos, and ala carte items to choose from with appropriately matched prices. Each dish I've had here has been delivered promptly, hot, very tasty, and always with a smile.  I think my only drawback here is the salsa bar, there are several basic choices offered, but would like to see more flavorful options.
