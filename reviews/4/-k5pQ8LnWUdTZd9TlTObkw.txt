In Short: Awesome food, one of the best places for authentic mexican food in the valley.

I've been going here for a while and I've never been disappointed.  It looks a bit sketchy from the outside but once you walk in, you're going to be pretty happy.  

Before you start the meal they'll bring a heap of fresh tortilla chips and two salsas.  I find the green one too sweet and the red one with pineapple lacks a real kick.  If you ask them they'll bring two other varieties one is about medium hotness and the other one is the habenero salsa.  Be careful with that one, it's really hot, but I find it if you mix that with the green salsa, it's pretty damn good.  

I love their enchiladas, the monterrey enchiladas being my favorite.  They have massive burritos and chimichangas too, can't go wrong with most of the items on the menu.  It's one of the only places in the valley with a decent horchata, there's a just a hint of cinnamon, making it near perfection.  Definitely save room for some flan, it's so creamy and delicious, perfect way to cap off a spicy dinner.
