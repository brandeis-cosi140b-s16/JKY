This place is great, it's right off of Mill Ave and besides having awesome chips and salsa, their tacos are huge. I only need one to fill me up but I always want more! The atmosphere is cool and I love sitting out on the patio . I get the breaded fish tacos, which is what I get at pretty much every taco joint and they are delicious!
