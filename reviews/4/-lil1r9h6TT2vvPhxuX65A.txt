I loved this restaurant! I'm trying to figure out if they are owned by the same group that runs Rojo in Minneapolis; from the menu to the sticky rice to the interior to the glassware they are identical.

We started with some guac which was fabulous. I ordered the fish tacos with double the sticky rice because it's THAT good. The slaw on the tacos were great, perfect serving (you get 3 small ones) and the rice is better than any dessert.

I thought the prices were fair considering the portions. We'll definitely be back!
