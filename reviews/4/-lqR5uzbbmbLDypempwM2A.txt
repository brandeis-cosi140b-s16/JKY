This is my go to spot for Mexican street tacos. I have to show some restraint every time I come here. On multiple occasions I've put away double digit tacos. If you're able, coming here at non peak times is your best bet, because it can get crowded in the parking lot and in the restaurant lines. Having some taco eating partners to stand in separate lines and order will also make life a little easier for you.

If you'd like to get away from the standard chicken and carne asada (which is still good also), this is the place to do it. There are so many different types of meat that are sliced fresh and put onto your corn tortilla and topped with mainly onion, cilantro, and guacamole. With the pineapple, the al pastor is great and not found in every taco shop. I also like the lengua, cabeza, chorizo, and adobada. If you need a little crunch, you can sandwich the meat and cheese between two tortillas to make a vampiro.

The salsa station and the bar is what sets Taco Y Taco apart from the others. There are so many side items and salsa and you're sure to find a combination that works for you. You name it, spicy, mild, radishes, beans, pickled carrots, cucumbers, etc. And what goes best with your tacos? How about a Modelo or a margarita? There's plenty of room in the restaurant including tables upstairs once you get your food.

Each taco will set you back two dollars and change. They also have a pretty decent happy hour. Don't give up on the place if you get frustrated, because once you get the ordering down, there's so much to discover and try.
