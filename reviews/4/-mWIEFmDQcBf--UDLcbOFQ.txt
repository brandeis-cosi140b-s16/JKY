99 cent margaritas on a Tuesday?
Awesome Tacos?
Great Empanadas?
If you said yes please to any of these questions.. YOU NEED TO TRY THIS PLACE!


So close to 5 stars.. this place is a hidden gem. Its hidden behind pomo pizzeria, and a whole different atmosphere. The food is fantastic, now lets work on our cocktails. My pina colada was... well.. not fantastic.
The food i got made up for that.

Loved this place and will definitely be going back.
