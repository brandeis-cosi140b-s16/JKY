Um, this place is a tradition - a staple for all graduating UIUC folk like myself.  I didn't fully appreciate it when I was there. Senior year, I started going more often, to partake in the insanely cheap margaritas and filling, hearty Mexican food.  Now, whenever I visit my campus, I return to get my fill of the deliciousness.

Seriously, coming from Chicago, you can NOT get food this cheap/tasty anywhere in the city.  Seriously, you can't!  I think my friends and I spent about $12 each - that's dinner for everyone, plus 1/4 of a 60 oz flavored margarita pitcher.  Come on now, what a steal!

It's actually pretty tasty too.  I looooove their tamales.  The bean burritos are pretty good too, and as soon as I bite into that familiar salsa, I melt.  The margaritas are always delicious, though sometimes they are stronger than others.  Service is usually very friendly and quick.  It's like memories covered in chile sauce with a side of beans and rice.  Dos Reales, I'll always love you.
