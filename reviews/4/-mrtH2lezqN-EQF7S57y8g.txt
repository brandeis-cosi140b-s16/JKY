One of my favorite mexican restaurants in the area. I bring lots of out of towners here when they come through. The carnitas entre is excellent. Guacamole tableside is another must order. 

The reason I dont give it 5 stars is the service. It gets super crowded and it can take a little while for things to get moving. Last time I was there (this only happened once) we had to flag the hostess to even get a waitress. While this has not been my experience every time, it sometimes is a little slower than I'd prefer. But to be clear, this is NOT a barrier to going. Food more than makes up for it if its a little slow!!
