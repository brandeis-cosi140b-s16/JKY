I love OTB, I mean I really love OTB. I've tried different things on their menu (Carne Asada Tacos, Ranchiladas, Fajitas, etc) but I always come back to the Ranchiladas. It's a hunk of beef cooked the way you want it with two onion/cheese enchiladas with beans and rice. I don't care much for the beans and rice but the combo of steak and enchiladas are awesome. Oh, btw - the endless chips and salsa are amazing. The salsa is really good. Top it all off with the Kahlua Ice Cream pie and you leave feeling very happy.
