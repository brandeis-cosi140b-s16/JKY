The food here is fantastic along with the chips and salsa. The service is good as well. The dining area is very open a lot more like a bar than a restaurant. It's a great place to go to watch the game and have some food and drinks. Their bar has a nice selection of hard liquor but only a couple beers on draft. Overall it's a decent experience for a decent price.
