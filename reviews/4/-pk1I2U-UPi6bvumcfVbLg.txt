Great little place located off of Bethany just west of I 17.  It's on the south side of the street and if you don't look for it you will miss it.  Little family type place where they have a good Chef that is popular with the Spanish TV channel.  Great food, they open at 6am and you can order anything from breakfast to Pizza and Burritos (yes even that early).  The place is small and is usually packed on the weekends.  They only accept cash so don't bring plastic.  Their Burritos are only $2.50 and are fresh.
