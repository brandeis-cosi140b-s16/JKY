The line is typically always long and very busy there at this location but the employees are always very fast and productive! They definitely keep the line moving!! I actually got here before the rush showed up and when I was finishing getting my drink and ready to walk out the door...all I needed was a straw! It took 10 mins to get one straw....ridiculous!! I'll give them a pass because service is typically great! But I didn't appreciate being ignored after asking for a straw!
