I really dig this place.  Angel and his wife (owners) are wonderful people, and do everything possible to ensure that your food is delightful.  It is not overpriced and the salsa is my favorite.

The verde salsa with the monterrey and guac cubes is amazing. So is the red salsa.  Fajitas are simply great and I have heard that the Margaritas are pretty damm good too.

Great atmosphere and I hope they stay open a long long time.
