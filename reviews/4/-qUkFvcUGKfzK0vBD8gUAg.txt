Excellent. I could not have been more pleased with my burrito (Veggie) , my wife was a big fan of her tacos, and our daughter loved her FREE kids meal as well. We loved everything about this place and will be making frequent trips. Looked to have a great selection of local beers that we'll have to come back for as well. And our service was so good, my daughter made our server a drawing!
