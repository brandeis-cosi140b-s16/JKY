In the world of fast food (drive thrus) El Pollo Loco is one of the better choices in my opinion.  The food is less greasy and there's a salsa bar.  Need I say more?  I'll say it again: SALSA BAR.

I'm not big and I don't need all the food in most combo meals so I made up my own.  I got couple drumbsticks ($1 menu) and a coleslaw.  Washed it down with the Cola on tap. I through down some pico de gallo with most bites and called it lunch. Exactly what I expected.  Chicken and coleslaw via the drive thru.

I'll be driving thru again next time I need me some chicken.
