I've been here a few times. During the day and at night. The few times I have been here during the day was for lunch. The food is really good no complaints on the drinks. Service is really fast seeing how we sat at the bar and it really wasn't that busy, also it was happy hour I may or may not had a few $2 margaritas and amore than 2 $3 beers..... May or may not have. 

Night time it turns into a club and it gets BUSY last time I was there it took a good 10 minutes to get from the entrance to the dance area mind you this place isn't really THAT big. It's a good time because everyone there is just there to have fun and dance. Everyone is friendly there. They have the grill going by the front with tacos, burgers etc. 

Crowd is a mixture of pretty much everything age and nationality wise real diverse.

Nice place to go to if you're really not trying to head to old town or party with the kids on Mill. 

Yes there is really sand in Sandbar... they have sand volleyball spot set-up inside..
