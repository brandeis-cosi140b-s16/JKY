In Madison for the weekend and found this place on Yelp. Located in the heart of State St. On the second floor, nice, clean, and family friendly. Ordered guacamole which was great, horchata was good as was everyone's entrees. Not fancy, but if you want good food in Madison, I highly recommend. Service was very good, and it was reasonably priced. Would for sure recommend and will come back next time in Madison.
