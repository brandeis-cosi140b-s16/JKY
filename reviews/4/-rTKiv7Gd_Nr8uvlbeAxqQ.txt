This place looks super small from the outside. It is still pretty small from inside too - probably could fit overall 25 - 30 people. The service was fairly slow but the food was good. It was really fresh. We got some colored chips and salsa. We also got some entrees which was good and we shared among 3 of us. 2 entrees were good enough.
