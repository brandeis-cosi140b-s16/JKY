I stopped by yesterday n got my reg chile relleno burrito w mayo;) and tried their steak sopes for the first time, it was pretty good I just wish they used Mexican cream instead of reg sour cream. Other than that the sopes were nice and fried (so a little greasier than I would prefer) but it wouldn't be real traditional Mexican other way! I enjoyed it.
