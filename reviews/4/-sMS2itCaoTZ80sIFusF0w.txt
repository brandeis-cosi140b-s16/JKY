Dos Equis Amber drafts are two dollars on Tuesdays. They're 20 oz glasses.
Allow me to Captain Obvious this for ya.

Seven glasses of this fine spirited brew, or approximately 140 ounces, (just a little over a gallon) will only cost you fourteen bucks, under twenty with the tip. 
And you don't even have to wait until happy hour!

For me, this means a BAL somewhere in the 1.2 vicinity, or as I like to put it; legally fun. 
For you, (my bragging little co-worker)  at 125 pounds and seven beers, you'll be a skosh higher than this, say around 3.25 and fast approaching legally embarrassing. 
But you still have a few motor skills remaining and there are plenty of activities you can partake in at this BAL, such as:

*Spastic dancing on the concrete counter at the bar.
*Flashing your tits at virtually no-one.  It's two in the afternoon. 
*Being forcibly removed from the concrete counter prior to stumbling off the bar and into a stool.

This followed by:
 
*Telling me all about what a dick Jeremy is and how you should have never moved in with him. (I don't even know him)
*Listening (uninterested) as you tell me your life story. (Cheerleader, yeah, right)

*Uncontrolled sobbing, followed by;

*Uncontrolled puking,.followed by;

*Passing out.

You also peed in the cab on the way home. Just thought you should know.

Next time you tell me how you're Italian, and how you can drink me under the table, you may wanna think twice.
I weigh twice what you do.
The nachos weren't such a hot idea either.

I hope you're reading this.
