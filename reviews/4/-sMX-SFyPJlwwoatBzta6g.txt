I had a craving for one of the best burritos in the Queen City. The clock struck 1:00 so I locked my keyboard, per compliance and headed down to Johnny B's. I ordered the reg.....u....lar. It was delectable. They had the tight rollers working today so my burrito was as tight as my pants after a Thanksgiving feast. Toppings galore. I went with the combo as drinks are free until 3. I highly recommend you swing by and secure a reg....u....lar.
