WELCOME TO MOE'S!!!!

You have to love that warm greeting every time you walk in the door! 

I went for lunch and decided to try a taco salad, I told the guy making my salad I really didn't want it the way it was listed on the board, and he replied that it's fine, "we make it the way you want it so that you love it!"  How awesome is that!

I started with the taco shell which was crispy and fresh, lettuce, grilled chicken which he warmed up on the grill, cheese, jalapenos, corn salsa (which if you haven tried you must....so delicious!), sour cream, guacamole, onions and BACON...which he also warmed up on the grill...I added the house dressing which was a nice mix of spicy and sweet and really brought the salad together in my opinion.

When he was done creating my salad it looked like a masterpiece and I almost didn't want to eat it! But somehow I managed, lol and it was just as delicious as it looked!

Add the chips and a drink and overall it was an awesome lunch! I would definitely recommend it and we surely be back!
