Deliciously authentic Mexican food, reasonably priced and well located. While the eat in space is small and bare bones, quick take away makes that a moot point. The red sauce is super spicy, so for anybody with a sensitive palate I'd suggest steering clear. Fresh made horchata and fish tacos are a must try for some seldom found in the north flavour!
