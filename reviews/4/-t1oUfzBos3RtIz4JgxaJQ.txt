I have only had the chips and salsa here. But that's because I can't get past it!!! I love Mexican food but I think I would mainline the salsa and grab to eat those chips before they come out of the fryer if I had the chance.

Any time I have a hankering for chips and salsa....Espos is the spot. Its also adjacent to an mexican mini mart - I think its a mini mart. I've never been in the store but assume it is. 

FYI on the restaurant though, they charge .70 to use plastic. So bring cash!
