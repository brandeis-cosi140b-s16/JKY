after being spoiled with real Mexican food in California, I became obsessed with finding places that served those damn delicious tacos. so, on a past trip to las vegas, i finally discovered a restaurant that did.

i got 2 carne asada (beef) and 2 birria (goat). soft, juicy, and jam packed with flavor. very authentic in my book.

i should have topped my tacos with more cilantro and onions, but was too ashamed because of the long line behind me. the sauces i took on the side were really good too; a green and red salsa.

the wait was long, but i didn't mind. i just couldn't wait to eat.

fyi: they do take out also, so be sure to call ahead if you're in a rush.
