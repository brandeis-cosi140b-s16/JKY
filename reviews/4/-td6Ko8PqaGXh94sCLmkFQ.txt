This place looks just as terrible on the inside as it does on the outside. It's not the cleanest or the most inviting and honestly, if I wasn't pushed by a coworker to go here on a Wednesday, I probably never would have given it a chance. 

However, you cannot beat 70 cent tacos. I ordered the tacos al pastor and they were wonderful. The meat was fresh and the fresh onions/cilantro that were placed on top of the taco were a delightful addition to the flavor of the meat. 

I also ordered a chicken Tamale. I am a sucker for tamales but I have yet to find a Mexican restaurant that makes them as good as the homemade ones I have bought from street vendors or the families who drop by our office during Christmas time to sell them. This tamale was pretty delicious and definitely one of the best I have had at a restaurant in Vegas. It was moist and flavorful. Grab one!

Give this place a shot if you want cheap eats and aren't turned off by the shady neighborhood!
