For 3 years I have lived less than a mile from Top Shelf, and for more than half that time I would drive by and scoff ... What kind of name is Top Shelf ? Sounds like a strip club, not  a Mexican joint.

Well, I wish I wouldn't have been so prejudice. This place is awesome. My mouth waters every time I think about it.  I only eat 2 things here, the chips and salsa and the Carne fundido. Its all I need. Oh, add a pitcher of margaritas and I am in hog heaven.

First the chips & salsa -- this is one of the rare places that brings you 2 bowls of salsa. One mild and chunky. One puree of the HOT stuff. Mix n match and you have a nice treat before the big meal. They also have bottled hot sauce on the table. The possibilities are endless! 

Next, the fundido -- I LOVE fundido. Top Shelf has THE BEST I have ever had. Its rich, creamy, tangy, smoky and delish. For the gringos out there, this is a chimichanga smothered in a spicy cream cheese sauce. This is not health food, but being happy is healthy, so its all equal in the end. Live a little and try it. They have pollo fundido too...

Top it off with some margaritas. Real, salty, tangy margaritas. And guess what?!?! They actually put tequila in them!! Thats more than I can say about the majority of the cheap Mexican places around the valley. 

Anyway - go to Top Shelf. It's awesome. Who cares about what they have on the wall (the have a sweet tropical mural!). You go to a restaurant to eat, not judge their interior decorating style. Have  a margarita and forget that materialistic stuff~~
