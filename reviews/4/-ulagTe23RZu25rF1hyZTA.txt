In an out of the way for some, but perfectly convenient to our hotel location, San Diego is a great little spot for some Mexican seafood in Guadalupe. I kicked off the meal with one of the best micheladas I've had in a WHILE. It was tart, spicy, good balance of Clamato and beer...so refreshing. The salt around the rim is fancier than my usual version in a plastic cup.

The specialty here is seafood, and that's what we stuck to.  The molcajete can be ordered mixto instead of just plain shrimp, so we got it that way. The flavor was very good, and there was plenty of seafood: shrimp, calamares, caracol, etc.  It could have used a bit more cheese.  We also had the cold San Diego Cocktail, with many of the same creatures, but in a citrusy broth, an the addition of oysters and avocado. Those two items were more than enough for the two of us, especially with some corn tortillas on the side. 

The decor is bright and friendly with some Diego Rivera prints and tile pieces. The waitress was friendly and attentive, even while handling the whole dining room herself, including a party of 8 or so.
