The only decent place to eat in the Monte Carlo food court. They offer a wide range of healthy options. 

I ordered the California salad. It was loaded with orange slices and avocado.

I would suggest this spot for a quick dish. The line is a bit long. However once you order your food, the wait is less than 15 minutes. And the plus side, the food is super fresh.
