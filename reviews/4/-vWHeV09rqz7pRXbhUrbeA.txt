Surprisingly very good. Their prices are great and the food is simple but that's how Mexican food should be. I don't need all the cheese and they do it just right. I recommend la tampique√±a and their tacos are flavorful. Their meat actually has flavor unlike other places that drench it in sauce and hope you can't tell the difference. A great choice when you want good food at a great price.
