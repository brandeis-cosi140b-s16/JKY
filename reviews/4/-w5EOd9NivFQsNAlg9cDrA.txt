Ventured to this place after seeing it featured on DDD. Always on the hunt for good eats, especially Mexican food. This place does not disappoint. Started with the queso fundido. It was so much more than just your typical queso, with a huge blend of flavors. Served with homemade chips, it was a great start to our meal. I had the mariscos enchiladas, and my husband had the cochinita pibil tacos. Both were very good. The enchiladas were amazing, with lots of cheese and seafood! 

Great service and great food. Come visit this little gem!
