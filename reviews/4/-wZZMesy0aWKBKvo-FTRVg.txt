Espos has a lot going for them...and it is all in the food. 

The decor is tacky and the house-turned-restaurant is bordering on dirty every time we go in there. However, the food is amazing. I cannot stop dreaming about taco salads and fresh made tortilla chips... 

My husband orders something different every time, but I'm a steak taco salad fan. The food is authentic and hot, fresh made to order. The dirt and the glove free hands frighten me a little, but the food is just that good. 

And we usually wait about ten minutes. I do not find that unbearable.
