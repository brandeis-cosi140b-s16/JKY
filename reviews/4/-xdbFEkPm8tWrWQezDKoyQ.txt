Came here one late evening with my girlfriend, who knows everybody here. :-)  The tacos were delicious, and the drinks were well made.  I tried the signature margarita here, and it was solid goodness.  

There is a sign above the bar that says something like I Y C R T B M A D, and you will have to ask the bartender what that means - and be prepared to buy a drink once you find out.  

Part of the restaurant is an outdoor patio, which is great when it's nice out.  It was rainy and super windy the day I visited.
