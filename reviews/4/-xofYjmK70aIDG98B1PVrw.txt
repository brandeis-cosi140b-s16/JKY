Tried asada and suadero tacos.  Asada is an easy pass next time..but oh, the suadero is sooooo good.  This is my first time indulging in authentic tacos, and being Filipina and not knowing a word of Spanish, I have to admit, I was a little intimidated placing my order.  But watching them warm the tortillas and cut the meat was so interesting and the guy next to me helped me out a bit when he realized that I didn't speak a lick of Spanish.  
I forgot to order Adobada, so that'll have to be on my next must try list along with their fries and maybe quesadilla.
