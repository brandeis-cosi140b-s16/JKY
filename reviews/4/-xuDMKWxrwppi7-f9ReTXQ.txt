OK, I have had my eye critically on this location for some time now. Verdict: MUCH IMPROVED over former staff. Managers on duty are always actually on-duty and working. Cleanliness has gone way up since my last review. Staff is always friendly and customer service is quite a bit above average in my experiences with other locations. They are definitely on the right track. This location could certainly use a renovation, but overall I have been well pleased as of late.
