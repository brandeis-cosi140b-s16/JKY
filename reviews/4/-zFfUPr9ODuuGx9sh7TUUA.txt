Food is definitely fresh and tasty, however they need to have a better system for Togo orders. They gave my order to someone else and let me sit there for 20 minutes before I asked what is taking so long. Before they figured it out, the lady looked me in the eyes and said she gave it to me already.

Kind of expensive. For the prices, they should put some tomatoes or a dollop of sour cream in their enchilada style burro plates.

I'll go back and try a taco salad.
