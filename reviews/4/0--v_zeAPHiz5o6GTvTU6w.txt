This was perfect after a long flight (long meaning an hour flight on an empty stomach. Don't do that ever!) obviously it as my first time and the worker helped me thru it all. First of all 50% corn 50% flour tortillas whatttt. Cornbread filling Whattt . Totes recommend! I also got the short rib and tried the green chile pork. Both equally good but short rib was off putting after a while. Also ordered the soup which comes with a heaping pile of meat and cheese on top. Everything goes into an oven which reminds me of chipotle/pieology. Actually it's pretty much the same exact concept but no complaints there! I don't usually like lots of options or decision making but this was Straight forward. Tortilla meat sauce cheese toppings more cheese more sauce. Hell yes! Yum Hit the spot
