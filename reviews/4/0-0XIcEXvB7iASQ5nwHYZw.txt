My bf, his dad and I come here every Tuesday for tacos. Great value and friendly service. 

Our main critique- consistency. There have been a couple times where I was ecstatic. The food was fresh, delicious and portions were perfect... Then there are times where the meat is tough, flavorless or they totally skimp on portion sizes.

Over all, we are pleased and will continue our tradition here.
