Let's be real with ourselves. Taco Bell isn't cuisine, it isn't authentic. However, if you're a college student trying to study or if you're coming back from a party, this place is not too bad. The prices are fair, and the food preparation is usually pretty good at this location. The server staff is almost always nice. The only downside is going late-night on a Thursday - Saturday. If you try to do this, you're going to have a bad time. This is when hordes of people come to get food from one of the few late night places near ASU. The lines get long, the staff gets irritable, and the food drops in quality. Any other time that you go, you can't really complain for the prices.
