We were seated promptly.
The menu was simple and easy to read.
Prices ... Some were slightly pricey.
We liked the ambience. Retro fun! ^_^
Service was prompt, and those who helped us seemed knowledgeable of their offerings.

We ordered tacos and chimis. Oh and salad as well. We liked the fact that it's not processed. However, it seems to lack flavour. It's either salty, spicey, or tangy. 

Their chips were yummy, and like the fact that Darth Vader kept us company! Lol

Give this spot a go! ^_^
