I am ashamed...ashamed to say I had the best carne asada fries last weekend, and it was NOT in San Diego. 

There are a lot of taco shops in Chandler. Apparently, word is they are not very good, except for Los Favoritos. I scoffed. My San-Diego-friends-now-residing-in-AZ kept trying to convince me how good it was. I scoffed again. HA! Finally, I decided to go, just to compare. What a snob.

Looks like every other taco shop I've been to, maybe a little cleaner. Carne Asada fries is not on the menu, so you have to ask for it. I opened up that styrofoam box, and it was pretty. No, really. I haven't had carne asada fries that good...ever...so far...

Recommendations:
Chicken rolled tacos, quesadilla, pretty much carne asada anything.
