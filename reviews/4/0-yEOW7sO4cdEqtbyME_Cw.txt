What can one say about a single location of a chain restaurant like Del Taco besides:
a. They always get my order right (which they do)
b. The employees have a great grasp of the English language (which they do)

Well, I can testify that this particular Del Taco made one of my wildest pubescent dreams come true.

It's like this... what teenage boy hasn't mused that if he had a pair of ta-tas, he'd keep himself amused for hours.  I was no different.

Then somewhere in my twenties, Del Taco came strolling into my life, with their thick and creamy strawberry shakes, made with a generous helping of real fruit!  The key to my youthful desire lied within this sweet polar potion... it was called lipids... aka milk fat.

Let me tell you friends, the grass isn't always greener.  I'm not amused... not at all.  There's nothing alluring about a tufted teat.  They bounce; they sag; and they can percolate perspiration like Michael Vick at a PETA rally in Death Valley... on a really hot day.

And no one seems to care.  Seinfeld conceptualized the 'manzier', but I've yet to see one for sale.

I'd have to say my lowest point came while at a water park with friends, one of which brought their new baby.  While relaxing in a lounge chair under the awning by the wave pool, they asked if I wanted to hold little Abigail.  Sure, I love kids.

As I was sitting there with this little cutie, I noticed other people were gawking at me.  When I looked down to check on Abby, I noticed that her mouth was firmly latched on to my right mammary.

That's right children, come suckle daddy's sugarball.

My nonchalant extrication efforts didn't pan out, and the worst part was that I thought I felt seepage.  With pretty much nothing left to lose, I wedged my left index finger between my swollen nip and lil-miss-hoover's mouth until I heard decompression.

Baby-go-back-to-Mama.

In conclusion, I'd like to think there's a lesson here we can all learn from.  Yeah.
