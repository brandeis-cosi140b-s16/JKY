As with any Mexican restaurant you expect fresh chips & salsa and this place does not disappoint!   Not only do you get a traditional salsa fresca but also ceviche salsa.  If you also want some heat don't miss the salsa verde (green) they serve with the shrimp empanadas...so good we put it on everything!   I already mentioned in my tip that the portions are well sized & well priced.  The patio is also a great place for small or large groups & instead are large family sized tables.  The only downsides - service was slow & the mariacchi ask for a $20 tip per requested song ($5-$10 is pretty standard).
