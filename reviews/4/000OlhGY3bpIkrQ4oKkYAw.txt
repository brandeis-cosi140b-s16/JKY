Look, this place would get 5 stars but I am sure I haven't tried all the best burritos out there. But the convenience of the location and the fact that I truly believe Carne Asada is a health food I recommend going to one near you!! Whether your a bean and cheese or a fat carne burrito kinda person, taco or taquito kind, maybe you need veggies, I still think their Carne Asada is just what the doctor ordered, throw their fresh salsa on any of it and call it a salad. 
 Remember Meat is what makes us human!!! And they don't  scrimp. In the future I am sure you will see a guy like me out in front of resturants selling FAT in little viles to people who realize, "remove the fat..remove the flavor".
  If you think you may be Burrito intolerant, it's just a myth, not a condition. However, I do sometimes notice others seem to be intolerant of my burrito consumption.. But my dogs still love me.
  One more note. Their burritos aren't so loaded with juice that the tortilla falls apart and drips all over. So I think taking a formal date would be ok..
