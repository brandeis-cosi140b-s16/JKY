I met a few co-workers for the end of happy hour and Cinco de Mayo yesterday. Located in downtown Gilbert next to Postinos, Joyride is almost always packed. We opted for first table available and were seated within 10 minutes in the patio. Our server was wonderful. He gave us great recommendations on drinks! We ordered the classic and blood orange margaritas, $5 special for the day. It was pretty strong but good. Then we placed an order for tacos! They have a diverse menu and had gluten free options. I had carnitas tacos. They were so beautiful I felt a little guilty eating them. The chips and salsa kept coming and I was glad it did. Everything is house made and you can tell. The ambiance is trendy and relaxing. I will definitely be back!
