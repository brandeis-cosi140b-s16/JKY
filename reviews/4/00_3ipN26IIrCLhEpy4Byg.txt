Pretty damn good lil' joint. 

We went there on Sunday @ ~ 5pm. It was not crowded at all and we got a table right away. Lil' girl came and asked what we want to drink. We shooed her away as we were not ready. But we made up our minds in a few min and she came right back to take our order for drinks. In the meanwhile chips and tasty salsa made its way to the table. By the time she came back with out Margaritas we were ready to order food and did so. 

We got some soup and a Burrito Enchilada Style. Soup was properly warmed and sized and tasted good, to boot. Burrito was HUGE! Did i say HUGE? I never EVER seen gianormous burrito like this in my life, and l love Mexican food and consume quite a bit of it. So... it was HUGE! And tasted real good too. 

All in all, it was good food for a fair price. I can not complain one single bit and will more then likely come back there.

"I like"
"Very nice"
