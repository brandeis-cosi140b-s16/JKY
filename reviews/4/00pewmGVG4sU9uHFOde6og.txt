I have tried Raul and Teresas breakfast. It was very good and simple. I had the Chorizo and egg breakfast and liked it alot. The chorizo was actually very good and it came with beans and tortillas. Not bad. We were served chips and salsa before our meal and enjoyed that also. We did actually wait for a while for our meals to come to us but luckily we did not have any starving kids with us. I will go back and try lunch or dinner then I can give a better review. The breakfast I had was worth going back to try it again.
