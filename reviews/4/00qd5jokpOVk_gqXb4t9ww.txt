I always enjoy eating here, well to go.. The smell isn't exactly desirable. The food on the other hand is always good. Since they changed management the last time, it always consistent. I usually get the same thing. Cowboy fries!! And since I recently became a vegetarian, I just omit the chicken and add refried beans.. Its a great treat but LOTS of food. The serving is huge!
