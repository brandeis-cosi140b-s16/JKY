I believe this was the original "burritos as big as your head" spot, now practically a conglomerate.  If your eyes are bigger than your stomach, god help you, but most average-sized people will be sated.  I was full after half a burrito.  There was something missing spice-wise in the preparation, but the end result still had decent flavor.
