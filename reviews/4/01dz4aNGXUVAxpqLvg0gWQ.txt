Nice little divey type place, but I liked it! 
Great service, and quickly greeted with very good Chips and Salsa. 
I went for the Green Carnitas and it was everything I could ask for. Tender meat, great flavor, not too salty. Grilled veggies mixed in were great! 
Tortillas were nice and soft. 
Try this place out if you're on the West Side.
