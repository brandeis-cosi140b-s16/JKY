People's taste in Mexican food is all over the map so you have to allow for that.  This Garcia's does an excellent job of serving the now standard type of menu items for Mexican Restaurants.  They don't "overheat" the food so your out of town guests will be able to enjoy it but it does have flavor.  I love their bean dip for the chips. Their service has been good every time I've been there.  The place seems to be doing OK business so someone else my like it too.  I usally get a green burro or similar and those have been good.
