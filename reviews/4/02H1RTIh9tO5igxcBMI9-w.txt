Didn't have big expectations but was pleasantly surprised. We were looking for a quick lunch before a spring training game.  Our server/ bartender recommended the shrimp tacos and they did not disappoint. Flicka himself brought us our food, introduced himself and chatted with us a bit. Looks like it would be a fun night time spot.
