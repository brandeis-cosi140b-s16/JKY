No small portions at this place! The beans and rice took up 75% of the space on the plate. ( I ordered chicken tacos.) Everything satisfied me. The juice from the meat spilled onto my top but no worries. ( That just demonstrates how marinated the meat was!) It doesn't exceed the Mexican food in California but it'll do for now.
