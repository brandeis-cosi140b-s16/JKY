An absolute must-eat if you're walking the Strip and looking for a generous, quick & tasty meal at a great price ($2 taco special). The Yelp check-in offer was another percentage off the total bill which was a nice surprise, so remember to check in!

Basically ordered one of each of the main proteins: carnitas, asada, lengua, al pastor, and was happy with all of them. The house habanero salsa is fantastic - not too spicy - one of the best-balanced habanero salsas I've experienced.

Great to see such enthusiasm behind the taco counter - turning & burning with smiles and big scoops of taco filling. Do try to keep it street-taco-simple with cilantro & onion only or you will get charged extra (for pico de gallo, cheese, et al).

Way to go, DJ!
