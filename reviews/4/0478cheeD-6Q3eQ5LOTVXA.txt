This place was a really fun time! Came here with some friends to check it out. We were all really happy with our food. I got the Chile rellenos and it was served with tortillas. I was curious how the tortillas would came into play, but then I realized that you chop up the chile rellenos and put in the tortilla. I don't think I can ever order a chile rellenos unless it comes with the tortilla. It was so tasty and I'm still dreaming on this dish. 

We also ordered pitchers of margaritas and they were delicious and decently priced. 

It is a small place but has a pretty cool decor. 

I just wish the service was a little better. After everyone ordered, the server had to make everyone repeat the order. A different server then didn't ask if we wanted anything else and then just brought out check and was pushing for us to get out. 

Besides the not so friendly service, the food was good and we overall had a good time.
