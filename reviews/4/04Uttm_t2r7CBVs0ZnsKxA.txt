For a chain of "fast food" American-Mexican food, it's delicious! Cheap prices, convenient location, and quick service. I appreciate the salsa bar offering red and green salsas, pickled jalape√±os, carrots, and onions, cucumbers, and radishes. The salsas could be better, but I like the flavor of the red salsa adds a nice spice to the food. Service isn't necessarily friendly, but for a two-minute interaction, I don't really care. You order your food at the cashier, you pay, you pick up your food, then you eat. That's it.

This location has only a picture menu with no prices (except the breakfast options). A lot of their items are drenched in (not-so-melted) shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream, and/or guacamole, so you've been warned. I simply order my meal without one or all of these toppings and I'm satisfied.

I've only been here a handful of times, but the experience has been consistent. I normally order Carne Asada Fries or Nachos and/or Carne Asada Tacos. I don't normally deviate from these items, but I have had the Breakfast Burrito and Tamales. Everything has been tasty. 

During my visit yesterday, I wanted to see how their Pastor stood up to street vendors, so I ordered two Al Pastor Tacos ($2.30/each) topped with pico de gallo and guacamole. Not too shabby! I was surprised that the pork was so tender and flavorful. Certainly a good alternative to street tacos! Ruben ordered the Chicken Quesadilla Combination Plate ($6.35) that was packed with three very large slices of quesadilla, refried beans, and Mexican rice. The chicken was moist and juicy and there was so much of it! They're not holding back. We also shared Carne Asada Fries ($6.95), always delicious, although they never season their fries, so it just needs a bit of salt. A small drink with unlimited refills is just $1.50 (no lemon-lime soda option) and all prices include sales tax.
