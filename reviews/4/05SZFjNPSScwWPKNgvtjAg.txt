This was my second dinner in this Javier's since it opened. Pretty much everything on the menu is good. I ate lighter fare, but for my customers who had never tried great Mole, their Mole with a steak was quite the hit. There are pages of items to choose from and it's pretty much guaranteed everyone will enjoy their food.

Their chips and salsa are always wonderful as is the table side guacamole. We had to have seconds on chips. Their handmade margaritas are great. 

I still like the Newport Coast location the best because of the view, but this location is way better than the Irvine Spectrum! Prices are very reasonable.
