Food is very good, the burritos are huge! Its worth the price, especially being in a hotel. I got the chicken taco and it tasted fresh. The employees worked quick and provided good service. It satisfies my itch for Mexican food when I'm in the food court. Worth checking out. They have a good drink selection as well and huge margaritas.
