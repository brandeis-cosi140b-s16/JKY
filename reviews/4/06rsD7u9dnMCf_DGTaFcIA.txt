I ended up eating lunch here and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The food was extremely fresh with great flavors. The salsa and chips are made on site and were really good. I also got the guacamole which was good but it was a bit small but I cannot complain since it was reasonably priced. 

I had the Yucatan Pork tacos which were incredible and full of flavor. I would love to go back another time to try their dinner menu. 

Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience with a very helpful wait staff!
