Some colleagues and I had lunch here recently.  Complimentary Chips & Salsa are served with your meal.  After browsing the menu, I went for the Cheese and Onion Enchiladas w/Rice & Beans.  The dish came out fast and on an extremely hot plate......be careful of these plates, you'll burn your hand if you touch them.

After letting the food simmer down, I went for a bite of the Enchiladas....they were really good!  I poured some of the Hot Sauce that came with the Chips & Salsa on top of the Enchiladas to give them a nice kick....yum!

The service here was really good and they were very friendly.  We had a great time.
