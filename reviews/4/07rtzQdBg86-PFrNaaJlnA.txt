This is Old School Mexican and just about as good as it gets. Inside, it looks dark and dingy. The furniture looks as if it were bought in 1963. The dining room/bar is well-worn and comfortable. 

Upon sitting, drink orders were taken and homemade salsa and chips were brought and refilled without our asking. The food arrived quickly after ordering and it was HOT (temperature and spice). 

The food is great and there's plenty of it. The three of us enjoyed green chile rellenos, enchildas and burritos. Each entree came with refried beans, spanish rice and cole slaw. They have a full-service bar, but we've only been there for lunch. Soda on the gun are RC products. The iced tea is brewed (kudos!!). Service was well above average. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable. Our glasses were never empty for long. 

The food is excellent. The waitstaff is attentive. The prices are reasonable. Three men had lunch (with a tip) for under $40. What more can one ask?
