Hit or miss on quality and ambiance. I have had great service there before, stellar food, a great time at the bar, and then there were the times with a rock in my bean dip, cold food served, and service that was non-existant. The last time I went (Nov -09) everything was just peachy, so perhaps they have ironed out the kinks. Food is good, creative, and filling. Happy hour prices are to be sought out for drinks.
