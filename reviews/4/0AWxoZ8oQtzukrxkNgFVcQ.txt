I cannot resist the cilantro-lime rice!!!!  Good to see a new establishment in the University area that can cater to students and area workers alike.  They haven't changed much from their game-plan: simple menu with lots of flavors and fresh ingredients.

The interior is clean and industrial... most of the tables are geared towards group eating, all the chairs are pretty much either stools that are fixed to the ground.  Makes for a unique/modern look.

The line moves pretty fast here but it can get crowded during the lunch rush - just have to hit it at the right time.  Servers behind the counter are young, energetic, and make you a yummy plate of deliciousness that your stomach will appreciate.

My only gripe about this place is the parking lot... which is already super busy..... The Papa John's that appears to be going in next door is not even opened yet... but the parking lot feels bit awkward and asking for someone that is craving some Chipotle (namely me) get clipped by a side mirror or something even worse.  The drive-thru Starbucks on the other end of the new building does not help at all with caffeine deprived people whipping through the parking lot to get their next fix.  Be careful.
