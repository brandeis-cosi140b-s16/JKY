Great menu selection would have given it a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the AC Unit, pretty warm eating lunch.  But overall I was extremely satisfied with my selection.  The El Salvador house special plate.  Coming from a cook. The food was made perfect.  Give it a try if you're looking for some Central American food.
