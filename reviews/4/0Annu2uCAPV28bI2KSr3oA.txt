Ordered the beef fajitas and a cheese crisp.  Both were delicious.  I had been raving about the restaurant Si Senor, but had just an ok experience there 2 weeks back.  I actually think Manuel's has them beat.  This will be my "go-to" Mexican place going forward.  The fajitas were very flavorful and the onions/green peppers were still crunchy.  I had awful onions/green peppers last time at Si Senor...very mushy and greasy. Be aware however that Manuel's only give you 2 flour tortillas which would never be enough for the amount of beef - you can easily make 3-4 fajitas, so be sure to ask for an extra two tortillas.
