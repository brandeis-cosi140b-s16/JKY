Earlier tonight I had the pleasure of eating at a gem of a restaurant in the University Area of Charlotte, NC - Zapaata's Cantina Mexican Restaurant.  I have been eating at Zapata's since 2002, and like a fine wine, the place gets better with time. 

We arrived around 7pm on a rainy Thursday evening.  (If you've never been to Zapata's in University Area before, it can be kinda tricky to locate.  It is in the back left of the plaza.)  When my date and I walked in, we were greeted by a friendly gentleman host, who gave us the option of sitting upstairs or downstairs.  Since we've seen the place before, we chose to sit upstairs.  

No sooner were we seated, when warm tortilla chips, and two bowls of fresh pico were placed before us.  Tecate was on special, so I gladly order one, my date ordered a coke that didn't taste quite right. (YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAY AWAY FROM THE SODAS.)  Our drinks, including ice-cold water; were brought to us within minutes.  My drink came in a can, however it was accompanied with a frosted-mug and fresh lime.  

I order the fajitas-burrito, my date ordered the (grilled) shrimp tacos.  Both orders arrived promptly and smoking hot to our table.   On my plate was a giant burrito stuffed with chicken and steak (I always get the mix), beans, cheese, peppers, and onions, etc.  The outside of the massive burrito was smothered in melted cheeses including guacamole and sour-cream which were splattered across the top.  The shrimp-tacos looked just as appealing.  Both entree's were brought to our tables on extremely hot plates. and were surrounded by warm refried-beans and yellow rice - cooked to perfection.  

We both loved our meals.  We both had plenty to put in a box and take home for a late-night snack or lunch tomorrow.  

There is much debate amongst life-long UCBers about which is the best Mexican restaurant in the University Area; with the contestants being Monterrey, Los Arcos, or Zapata's.  My nod goes to Zapata's by a smidgen over Monterrey!


Our Bill: 1 coke, 1 Tecate, 2 waters, 1 fajitas-burrito, 1 shrimp-taco = $30.00

Service:  The service is simply amazing.  I've probably been to Zapata's over 20 times, and even though I've have had a few not so tasty meals, the SERVICE has always been top-notch. 

BEWARE OF:  **If you get the shrimp tacos, I recommend them grilled.  **Watch for the pulled-chicken.  It's not so tasty compared to the chicken-breast or steak.  **$2.25 Tecate cans on Thursday nights.  **You can get a steak/chicken mix with the burritos
