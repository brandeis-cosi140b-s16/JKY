We went here for lunch, and split a plate of appetizers along with a side of chile relleno, and were actually stuffed after that :) I had 2 beers from the tap and wifey had what I can assume was a lava flow sort of pina colada drink -- they have margaritas and you can pick your own tequila, as well happy hour Mon-Thur from 3pm-7pm, friendly staff, great decor all around, and misters around the outdoor patio if you feel so inclined. Fiesta? oh yes! 

Price, say about $9 a person for food, drinks about what you'd expect. They have many more pricier options for those that want to eat more, as well a tantalizing desert menu with all the traditional faves, flan, deep fried ice cream, and so on... 

Don't expect street tacos or grab and go burritos, it's not that kinda food. This is good Mexican style sit-down-and-eat restaurant grub, with a few entrees from other south american cuisine as well.
