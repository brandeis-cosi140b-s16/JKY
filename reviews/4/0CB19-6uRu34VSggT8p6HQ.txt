Flew out from LA to catch Bingo Players here back in April of 2012. Never thought it would be the last time I'd see both of them spin together :/ Environment was great! Drinks weren't overpriced. I love seeing DJs on a personal level and this club/restaurant gave you just that! Surprised to see that it's closed now. Maybe it'll reopen in the summer. Rattle on Paul! We know you're watching down on us all!
