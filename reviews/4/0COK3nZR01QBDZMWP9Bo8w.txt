Authentic Mexican, always delicious and hot and quickly served, truly the nicest staff in the Valley with a handsome, relaxing ambiance...what's not to like?  Except I always fill up on the delicious house-made chips and the salsa they make with roasted tomatoes followed by a delicious entree...a different dish every visit...can't decide on a fave....never have room for dessert!
