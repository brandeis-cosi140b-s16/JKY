I'll keep it simple. We had a couple burritos and chicken tacos. The burritos were good, quite large. But the chef/cook could mix the ingredients a little. Both our burritos had one ingredient on one end and another on the opposite end etc etc. The tacos were piles high with chicken. I have no idea how a person is supposed to eat them with any toppings. There was that much chicken. The restaurant itself is a dive. But ya dont come here for that. Its all about the food. Reasonably priced, especially with a restaurant.com certificate. I will go back soon. I'm anxious to try the tortas.
