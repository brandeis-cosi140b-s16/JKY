In the scheme of things, Sandbar is a great alternative to the Scottsdale scene.  It is a little less dressy and a little more casual.  The food is good for what is worth -- Mexican bar food.  But, I love going there because the crowd is a bit more chill and its a little more relaxing than the other places in the area.  There are a lot of TV's, which is nice to catch a sports game.  There are private patio cabanas, but I have never used them.  This is a great place to hang outside in the sandy patio for happy hour or to get your groove on the dance floor during the weekend nights.
