I have lived in Phoenix most of my life, but didn't try this place until a couple of months ago. What was I thinking?!? This place is awesome! I was a little concerned about the "fusion" of Asian and Mexican food, but I shouldn't have been. The food is delicious. They even let you try samples at the counter! My favorite is the red jade chicken, but really...IT'S ALL GOOD! And, they bring you a tasty little Snickerdoodle cookie with your meal, which makes the whole visit worthwhile. I would give it five stars, but the only drawback is the place looks really dirty. If you can get past that, however, you are in for a treat. Try it. You'll like it.
