Good Mexican food that tastes fresh and homemade.  The chips and salsa were the only thing that wasn't good at all. Tasted like it was out of a bottle from the grocery store 
I ordered a bean and cheese sope with guacamole and sour cream and it was tasty. A bit on the crunchy side but  was flavorful. I also ordered the chile relleno with rice and beans and was Mmmmmming after every bite. The chile was stuffed with ooey gooey melty cheese. The rice and beans had great flavor which is rare.  Most Mexican restaurants serve bland flavorless rice so this was a nice surprise. My hubby enjoyed his chimichanga as well. 

The restaurant is not fancy at all but the service was fast and our waitress was a real sweetheart. Will go back for sure.
