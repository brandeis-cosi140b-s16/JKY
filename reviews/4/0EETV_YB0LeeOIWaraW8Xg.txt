I really enjoyed my first experience at Habaneros. I did use the drive thru. It took probably about 5 minutes to get my food once I got to the window. I got a cheese quesadilla and two chili rellenos. Yes, I went a little overboard. The quesadilla was huge. They don't skimp on the cheese at all. It was very tasty. I got green sauce on the side which definitely has a kick but nothing crazy. It also came with guac and sour cream. The chili rellenos were pretty good. Tasty and full of cheese! So why did I only give them 4 stars? My two complaints were that the quesadilla was not cut so I had to tear it into pieces and the other was I didn't get a plastic knife to cut my chili rellenos. Luckily I was able to MacGyver it with the fork and spoon I had. I will be back again!
