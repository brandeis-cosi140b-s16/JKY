I'm pretty picky when it comes to my food. I always get either the bowl or the burrito with plain white rice and just a tiny bit of it. So many times I get attitude from the employees or they try and put like a cup of rice which I'm sorry is just way too much. 

This was my first visit to this location and the lady who started my food was friendly and understood the meaning of "a tiny bit of rice" mainly because it's a burrito don't need rice in it and without it the beans soak a hole in the tortilla. I absolutely hate cilantro LOL and yea my boyfriend is Hispanic haha but yea back to the restaurant... The lady was also the cashier so she had to walk off and let the second line worker finish our food. She also understands the importance of good portions. So many times I get like a pinch of cheese like really?! But not her she put a perfect amount of cheese and sourcream on the first try! Steak was brown all the way through so it definitely was a little old which works great for me because I can't eat medium rare meat which is how they cook it. 

All in all great visit will definitely return!
