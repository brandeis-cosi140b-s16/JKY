YUP. THESE GUYS ARE SO AUTHENTIC, YOU MIGHT NEED TO BORROW SOMEONE'S ROSETTA STONE SPANISH EDITION.

When I got in line, there were about 3 people ahead of me. Each one of them ordered in Spanish. When it was my turn, the first thing I asked was, "Do you speak english?" The guy looked at me, smiled and said "Si!" I know that sounds funny but whatever I ordered, he translated it to his fellow compadres that were putting the food together. Btw, im Filipino if you guys are wondering.

So for the food. All the reviews on here are pretty much spot on so here's my 2 pesos......I mean.......2 cents. I ordered 3 tacos. Spicy Pork, Carnitas, and Carne Asada. Usually my favorite is Carne Asada but these three I got were so good, it didnt matter which one I ate first or last. At 2 bucks a pop, thats a pretty decent price for a tasty meal thats filling. 

The person at the next table ordered what looked to  be a nice sized Carne Asada Fries. I asked him how much it was. He said it was 5 bucks and it was the half size. (Que the record scratch). What? That's the half size? HOLY CRAP! (I wonder what that is in Spanish? LOL). 

As I finished up, one of the ladies that works there came up to my table, looked at me and mumbled something in Spanish. I just looked at her and shrugged my shoulders. She pointed at my tray of garbage, picked it up, and put it away for me. When she walked by again I said "Gracias!" I should of just kept my mouth shut because she actually started talking to me. I was trying to think of how to tell her I dont speak Spanish. So without thinking it through, I said, "No habla ingles!". As soon as I saw the look on her face I realized I just told her that I dont speak english! 

So in closing, you dont need to know Spanish to eat good food here. But in my case, it probably would of helped!
