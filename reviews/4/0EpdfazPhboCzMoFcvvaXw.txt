Picked up the nachos and carne asada tacos. Both were really good! Didn't try the red chile, but the green chile on the nachos was amazing. The tortilla chips themselves were amazing too. 
If I'm in the area next time, I'll probably dine in since they have buffet style tortilla chips, salsa, cilantro, onions, etc.
