Within the Phoenix metro, I never order green chile.  This premise extends to Tucson and everywhere in between.  It's just not as good as what you get in NM and there's no real reason to try, as far as I'm concerned.  But AZ red chile can be top notch.

I was bored with mediocre burritos and decided to take the plunge and order a green chile burrito (with rice and beans which were .25 extra each).  

It was awesome.  Seriously.  Great green chile which was con carne and pork.  

I am a fan.  I will be back.  The salsa bar is okay at best.  The hot red is tasty.
