The place is small and can use some remodeling, but that does not matter, because the food is so good! Authentic, tasty, and dont even get me started on that side of sweet grilled onions!
I will be coming back for sure, and of course i will be bringing people with me ;)  
It's hard to find a GOOD taco place in Phoenix, and i think i might just have found my "gem" in this desert.
