Great experience here. We started at the bar for a few drinks while we waited for a table. We were sat after 30 minutes at the outdoor bar. Started with the build your own Guacamole (we did #2) and fish sauce wings. While we were eating out appetizers, it got very dark and started to rain. They immediately moved us to an inside table and held our main courses. We split the chorizo and al pastor tacos. Both were delicious. 

My only complaint is that the wings had way too much fish sauce. Other than that, we enjoyed every bit of the meal. We'll be back.
