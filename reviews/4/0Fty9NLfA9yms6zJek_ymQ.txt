walking through the airport on way to gate. Thinking about the nasty food I'll likely eat when I reach it. Pass by Blanco. Angels singing with ray of light. I've been to the location in the Tucson hills. Its consistently great food. What a nice surprise in an otherwise awful food environment. Way to go Phoenix airport. Fish tacos were a solid choice.
