The service is soooo sloooow.
The Adobada taco was way too salty. 
However, after a long night of dancing and drinking, I can't really complain. 
The Carne Asada Fries, though, was so YUMMY. I ate nearly the whole thing. The fries was perfectly crispy and crunchy; the carne asada was plentiful and just enough seasoning.
