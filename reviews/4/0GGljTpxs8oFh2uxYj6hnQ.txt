Every time we've been to Plaza Bonita (PB as it's now known) we've enjoyed ourselves. The staff is so nice and makes you feel welcome. The food comes out hot, quick, and fresh. The camarones mexicanos is one of my favorite dishes as is the healthy chicken burrito. I love the vegetables they fill it with. My boyfriend has a combo platter with a chile relleno, tamale, and enchilada. All were fantastic!! And that's coming from a Mexican woman who makes tamales every year for Christmas. 

One of our favorite things about this place of course are the margaritas!! I think we've tried every one of them two times over...not sure what that says about us, but...

We also love the colorful decor of the place, it really reminds me of Jalisco, Mexico. Some people may disagree but I wish they'd play music, at least during the evenings and on weekends. We're so happy a place like this has come to our neck of the woods!
