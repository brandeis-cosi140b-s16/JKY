Here we go! 
So I'm in Vegas for the weekend, came to visit this guy I met online. The guy works at encore, Wynn, and he decided to bring me to a restaurant off the strip rather than take me to a steak house at the Wynn...  This restaurant is actually pretty great overall, but common, a girl travels to Vegas just for you and instead of wining and dining her u bring her to a random Mexican restaurant off the strip in a dark street? Oh wait, did I mention there's a gentlemans club next door? Well there is, and between us, I rather be there. Brb my food just got here. 
Ok so I just finished my meal, the margaritas aren't that good, but the food is honestly amazing. The best part of the meal was the cilantro rice, it was soft and had a sweet touch to it which made it really appetizing. The server was great, his name was Mark, very nice guy and would check on us very often to make sure we're happy with everything we ordered and he made sure that our experience went well. I ordered the steak burrito and it was pretty good, we also got shrimp tacos and they were amazing, the shrimp was grilled so it was a light meal.
For dessert: I hope you like eggs bc the flan tastes like a day old omelet. 
Adios!!!! ;)
