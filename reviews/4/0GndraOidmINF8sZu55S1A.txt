Having read Amber G.s review today and knowing I would be in the area her review convinced me to stop in Don Rafa for lunch. 

  I do not know how they can do this but they need to find a way to be better noticed. I have been to the furniture stores right next to this place several time very recently and I never noticed Don Rafa. 

  OK So considering it is in a strip mall building it is not a bad looking place inside. The tables are not placed too close together so you do not feel cramped. 

   I ordered the tacos, expecting to get one al pastor and two barbacoa. They had no barbacoa. Ok this pisses me off for two reasons. One, I went to their web site before I went to the restaurant to see what I wanted to order. Since I had to choose another I would have had to read the menu and I did not have my glasses with me so I went with two al pastor, and one Don Rafa since that is the other one I remembered. The other reason it bugs me is if you are not going to have what is on the menu, do not put it on the menu in the first place. 

   The chips they brought first were unremarkable, much like I could buy at Fry's. My actual tacos were just fine, they had the flavour; but a bit dry. I would order them again. 

   As for service, it was fine really. I am just picky in this area. The young man who served me should learn that serving is more than the delivery of a product. One should smile, one should develop a personality, one should speak so the customer can hear you. Oh and your choice in eye wear is odd. ;-{) This guy was not unfriendly, he was just there and he did his job in delivery well. Oh yeah even if one is only drinking water a refill would be nice . 

   I am not as enthusiastic about this place as Amber G. but it is good enough to go back and try other dishes.
