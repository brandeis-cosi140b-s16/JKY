We just moved into the neighborhood and this will easily be a regular spot for us when we don't feel like doing dishes.  You can't beat the deals on Tuesdays ($1 tacos) and Thursdays (all burritos are $5.49).  My favorite is their fish taco with the fried plantains - delicious!  Service is friendly and quick even with it being cooked to order.  The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is that the last time I came in, they waited until I already ordered to tell me they had no plantains - I would have ordered something differently if they told me first.
