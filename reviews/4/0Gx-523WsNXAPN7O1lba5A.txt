My wife and I went here for dinner last night.  It was a Thursday night at about 7:30 and the place was pretty dead which was nice.  Somehow I've never been to this location before and it is pretty run down and old but you still get the good ole Macayo's charm.  There are signs all over the place saying they are going to remodel the place this month so that will be nice.

The food was pretty good and exactly what you'd expect.  Not the best, not the worst.  You get some decent Mexican food at a decent price.  The best part is that I scored a Local Dines gift certificate ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ) and my meal was basically free.

Our waiter was very good, fast, and friendly.  He kept my diet cokes coming like clockwork which was awesome.
