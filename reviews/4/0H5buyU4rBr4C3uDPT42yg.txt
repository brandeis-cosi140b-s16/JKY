Its Sat night, and we have ran around all day and the last thing I wanted to do was cook some dinner, so I asked my son and daughter what do they want for dinner and they just looked at me with the deer in the headlight look, so I knew it was up to me to find the place.

I remembered that Some Burros was next to the Chandler Mall, now I have had Some Burros before, use to work near by the one on baseline & mill & sometimes work has them cater events, and once the thought Some Burros got into my head I was craving their hot sauce, have you tried it yet? Omg it's a good hot sauce, goes perfectly with chips and food.

So I told them that's where I am headed, so off we went. My daughter ordered 2 beef tamales with red sauce & beans & rice, my son had the carne asada burro with beans & rice and they both liked their dish, my son even said he will go back, and that's a big deal because he is a picky teenager haha

I had the pollo fundino, the chunks of chicken were very tender, the flour tortilla was fried perfectly, not too hard & not to soft, oh but that jalapeno cream cheese is to die for! Love that stuff!! 

It was the perfect dinner for a sat night!
