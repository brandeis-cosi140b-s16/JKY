Began my Vegas Halloween weekend by doing grub and drinks at Pink Taco. The food was great and staff was super friendly and fast. Looking at the portions I thought I would be starving an hour later, but I was stuffed. It filled me to the point where I couldn't drink beer and had to turn to the harder adult beverages. I gave Pink Taco 4-stars because their pitchers of Margaritas on the rocks, while tasty, were kind of pricey. Eh, its Vegas though, and you've got to pay the cost to be the boss.
