This place isn't super fancy but it's good Mexican for a reasonable price. I ordered an enchilada plate and it came with a beans, rice, two enchiladas, and a fountain drink with free refills all for $10. If you are traveling with family there are several other dining options if you have a picky eater.  This is located in terminal B.  The only draw back is seating is limited.
