Best Taco Bell for sure!  The staff is usually friendly, I am usually surprised by this fast food staff.  They seem to be happy at this location and it shows in the service and food.  I never had missing items, extra sauce, and napkins, etc.  Food is hot and staff is friendly.  
I applaud the manager at this location, he/she run a great group of customer friendly staff.
