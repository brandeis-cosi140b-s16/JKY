Well I've beeb wanting to try here for a while me and my 3 friends got off work early and went . Im glad I did!! Michelada delicious :). Oysters wonderful,  shrimp cocktail yummy! & aquachiles first time trying definitely would get it again and my friend let me try her shrimp tostadas definitely spicy but want more. Only thing that kept it from 5 stars the band was nice just to loud our great waitress could hardly hear us.  Overall I'll be back . Way more i want to try.
