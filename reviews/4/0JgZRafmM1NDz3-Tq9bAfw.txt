Okay, I didn't dine in... I was the 1:30 am takeout queen on my excursion to La Flor.  The MAN ordered two sets of taquitos and a la carte chicken enchiladas.  I had fish tacos and upped my order to a combo with rice and beans.

One set of taquitos went right into the fridge for chow the following day. One set got devoured and the MAN reported them to be outstanding.  I, admittedly, gave the tortillas from my fish tacos to the pups, but the fish was perfectly cooked and mixed very well with the cabbage, sauce, and red chili copiously supplied by the very friendly overnight counter personnel.  The chicken enchiladas were AMAZING and really made the local Mexican restaurants look like junk food in comparison.

The reheated taquitos 24 hrs later were very good... Not sure how they reheated so dang well (surely a testament to the initial cooking) and with no grease stain on the paper towels... 

The rice and beans were cleaned up in minutes and were exactly what one wants from rice and beans... Beans that stick to the fork (no spoon necessary) but are still soft enough that chewing isn't required and rice that separates (not sticky at all) and is still firm.  Perfectly yummy!!!!!

Visit Flor instead of the silly Sonic sitting in the parking lot in front of it, they are open 24/7, you won't be disappointed!
