I was debating on whether or not to give OTB 3 or 4 stars because the food is just okay but the service was great last night and the drinks were very good so 4 it is. 

I had the cheese enchiladas last night with black beans and rice. The enchiladas were okay, the sauce was a little thick but not bad. The salsa is spicy which I like and I like to pour it on top of my enchiladas so this helped with the thickness of the sauce a bit. Our waitress was nice and very attentive. I ordered a Corona Light and she brought out a frosty glass to pour it in which was a nice touch.

I will visit this location again because the portions are good at a good price. Not necessarily my favorite Mexican restaurant in town but it's good.
