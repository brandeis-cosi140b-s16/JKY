LOL, I don't know if they changed the restaurant name recently, but I wasn't aware it was called La Hacienda Hornys BBQ. (ok I'm a child lol)

Anyhow, heard from a friend that this place has awesome ceviche. First time my husband and I came here we ordered from the window outside. Nice friendly lady. They had a grill outside and a man serving tacos. They have seating outside at night under a cabana. Perfect, since it's bearable to be outside after the sun sets here in Vegas and it's nice to eat outside.

I ordered the fish ceviche. It was delicious! Full of flavor and large portions. My husband got the carne asada burrito. Also large and full of flavor. Their tacos are also good. 

We ordered ceviche, carne asada burrito and 2 large drinks. The total was like $10. Another time, I ordered ceviche and a taco and it was $5. This place is well priced, and you get more for your money.

At another visit, we shared their Super Nachos. They were super indeed. Very big portions, fresh homemade tortilla chips, nacho cheese, chicken, avocado, and much more. Oh, try their homemade horchata! Best I've ever had. Not too sweet, just right. 

The workers don't speak english but, there is usually at least one server who does. Been here a few times now and the service is always great. Nice smiling servers. 

Wait time is pretty good. Maybe 5-10 minutes. They also accept credit card.
