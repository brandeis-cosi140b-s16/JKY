We had the tuna sandwich which was pretty good and big. Tried the melon drink it was very refreshing! Highly recommend it. Especially summer is coming. And I ordered the fruit combo with everything on it. (Papaya, kiwi, apples, melon, raisins, coconut, banana, grapes and yogurt on top) u can always request if you don't want some of them. Will try the tostitos next. Nice place to have it around west side of the valley
