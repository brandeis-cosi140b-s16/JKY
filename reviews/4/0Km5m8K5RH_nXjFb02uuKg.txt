Pulled into a gas station to put some gas in my car when I noticed this taco place adjunct to the Sinclair store. I was kinda hungry so I decided to fill up my own tank with tacos. The place looks kinda new so it was very clean and the people working there were very attentive. 
I ordered some carne asada tacos and a shrimp cocktail for dessert. 
The tacos. Tacos were pretty good they had plenty of meat although they were a little too greasy for me when trying to maintain my six pack not looking like a keg (half ways there)
So next time I'll just ask them to use less oil a that should bring the tacos to perfect.
The shrimp. This is one dish I would consider myself an expert, I eat more than my share of shrimp and I have the cholesterol to prove it! Best deal in the house for the price. They were fresh and juice was flavorful and had the right amount of spiciness. It may be a little to spicy for some green..folks that..go there, but you can always ask for your level of spice.
 I also got a can soda, I have nothing against can sodas as a matter of fact I collect the cans ( they turn into tacos) but I prefer the fountain sodas, I always like to refill my cup as I leave a fast food establishment, there's nothing better than the feeling of getting something for free.
 So here's my free gift to you... Do yourself a favor and try this new place, the food is great, prices are good and you'll be supporting a local business...your tank and the economy will thank you.
