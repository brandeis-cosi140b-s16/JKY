This is actually a good Mexican Restaurant, which was very surprising. Hell at 2x's in two weeks. The pot-roast special on Thu was really good. The 4 star rating is for a casino Mexican Restaurant, it would be hard for me to think of any casino that has a decent Mexican restraint that is even close to authentic.
