The food is excellent. I've been there for both lunch and dinner. My only complaint is the noise level can be loud. They have done some things to quiet it down though like adding in tapestries. Salads are excellent as are the soups and  well everything. Their guacamole is really good, but hard to get at in the tall, thin glass they serve it in.
