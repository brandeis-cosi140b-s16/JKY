Great customer service, is the first thing I have to say! My wife and Are visiting from Washington. we had the carne asada tacos and burrito. The ingredients are fresh, meat isn't chewy. The only downside is that the rice served with the taco plate was a bit more moist then I would prefer. A diamond in the rough. I would and will visit this location again.
