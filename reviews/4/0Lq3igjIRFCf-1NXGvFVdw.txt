I just can't understand all of the negative reviews that this place has received on Yelp.  I guess you can't put too much stock in a review where the person says that Taco Bell is authentic Mexican food.  Yikes, you need to get out more!

In my opinion, the food here is every bit as good as the original Tia Rosa's in North Mesa.   I've had the Fiesta Burrito, Crab Taco, Shrimp Taco, Quesadilla, and a few of their unique salsas and everything has been wonderful!  The portions are awesome for the price and the food is very fresh.  

I was skeptical due to the negative reviews here but I can say after a few visits that this place should do very well.
