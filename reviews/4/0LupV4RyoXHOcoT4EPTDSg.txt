Wow, this is the cleanest, nicest, best smelling fast food Mexican joint I've ever been to. The tables and chairs are newer & comfortable & even the kitchen looks super clean. I came here this morning for a breakfast burrito & even stayed to read the newspaper (I know, I'm the only one still reading them).  I had the chorizo egg & cheese burro & it did not let me down, in fact it had mote chorizo than most places & it was mixed evenly with cheese & egg. The tortilla didn't seem homemade but it didn't smell like preservatives either. I will most definitely come back to this location since it's close to my office.
