This has always been my go-to spot whenever I felt the need to fulfill my craving for carne asada fries. Hands down, they will always be the best to me. Im sure there are other great options to be had, but you'd have to know where to look. In my case, it's a quick drive for a quick fix. Carne asada isn't my only favorite but the Nevada burrito will give you such a satisfying bite, it'll have you coming back in no time! It doesn't get better then your carne asada fries wrapped in a tortilla, so you can enjoy the mouthwatering goodness as a whole. There food is definitely enough to satisfy you, and your friend.
