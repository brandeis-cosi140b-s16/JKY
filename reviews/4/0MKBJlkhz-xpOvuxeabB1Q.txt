I consider Monterrey the standard for really good 'dive' Mexican food.  There is nothing gourmet about it and you can order by number.  The menu comes with pictures and you get a side of refried beans with almost everything.  The waitstaff is friendly and actually speaks Spanish. And the salsa - oooh how I crave the salsa.  Whenever I'm in town, I require a trip here!
