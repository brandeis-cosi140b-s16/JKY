Don't know why I haven't written a review before. I go here quite a bit. I discovered it through a friend who had a coupon. This was 7 years ago. I eat there regularly.  I've never had bad service. It's always quick and efficient. My food arrives hot, sometime molten-lava hot. I do like the margaritas, too. Occassionally I'll try something new off the menu or the special board and it's always good but I end up sad because it isn't two cheese enchilada with red sauce. To me, that red sauce is perfect. I could swim in it.
