Rubio's helps me keep my diet, so I can eat out more often, haha.  This is my go to Rubio's after the gym.  As another yelper mentioned, the location is a little tricky and sometimes it is hard to find a parking spot.  Francisco, the manager is very personable and accommodating.  They have a few choices that are a lot healthier and they even make stuff for me that is not in the menu.
