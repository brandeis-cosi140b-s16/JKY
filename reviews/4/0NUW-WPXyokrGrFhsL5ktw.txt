Tasty and unusual, but far from healthy is a decent way to start.  This tiny restaurant combine a Korean Chef and a Mexican Chef who magically mix two cultures into one interesting flavor combination.  Everything I have tried so far has been tasty, but leaves me feeling a little greasy afterwards.  Good lunch, but get there early or you will NOT get a seat.  Definitely worth a try if your want something new and interesting.  Delicious food!
