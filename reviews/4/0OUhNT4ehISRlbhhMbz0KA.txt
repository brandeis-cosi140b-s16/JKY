Obviously a lot of people reviewing are not open minded. The area isn't the best but you probably won't get shot here either. We went here in June for my boyfriends parents 25th anniversary. It was at night during Mariachi performances so it was EXTREMELY loud. This is OK if you enjoy that type of thing, and it is certainly a unique experience. The singer is super sweet and dedicated a song to his parents and even did a special announcement.

For the food, I ordered a vegetarian burrito and nachos. Everyone else ordered various things. The food is REALLY delicious! I've been to a lot of Mexican restaurants around the country and this one is easily one of the best. The food IS authentic, I live with hispanic people and it's pretty much on par, so I don't know what some reviewers are talking about. 

I was impressed and I plan to go again VERY soon! Such as today. :)
