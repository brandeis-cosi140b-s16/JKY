My family is quite the fan of this place. Yes its not the most authentic Mexican food but we live in Verona, we take what we can get. I think they have great salsa, and the're fajita anything is great! Even tho the waiters don't speak very good english we've never had a problem custom ordering things for my picky fiancee and they are always friendly. 
Each table has a unique theme so always nice to have things to look at and talk about over dinner. 
It's too bad Pasqual's is open right around the corner but I don't think they are going to hurt business any. :)
