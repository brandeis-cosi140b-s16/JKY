It's like On the Border with a bit more soul and less salt.

Family and I dined in once and took out once.  We got the chicken taco salad each time.  Comes with chips and salsa (even with takeout--nice touch!) and jalapeno ranch dressing.  You get a taco shell bowl stuffed with REAL chicken (not the processed bits you typically receive at chains), cheese, and veggies.  Tasted fresh and was very filling.  Great meal for hungry dieters (particularly if you forego the bulk of the shell).
