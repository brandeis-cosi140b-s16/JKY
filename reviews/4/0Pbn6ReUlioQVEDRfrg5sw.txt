Fast service and close location to ASU makes this location pretty popular. Parking is a little tricky but as long as you avoid coming here during lunch when school is in session you should be good to go.

Building wise it's a bit on the smaller side compared to other Chipotle's and the line will snake through the restaurant when they get busy. Haven't had a badly made burrito here yet~
