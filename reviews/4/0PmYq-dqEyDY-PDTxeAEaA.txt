Decided to make the drive from Tempe to North Phoenix today to try out the Most Wanted Taco Shop due to the amazing reviews on Google and Yelp. It is a Chipotle style way of ordering your tacos or burrito. I particularly enjoyed how they had marinated onions and fresh cilantro to add to your order. The guac looked spot on though I did not try any. I ordered the 5 small tacos so I could try a few of the meats. The beef barbacoa was very good, the green chili pork was good and the chicken was "eh." The rice was unimpressive, but I am biased towards cilantro lime rice from Chipotle which I know is not authentic Mexican. 

I didn't realize that you could not order the fish when you get the small tacos, and mentioned something about it at check out. The person ringing us up heard me and said he'd bring me out one. Super nice guy. As I was eating my other tacos he brought out two regular sized fish tacos with all the fixings. They were amazing. Definitely recommend the fish for something special. Also, if you prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas, get the burrito, as they only have corn tortillas for tacos. They also have a little salsa bar with sliced limes for you to add to your meal yourself. 

Overall, amazing customer service and well worth it once you know what your ideal order is.
