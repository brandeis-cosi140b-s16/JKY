If you are looking for good food, cheap I would definitely recommend this place. If you don't speak Spanish however, you may not be understood to the fullest extent. But pretty good authentic Mexican tacos, not the best but I would say pretty great overall. Our food took a little longer to come out so as we sat at a table one of the workers brought chips and salsa with cheese on them, even though we ordered to go. So pretty good service, but I would definitely say you get you money worth here.
