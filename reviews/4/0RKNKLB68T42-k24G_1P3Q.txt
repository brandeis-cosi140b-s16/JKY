BURRATA!!! It's amazing but huge; a great appetizer to split among a group of friends.

The pizza was also delicious. They have a great locally sourced meat selection for proteins, but they also have white bean puree to sub for cheese if your vegan friend comes along.

Great place, good food and convenient location. So glad they added a location downtown!
