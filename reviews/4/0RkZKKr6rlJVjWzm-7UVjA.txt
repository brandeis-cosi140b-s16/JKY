Not the very BEST, but pretty darn good!!  (I still Gallo Blanco).  
I had the short ribs taco, the pork taco and the side of corn (which comes in a bowl).  The tacos were delicious if a bit greasy.  I ate every bite!  The meat was fall-apart tender and nicely seasoned.  The view to the pool provided nice relaxing atmosphere.  The corn is DELICIOUS!!  Definitely a young person's place (so near ASU), but everyone was very friendly to us older folks (ranging in age from 40's to mid-50's).  Would I come back again?  I think definitely!
