The following is written by me, one of Richardson Browne's biggest supporters and fans. 

This is an absolute 100% carbon copy of Richardson's. The window coverings, adobe booths, throw pillows, copper bar top, teal awnings, eclectic mix of soft rock, and even the prickly pear margiratas. The feel and atmosphere are almost the same. They even serve meals on big metal plates, often times with tortillas under them. Anyone who thinks this place is original needs to go see Richardson immediately.

All that aside, the food here is really good. I ordered the Carne Adovada which came a little drier than what I'm used to a Rich's place, which was a welcome change as they really let the pecan wood smoked pork speak for itself. The tortilla accompanying the dish was not tearable, but rather so dried out that it broke when I tried to tear it. This was the only dissappointment of the dish. Beans and rice were identical to Richardson's, smokey and delicious. The girlfriend ordered the Enchiladas, which to her surprise were the Red, White, and Blue Enchiladas from Richardsons. One chicken, one shrimp, and one cheese, wrapped in different colored tortillas smothered in green sauce. They were very much exactly what we were used to.

All in all, I'd say that Barbara, the owner, probably is using the same recipes and has obviously used the same formula here. She is doing a great job, and I will go back if I am ever in this part of town again. Even with the prices on the menu being about 20% less, it's not worth a 35 minute drive for me.
