Oooooh, what's this? A huge, delicious torta for 6.50? With perfectly ripe avocado, just the right amount of jalapeno, a crusty, toasty bolillo, and so much delicious queso and huevo that they knew to wrap BOTH ends to preserve it's structure 'till the very last bite?

This might be it. Might be. The Torta I have been searching for.

At first scan, the menu could put the veggies off, but if you tengo a little espanol, they're awesome about making it work, at least bean + cheese wise. So get the torta, or the enchiladas, or the tostadas, or the burrito - but make sure to grab a papusa too - they're good here, with that delicate slaw, and some weird bean broth I'd never had. 

Two salsas as you sit - both good - green's better. On the list for next trip - Chilaquiles, and maybe one of those open-faced burritos I'd only ever seen at Lempira. They dabble in Ecuadorian but not deeply enough for tostones, sadly.

Who cares. Torta, I ruv you.
