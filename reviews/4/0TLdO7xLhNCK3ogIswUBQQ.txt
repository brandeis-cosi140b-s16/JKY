Really delicious, fresh and filling food. A nice departure from the bland, overdone stuff that a lot of local places serve. I had Peruvian Ceviche, which (although I'm no expert) is a terrific, light and healthy dish. Wife had fish tacos, also very good. Minus 1 star for a little too much salt on everything. But I guess we didn't need that second basket of those yummy chips.
