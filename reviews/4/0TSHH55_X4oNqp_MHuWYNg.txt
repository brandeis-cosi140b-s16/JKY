This place is getting a bad rap.  I don't know if the ownership or the menu has changed, but a co-worker and I went there today for lunch and it was top-notch in ALMOST every category.

The Bad:
Red Salsa - this is just not very tasty. And as others have noted, exactly the consistency of ketchup.
The Side Salad - mostly the yellow spongy and white bitter parts of an iceberg lettuce head.  Not appetizing at all.

The Mixed Bag:
Service -  our waitress saw us three times - to take our drinks order, to deliver our drinks and take our food order, and to deliver our check.  The rest of the time, the "salsa and chips busboy" did all the work.  I hope he gets some shared tips, because he was the attentive one.

The Good:
INSIDER TIP - ask for the Green Salsa with your chips.  This is fairly fiery and is one of the best tomatillo-based salsas you can get in a restaurant in this town, and I have been to a LOT of them in 16.5 years living here.  Really EXCELLENT salsa.
The "Big Al's Plate" - this was a fine, fine entree'.  A huge, tasty grilled chicken breast, half a large avocado, two huge slices of beefsteak tomato, a good-sized dollop of cottage cheese, and the aforementioned "kinda gross" lettuce pile.  The chicken breast was cooked perfectly, just moist enough; really tasty.
Side order of grilled jalapenos - two nicely-sized excellent tasting peppers.
Chips with the Salsa - the chips are thin and perfectly fried.  Add some salt and you are gonna like these chips - a lot.

This place exceeded the expectations I had developed from reading the bad Yelp reviews.  Yelp almost steered me wrong in this case - don't let that happen to you.
