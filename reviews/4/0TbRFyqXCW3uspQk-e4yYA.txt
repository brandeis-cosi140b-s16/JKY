I've been to the Oakland Mad Mex many a time in my wall-sittin' youth. Anyone who knows me even a little knows my unabashed love for all food Mexican.

This morning my bf and I awaited 11am like kids waiting for Gift-mas morning. Promptly at 11am we started our brisk walk from Bloomfield to the new(er) Shadyside Mad Mex. 

The day twas lovely and once I saw that cactus shaped cigarette depository and those big ominous doors I knew I had arrived at Mexican food brunch heaven.

Walking in it is HUGE compared to at least the Oakland location. There are some seriously beautiful paintings and a really eye catching mural. The ceilings are high and the front is windows to allow some natural light in too.

Our waiter came immediately over to our table after our equally attentive hostess sat us. He was a little over the top, but likable and funny. We had our chips and salsa/guac and Big Azz margarita's on the rocks by the time I came back from the restroom and our long awaited Gobbleritos not long after.

I realize we were there at 11:30am on a Sunday morning so we're in a near empty restaurant at the start of everyone's shift, but honestly that's how I roll. I like trying something new when I won't be annoyed by the other patrons.

The drinks weren't quite as strong as I remember them being, but the Gobblerito's were delicious and I took half of mine home. My only real issue with the food was that while the salsa was so chunky and dense, the chips were absolutely not strong enough to dig any out. They were fine with the guac but would just break apart in the salsa. 

Honestly, if that's the only bad thing, then this place is winning for sure. I can't wait to stop back and try something else.
