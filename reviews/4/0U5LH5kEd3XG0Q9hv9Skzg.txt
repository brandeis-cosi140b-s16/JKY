We ordered 3 different pies for the 4 of us and had about 1 pie left over. Great way to test the food our first time visit. The staff said 45min to 1 hr wait for a table but we could go to the Johnson public house next door if we ordered drinks there (root beer coke and chocolate  milk).
Excellent pies we all commented no marinara sauce. Great combinations off their menu.
