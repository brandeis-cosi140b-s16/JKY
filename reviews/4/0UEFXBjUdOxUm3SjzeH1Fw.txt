This joint might only rate two stars in LA, but it's the best taco I've had on the East Coast. Get the tacos soft-shell and 'Mexican-style' with cilantro and radishes, delicious! Chicken enchilada was pretty good, the chalupa was just regular OK Tex-Mex fare. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a great 5-star authentic dinner somewhere on the menu, but our meal was a mix.

Salsa verde with the chips was excellent.
