great happy hour prices. tacos are some of the best in Scottsdale. reminds me of the street vendors in cabo and rocky point.  

great presentation on the trays. the tappers on the table are a nice touch.  younger crowd with attractive waitresses.  nice open air restaurant, close to the W hotel.

tacos and all the different salsas that come with the chips were fantastic.
