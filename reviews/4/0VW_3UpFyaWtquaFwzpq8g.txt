I get to eat at their Chandler location whenever I'm in town visiting friends. It's a nice change of pace from the Mexican food you find in California. The open face cheesecrisp is a great one to share and the taquitos and guacamole are my favorite. The atmosphere is nice and it's always clean. This is a great place if you're looking for a quick and delicious lunch.
