Clean resteraunt chain that still puzzles me how they stay in business . But tryed there grilled chicken tacos for the first time and they were acually pretty good . 

What bothered me is they have signs out for taco Tuesday for .39 cent tacos but they said its only from 3-11 pm . Its TACO TUESDAY not taco 3-11pm ... 

But of you want cheap fast imitation mexican food its pretty good
