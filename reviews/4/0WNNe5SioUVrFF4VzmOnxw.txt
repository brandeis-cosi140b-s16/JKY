My wife and I walked in on a Thursday night... sat at the bar and ordered beers and food... asked to change the tv to the NFL network and they were more than happy to oblige! Had the machaca chimi and the wife, cheese enchilada and taco. All was delicious!! Bartender offered a free sample of their house margarita (as they make their own mix...)... unexpected, and delicious! We will be back for more!!
