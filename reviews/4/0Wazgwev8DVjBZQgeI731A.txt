I am writting this review in large part because of he many negative reviews from one group of 30 who went there. First, the manager seems to have been at fault, if you notice an apology from the blue adobe grill appears under one of the reviews. Secondly... did the person making the reservations ever go there before hand? It is a small restaurant, it seats at most 60 people and the largest group it is likely to be able to handle in all honesty would be about fifteen. The food is excellent, the service generally good. My Only complaint so far is that thier Calimari and crab cakes are over-priced (still good quality). everything else is extremly good. It would be a good idea for anyone setting up a large dinner party to visit the restaurant in question if possible
