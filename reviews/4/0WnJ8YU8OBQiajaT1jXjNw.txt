Cheap, fast, fresh and efficient taco stand posted right by a tire shop, across from a community rec center. Folks the taste buds do not lie and I gotta thank the Goyamonstah once again for a recommendation. I recently brought a friend who enjoyed it the first time around so much that he was strongly considering going again dispite the possibility of missing his flight! Damn that's a mean taco! The pastor tacos are on point I think the only miss that I had was the mulita (sp) which was a little too plain for me. The gordita on the other hand, while somewhere around 5 bucks (?), is topped with so much and along with the various condiments they have to offer it can be a meal within itself. Don't know if it knocks Gordos outta the ballpark but its still damn good and got me wishin' we had something like this on my bougie azz side of town *cough*southeast*cough*. Mos definitely going back for more.
