This is not quite 5 star, but it IS a solid 4 star most of the time. They built a newer store on Chandler Blvd that is closer to my house, but I have started going back to this location because they seem to make better food. Their salsa bar is not as good though, they do not have as many things in the salsa bar. 

I love the extreme Fajita burro if I'm real hungry, and the Green chili pork is pretty good as well. The Carna Asada is usually a little over cooked for my liking, but many people like it. Their Chicken Chimi is worth a try.
