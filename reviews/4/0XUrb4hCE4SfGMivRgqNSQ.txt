I recently moved from the Los Reyes de la Torta (which, apparently, used to be a Tortas La Presa location) to the Tortas La Presa #2 neighborhood, so I knew I had to possibly lower my expectations.  I was wrong!  The tortas at La Presa are excellent! I went in on a Wednesday night for a take out sandwich.  I ordered the Torta Especial which is breaded pork cutlet, ham, carnitas, cheese, grilled onions, jalepenos, avacado, tomato and special sauce on wonderfully fresh bread.  Beautiful!  There was a little more heat from this sandwich than those of Los Reyes, which I welcomed.  All of the toppings were fresh and tasty.  I am happy to be in the 'hood, I will be a regular!
