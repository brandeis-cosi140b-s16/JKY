I had not been here in a while, as I usually bring my lunch to work with me.  As my tummy told me that lunch time was near,  I looked up to see the free cup and $2 off coupon a Baja Fresh worker had handed me several weeks ago.  [My frugality funds my splurges.]  That was all I needed to inspire me to get my lunch here.  I was kicking myself for heading out right at noon, usually a downtown eatery nightmare, but they handled the load well.  Getting folks through the lines quickly, yet awkwardly as I had to weave my way through a couple of doors, the salsa bar and a maze set up to maximize the people in line. 
I ordered the Baja Burrito-Bare Style with Carnitas.  Bare style essentially means it is served like a salad.  I was impressed.  The Romain lettuce was fresh and crisp, the carnitas savory  and the salsas were fresh and quality.  I will likely go back, as I did take the survey online and got another $2 off coupon, but even if I didn't have a coupon I would go back and recommend to friends.
