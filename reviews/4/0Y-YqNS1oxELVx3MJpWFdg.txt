Fear not my fair skinned friends and come get some authentic and unique Mexican!

Obviously this place isn't winning any awards for ambiance or location but for value and food it's a pretty great lunch option.  Located in the Guadalajara Mercado on Arizona Ave, this is pretty much a spot in a mini food court surrounded by predatory cell phone companies, a western union location, and some clothing stores.  The menu is clearly laid out (in English) and ordering is fast and easy.  

The signature torta is $6 and will leave you full for hours.  You have numerous other tortas and burrito options as well in the $5-$6 range.  The torta ahogada has a great roll stuffed with roasted pork which all swims in a pool of sauce at your desired spice level.  It's good but I think next time I'll sample some of the burritos.  There is a toppings bar to add pickled onions, lime, cilantro, etc.  

If you're over in this area and want a good lunch for a good value then you can find it here.
