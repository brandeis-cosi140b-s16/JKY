A friend of mine once said "The sketchier the strip mall, the better the Mexican food" well this holds true when it comes to Casa Grande! I met a fellow Yelper here the other day and thank God we went for lunch because god only knows what it would have been like during night time. Casa Grande is authentic, like menus all in spanish with no english whatsoever and no pictures authentic. I took four years of spanish and grew up in South Florida so I like to think I can get by with my espanol skills. 

They have lunch specials of the day and I saw pollo y arroz so I had a semi understanding of what lunch would consist of. So much food for only six bones (check the pics) plus they give you soup as well which was brothy and full of veggies-woo hoo!The chicken was delicious and anytime I can get a serving of potatoes and rice, I'm happy for I am a gal who likes the carbs. I finished half of the plate and took the rest to go so really it's two meals for $6, my kind of place!
