Based on just my lunch salad and a margarita Caldero is unique and above the average in Mexican Cuisine with a interesting and not average dinner menu. Many people who are not fans of Mexican might be fans here.

They have several non ordinary salads and I picked the Bass salad but they ran out so I went with the almond crusted chicken salad. It was just the right amount of chicken that wasn't heavy or oily, it was prepared nice. The salad also had jicama red peppers and pecans. The vegetables were cut nice and tasted well together. I picked the mango dressing and it wasn't sweet but savory and interesting, they also have a tamarind dressing.

I don't recall the name of the margarita I had but it was a tropical fruit one with a hint of habanaro pepper. The margarita wasn't really sweet but was flavorful sort of a peach kind of fruit flavor with sour and the mild hot pepper hit your throat at the end of your sip in a nice way. The margarita was large ($6) and does give a buzz.

I noticed marinated whole fish on the menu  and nut crusted stuffed chillies and slow cooked beefs on the menu.

Service was friendly and efficient.
