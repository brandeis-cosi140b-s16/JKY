I'm a fan of Cantina 1511, Big Daddy Burger, etc....so I had to try out Paco's Taco's.  My husband and I stopped in on Sunday for an early dinner.  The place has only been open for about a week, and it did not disappoint.  The beef brisket taco is excellent, the service is excellent, and it's exciting to have this place close by in Southpark.  We will be back!
