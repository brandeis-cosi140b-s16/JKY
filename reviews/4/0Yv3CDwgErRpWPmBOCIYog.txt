I had the chicken sandwich and it was amazing! Had jalapeño bacon and chipotle mayo, which gave it an extra kick, but was not overwhelming. Even the chips have seasoning on them to make the chips and salsa even more delicious! My husband and mother-in-law both had the platter which had the chile relleño, chicken enchilada, and pork burro. They both loved it! I got to try a bite of their sopapilla, and it was phenom! I can't wait to try more on the menu. Also, great service!
