Great food, wonderful service, fair prices. Always hot fresh chips and delicious salsa waiting for you. Drinks are always refilled. Attentive staff. What could be better? 

I love the decor, but my kitchen is also decorated with the chili peppers. :) 

I've eaten here 3 times now, each time has completely satisfied my tummy, taste buds and my dislike for bad service. This means, I will keep going back and bring new people to try it out!!
