Came here with a huge group recently. We had 65+ people on the patio and the wait staff handled it like champs. I bought some tasty burrito that's supposed to be the best seller there and enjoyed my beer, but I wish you had craft beer. The patio is very nice & everyone was older so it was pretty chill there.
