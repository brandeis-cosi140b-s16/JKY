One of the best small Mexican joints around. It's very small inside but I've never seen it crowded. Most people seem to use the drive through. They do seem to take a while if you order using the drive through. Staff is polite and friendly and it's always clean inside. Food is always made as you order it and always taste good! If you're looking for quick authentic Mexican food this is your spot! Beats all other similar joints hands down.
