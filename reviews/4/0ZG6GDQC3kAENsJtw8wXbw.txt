I was picking up my car from an auto shop nearby when I noticed this new Mexican restaurant.  The chicken taco sign for $.79 drew me in and I was happy that I did.  All the items on the menu were cheap.  Their chicken taco had quite a lot of grilled chicken pieces in it and the pico de gallo topped it off nicely.  I also ordered their foot long burrito with char chicken for $4.99.  Although I am not an expert in Mexican cuisine, I thought this burrito tasted quite good and it really was a foot long.  This burrito actually feeds two with loads of rice and bean inside.  I will definitely come back and try their other cheap combo meals.
