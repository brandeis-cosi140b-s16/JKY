I don't understand the lack of love here for Qdoba. Maybe everyone has been sucked into the Chipotle burrito-sphere and the refried beans are affecting their brains. There are enough tortillas in the world to support more than one fast food burrito joint, people!

Don't get me wrong. I like Chipotle too. I will enjoy a burrito bowl there from time to time. But Qdoba has one thing Chipotle doesn't offer - their queso dip. A squirt of cheesy heaven, Qdoba's queso makes everything taste better. 

My favorite thing to get is their nachos. They load 'em with beans, your choice of meat, salsa, cheese, sour cream and 3-cheese queso. YUM! You get a heaping serving of salty yumminess for like $6.00. If I'm starving I can finish a whole plateful but there is certainly enough to share.

So do yourself a favor and indulge in a little queso therapy next time you're craving some fast mexican food. You may never visit Chipotle again.
