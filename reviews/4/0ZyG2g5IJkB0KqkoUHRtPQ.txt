Awesome grilled pork tacos, the beef ones are good to, but they can be on the fatty side most times. chicken delicious as well, but to me it doesn't top the pork. great salsa bar at every moreno's and awesome service. food always is hot and come out quickly. i love the horchata as well. i come here for a quick pit stop taco craving all the time!
