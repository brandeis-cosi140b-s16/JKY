I don't know why but my cousin and I are obsessed with this place. I've ordered out, been to happy hour and had a sit down meal. All very good. They offer a vegan menu which is a huge plus and serve breakfast all day. I've had the apps, entrees, and of course NACHOS. Nachos are a must. Vegan grub is pretty awesome I hear as well.

This week I went there and sat out on the patio which was very comfortable and pleasant. Our waiter "Nacho" Nick was awesome. Very friendly and accommodating. Even though one of our requests wasn't on the menu he made it happen - score!

Until next time Nacho Daddy, so many items to choose from I have to keep coming back until I'm tasted them all.
