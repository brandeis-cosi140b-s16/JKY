Fabuloso! I had a chicken chimichanga and it was HUGE and so delicious! We also ordered some chips and guac and they FRESHLY FRIED the chips. So, so good! Everything was fresh and the portions were large. This will be our new go-to quickie dinner spot. I just docked one star because I wish they served beer.
