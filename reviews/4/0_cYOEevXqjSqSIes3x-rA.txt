The food was good if your up at 1o'clock in the morning and hungry for Mexican food this is a good place to go. The beans and rice are ok but the mini tacos are pretty good. The staff is really nice and the food is cooked when you order it so not a bunch of old nasty laying around food and it's always consistent. Bottom line great late night meal or drunk food!
