Great place to have dinner outdoors! The atmosphere was great for a Friday night. The food was excellent and well portioned. Not the usual fill a massive plate with "OK" food and hope that you are so full that you forget how medicore it was, but truly good food. The place had two seperate parties going on and service did not suffer one bit. The table next to us was a party of self important jerks, but the manager came over and handled them with class! We will be back next time we are in town.
