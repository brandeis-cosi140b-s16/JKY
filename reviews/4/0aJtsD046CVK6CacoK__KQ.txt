Definitely the King of the Tortas. I love this place, great tortas and aqua frescas. 

It was featured on Man vs Food a couple of years ago, mainly on the reputation of their Torta del Rey, an enormous sandwich generally enough for 2 meals for me. The torta milanese is great as is the shrimp tostada. Parking can be problematic at peak lunch and dinner hours (it's in a smallish strip mall). They do take phone orders for take out.
