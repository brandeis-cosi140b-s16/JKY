Four of us went there for dinner on 11/29/10.  It is newly opened and the atmosphere is elegant and spacious.  The menu runs closer to Southwest/Mexican rather than Mexican/American.  Among us we had the pork tamale, the chicken & mushroom quesadilla, the guacamole, the chicken enchilada, fish tacos, Yucatan pork stew and sopapillas.  Service started with the margaritas and a basket of yellow corn, black corn, yucca, and plantain chips with two salsas.  Everything was excellent, but the real standouts were the guacamole and the Margarita de Taberna.  

We'll surely go back.  Our only reservations were that the menu could have been larger, and the waiter over-reacted when two of the diners expressed an aversion to cilantro.  Instead of bringing a cilantro-based sauce on the side, he skipped the sauce entirely on the tacos and tamale.
