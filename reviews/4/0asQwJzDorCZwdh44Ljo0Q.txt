First time to eat here and it was great! Nice place with paintings to admire while waiting (these are for sale you can check them out). Staff were really nice and served the food fast. Though I only ordered Sopapilla, I'd say, I will be back to try other food on the menu! Spicy food people should really come here. Plus, I love that they have Coca Cola!!
