Los Favoritos I consider the best mexican fast food. This one in particular is not as great as the one in scottsdale but I like it regardless. Better than filimuertos. The thing that I like the least is the salsas. They have not flavor. They should make them again like the one in scottsdale. The place is clean, the food is good all the time, costumer service could be better not that I have had a problem. Just keep cooking better than any other "-bertos" and I'll keep being a regular.
