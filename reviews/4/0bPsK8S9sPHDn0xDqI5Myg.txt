The food is fresh and the service is always engaging, even if seemingly a bit slower than would be expected. I've been the only one in the place a couple of times and each time I was mildly surprised at how long it took for my food to be ready. But, if that's the price to pay for good, relatively inexpensive food then so be it-it hasn't stopped me from coming back.
