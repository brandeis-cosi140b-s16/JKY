It's just another 'Berto's' around the phoenix area. It is pretty similar to most of the other places with a similar name. The one thing that really stands out about this place is that not only do they have 2 drive threws bit they have a walk up window that is also open all nigjt long! This is a plesent feature to a 'fast food' place, i know im not the only one who has tried to walk up to a drive threw and try to order because the inside was closed only to be rudly turned away. Well this walk up window will prevent that from happening at this location. As far as the food goes, they serve you a very generous portion of food. The burritos are huge, stuffed with the meat of your choice, carne asada, fish, beef, chicken, carnitas and then your choice of cheese beans and sauces. Great for a late night meal after a couple drinks.
