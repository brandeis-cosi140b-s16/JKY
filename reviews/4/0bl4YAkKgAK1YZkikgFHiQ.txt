So I gave Asado another try because I was hearing that the food had gotten better.  The chips and salsa are still great but now the food is also good.  I went for lunch and got a chicken burrito and my husband got a carne asada burrito.  At lunch the chicken burrito is only 8.95 what a deal.  I was impressed by the moistness of the chicken and the flavors.  The rice was even tasty.  I would tell you to try this place again if you haven't already.  I think it is worth another shot.
