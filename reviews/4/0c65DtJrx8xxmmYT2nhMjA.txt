One of my Vegas go to spots is Don Tortaco, so you can imagine my shock and sadness when I saw that this location was no longer there.

I'm not saying I started to weep uncontrollably, but I may have shed a tear or two.

Then my ever caring and super observant wife said,
stop being a big baby,
as she pointed to their new location across the street.

Then she said how nice it was that the new locale has a drive thru.

And just to show you how much she knows your truly,
the last thing thing she said was,
you better mention it was me who found it when you do your review. 

Oh my dear better half, of course, I'll make sure to mention you.
