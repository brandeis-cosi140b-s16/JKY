Cafe Rio is my favorite of these style places. I usually get the pork barbacoa tacos. Burritos and salads are good. Check out this place ( any location really).  

My only complain, is the wait times sometimes during rush times. Im patient, and I totally understand its a popular place, but why does it seem like chipoltle, qdoba, baja, or any other similar style place with similiar lines seem to move faster.
