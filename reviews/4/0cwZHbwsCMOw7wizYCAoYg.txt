Headed to Rubio's for the first time, and I was very pleased.

I ordered the California Bowl w/ chicken.  It was pretty good.  Would I eat it over Chipotle? No, but c'mon there's no "fast food" place that beats Chipotle.

The one thing that I LOVE about Rubio's is their salsa bar.  They had 6 different kinds of unlimited salsa!  I don't know about you, but when it comes to salsa, I'm a massive scooper not a petite little dipper.  I like as much salsa as possible with each bite and their unlimited selection suited my preferences perfectly, and the variety was great as well.

I'll definitely be back because it seems that they are more well known for their seafood dishes like fish tacos.  I'll head back and give those a whirl when I get some time.
