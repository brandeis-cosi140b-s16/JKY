This Chipotle was there right when we needed it - around 9 pm on a Wednesday when we were stumbling to the bus stop after the Yelp Elite Event at Olive or Twist.  We needed food to help soak up our free cocktails, and we needed it now!  What better way then with a yummy burrito?  Service was fast and friendly, and we got our burritos to go so that we could sit in Market Square and people-watch.  We listened to the music coming out of NOLA, and nommed our burrito snacks.  I always enjoy Chipotle, sometimes even craving it, and I like how they aim to serve sustainably raised ingredients.  It's always super satisfying and tasty, and you get exactly what you are hoping for.  And this one is in a great location, perfect for sitting outside and relaxing.
