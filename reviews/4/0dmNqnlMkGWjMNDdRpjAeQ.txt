I want to say I was surprised at the quality of this place, but you can kind of feel it's going to be different by the energy of the building just driving by. Tired of looking for good Mexican food in a place that should offer it on every corner, we often don't bother anymore. Espo's, as you will read in their Yelp write-up, existed for 40 years in this same location until some time back and then was reborn this last year. We found it a few months after its re-opening and it was packed with a variety of folks, many of whom had apparently just found it as we had. Yesterday we were there again and noticed how many of the patrons were of Mexican descent--a very good sign. The food is the best you'll find for 20 miles in any direction and very reasonably priced. I tend to stick with what I like, so I can only directly speak for the tacos and the chimis. Staff is super-friendly, vibe is warm and cheerful and decor is simple old-world rustic. And they now have beer! Great outdoor patio seating.
