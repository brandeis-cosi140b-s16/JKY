As a San Diego transplant in Pittsburgh, learning about Los Cabos during my sophomore year was a godsend. No longer did I have to wait until winter break to reunite with my beloved California Burrito :')

With that being said, get the California Burrito! I haven't tried anything else here besides that and the Carne Asada Fries (alright, but not up to SoCal standards). The California Burrito has carne asada, cheese, sour cream, guac, and fries (don't remember if you have to ask for guac or not, but do it just to be safe). Downside is that sometimes they have horchata and sometimes they don't - better always to have it than not.
