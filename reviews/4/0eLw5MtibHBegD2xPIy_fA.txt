Authentic Mexican food is tough to find in Charlotte but this place does a solid job of bridging that need. Reservations were easy enough. This places uses opentable. The ambiance is very family oriented; don't be surpised to see children and families dining there for dinner. I got the enchildas and they came with rice and beans. Although I got only two, the meal was large enough that it filled me up. Food was flavorful and fresh.
