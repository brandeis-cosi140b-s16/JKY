Love their chips,  salsa and beans they bring to the table when you're seated.  I have never had anything bad,  but my favorite is the Tortilla Soup. It usually has more chicken than I can eat,  but the flavors are wonderful.  They also have the most delicious Tequila Lime cupcakes. ...... To die for.
