Loved it! I loved the authentic Mexican feel of the restaurant, and loved the live music that was playing. We went on a Saturday night and were seated right away- we had a party if 4. I ordered a drink and we shared the guacamole and chips appetizer to start.  It wasn't a large serving, but it was very good. For my meal I ordered the floutas- I thought they were a little plain tasting. Probably would order something different next time, but everyone else at the table loved their meal. Service was very good and friendly staff. Will likely return!!
