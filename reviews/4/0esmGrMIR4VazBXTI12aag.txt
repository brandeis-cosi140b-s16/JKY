My fiancé and I were starving. Neither of us had eaten anything all day. So when he gave me the I don't feel like cooking let's order something look after getting home one night, I knew we were in trouble due to the fact that all there was to order near us was pizza. So, I opened yelp and stumbled on this gem. Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced. My fiancé had the three enchiladas plate and I had a bean rice and cheese burrito. He ate his so fast that I know it was good, although all he could manage to say was "Spicy." My bean rice and cheese burrito was excellent. Especially when I added a little bit of their Pico. The only thing Los Burritos can work on is their delivery time. I felt that waiting forty five minutes was a little long.  I give these guys four stars.
