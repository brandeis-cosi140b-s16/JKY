Lengua and adobado tacos are good. Ask for easy sauce on lengua because it is spicy. The buche(stomach) tacos is salty and I'm not a fan of the intestine tacos but the fianc√© liked it. Adobado taco sauce is really really good. The tortillas were good. I hate how crowded it was and how it was hard to find seats but if you team up just manage your time and look for the different meat lines. Next time I need to get the carne asada.
