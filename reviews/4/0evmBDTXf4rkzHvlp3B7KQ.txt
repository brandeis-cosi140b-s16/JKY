great food, amazing prices. dont understand the talk on previous reviews about a seedy strip mall. i've been to much worse and it's not the least bit dangerous. last night had 7 taco's, cheese quesodilla and carne asada quesodilla, total bill $16.47!!!! the food is absolutely delicious. staff is nice and helpful. the horchada is awesome as well.
