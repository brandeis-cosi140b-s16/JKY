Return trip this time for dinner and brought a new tastebud (aka boyfriend).  Ok seriously, amazing friendliness from the cashier girl.. she leaves the register since we were standing a distance away while we decide on the menu and comes up to talk to us...I asked what she suggested but told her I'm decided on the Cubana and bf is up in the air... she had the that's-a-nice-torta-but kind of look and then proceeded to try to describe a crunchy taco and its filling.  It didn't interest bf, so he went with a classic burrito filled w/ pork (pastor).

While we're waiting at a table, the cashier lady (who turns out to be the server and busser later) nonchalantly swings by and drops off in front of each of us a crunchy taco filled with potatoes dressed with red sauce and white crumbled cheese.  With a very surprised thanks, we got to them... OMG, from now on I'm ordering these Taco Durados (only 99cents each!).  Later when we tried to thank her again, she was quietly pleased and told us they come in either beef, bean or potato.  Probably will be my next meal.

Classic burrito w/ pork reminded me of bacos mixed with rice. The Cubano could of been good (salty but forgiveable, it's breaded steak, ham and who knows what else..I better be reasonable), but it was no match for the taco sample.  

Definitely extra star now...we're excited to come again and what kind, friendly service to make us feel comfortable!
