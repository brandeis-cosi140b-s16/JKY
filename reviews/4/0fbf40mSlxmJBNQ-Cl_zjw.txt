A conveniently located Chipotle inside of the Fashion Show Mall, this is my go to location for Chipotle once I get off work and for eating while shopping. The service is up to par with all of the other Chipotle locations that I have been to and the staff seems a little bit nicer even. The only downside to this location is that because it is located inside of a mall, the prices are a little bit more than a stand alone Chipotle. Overall a great place to get some food!
