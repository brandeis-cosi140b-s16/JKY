I went here when sunday brunch was over so the place was pretty empty, good for me because we were seated immediately.  Service was good the waiter was friendly and attentive.  I had a combo plate with a flauta (seriously it was a taquito or how phoenicians refer to them...rolled taco) and the chile relleno which was very good, a nice sized poblano with little seeds just as I like it.  I would definetly return to this place, however I won't say it is the best mexican food around. My sister had the menudo and liked it very much.  The beans were just ok but the cheese they use to top them off with made it better.
