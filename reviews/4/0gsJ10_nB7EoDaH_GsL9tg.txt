BEAUTIFUL MEXICAN RESTAURANT 

Ordered Combination dinners. 

Oxaca and Monterey Jack Enchilada and Crispy Flour Choula Chicken Taquito served with rice and choice of refried or black beans... very tasty

Yu-go selected Chili Relleno, Pork Tamale and Crispy Taco with Ground Beef... pleasantly surprised with the quality.

The food was more than plentiful and seasond perfectly to our south of the border preference. Priced very reasonably and certainly a bargin with a casino restaurant coupon.
