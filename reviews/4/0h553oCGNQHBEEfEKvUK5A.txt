My Barrio Queen margarita was so good that I wanted to spend the entire afternoon there and work my way through their entire list. While this was definitely the place, unfortunately, it wasn't the time and I stuck with just the one.

I like a good traditional margarita - tequila and lime on the rocks and nothing else, but the El Tamarindo on the menu talked me into upping my margarita game. Tequila, tamarind juice (I think), (fresh) lime juice and Tapatio hot sauce. The straw is coated in a tamarind paste. Lick the salt, bite the tamarind, drink the margarita - it's so good! Sweet, spicy and tangy all in one sip.

They've also got 400+ tequilas. GOOD LUCK!

Our service was super poor, but thanks to the other servers for picking up the slack of ours. She was super friendly! ...Just never around or available.
