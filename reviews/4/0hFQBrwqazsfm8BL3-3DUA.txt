Wow, we arrived after a two day road trip to Phoenix only to find this little gem right around the corner! Happy hour is M-F from 4-6 and is well worth it! The margaritas are really what sold me on this place. Super simple, lime juice, tequila, agave nectar, salt. We shared some of the small plates from the happy hour specials and everything was delicious. The queso fundido definitely had a kick to it which was great. The bartender, Chris, was super friendly and very attentive. All around good place, can't wait to go back!
