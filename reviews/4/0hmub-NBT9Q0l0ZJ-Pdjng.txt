Believe it or not 4 stars.  This was probably my fourth visit here & least enjoyable.  Since all the other visits were so great, I graded higher.

Tiny lil place made of shipping containers.  My complaint today was overly chewy chips.  Also, the chips were caked with salt.  They tasted stale & I was given diet coke.  I didn't notice until almost home.

Ok the part where I can be positive.  Fresh food & friendly staff.  I love the verde & brushfire salsa.  Yesterday I tried the potato croquets & they were pretty good.  Hot as hell so I know they're fresh.  Then my shrimp taco was yummy as well.  Shrimp was spicier that expected but I still loved out.

In the past I've tried the beans, friend shrimp & potatoes.  None of them let me down.  They were all fresh cooked & really delicious.  

I love this "sit down" restaurant quality from this cute little drive thru place with only outside seating.
