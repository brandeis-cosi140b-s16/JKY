Good, fast specialty Mexican food. You order similar to 'Some Burros' and 'Cafe Rumba', on line. Small menu but big portions regardless what you order. 

I had the shredded chicken salad with the toppings I preferred. My wife had a fire-grilled chicken burrito- which will last her three meals!  Both were hearty and very good tasting. 

We also had fresh chips, salsa and guac. Yum! Very fresh in every regards. 

They also have many drink options with sodas, horchatas, and teas. 

We were surprised, yet very pleased with their food.

One downfall: some new employees had a poor attitude, like they didn't want to be there. Not good for a business that opened three days ago!
