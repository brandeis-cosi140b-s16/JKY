I was really in the mood for enchiladas this weekend. I live in this area and drive by this place daily, and had never paid attention to it for some reason. (Their sign is hard to read while driving.) I searched on Yelp for enchiladas and found this place. 

I was there about 430PM on Saturday afternoon and I was the only customer, which I thought was odd, although it's the first couple of weeks after Christmas and that seems to be a slow time. At any rate, I had enchiladas rancheras, typical preparation, great flavor,  with better than average rice and beans, chips and salsa. It was better than Michoacan the last time I was there, several months ago and the server was very friendly and efficient. 

By the time I left, there were several other customers which was good. I hate seeing restaurants go out of business due to lack of customers.
