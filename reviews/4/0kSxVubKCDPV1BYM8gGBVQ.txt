Very delicious food and the lady behind the counter was friendly and thoughtful. All the meats were great flavor...steak was a bit sweet for me but they let you sample. Te pig was delicious, a bit salty on its own but in a bowl packed with rice, beans and an abundance of salsas it was quite perfect. There homemade hot sauces are good but sweet, my fav was the mango/pineapple/habanero which added a touch of sweetness to the bowl I ordered. Would definitely come back.  I'm not sure what would make this a give, potentially a bit more air conditioning, was very warm and a better soda selection.
