I really love this place! Tasty "Trendy Tex-Mex/Latino" food. It's easier to get in and be seated than Cabo Fish taco and I would say the drinks are stronger and the food is just as good. Plus, the salsa here is better than the weird corn version they serve at Cabo Fish. 

I REALLY love that Loco Lime allows friendly dogs on the patio. I'll bring mine next time, as long as it's not too hot. I'll be back for sure.
