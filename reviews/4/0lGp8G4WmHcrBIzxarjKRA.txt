I love Los Betos.  I love all the 24 hour Mexican food places in Arizona.  It shocks me that these places don't really work in other parts of the country.  

I'm writing about this Los Betos because I live within 3 blocks of them.  God knows their food has probably lead to a healthy hardening of my 24 year old arteries.  I eat here at least once a week, and their food is always pretty amazing.  It's just delicious, greasy Mexican food at its best.

Watch out for the 2AM rush, as that's when the drunks show up en masse.  You will likely have to wait in line, and potentially deal with ridiculous behavior.  This pretty much goes for any of these 24 Mexican joints.
