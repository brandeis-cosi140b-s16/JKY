I found out about this place by accident as I stopped to get gas at the next door station and noticed menus for El Ranchero so I took one. I noticed that it is a taco shop located adjacent to the gas station and after browsing the menu I made note to come back.

My sweetheart and I were in the mood for Mexican food one night so we stopped here to give it a try and we also got 10% our tab for checking in on Yelp!

The food was super good, fresh, authentic, generous with great prices!

What we ordered...

shredded beef burrito which was stuffed with tender meat, green peppers and onion!
rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, hand stuffed and rolled!
carne asada soft street tacos, full and delicious!
California burrito, jam packed good!

The place is clean and the staff is Amazing. You can dine in, take out or use their drive thru window for on the go grub! We decided to dine in on our last visit and it was a nice and comfortable experience.

They boast about being Authentic and they are! I have to say they have the best homemade frijoles (refried beans) I have ever tasted!

We will be back again for sure, and lucky for us they are close to our home!
