There was a 30 minute wait, but it was well worth it.  

The complimentary chips were thin and crispy and not greasy and served with a red and a green salsa and an addictive warm white bean dip.

Our party had asada tacos, pork quesadilla, shrimp tacos and the spicy asada burro.  Everyone liked the food, the burro (burrito) I had was a normal size,  not some monster giant burrito it would take a family of 5 to eat.   The spicy salsa/marinade on the steak was very tasty and there was no fat on the meat.

I'm adding this to the rotation when I'm in the area.
