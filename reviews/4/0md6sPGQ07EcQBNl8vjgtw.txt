Las Famosas de jose  is a better local torta shop.  Better because this Jose guy really puts his special touch to the menu.  The drinks are authentic freshly made staple fruit juices and horchatas/jamaicas made from scratch.  There are different salsa's marked from different regions of Mexico.  Much more than your generic red or green like Robert-o's.  **The super hot salsa sauce that is white colored is liquid fire and I can't get enough of it!**.  Famosas is also known for offering an extensive selection of Mexican meats to choose from.  Anything you could possibly want on a torta, he just may have.  The 1 thing I don't think I saw was tripitas, which I may be wrong about, but it is such an acquired taste anyway. You can order any combination even if it's not on the menu.  The specialty here are the GIANT TORTAS!  They are hee-gan-tay and there are about 6 or so to choose from.  You need to share these with someone or someone's.     

The LA PIQUITA is your typical "kitchen sink" torta with almost all the meats on the menu including pork leg, milanesa(breaded beef), ham, chorizo, avacado lettuce Oaxaca cheese.  It is literally a double king size torta and it's heavy.  At least 3 lbs guaranteed.  The best part is it is soo damn delicious!  I am not b.s.ing it tastes so good I wish I could eat more than just a half.  After eating half of one you get that "hit the wall" signal from your stomach.    

I don't really dig south of the border cuisine, personally.  Which you now probably hate me for saying.  Well, I just don't.  This is the one place that I choose to go to when I change my mind.  Better than your taco shop!
