I heard so much about this place, and I've been wanted to try... 

Food: it is tapas style, or in Japanese izakaya style.  Each portion is small so it will be good if you order about two dishes per person to share with the group.  Everything we ordered was very good, great flavor, nicely presented. Looked yummy and tasted yummy too.

Dates wrapped in bacon: I like the sauce on the dish. Dates and bacon are interesting mix but this sauce nicely mixed together.

Suzuki roll: I liked the smell and taste of slightly deep fried? rice around the roll.
Maya roll: Double spicy (spicy tuna and spicy sauce (I think it was wasabi base sauce).  Nonetheless, liked the flavor.
Kimuchi fried rice: tasted better than the one I make at home. Smelled the kimuchi but it wasn't overwhelming at all.   Sometimes kimuchi could be strong, but I think the sauce on the dish toned it down to the level the kimuchi was enjoyable.
Chinese Chicken salad: nothing fancy...
We shared three deserts and all were good. 

This place said Mexican Asian fusion but the way they used difference sauce reminded me of French food.  I think they used French dressing for Chinese Chicken salad
Nice decor inside, mix of Mexican and Asian. I didn't necessarily loved it but it was certainly interesting for sure.

Service: although it was good but very slow... We were there for lunch and ended up being there for two hours. So if you are in a rush, this place is not good for you. Go there only if you want to enjoy the fun atmosphere with a group of friends to enjoy conversation.

Food was so interesting, I want to come back and try all the rest when I have more time. I like French, Mexican and Asian in general. When combined, it is perfect of all.
