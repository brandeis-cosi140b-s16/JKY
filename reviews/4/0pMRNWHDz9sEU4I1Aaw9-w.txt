I went to Casa Reyna for dinner and overall it was a very good experience. It's located in a basement that feels warm and cozy without being claustrophobic. I had the Guiso vegetariano with a side of roasted corn salad and another side of spicy pickled cactus salad. The Guiso was rich and hearty and very flavorful, it comes with tortillas so I made sort of tacos with it. The portion was generous, I ate about half. It was filled with lots of different veggies and beans, in a red-brown sauce. It was everything good about Latin vegetarian food, with lots of flavor, not just a mess of bland beans and cheese.The corn salad was great, there was a charred flavor to it. I was very excited about the pickled cactus salad and wasn't disappointed. It was mixed with some peppers and onions that were also pickled, and was pretty spicy. I expected the cactus to be slimy but it wasn't at all, it was about the texture of a pickled beet. Overall very good Latin food.
