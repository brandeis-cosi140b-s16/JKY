Love the burgers and like the staff.  (They could use a little more personality - not quite like Dutch Brother coffee, but maybe a smile or two..)

They were a little quick to close the patio on a Sunday.  So we had to fend for ourselves to take a seat.  We laughed as 4 different staff people tried to get out the locked patio door, until one wise one finally decided to unlock the door.

The burgers a just like In & Out Burgers.  Very delish.
