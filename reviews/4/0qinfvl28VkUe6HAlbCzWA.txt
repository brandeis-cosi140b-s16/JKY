The food was delicious and are waiter was great she was on top of everything, this kitchen made a mistake on our order but our waiter got it situated no problem! I was very happy with my portion size their was so much food we had left overs. some of the best Mexican food you'll get an Arizona I highly recommend this spot if your ever in the area hit it up the drinks and food are amazing!
