Just tried Sabor Latin Street Grill in Indian Trail where Genaros used to be. By the Sports Clips (Walmart mall). It's pretty good! All fresh, hand made food. Large empanadas (beef, chicken, vegetable, chorizo),  beef arepas (cheese and ground beef stuffed) yucca frita, soft tacos. They will have take out menus in a week and liquor license in a month but only beer. I recommended they have at least a red wine or sangria. My personal favorites were the guacamole  (with onion, tomatoe in it) and the shredded chicken over quinoa with sliced avocados on it. I think it was a bowl. Fresh cilantro and lime. The chicken wasn't as salty (not a criticism, I just don't do salt) as the ground beef so I personally enjoyed it more. Chorizo was good with just the right bit of spice to it. I'd recommend more lime especially for the chicken, great!!! Loved the guacamole,  my favorite I even ate it with a fork and put it on my food :) They redid the inside too and the prices are fantastic. I walked out with three bags of food for about $42 and I tried all the main dishes. I forgot to try the beans - next time.
