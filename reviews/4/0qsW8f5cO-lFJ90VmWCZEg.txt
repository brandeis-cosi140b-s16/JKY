This is my fav del taco. Also quick and efficient. I don't mix meat and dairy so I always ask for "without meat" and they never get it wrong. They give me as much fire sauce as I want. And for those in know, the pretty black lady who works at night has an amazing voice and used to sing at a lounge downtown.
