Tony's is a great little mom and pop restaurant. It's family owned, owners are super nice. Most Mexicans restaurants taste pretty much the same if you order carne asana burritos or cheese enchiladas. You have to venture to find the good stuff. Their fried shredded beef tacos are amazing. Not too greasy with Mexican cheese and peppers on top. So addictive. Also their chile verde burrito is very tasty.
