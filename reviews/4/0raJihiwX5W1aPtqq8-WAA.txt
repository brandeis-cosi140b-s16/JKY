The place is very clean and bright.  We had a 'Deal Chicken' coupon and was pleasantly surprised that the young lady at the cash register was well aware of it and knew exactly how to handle it.  It came with a very large basket of chips and the salsa bar was excellent (especially if you mix the salsa and the pico de gallo).  I had the carnitas burrito and I thought it was too dry but that is sometimes true of carnitas.  However, it was a simple fix with addition of the salsa/pico de gallo.  My wife had the scrimp tacos which  were very good.  I am not much of a fan of rice in my burrito so that was a little bit of a turn off but then again I could have probably ordered it with no rice had I known.  It was a very safe place as there were 8 policemen there for lunch!! LOL   There are better Mexican food places in Phoenix but I would certainly not mind going back if I was in the area as it was quick and the selections were plentiful.
