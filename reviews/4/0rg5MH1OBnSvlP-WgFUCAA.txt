Last night we had a craving for mexican food and we remembered seeing a coupon in the Savvy Shopper for Las Fuentes which recently opened in surprise.

The coupon we had was for buy one entree get on free of equal or lesser value up to 8.99.

being that we just had our yard landscaped a free entree was very enticing.  We arrived to find a well decorated mexican restaurant, we started looking over the menu and after a few minutes we started to think the joke was that nothing on the menu costs less than 8.99 except salads.  luckily my wife was able to find a tostada for 8.50, I ordered the fountain sampler which was their appetizer sampler platter.  We got our food shortly after.  Both plates were huge, I had a mountain of nachos, several quesadillas, taquitos, and mini-chimichanga's.  the nachos were very cheesy and tasty and I really enjoyed the mini-chimi's.  I probably only ate half the plate and had plenty of leftovers.  Overall the food was very good.  the coupon was a bit offsetting though when the average menu price was 14.99.  I'd like to come back when we're less broke and order some of the more specialized entrees.
