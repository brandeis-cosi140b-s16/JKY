I've been coming here for over 15 years and still love my bean wet burritos! This place a small "authentic" Mexican restaurant where you can venture out of your usual arroz con pollo and try some more of the unusual Mexican dishes such as cabeza (head), lengua (tongue), and tripa (tripe). Not feeling that adventurous? That's okay.. they have lots more yummy dishes to try!
