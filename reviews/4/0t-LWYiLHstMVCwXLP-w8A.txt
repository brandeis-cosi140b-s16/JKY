Not the cheapest mexican place around, but the flavors are there.  Comfortable atmosphere and excellent service.   The lunch specials for less than $10, and happy hour til 7 will have me coming back.  The black beans were good, and the spanish rice was fluffy and flavorful.  Chips were thin, crispy and not greasy.
