Again 4.5 stars for Manuel's!  I love this place.  Great salsa, fresh chips.  The Margarita's are delish and the service has always been good to excellent.  

I sometimes stop in just to buy chips and extra extra salsa to take home and maow down in the privacy of my living room, so no one can see me scarfing down the chips and licking the salsa container clean.

Their food is always hot and fresh tasting, I must admit I've had better, but not by much. Go Go Go and while you are there try all their flavoured margaritas.
