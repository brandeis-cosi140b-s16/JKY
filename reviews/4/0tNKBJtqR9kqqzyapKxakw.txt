I've been by this place  a thousand times and finally decided to stop by last Friday.  I wasn't impressed at all when I walked in, I had to seat my self so I was thinking hmm will I have to get my food my self as well.  There was a lady standing behind the counter yelling across the room to me, asking what I wanted to drink.  So I let her know, and again thought will she throw me my drink since she yelled?  Any who, finally a waitress came and I oredered mine and my little girl food.  The basket of chips and salsa was good and warm.  When I got my food, I was shocked at how much I got.  I know that just about any authentic Mexican place you go to you get an astounding amount of food.  But I ordered a side of rice and beans and bascially got a full plate size of both.  Not complaining it was really good, the guacamole was amazing better than any guacamole I've ever had, it was a little spicy but really good.  I had fajita quesadillas and they were super good, it was like eating a chicken grilled cheese on tortillas.  And the sweet tea, oh my it was the best sweet tea I've ever had at any Mexican restaurant I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  I will be going back, I met a lady there that enjoyed the place so much she was on her thrid visit for the week.  So I will be back, don't let the look fool you.
