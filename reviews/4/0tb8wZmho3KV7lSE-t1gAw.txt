Barrio Urbano is tiny spot/smaller version of Barrio Caf√© located in the large Culinary/Yard complex. 

We came in for happy hour the other day and sat at the bar to enjoy a few snacks. 
I tried the hibiscus margarita and it was delicious, not too sour with the perfect topping of hibiscus to balance it out. We also split a green chili dip that had slow roasted melt in your mouth pork and a couple of the quesadillas. Everything really good and our bartender was friendly. We will definitely be back to try the 25+ tacos they serve!


Did I mention the ridiculous happy hour? It goes from 7am-6pm ($5 apps, margs and  1/2 off tequila, tacos, apps)..
