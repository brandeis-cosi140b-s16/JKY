Good food, good price, and good service.  I was there on a Saturday early evening.  It's a small restaurant and tucked into a corner so it could be difficult for some to find.  I enjoyed everything I ate.  I'll most likely become a regular customer once I move to Charlotte later this month.  Thumbs up!
