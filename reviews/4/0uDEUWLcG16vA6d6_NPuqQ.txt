The husband and I had a late lunch here today and it was surprisingly lovely. I was a little nervous going in because the place was just about empty. Despite this, the food was clearly fresh and tasted good. I had the carne asada torta (10$) on the the waiter/bartender's recommendation and it was very tasty. The bun was soft, the meat was tender, and it had a charred jalapeno on it (which really made the sandwich). It came with papitos (fries) which were fairly standard. The husband had carne asada tacos (9$) which came with rice and beans. He really liked the beans (I thought it was just ok, but I'm not a big bean person). My one critique is that their chips and salsa costs 4$ and the salsa isn't very spicy at all.... I would hope that for 4$ you might get at least a couple varieties of salsa. Regardless, the food was good, the service was attentive, and the prices were maybe just slightly on the high side (I did see their dinner menu which is significantly more expensive, but seems to be more on the 'fancy' side). I would like to come back here for happy hour, you can't really beat 1$ tacos and half priced apps (like the cheese dip which sounded yummy).
