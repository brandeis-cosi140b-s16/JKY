Dear World,

You know the drill. It's lunch time. You are hungry. You don't know what you want or where you want it. You don't go to sites like google or yahoo. You go to Yelp. That's where the searches are taking place. Steve Jobs even said so in a video. I know because I saw the video. 

Anyway, on this particular day, my former boss says, "Dave, how do you feel about Loco Patron". I said..."works for me." 

So the first paragraph of this review was completely meaningless.

In any case, we sat outside on the patio for lunch, and I ordered the steak salad. The steak was cooked to perfection, the dressing captured the true essence of all things salad, and the greens weren't wilted. They were crisp, fresh and delightful.

The service wasn't memorable, but it wasn't bad. 

Love,

Me.
