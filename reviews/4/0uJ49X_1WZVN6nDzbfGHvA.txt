Fantastic, authentic Mexican food with many delicious seafood options. We lived in Texas for five years and got really spoiled by the delicious Mexican food options there. Charlotte does not have many good options, in my opinion. But Tacos and Tequila in downtown Matthews gives me hope! As many small, family-owned restaurants learn, it can be difficult to hire and keep good staff. That seems to be one of their issues, which may explain the low ratings from some Yelpers. But of the 10-12 times we have dined there, maybe once did we feel the service was lacking. The rest of the time, we were greeted and seated quickly and the service and food were great. 

Let's talk about the food: If you like seafood, check out their seafood menu first. Bypass the enchiladas and all the typical stuff and try their sopa de marisco, which is a delightful seafood stew filled with fresh shellfish and seafood. It's enough to share, really! They also have great fajitas. My husband goes crazy for their pollo con arroz which is simple and filling and a perfect Mexican "comfort food". I also highly recommend their guacamole, which is prepared table side. Oh and did I mention the reasonable prices? 

Drinks: okay so don't be boring and get the house margarita. Try their margarona, a margarita with a small corona beer inverted into the glass. Yum! My new favorite way to enjoy a margarita- love that it cuts the sweetness and the beer adds a little fizziness to the whole concoction. Also- if you like a sweeter cocktail, they have a special margarita that is hand mixed and served in a half gourd, complete with plenty of fruit garnish. So fun and yummy.

Lastly- be sure to duel it out on the beer pong/ping pong table while you wait for your entree. 

Give T & T a chance, Matthews. It may just surprise you and become a new favorite!
