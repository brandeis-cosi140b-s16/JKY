Enjoyed my visit here recently on a date. 

When you walk in, the interior is very striking with a large, what seems to be an Oak tree replica in the center of the space. Service is excellent. The hostess was very kind, complimented me on my handbag and seated us quickly. Our server was very attentive and inquisitive. He also demonstrated that his skill in recommending a refreshing coconut martini that was quite tasty! My boyfriend and I thought it was also nice that he informed us the portion sizes with the various entrees so that we would pick something that suited us best. 

mmmm the beef tacos were so delish!! The meat was so tender and flavorful and it came with a pineapple salsa that was just the right addition.
