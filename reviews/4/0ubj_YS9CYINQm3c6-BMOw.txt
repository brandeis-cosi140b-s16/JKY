As a general rule, I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, but I do enjoy a good fish taco. For some reason, it seems that the vast majority of Mexican restaurants do not offer fish tacos on their menus. That's probably because it's harder to get it right compared to a chicken or carne asada taco. Fortunately, there is Rubio's. Its whole claim to fame is the original Baja-style fish taco and as far as I'm concerned, Rubio's makes one of the best. Crispy beer-battered fish is served with shredded cabbage, mild salsa, and a tangy white sauce in a flour or soft corn tortilla. It's just as delicious as it sounds, but it tastes better if you eat it right away before the batter has a chance to get soggy. On Fish Taco Tuesdays, the original fish taco is only $1.25 after 2:30pm.

We also enjoy their carnitas rajas taco with its tender and tasty pork. My wife often orders their balsamic and roasted veggie salad with grilled chicken. Their salsa bar has 3 different salsas: mild green, spicy red, and my favorite, the chipotle. For the health conscious, they offer a grilled Mahi Mahi version which is very tasty as well. Sure there are other items on their menu, but we typically stick with our favorites.

Rubio's is a great choice for an inexpensive meal that tastes good. With friendly and efficient counter service and surroundings that are clean and comfortable, what more could you ask for? If you join their "Beach Club" email list, they will send you coupons on a regular basis, including a free meal on your birthday.
