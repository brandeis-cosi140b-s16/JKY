Top Shelf is what I call "Mexican Comfort Food."  It's the kind of Mexican food that I grew up with - cheesy, sorta greasy, good food.  Their enchilada sauce is killer.

It is definitely the kind of place you go to when you want a good, solid meal - it isn't WOW, but it isn't bad.  

I heard once that the sign of a good Mexican food is good beans - Top Shelf has them.  I never asked if they are vegetarian... at the time, I didn't want to know. (so they probably aren't)

Go to Top Shelf.  Not on a first date, but on the 4th or 5th, when you want a good meal without any pretention.  Yum.
