Manny gets it right. I have lamented the absence of San Diego style Mexican anywhere near Pgh, let alone the East coast. Los Cabos is decent but I feel these folks are a bit more true to form. They have great specials for lunch everyday, and the carne asada burrito is bomb. Thankfully I work 5 minutes away, no more subway on rte 51 for lunch anymore.
