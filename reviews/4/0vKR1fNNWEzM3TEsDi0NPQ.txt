The service and salsa get five stars here at this little place. 

It was busy the night we went in which tells you it's a Wickenburg favorite. 

I am not a vegetarian, but I like go towards veggie options when I go out to eat. Mexican food veggie choices are usually rice, beans & cheese. Boring!! So it was refreshing to see the Spinach enchiladas on the menu. And it was pretty good too. 

My hubby got cheese enchiladas and thought they were pretty bland and the cheese wasn't completely melted and gooey, as an enchilada should be. He wasn't overly excited with them. Seeing as that is his go to Mex dinner, he's pretty much an expert on good enchiladas. These didn't make the grade.
