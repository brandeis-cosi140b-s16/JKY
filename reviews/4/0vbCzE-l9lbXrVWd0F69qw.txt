Awesome tacos - I highly recommend the carne asada.  Quesadillas are good too, but there isn't much of a taste-difference.  We also tried a burrito, but it wasn't that impressive at all.  The beans were good, but I probably wouldn't order them again.  

Indoor seating is very limited, so avoid peak times if you are trying to sit inside.  Parking is also a bit of a challenge at times.  

Overall, this is a tasty little lunch spot. You can't really go wrong with what you order.  My biggest complaint is the FLIES inside.  Eat a taco in one hand and swat flies with the other.
