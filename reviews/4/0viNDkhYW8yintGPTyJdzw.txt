Stopped in at Havana Grill for lunch this past weekend. It made high marks for simple and flavorful food, friendly service and a pleasant atmosphere. We started with the Papas Rellenas, which were surprisingly flavorful, even with the heavy potato on the outside. 

I ordered the Pollo A La Plancha as my entr√©e, which was basic but delicious. The onions were cooked just enough to take out the bite but still remain a little crisp, the chicken was moist, and the black beans and rice were the perfect compliment. 

I definitely plan on going back soon. Especially since Happy Hour is 4-9 PM every day!
