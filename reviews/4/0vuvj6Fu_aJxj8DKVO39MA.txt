Food here is great. One of my favorite Mexican restaurants, and they use Hatch chilies. Depending on the day/ waiter  yes, I may have to wait for a refill, but that's happened at one time or another everywhere I go regularly. 

Waiting for a meal is a treat, though often I fill up on the chips and salsa they bring out. Not only that but they bring out mild and spicy salsas as well as bean dip. Which is great since I then take most my food home, and it becomes lunch for the next day.

Food is plentiful as well as their size of their margaritas. Price is moderate, comparable to most other sit down Mexican restaurants.
