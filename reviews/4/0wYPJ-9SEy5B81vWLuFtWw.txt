Stopped in for a late "birthday dinner" for my partner and his sister.  Lots of vegetarian options and the staff were very friendly!  Our orders didn't take too long to come out and they didn't seem to mind us hanging around after the meal (we were there a while).  Overall, I'd definitely go back :)
