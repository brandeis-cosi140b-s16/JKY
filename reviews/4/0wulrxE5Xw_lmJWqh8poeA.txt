The good: Food is amazing, I had the SWORD FISH TACOS- DELICIOUS, drinks were not only very good but unique in the style they were made, the service was tip top, they have indoor/outdoor seating.

Not so good: Be sure to make a reservation as this place can get packed, not a good spot for a date or intimate setting, the seating is terrible- you might as well have dinner with the strangers next to you- I promise they are that close.
