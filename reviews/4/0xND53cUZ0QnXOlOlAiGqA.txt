I've been here a handful of time, and have yet to be disappointed. You start with chips and salsa which are nothing more than average. I ordered the Don Jose Special it comes with a tamale, cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco, and a bean tostada, with a choice of rice or beans. Everything was amazing, my personal favorite was the tacos! It's a small restaurant but don't let the size intimidate you, the food is delicious. Best part is their only 2 minutes away from me :)
