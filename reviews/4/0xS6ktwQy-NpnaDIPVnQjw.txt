Stopped in for dinner on our way to the Mesa Arts Center and so glad we did. It had been years since I dined at El Charro last. My mom and I split the cheese and bean tortilla and it was AMAZING! I'm still craving it!!! My mom had the sour cream enchilada and I had the sour cream enchilada and the green chili enchilada. Both were good but the cheese and bean tortilla stole the show!
