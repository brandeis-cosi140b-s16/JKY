Lime garlic asian fries for a buck. Incredible. Best way to spend a dollar. To be honest I've never had mexican eats fused with Korean flavor.  I also had the tacos which I was so inspired by, for this food truck's boldness to try something different and original. Sidenote: i LOVE celantro. Me and celantro are bff's. Wherever and whenever I ask for a side of celantro, I'm hoping for finely chopped 4 ounces. This guy delivered with no questions asked. It put a smile on my face. The guy that owns the place is pretty cool, a chatterbox I could barely bite my food from conversing with the guy, but needless to say, friendly and chill. You get what you pay for, for food trucks. I recommend the lime fries. 

Wish it was a mobile truck to cruise around the city.
