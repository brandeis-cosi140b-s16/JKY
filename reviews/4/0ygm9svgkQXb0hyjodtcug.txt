After pondering whether to go to Roberto's or try out Laurita's my wife and I finally landed on trying a new hole in the wall. We were very happy with the results. 

If you've read my Mexican Food reviews in the past you will know that the key to my heart is through a bean & cheese burrito. Something so simple can often times go so bad. It's a travesty really. I wasn't sure what to expect from Laurita's. The establishment itself used to be a Roberto's and still sports some of the old Roberto's attire. Fortunately, their bean burrito isn't anything like Roberto's. 

They have numerous specials at ridonkulously cheap prices. A coke, bean & cheese burrito, and a churro for the mere price of $3.99. Holy guacamole is that cheap! The beans are very good, the burritto could have used some extra cheese (since I did pay for extra cheese). The beans were piping hot and the burrito was massive. I could barely finish it. Top it off with a churro that was just a notch below a Disneyland churro and now we're talking a good meal. My wife had the wet bean & cheese burrito. She definitely liked it, personally I didn't care for the enchilada sauce (I prefer more of the cherry red colored sauce, this one was a little darker - but not bad according to her). 

The service was surprisingly good. Can't say I've had too much good service at Taco Shops, but the gentleman running the register, filling drinks, and providing refills was exceptionally friendly. Much appreciated! 

I'll definitely be back to burrito it up at Laurita's.
