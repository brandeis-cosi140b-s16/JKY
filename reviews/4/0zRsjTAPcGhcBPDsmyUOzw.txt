We've always loved Salsa's, but always had two reservations about going there: 1. the bar area (where smoking was legal) was too close to a lot of seats, therefore you'd inhale smoke all night and 2. it got crowded fast on "family" nights.  We would usually just go for lunch to avoid the crowd.

Well, two thing happened: 1. North Carolina outlawed smoking in all restaurants and 2. Salsa's expanded!  They've added a fresh tortilla maker and a place for a live band.  We went last Friday night to see our friend's band play and it was the same great Salsa's food in a wonderful atmosphere.  There was still a wait for a table, showing that the place is even more popular now!

Menu recommendations:

Pork Carnitas - I challenge any one person to finish this.  My wife usually has 2-3 meals from it.

Any other fajita - all of them are great, but now add in the fresh tortilla experience and they are no longer "just a fajita".

Tacos al Carbon - a great hot sauce and the onion/cilantro combination make these tacos jump

Enchilada Suizas - when you're in the mood for enchiladas done differently with a tomatillo sauce and queso!

And, getting back to the live band, they had the volume of the band set perfectly.  You could clearly hear them, but you didn't have to shout to have a conversation at your table.
