I seriously almost gave 5 stars for such a huge legitimate reason and possibly the only thing you need to know about El Dorado Cantina: GMO FREE AND ORGANIC MEXICAN FOOD! 

That's not a ?
That's an ! 

Love, love, love this restaurant for that main reason being, for average yummy Mexican, amazing service every single time, and a really fun and hip lounge atmosphere that stays open 24/7. Don't expect authentic or San Diego and come with friends because you LOVE to eat Mexican before or after you party or on your lunch breaks and most importantly because you want to vote "Yes" for organic and non GMO movements. Yippee!
