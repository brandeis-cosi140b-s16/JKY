$5 lunch specials every day, all day long. You can't beat that. Small restaurant attached to Doc Hollidays. It is still family and kid friendly (they do have a kids menu). Good food, delicious salsas and great service. I do hope they succeed. I will definitely be back for another one of those $5 deals!!
