Came in...ordered food....got served...ate. It was that simple. I got the chicken fundido being that I'm on the slightly hungover side. It really satisfied my cravings of Mexican food. I enjoy the simplicity of a burrito stuffed with chicken and smothered in fundido. The rice is delicious. One suggestion: if you and your partner are debating on getting a side of rice or beans, know that "sides" can easily fill 2 people
