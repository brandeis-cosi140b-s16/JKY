What is better than Garduno's margarita brunch in the spring, poolside, followed up by a movie to sober you up by? 

If I were doing all of that with Johnny Depp, that's pretty much it.

The food is just regular Garduno's food which, if you've been in Vegas long, you've probably had elsewhere.  I really like their guacamole.

But really, the thing that seals the deal here is their Sunday margarita brunch.  A bounty of food for a small, small price (add more for the adult beverages) and you can sit by the water.  

Also, since it's Sunday morning, all of the club kids are still in their rooms so you can almost forget that you're at the Palms!  Score!
