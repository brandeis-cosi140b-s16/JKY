Located in the Target shopping center next to Michael's, Ulta, Nike, etc., Maribel's was not super easy to find after we yelped it. There's a sign hanging up next to Doc Holiday's Saloon. Apparently Maribel's took over the restaurant part and the next door bar is still Doc Holiday's. 
Upon entering I was immediately hit in the face with a moderate cigarette smoke smell, to me, really disgusting. My husband was starving and needed to eat right away or something violent would happen. We were greeted by a a friendly younger waitress and she said we could sit wherever we wanted. We picked a booth as far from the cigarette party and she brought us chips and salsa. My husband asked what the speciality was and she told us the green chili carnitas. She explained how everything down to the salsa and tortillas are made here in the kitchen. I ordered the chicken fajitas and my daughter got the pork taco plate (3 street style tacos with rice and beans). We ordered a side of guac which was pretty awesome. All the food came out and it was very good, high quality and fresh. Total bill was $40.31. My husband ordered a beer from the bar next door which the waitress got for him, $2 draft Red Hook. The waitress was super friendly, very sweet. She explained how her parents bought the restaurant and her mom is the cook and she and her siblings wait tables, obviously all a hard working family, not like my spoiled children... It's not a ritzy place, but the Mexican music playing in the background, friendly service and good food might make up for the smell of the bar next door slightly wafting cigarette smoke under the double doors that separate the two locations. That's really the only bad part of the place, leaving and getting into my car my sweater and hair stunk like cigarette smoke. I don't know if I'll go back because of that, I wanted guac and chips, not to smell like a dirty ashtray.
