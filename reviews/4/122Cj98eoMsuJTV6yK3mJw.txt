Well I love Chipotle and since I was with my sister after shopping it was the closest location, it was her first time eating here. The food was great but the redhead that works their was rude and impatient to my sister, she's only 12 and it was her first time and she wasnt sure what to get so the red head was rolling her eyes and idk If she's gonna work for a fastfood place she needs to learn to be patient. Other than that 4 stars good food that's why! Burrito Bowl my favorite!
