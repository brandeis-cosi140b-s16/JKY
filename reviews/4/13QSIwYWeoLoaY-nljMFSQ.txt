I wondered when they opened this place how it would do right next to Iguana Macks, or if Iguana's would suffer.  Both seem to do just fine.  We came here on a Friday night after pre-gamming at a friends house.  Even with full bar, the service was fast and friendly.  The whole crowd seemed to be pretty friendly and relaxed, which was great because a few of my friends were a little drunk!

The Jukebox seems to have a master control - they will turn off music they don't like and skip to a new song, so unless you are spending your money on mainstream hits, don't bother.  Not sure how much money my brother spent before he gave up.

My favorite feature of all Dos Gringos is the painted footsteps you follow to the bathroom.  Amazing how helpful that is after a few (many) beers.
