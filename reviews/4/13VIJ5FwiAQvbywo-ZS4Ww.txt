This was a good time for just stopping off on a late sunday afternoon for a margarita.  The bartender and entire waitstaff was friendly and went out of their way to accommodate me.  Coming from another part of the country I am used to a different style of latino food but considering they made me something specifically for me and I gobbled it all down, I am not complaining.  the guacamole made tableside was delicious and the hot salsa was also delicious.  I can't speak highly enough of the service.
