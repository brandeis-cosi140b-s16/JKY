I went here with my wife, daughter, son-in-law, and three young grandchildren.
This place is excellent for family dining.
It was early-dinner time, we had no reservation, and they sat us right away.
I heard other children in there, but there was a half wall between us and them, so it wasn't a problem.
We ordered five main courses and a few side orders (guacamole, rice and beans, etc.), and they had no problem with us sharing the food. In other words, they didn't charge us for sharing. Always a plus.
My son-in-law is kosher, and he enjoyed every dish for which he could eat.
The kids really liked it, which is what it's all about, right?
The decor was as authentic as any other Mexican restaurant that I've been to, and when my family visits again, I'm sure that we'll be going back there.
Yay!
