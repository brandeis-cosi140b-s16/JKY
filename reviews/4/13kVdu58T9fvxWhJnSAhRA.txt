I keep forgetting about this restaurant because it is so far south of us. We arrived at the restaurant around 6PM and we were the only customers and the staff was outside getting fresh air.

The decor is still the same, not much has been done. The sign outside is a bit faded.
Our server was so-so, all business.

I had the two enchilada combo, One pork and chicken and I substituted the refried beans with black beans with red sauce. It was pretty tasty. Plenty of chicken and pork with each bite. There were more black beans on my plate with a couple of spoon fulls of Spanish rice. The little bit of diced lettuce, tomato and onions was refreshing.

My wife had a different combo, forgot what she ordered which came with the refried beans. Ask her why she didn't get the black beans and her answer was that sometimes the beans aren't thoroughly cooked, Mine were perfect.

This is the place to go if you just want good Mexican food.
