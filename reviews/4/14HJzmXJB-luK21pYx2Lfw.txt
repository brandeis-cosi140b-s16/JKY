Have you been to Mexico and had tacos from the street carts? Hot and yummy it hits the spot after a night of drinking. You can get the same kinds of tacos and more here. They have five or six kinds to choose from and all of them are pretty good. They also have a wide range of other mexican foods to choose from. I should know, when I go there I often order four or five items. A couple of tips about this joint are: 1) if you dine in you get free chips and salsa. 2) if you like tamales order the red. it has beef in it. the green only has chiles and cheese. Overall the place is a good value and I have not been disappointed yet.
