We decided to venture "off campus" while staying at The Phoenician and The Mission came highly recommended.  We ended up on the back patio which was comfortable despite the heat!  Service was amazing and the food was fantastic.  We opted for the table-side guac (obvs) and an array of tacos.  My husband and I are taco lovers and we both agreed, these were the best we had had in AGES.  We were with a kiddo but The Mission would be a great destination for a girls night out or a super fun date night.  Highly recommend.
