I went to Braddah's on Rainbow when it first opened last year and, honestly, I wasn't wowed enough to return.  Then something strange happened this week.  I was feeling hangry and found myself back at the same location by myself because it was the closest thing around me at that time of night offering decent protein options that weren't fried.  I stopped in and got a huli huli chicken bowl with brown rice, lettuce, and lime wedges.  I took it home and it was very tasty, much better than I remember my first meal being from them.  Four days later (today), I stopped by this location across from UNLV and basically had the same meal again, with the addition of black beans and some sour cream.  I think I'm now addicted to it.  Everyone always talks about Braddah's coconut bark, which is good, but I think their chicken bowl is going to be my new BFF.
