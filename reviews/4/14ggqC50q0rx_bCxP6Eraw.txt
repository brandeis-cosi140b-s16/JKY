If you find yourself at Market Street DC Ranch, this is definitely a restaurant worth checking out. If the name didn't already give it away, this is a Mexican food restaurant with a great patio, delicious food and a heck of a happy hour. 

With clouds lingering in the sky and a cool crisp breeze on the first day of March, we sat on the patio and enjoyed a meal here. The margaritas looked amazing but those will have to wait until after Baby D makes their debut, however I did notice that they also have a skinny cocktail and skinny food section which looked appealing for the future. 

However, this review is about the non calorie-counting options on the menu. Believe it or not, this restaurant won best tamales in Phoenix back in '08 so I had to give them a try. If you like tamales, you'll love these. They also had a sweet flavor to them and tasted like a combination between dinner and dessert. Whatever they put in there, they did an excellent job. We started off with the mini fundidos which were topped with amazing jalapeno cream cheese. These were really good and I would definitely come back and order them as a meal (and maybe add a cup of soup). My husband ordered the massive nachos and I have to say, I stole a couple bites and loved them. They are huge and can easily be shared. Everything here is pretty large in portions, so it would be a great restaurant to order a couple items and enjoy it family style. 

I look forward to coming back for Happy Hour soon!
