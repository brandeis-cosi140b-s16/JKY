Chipotle is a staple in any human's diet, yet I don't eat it as often as many people seem to...I stopped at this location after a day of meetings and before class. The line wasn't long and the workers moved quickly. I've been here before during the lunch crowd and it operates basically the same way. This is a good location and I look forward to coming back again.
