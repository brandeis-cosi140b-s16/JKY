That was some damn fine Fish Tacos and Shrimp Burrito.

We always pass this place and assumed it would be like a Del Taco but it's not. Top quality stuff here. Huge Burritos! Loved it.

The only thing they need is something spicy. It's just gringo spicy right now, some of us Gringos want REAL spicy. 

You guys should add a Habanero salsa or something as an option ;)

Great grub.
