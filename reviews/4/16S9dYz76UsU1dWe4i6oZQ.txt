I am giving a 4 for effort, friendliness, cleanliness and food deliciousness.
Who ever is working the kitchen knows what they are doing.
After watching every single episode of Bar Rescue, it's hard to be perfectly satisfied. Unless you hit key points.
1, customer service
2, cleanliness
3, well executed and consistent drinks
4, good food
5, staff knowledge
I felt that on my visit the staff's knowledge of pricing and what they served was not what it should have been. 
Also I noticed one of the servers using the center of the bar as a servers station instead of one of the ends. 
We ordered a pitcher of the cider. Though good, it was very potent. My friends and I were looking for a buzz. But you don't want to be known as the place to come to get a cheap drunk. That'll bring in low end and possibly dangerous clientele. 
Like I had said tough. Good food. Good service. Respectfully priced. You definitely get what you paid for. Possibly a little bit more.
