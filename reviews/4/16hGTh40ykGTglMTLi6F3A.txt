I also only chose this place based on its high reviews on Yelp. Now I have been to several Mexican restaurants and I have to say this place is not bad at all. I mean its not excellent but pretty good overall. The rice and beans were tasteless but the tacos I had were delicious and the chips and salsa were great. I could drink beers and eat their chips & salsa all night. 

The service was awesome, I never had to ask for a refill or more salsa or wait for anything. I was a little cautious because of its location and the way it looked outside but I am glad I tried it out. 

Friendly, Good food and very affordable!!!
