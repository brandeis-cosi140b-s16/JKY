Mmmmm....Mexican! One of my absolute favorites! 

This place is located in a shopping center right next to the Trader Joes. 

My friends and I decided to grab a quick bite after work. We were seated right away and ordered our margaritas while we reviewed the menu. 

The margaritas were delicious, so I was able to get a coconut and strawberry mix! 

They had tons of specials everything from tacos to fajitas. 

I opted for the beef chimichanga which was loaded with yummy well seasoned beef. An adorable and delicious tortilla boat filled with the refrained beans which were delicious. The were almost pur√©ed, very smooth and creamy.

The rice was a little crunchy, but everything else was great. 

Our waitress was great and the food was reasonably priced. So I'm sure to be back again!
