Stopped in for an after work-work dinner last week. We had a very nice time. 

The service was quick, the food was good and my "skinny" margarita was awesome!

Their chips and salsa is very tasty, not the best, but good enough for me to eat way more than I should have. I had the chicken fajitas and they were very good. The grilled veggies that it came with were the highlight I think. 

I would defiantly consider going back if we are looking for a dinner spot on this side of town again.
