This place is the closest you will find to the real deal (south of the border style) in old town...  if you are a gringo you might be out numbered but the food is pretty good... if you don't speak Spanish you can point to what you would like... this is so real you can actually get gut tacos (i was not a fan... too chewy)...  if i were you i would get the quesadilla... just had it for lunch today and I don't want to try anything else... 

you know this place is the real deal when they serve you the Mexican bottle and have the recycling create where you throw the stuff away... i would recommend this place for the adventurous (and those that have stomachs of steel)... but check it out... nice lil gem...
