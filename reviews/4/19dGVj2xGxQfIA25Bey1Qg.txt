This place is fantastic, I wish I could try some of the other items on the menu, but I can't get past the steak super nachos, the only thing I didn't care for was the size of the restaurant, but since I don't go there to eat the size of the restaurant it earned 4 stars easily. I'm saving the last star for when I try something new.
