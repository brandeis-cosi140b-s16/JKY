Wow what an interesting place. We ended up going there one day because we couldn't find anything else on Fremont street that we wanted to eat. My first impression wasn't that good. The restrooms are in the back and kind of small, dirty and scary looking. The place itself didn't look very clean and kind of scary as well but I bit on my lips and refused to leave before I tried their food. And I'm very glad I did. The portions were big and everything was full of flavor. I cannot remember exactly what I had but I know I really liked it!
