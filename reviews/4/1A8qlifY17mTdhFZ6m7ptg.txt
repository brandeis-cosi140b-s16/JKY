Eating at Chino Bandido is not just dinner it's an adventure!  When you mention it is your first time dining at Chino Bandido a friendly staff member will give you the "tour of taste" allowing you to sample nearly all of there meats.  They will also explain to you all of the different ways that you can order up your meal and if the order sheet is too confusing they will even fill it out for you.

Yes, Chino Bandido is a hole in the wall (One of the reasons it is so cool.). Yes the food is fatty (In a good way, it's Chinese/Mexican for crying out loud). Yes, the name is funny (Chino Bandido takee-Outee).  Yes, my friends and I had to take  a picture with the giant panda in a sombrero but you should too!
