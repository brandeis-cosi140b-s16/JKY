I've been here twice now. I came once for a team lunch for work - the lunch specials they have are amazing! $15 for an app and an entree and a beverage. The guac is delicious! I had the mahi tacos and they were pretty good too. The tacos are real small but pack tons of flavor. The second time I went, I bought a Livingsocial deal for two margs and two entrees. The margaritas were really good, they taste fresh. I didn't get a flavored one, but I'd be interested next time. I got the shrimp and chorizo tacos and the boyfriend got the duck fundido. I don't think it was what he expected, but it was good. There's a good amount of duck in the dish too, it's just really greasy. To be expected, duck and cheese? I mean come on. We got the plantains and corn rice as sides and they were pretty good too. We just were so full we couldn't finish everything. 

After dinner, we sat at the bar and talked to the manager and the bartender about all the different kinds of tequila they have. Super nice people. The best part about this place is the glittery tables! The decor is really fun. Personally, I like the food at the Mission better but this place has a really fun vibe. And I mean, come on the owner is Iron Chef Garces! That's pretty amazing.
