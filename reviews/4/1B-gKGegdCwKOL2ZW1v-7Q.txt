I love this place, I have for a long time. Even now with my dietary restrictions they still have decent choices. I ordered the lunch chicken fajitas with no dairy items and no peppers. It was still amazing, the chicken was juicy and spiced just right and the onions....ohhh how I love perfectly carmelized onions. I didnt even want the tortillas, it didn't need it. The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The beans could've been a little creamier and fresh tasting, while they weren't horrible, they weren't great. All in all it was a great lunch with plenty to take home. I will definitely be back.
