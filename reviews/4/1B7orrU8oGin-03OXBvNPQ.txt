Had dinner here one weekend and had the Combo with a couple of rolled tacos, taco and toastada... crazy awesome Tacos, but the rolled tacos weren't the greatest. I loved the salsa with tons of cilantro! I need to try the menudo sometime soon!! 

Nice, COOL, clean taquieria with a nice seating area. No cheap o booths! lovez it. and it's open 24 hours!! So if you're in the hood and its late... waaaay late... forget the bell and head to Rivas!!
