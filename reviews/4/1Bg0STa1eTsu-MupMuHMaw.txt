Fast service, good food, not great food but good. Wife says ground beef is full of grissle, chicken verde enchaladda(sp?) Were very good, premium margarita was on special on saturday for $9, yes thats right nine dollars! I was afraid to ask what the regular price was. There are better places close by.
