First time I tried Baja Fresh was in Vegas and was amazed. I didn't even know there were Shrimp Burritos! My entire family was delighted with what they ordered. During our entire Vegas trip, we all kept mentioning how we wished they'd have one back home in Tampa. Unfortunately, there are none that I know of closeby. There was one in  Wesley Chapel, but it seemed to have closed a while back. Anyway, give Baja Fresh a try, you won't regret it.
