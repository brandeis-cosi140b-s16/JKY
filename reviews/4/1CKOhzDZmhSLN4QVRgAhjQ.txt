SOME of the best mexican food I have had in the valley. I never make it out to this part of the valley because I live more in the Scottsdale area. BUT while staying out here for Nascar weekend I came here with my boyfriends team and I was blown away. I know me some Mexican food! It's so good I can see myself making the trek out there to get my fix every now and then before the next race in November! The staff is super friendly! Salsa, and I think I am an expert.. I like it somewhat hot, but not 'can't swallow hot' .. was mind blowing. I had the shrimp and carne asada fajitas. Couldn't finish them. Generous portions; you won't go away hungry. We shared a pitcher of margaritas and I left happy.. happy..happy:-)
