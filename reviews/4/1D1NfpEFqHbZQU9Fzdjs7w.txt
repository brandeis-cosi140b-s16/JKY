I'm not gonna lie: my expectations for this place were low.
I saw the Groupon and read the mostly-mediocre reviews, and bought it anyway because who doesn't love a discount? Plus it's right by my work.

Well this evening I was pleasantly surprised. 
Got the Fiesta Nachos with carne asada and the lengua burrito in salsa verde with cheese- both were really good! The nachos are loaded with tons of beef and both melted and shredded cheese, and the chips are thick and crispy. Lots of guac on top, too. The burrito is served enchilada-style with the green salsa that is just right: not too much heat but a good zesty kick to it. 
Total was under $20 and portions were good- I'll be eating leftovers for lunch all week.

Not sure I'd go out of my way to go here specifically, but they have a happy  hour with discounted margaritas and dollar tacos, and the nachos at least I can highly recommend!

Down side: they don't answer their phone, so don't bother calling in an order. Minor irritation, but I ordered to go and wish I could have had it ready when I pulled up.
