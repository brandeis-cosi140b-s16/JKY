Always love coming here on my lunch. Food is prepared fast and delivered to your table, which is nice. The place is always clean, and the salsa freshly stocked. I've never had stale chips! Everything I've gotten to eat here is really good, but sometimes the fish is a little over cooked, the flavor is still great though. 
Also, they give 20% off to teachers! If you work for CCSD, just show your badge. I work for a preschool in the area and they gave us the flyers for it, which they let us use as a coupon. Love it here!
