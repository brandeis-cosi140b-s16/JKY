It's pretty much a given that the food here is amazing. The line is almost always out the door. My favorites are the lengua and pork shoulder. The only real problem I have with it is their line system; they have three lines, for different types of meat. SOMETIMES you are able to request that they get you meat from the other 2 stations when you get to the front of your line, but if you're looking to get tacos de cabeza, lengua and asada all together you may have problems.

Other than that, there is no reason NOT to go here if you have a car or are staying at Wynn/Encore adjacent. Cheap meal with more satisfaction than most of the Vegas hotel spots.
