A great little hole in the wall Mexican place. Not much to look at from the outside but come inside and find a very clean, comfortable place.

You can't help but notice the awesome salsa bar.  Great selection and very fresh. 

And here is where it gets really interesting.... Sure they have all the traditional Mexican food and that is delicious but they also have carne asada fries and... Wait for it.... Mexican sushi!

Now, I had the pastor tacos, carne asada tacos and the carne asada fries all of which were amazing; but I wasn't hungry enough to tack on the Mexican sushi.  I'm sure, based on my experience that the Mexican sushi would have been just as delightful. 

If your in the area, do yourself a favor and treat your tastebuds to some great flavor!
