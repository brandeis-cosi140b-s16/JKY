Had about 2 hours of fun at the phx MVD and thought i would reward myself for dealing with that, so I yelped what was near and guess what shows up! I had no idea they had more locations, i thought it was only the one from man v food... 

Walked in and first thing that happens is that im welcomed by the owner... I ask for a recommendation, and he recommends El Rey ( The King) Its a big torta so I opted for the smaller Especial... the same sandwich except without the egg  , chorizo, and sausage omlette! I also got a agua de pina (fresh pineapple juice)... legit! I would go back for that alone... the torta was big.... maybe to big... but hey... man v food did go there for the challenge so expect it!  

The torta was good, had different cuts of pork in it and i think a slice of breaded beef! The neighborhood could be considered not desirable, but get over it, the place is fine... i usually judge a place based on whether or not i would return... for the food, service, and atmosphere.

The answer is yes, i am going back to try some other stuff on their menu, the service was quick and the waitresses were nice, the food was good especially the juices, and the atmosphere was whatever... but yes i will return to get me some fuel soon!
