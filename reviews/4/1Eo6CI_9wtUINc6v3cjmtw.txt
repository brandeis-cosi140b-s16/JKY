Stopped in for the first time this Saturday to give it a quick try. The bakery looked great and a wide selection of goodies, but I was interested in the Mexican cuisine. Generally when visiting a Mexican establishment for the first time, I order pastor tacos. If they can't get that right, what's the purpose of trying anything else? I was not disappointed. 

I ordered 3 tacos ($2 each) to go and they arrived in an appropriate amount of time. The first thing I noticed was that they had corn tortillas - I hate corn tortillas, but shrugged it off and squeezed the fresh lime over the pastor tacos topped with fresh onions and cilantro and dived in. It was delicious. 

I have come to the conclusion that its not that I don't like corn tortillas, I just have hated the ones that I have had in the past. I associated corn tortillas with mealy and overpowering flavors, but that would not describe these tortillas. The portion was huge and my large appetite would have been more than satisfied with just two tacos. I can't wait to give this place another try.

If I was a Monona Grove student, which has an open campus, I would be spending every lunch hour at this place.
