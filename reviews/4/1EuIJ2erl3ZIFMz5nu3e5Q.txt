Wow! Great, cheap food on the strip.  $2 tacos on Tuesday (even if that Tuesday is Christmas) with fresh, tasty ingredients.  Lots of meat options, and a few veggies ones too.  Spicy salsa is spicy.  And maybe I was lucky that day, because they were out of many toppings, but the ones I wanted (sour cream, jalapenos, pico) were available and tasty.
(And even though they sell frozen alcoholic drinks and beers there, if you're careful, you can go to the Walgreens or ABC nearby and pick up super cheap beer to go with your super cheep tacos!)
