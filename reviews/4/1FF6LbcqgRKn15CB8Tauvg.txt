Right when we walked in the door we were greeted and seated with a smile. Luckily for us we came in during happy hour. The $3 beers and $5 margaritas were huge and delicious. The food was wonderful and reasonably priced. After our meal the manager came over and asked us how everything was. Talk about service! We will definitely come back!
