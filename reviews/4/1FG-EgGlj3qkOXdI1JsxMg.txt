Place is really nice.  This is the kind of place you would take an out of towner.  I thought their salsa was great.  I had a red carnitas enchilada, although I thought the meat was delicious, I think the rest lacked flavor.  My wife had the nachos, and she thought it was loaded with beans, which took away from there rest of the ingredients.  She also ordered a frozen horchata smoothie, which tasted more like a pi√±a colada.  I thought the service was good, however our server was new so he wasn't very familiar with the menu and could not answer many questions about it.  Overall, I will say the food was just ok, the pricing was a little higher than other places, the facilities were excellent, so we will try again and see if maybe the cooks just had an off night.
