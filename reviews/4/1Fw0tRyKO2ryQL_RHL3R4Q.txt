I love this place. Any time my wife and I come to vegas we come here. I like the fresh chips with the 3 sides. The food is always good. Service is great. This is the old don miguels. I asked what had changed. Nothing only the name and owner. Staff and cooks are still the same. I like the quality of the food. i am very picky. I have never had a problem in this place.
