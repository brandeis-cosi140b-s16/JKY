This place is quite pricey but they are good ill give them that for sure.  I am not necessarily a fan of going to Mexican places in Arizona because no one is ever as good as the "lower quality" restaurants in California.  Those restaurants back home are where the real food is because you can order anything off the menu and its good. Enough of California..Isabelas is good it is worth trying..But i can't say its worth a second trip.
