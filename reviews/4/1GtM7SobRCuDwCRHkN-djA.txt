This place is great. You do have to know what is good to order and this is why I am here. Beef Kabobs, some of the best I have ever eaten. (they come medium-medium rare), so if you don't like, order a different temperature).  Chicken Kabobs, excellent. Chicken Schnitzel, outstanding. Potatoes, great. Pork Steak, very good, but not a very good value. Stroke'in'off, very good, but I am no expert, (on the dish anyway). Service, excellent. Putin really beat them into shape. Decor, 80's/90's, this is where it is stuck and this is where it should be, excellent. 

A couple of gripes. Rice..on my most recent order they had transitioned from some of the most outstanding wet long-grained rice with butter and green onions to a super dry jasmine with just green onions. Please switch back! It was seriously the best rice I had ever eaten. Delivery, although they know it is a cash pay, guy shows up with three $20 bills as all of the change he carried. Fortunately I rounded up some ones to cover the $24 bill. He was very gracious and apologetic and offered to just take $20 for the bill. Glad I was able to scrounge up some bills to pay the full amount. 

I will keep ordering from here and hopefully they keep improving. They have 5 star potential.
