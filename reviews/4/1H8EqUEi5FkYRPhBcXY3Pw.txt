DO IT!  Put aside any reservations you may have about this little shack and go ahead and give it a shot.  It's a super cute place and it seems like it may be family run and has a very friendly vibe.  I went here after urgings from my friends and I'm so glad I did!  
Today is Cinco de Mayo and one of their specials was Cinnamon crisps with fruit salsa and dip (they sold me with a free sample).  DEEELISH!! Seriously, my hungover husband couldn't eat much, but he sure was able to scarf this down.  The fruit salsa is like pureed strawberries and other fruit and it was perfection.  My husband said he could have drank it, it was that good.  I'm glad we gave it a shot since I don't think it's regularly on the menu, but maybe we can petition for it to be a permanent menu addition...
I had a carne asada burrito, the carne is good chunks of tasty meat and the tortilla was great.  My husband got the carne asada fries which were pretty basic but not as exciting as the ones he used to always get in LA with his buddies.  All in all, I'll definitely be back, and I actually want to eat there instead of doing take out... at least before it gets too hot.  The ambiance is really cute and laid back.  I'll be back for breakfast!
