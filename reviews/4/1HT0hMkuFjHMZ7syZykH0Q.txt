Make sure that you look better in person than in your ID. I apparently look better in person, so I got a free drink. +1 star for quality princess service. Besides that, the food is actually delicious. It's filling, but you don't feel like your insides are going to burst and that you're going to die of a painful death after. The prices were cheap and the place didn't smell like most Mexican places. It was actually clean and I wasn't scared to put my hand on the table in fear that it will get stuck.
