The food is good here! I didn't get to try and mixed drinks though. I stayed with just the dos Equis. But the atmosphere is nice and the setting fits the area. Only been here once, the waiter we had only came around three times and Ignored us when I tried to get his attention on several occasions. With him aside though. Great place to try out and relax
