I have not been to chipotle Grill and quite a while. I like the fact that you get to see the food before you choose it. Everything looked really good but I chose the shredded pork bowl. I usually get the bowl because it's the lower carb option. Seems like I got a lot more food at this location than at other locations.  I was completely full! Check this place out when you are really hungry!
