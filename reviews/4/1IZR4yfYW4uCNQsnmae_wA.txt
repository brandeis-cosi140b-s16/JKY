Love Rivas!  I am a huge Filebertos/Fredericos fan and this restaurant is just as good.  I especially love their land and sea quesadilla.  It is filled with shrimp and steak and topped with a really good red chile sauce.  Everything we have had there has been fast and tasty.  We have become regulars, all though we have never eaten inside.  I also love that they have a kids menu.
