Ok....Lemme let you in on a little secret...If there are quite a bit of Mexicans grubbing down in Mexican food restaraunt...it's probably a good place....I should know...I'm Mexican. Now with that being said, being on vacation I thought this place was OK. First time I went in I had a Chorizo & Egg burrito. It was freaking huge. The eggs weren't all greasy & runny like some Mexican dive places and the chorizo was NOT greasy at all. Took it into the Giants game and people next to me were like, " where did you get that?" Not at the baseball game my friend! Second time took a Carne Asada burrito w/ me to the Dodger game, the meat was tender and tasted great. I don't know if they do this w/ all their meat burritos, but they threw in some guacamole (& with the salsa I threw in) made it slammin'. Nothing better than a good buritto and a cold beer @ the ball yard!
