Whipped in for a burrito today.
Scrumptious carne asada burrito with excellent moist texture, excellent salsa bar options!
Hit the spot!
THANK YOU!!

Next day.....
Adobada burrito.
Dry and hard meat, too much salad inside.
I was a bit angry. I got it to go or I would've complained.
At least I had salsas.
This burrro is usually juicy.

April 7: Chile relleno burrito. Well done. 
All flavors well-represented.
Relleno could've been larger.
At Fiesta Burrito they put TWO rellenos.

May 17: Arizona buritto. MY NEW FAVORITE.

INSIDE SKINNY: Chipotle salad dressing sauce?
It's the thousand island looking sauce at the salsa bar.
YUMMM.
