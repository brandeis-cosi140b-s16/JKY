The outside looked like Cheesecake Factory. The inside reminded me of a casino where the ceiling is a fake blue sky. Me gusta la comida! I'm all about Mexican food at a reasonable price. $14.99 for a large plate called the Monterrey, which consisted of three enchiladas, one crunchy chicken taco, one beef tamale, rice and beans. The plate was so huge it looked like a turkey platter! They don't have an Abuelos in San Diego, so this was a nice touristy treat!
