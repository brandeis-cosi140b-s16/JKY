OK so the restaurant is kinda scuzzzy, but the food is very very good.   I actually avoided this place for the past five years I lived in the area, but the service is friendly and quick; and the food did not cause heartburn!   It was a great value for the price paid, and tasted good.

Damn, been back to this place 3 times since first review... I love it, more than Lindo
