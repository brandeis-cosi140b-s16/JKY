Thank you previous yelpers! This was a great lunch. We started with the guacamole and salsa trio - what a combination of flavors. Tried the Aqua Fresca, the sweetness of the Cantaloupe Aqua fresca balanced wonderfully with the spice of the Enchiladas Verdes ~muy bueno. My lunch guest had the Enfrijoladas - chicken filled corn tortillas with a black bean sauce.

Can't wait to go back for dinner soon
