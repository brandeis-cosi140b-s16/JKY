Filly Bs. I LOVE this place. This location is particularly good. I love their taco tuedays, something about their chicken tacos is just good. I love their carne asada tacos, chicken tacos, and their bean burritos. If you want cheap, big portions of good Mexican food, Filly Bs is it. It's not by any means fine dining or a "restaurant", but it's a good quick stop place.
