I have eaten here 3 times in 3 months. Super consistent food, and totally tasty from start to finish.
The house salsa has gotten better every time - perfect heat and well-seasoned, made with love.
The carnitas fajitas are really, really good. Got the prawn fajitas this last visit and was happy with them, too. Generous portions = good value.

Service can be a little thin, as all 3 times the entire restaurant was being served by a lone bartender. Would be 5-stars if my 35-min meal didn't take an hour every time! ;)
