Went there on a Saturday night with my husband. We waited for about 20 minutes for a table, which isn't bad. Our waitress was really nice and brought out our drinks right away. I had the fish bowl margarita and added a Corona to it and it was really good. The food came out quickly. We ordered carne asada and flautas and everything was delicious. I want to try going there again before I give this place another star because so far this is the best Mexican restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh.
