I didn't have high expectations for this place based on other reviews, but I loved it! I got the citrus chili shrimp tacos with a mango jicama slaw and the street corn and it all was really delicious!  We also got the ahi tuna taquitos as an app and they were great - I don't remember any seaweed in it though.  Everyone ordered different types of tacos and devoured them.  My patron cosmo drink was perfectly made - not too sweet or strong and the service couldn't have been better.  Oh and the atmosphere is both warm and fun.  The place was packed.
