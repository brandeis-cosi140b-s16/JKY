This is a lovely restaurant in downtown Chandler.  It's not a typical "Mexican" place.  Sure it has the usual stuff (burros, etc).  But you can also get chicken mole!!  The service is good, the food is good, and the menu has some different items on it.

And when the weather is nice they have a patio.

I should really come here more often.
