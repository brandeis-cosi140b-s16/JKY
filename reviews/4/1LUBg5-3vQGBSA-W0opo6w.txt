Real good food!  Burito could be a bit larger(1 star alone) taco de pollo, yum!  They ask if you want it American or Mexican style.  Onions and cilantro being the added goodies on the Mexican style. Mexican style all the way.  What would American style come with, corn syrup, guns and xenophobia? Hah!  The verde salsa is a must, at least with chicken tacos.  Good to see a food truck in champaign.  Support it.
