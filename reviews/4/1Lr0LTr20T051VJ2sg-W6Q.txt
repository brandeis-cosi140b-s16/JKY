A great addition to the downtown. Great prices and generous portions. 

My favorite is the steak. They told me that they marinade the meat for a few days. It shows in the great flavor and tenderness of the steak.  I recommend trying their special rice. Its a great healthy addition to your order.It has peas and other veggies in it. I usually get the two tacos and that is more then enough to fill me up at lunch.
The staff is very friendly and helpful, just speak up because it is hard to hear over the glass wall. You get to choose everything that goes into your meal like Cafe Rio. 
A bonus for me is that they have a veggie juice that taste great and isn't overpriced.

I am happy to recommend Mcken's if you are downtown. Its only a few blocks from Fremont street and perfect for your break during jury duty.
