Ordered tacos, between the four of us we had pastor, asada, and lengua. The meats were all delicious the only thing I would recommend would be better tortillas because they were dry and falling apart. Each taco is made with two tortillas so I just took one out so that I could better enjoy my tacos. I like that they're open late and staff is friendly. Oh I also like that they give you the choice to add in pineapple to the pastor :)
