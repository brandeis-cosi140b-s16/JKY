Ate here for the first time today. They've been open about four weeks. Overall we liked it.  I had the lobster tacos which were served with a mango  fruit and they were very good. My daughter's steak empanadas were excellent.   Husband had the carne asada tacos. The meat was good but the taco itself was a little dry--needed some green salsa or something. The rice and beans came with some kind of sour cream drizzle on them which was not mentioned on the menu but the staff was nice enough to replace them with plain ones.  The papas were hot, both in temperature and taste.  Husband thought they had too much chili powder.  Reuben, the manager, is a really nice guy and was very receptive to our feedback which included a suggestion to be able to mix and match tacos.  They promote themselves as a taco shop but did not have very many kinds of tacos.  Overall it was a very good lunch and we will definitely go back.
