I would agree with a lot of the previous reviewers about the service as I will agree it's not great.  The restaurant is really large so even though they have a lot of staff they struggle to keep up with how big the place is.  On to what I consider much more important the food: We got the tableside guacamole which was really good.  The salsas weren't to my friends liking so they made a special really hot salsa that was what my friends wanted.  For entrees we got the steak fajitas which was above average, carnitas chimichanga which was huge and tasted like a barbeque pork chimichanga which my friend liked and the tamale trio which looked good.  Overall a pretty good place just be a little bit patient
