this is a great mexican joint in pineville. great outdoor patio area with large tvs. the inside decor is pretty standard mexican restaurant so i usually choose this place in warmer weather. 
chips and salsa are good. they have a wide variety of beer. food is relatively cheap and fast. good portion size.
the food here has never wowed me but i have really never been disappointed either. 
this is a great place to go for a leisurely lunch or dinner with friends.
