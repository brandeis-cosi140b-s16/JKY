They have half-priced margs on Mondays and Tuesdays, so just about every Tuesday this summer we've sat on the patio and gotten margs, chips and pico, and split a salad or fajitas. The margs are delicious, chips and salsa are tasty but not included with your meal. Their entrees are generally above average. 

The patio is lovely in the summer, but inside is a bit loud and echoey. It's a bit slow, so best to go when you're not in a hurry.
