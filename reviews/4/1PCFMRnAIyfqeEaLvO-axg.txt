I have been here a few times for lunch and love sharing the Ensalada Asada with a friend (it is huge). First time here with family I'm reminded that the chips and salsa are so so. Lacks the flavor you typically find in a good AZ restaurant. No worries friends it gets better from there. I ordered the seafood enchiladas. Great choice! I was not disappointed. Will definitely be back for lunch and occasionally dinner.
