Decided to have lunch here today solely based on the reviews. My family usually goes to Garcia when we want really good Mexican food and this place is in a plaza I never really trusted. Well, I am very happy stopped in. I ordered the chimi and finished the meal.  The portion was huge and delicious. You will want to add either their green or red sauce as there is a lot meat but that's okay in my book. I will be back with the family. Thank you having really good Mexican food much closer to my home.
