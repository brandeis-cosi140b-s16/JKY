I am happy that Chronic Tacos has made its way to AZ. I am used to seeing this establishment in Cali, and I am a fan simply because they get that a lot of people prefer all white meat chicken. The nearby competitor has not gotten that message. My suggestions would be to make sure that the meat it always warm and to add another person into the serving rotation. It was a bit slow for the after 1pm lunch hour. I think they give you a lot of meat even for Taco Tuesday. I will definitely be back!
