Yay! First! Been going to senor taco in fountain hills and i didn't mind the 25 minute drive because they have the best carne Asada burrito in the valley. However i always wanted them to open one closer to home and they finally did!  It was pretty obvious they have not been open for long. Salsa was fresh,  and burro was delicious but the size was smaller than the ones in fountain hills. Right next to DD, I will be visiting here often :)
