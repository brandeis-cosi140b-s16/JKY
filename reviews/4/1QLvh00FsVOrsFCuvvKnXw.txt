My go to spot when I'm angry at my tummy.  I mean this in the nicest way possible.   "What's that you say?  You need more veggies?"   as I take another bite of my California burrito stuffed to the absolute limit with steak, cheese, and potatoes.  As it's pleading for help I add to it with a heaping forkful of Carne Asada fries and wash it down with whatever alcoholic beverage I might be indulging myself with that evening (early morning?)

Great for drive homes where it's 3 am and you're trying to remember when the last time you ate was and what kind of food you might have available when you'll wake up and dont want to move.  

My list of recommended food:
1.  California burrito (steak, cheese, fries.   3 essentials to late night dining)
2.  Machaca Burrito (Shredded beef, eggs.  Breakfast OR Dinner.  Or Both.  HAVE YOUR PREFERRED HOT SAUCE ON HAND before ordering)
3.  Carne Asada Fries (you can't ever get enough fries, cheese and steak)
4.  Carnitas Burrito/Carnitas Plate (when you're sick of gut busting steak and instead want gut busting pork)
5.  Adobada Burrito/Carne Asada Burrito/Chorizo Burrito (eenie, meenie..)

You really can't go wrong IMO, though I personally am not a fan of their chicken overall, and I tried the Flying Saucer on a whim because it was the most expensive thing on the menu and I expected them to hand over the keys to the store based on the other menu items' relative value, and instead it was just some disappointing tostada thing.
