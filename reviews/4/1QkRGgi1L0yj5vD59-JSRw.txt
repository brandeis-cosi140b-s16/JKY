Morenos is a great Mexican place that has some really good Sonoran dogs!! One of my favorite foods. I come here often for lunch and my co workers and I always get food here. 

It's reasonably priced and I never stay hungry. The tacos are small though. But the dogs and the burritos are good. I would take Mexican friends to this place.
