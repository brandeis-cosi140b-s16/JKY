Taco truck brought indoors. Meaning - YUM! They have the full fare - tacos, burritos, etc. All freshly made on the spot. Portions are grand. Tasty. The salsa bar is a little sparse (two choices, some radishes and cilantro) - but still fresh and tasty. We spent under $20 and ate until it hurt.

Skip the Bell, go for the real thing.
