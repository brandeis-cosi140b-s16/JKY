Yum!  I finally made it to Escobar's, and I was not disappointed.  The food was excellent and the portions were the perfect size.  As is the case with Milo's, the dressings on the salads were divine.  Escobar's is not cheap, so minus one star, but it's a great destination for those special evenings when you are willing to spend some money on a nice meal out.  The white sangria was particularly noteworthy.

My complaints would be that they were stingy with the bread.  They only gave us three slices of bread, a boring white and wheat and then some sort of corn foccicia thing that was really good, but two of us had to split a small piece so I really didn't get to enjoy it.  Also, on the jicama orange salad I had, they served the orange in slices rather than segmenting them.  This meant chewing on nasty orange membranes instead of simply enjoying the lovely combination of flavors in the salad.  I know it's probably more labor intensive for the kitchen, but when a diner pays $7 for a salad, you need to segment the damn oranges.  Overall though, these were really small things that really didn't damage my overall enjoyment of the evening.  My entree and dessert were absolutely wonderful, and the service couldn't have been better.  The food wasn't spicy at all, but was still very flavorful.  I personally would like to see a little kick added to some of the dishes, but it would be icing on the cake and they are fine without it.

All in all, I really enjoyed my dinner at Escobar's and plan to go back.  It's not cheap, so I won't be a regular, but I certainly plan on coming here for birthday dinners and the like.
