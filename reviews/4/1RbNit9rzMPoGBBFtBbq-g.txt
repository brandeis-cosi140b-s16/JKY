I would not expect what lies inside from first glance. Delicious authentic Mexican food, lively staff and a clean restaurant is what is behind the empty looking establishment. I had the carne asada which was super flavorful and tender, rice is also full of flavor and fresh made chips with salsa is par. I got a coupon on LucyVegas.com for half off!
