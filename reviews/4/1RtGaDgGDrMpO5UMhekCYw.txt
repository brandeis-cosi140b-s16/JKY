I was contemplating between giving the Mission 3 or 4 stars. I chose to give it 4 stars because I remembered how DELICIOUS the tacos, guacamole and street corn are. Unfortunately, I think all the other dishes I've tried are mediocre.


I had the pork shoulder (Chorizo Porchetta) which the server said was the best on the menu. I didn't like it, as it didn't really mesh well with the chorizo. The pork itself was dry. The beans on the side however, were good. I tried my sister's dish (halibut) which was dry and bland. She had to ask for sauce to give it some taste. I've had the Malbec Braised Shortrib before which I remember was pretty  average as well. 

I would definitely be back, because I love the ambiance of this place. It's the perfect spot for drinks/tacos before heading out to old town or for a romantic date. The service is good and I've always had a great experience here.
