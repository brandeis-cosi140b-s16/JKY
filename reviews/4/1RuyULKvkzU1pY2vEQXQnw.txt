The food was excellent and you get so much for the price. I ordered a fish taco, a chicken quesadilla and a barbacoa quesadilla. I was too ambitious but managed to try all of them. The chicken was my favorite. They used a decent amount of meat in all of them and the tortillas were clearly freshly made and yummy. 

It is a small place but great for a date or low key night out. The staff are all very friendly and our waiter was very attentive. I don't think they have ac but they had a fan on and it wasn't uncomfortable. 

No complaints. I'll definitely be back.
