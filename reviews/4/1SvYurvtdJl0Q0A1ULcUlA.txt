The atmosphere here is very inviting, airy, and open. I was greeted promptly and seated right away. The menu is physically large while being surprisingly limited. The seafood choices are quite small, actually. Fresh chips, very light and not greasy, were served hot and with three different salsas. None of them are hot--the habanero was disappointingly mild, but your tastes may be different.
I ordered the vegetarian fajitas--be warned: the rice that is served with them is cooked in chicken stock so ask for white rice if you are a vegetarian. The fajitas were very undercooked: essentially just absolutely raw veggies on a hot plate. I sent them back for a bit more cooking and the arrived quickly cooked properly. Everyone makes mistakes. The tortillas were fresh and tasted good.
Overall, a good experience.
