Open 24 hours. My wife and I have always got good food, and service here.
Herrera's is less than 1/4 mile from our house. 
They have a few tables in the restaurant but most of their business it drive through and take out. 
Their burritos are plenty for one person to eat if you are hungry and enough to share if you are not. 
I enjoy coming here because the food is good, people friendly and this is a locally owned business which I prefer.
Give them a try! You will be back.
