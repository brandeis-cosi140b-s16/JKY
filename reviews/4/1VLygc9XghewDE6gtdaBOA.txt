Really close to my work...you really can't bet a fast, affordable, semi healthy lunch.  I really like how they have changed their menu to include the health information.  Helps to make a more informed decision.  The staff at this location is very friendly.  Gotta love a free salsa bar and chips too! 
Will I be back to this location?  Definitely.
