Pros:
-Service was excellent. The servers were very polite and our food came out fast. We had about 3 people constantly filling our drinks/chips/salsa/beans. Plus, they're really good at singing happy birthday :)
-My fiance loves beans and was really excited to see they served complimentary beans with their chips and salsa. A nice touch and one I have never seen before in a Mexican restaurant

Cons:
-The food was OK. I got #16 (two hard chicken tacos, all rice) and I enjoyed it, although the tacos were a little small. My fiance had a combo plate as well (hard beef taco and enchilada, all beans) and did not like the enchilada's red sauce.

All in all, the restaurant was alright and if I was in town again I might consider coming back.
