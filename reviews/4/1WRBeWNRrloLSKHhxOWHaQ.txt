Deliciousness delivered right to my door! I had a carne asada taco and a shredded chicken vampiro w/ a side of Mexican corn (you know, the corn on the cob slathered in cotija cheese). It was all fabulous, incredibly seasoned and delicious, plus the delivery driver was sweet as pie. This is the real deal.
