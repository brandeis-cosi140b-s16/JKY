I am glad I didn't read reviews before I decided to go or I probably wouldn't of gone...it's near the office and have grown tired of the usual no time to eat- grab a sub to go and eat at the desk. 

Megan our waitress was on it. A smile, an occasional friendly wink and someone who knows her menu! I asked about vegetarian options and she had it covered! She knew what was in everything and gave me many options beyond a few tortilla chips with some guacamole.  Green sauce safe - red sauce off limits, black beans -ok, pinto beans - in the green. Megan even offered a rice alternative that was not made with stock.  

Tofu tacos?? What Mex joint even knows what tofu is?? Big Daddy Mike in the kitchen does and knows it well! I left it to Megan to bring her best veggie meal out and left it up to her. 

Tofu fajitas!?!?!?  Wow full of flavor, taste , texture - seasoned great and a portion built for 2! Big daddy Mike ( I don't think I'd ask for him by that) came out for a tofu follow up. Told him it was great and I was pleasantly shocked at how good it was. This stuff needs to be on the menu!

Kudos to NachoDaddy for an informed waitress, a creative chef and an offering to vegetarians that goes beyond the boring.
