Great food , healthy alternative to fast food . I have never been disappointed with my meals every time I dine for lunch or dinner . I prefer the rice bowls and they are quite tasty and refreshing . If you are counting calories and want to go the healthy route they have you covered with some dishes that are vegan or low in calories . The owners and managers are attentive to your needs , I have no complaints !
