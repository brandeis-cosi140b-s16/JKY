I originally wanted to go to the incredibly delicious Pacos Tacos just down the road, but since they had a half hour wait, I wanted to find another place to scratch my burrito itch.

Thus, we walked into Chuy's. There was no wait (surprising on a Friday night), and were seated instantly.

The decor was a little weird though. Very colorful, but the themes don't match up. You'll see hispanic decor mixed with 50's rock and roll with guitars right next to them. Not really a fan.

When it came to the food, it was very delicious. I had the steak burrito and it was very satisfying. Not a fan of their salsa (I always wish it were a little bit spicier), but still decent food nonetheless.

It can't hold a candle to Pacos Tacos, but it's still worth your time and money nonetheless.
