This place didn't stand out on it's own but I tried it due to the proximity to my hotel and the overall positive yelp reviews and I am happy that I did.  I went early and solo so I sat at the bar.  I didn't experience any of the service issues that are pervasive in other reviews.

The bartender was a bit less sophisticated that I would have expected.  Given the extensive tequila menu, I asked for a recommendation for his best margarita.  Despite me telling him that I am not a fan of sweet and a more traditionalist, he suggested a coconut margarita.  When he described the ingredients, I passed on his recommendation and went with one from the menu (which was delicious).

As a vegetarian, I also asked for the bartender's food recommendation.  He was very candid and knowledgeable about both the menu and other diners' preferences.  At his recommendation, I ordered the hibiscus enchilada and I am so glad that I did!  It looked beautiful and tasted better - a nice blend of tangy and creamy and very substantial.  The black beans served with it were good, if not a bit too salty.  Fresh steamed veggies and rice added a nice compliment.

I found the prices reasonable for the quality and amount of food.  They do offer a limited happy hour menu that had many options at discounted prices.  I don't mind paying for quality food but the one thing that rubbed me the wrong way was charging for chips and salsa, which were just okay - typical offerings at any other Mexican restaurant.  The price was modest but it was a strange staple to charge for.
