Susie's is great--not the best but friendly, dingy and tasty. They try hard to be better than they are, but the proof is in the food. It's good--a little rough around the edges, but good. Strange front door...but I like it when I'm in Aridzona. Not as good as SoCal Mexican, but better than Serrano's by a mile...and Macayo's too. Now, Jordan's on Central...that's the place! But if you're over in Mesa/Tempe, Susie's is a good choice. Aloha....
