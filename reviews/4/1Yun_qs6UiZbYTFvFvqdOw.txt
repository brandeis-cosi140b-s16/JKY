Some of the unhealthiest food you'll eat, but man is it good!  The ingredients are fresh and delicious.  The prices are pretty fair considering how filling the food is.

The best part about the place it that it defies what you think a burrito stand will be.  It is, without a doubt, the cleanest restaurant I've ever seen.  It has an open kitchen so you can see how everything sparkles.  The floors are spotless and,after a long night of drinking, I'd be totally cool with eating off of them.
