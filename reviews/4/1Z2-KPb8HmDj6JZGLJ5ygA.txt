So I have to have real Mexican food when I come to Arizona and had to try this joint. I always ask if a Mexican place has cotija cheese and if they answer in the affimative, then I know they at least have the potential of being authentic. So I get the torta ahogada, pork. Super tasty pork with avocado, cotija cheese (I asked them for it) with a spicy red sauce covering it and drizzled with cream. All of my friends loved it as it was delicious. Also, the counter guy taking our order was so helpful and friendly and BAM got our order spot on. He could tell we had never been there before and kept offering us samples of the ice cream, horchata (SO GOOD) and soup.
I wish I had tried their paletas, they looked delicious but we were all happy with what we got. I wish I lived here so I could eat there again. Yum.
