If I have to choose drive thru for dinner it is either In-N-Out or El Pollo Loco. There chicken is always cooked well and I love their seasoning/marinades. I usually only get the the thighs accompanied by a salad or just cole slaw and that is it. I do not venture too much, just an occasional order of the churros. The place has not let me down yet so I will keep this location in my rotation.
