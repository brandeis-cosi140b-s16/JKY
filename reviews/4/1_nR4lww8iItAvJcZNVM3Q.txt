This is the best late night food around! Midnight any day of the week I know can rely on La Bamba. I get a regular sized burrito or a couple tacos; great meat selections, always have tasted fresh. They are heavy handed with the cilantro and onion, which I appreciate. Very kind staff, fast service. Accommodations in the restaurant are very basic but more isn't needed. Very affordable. Try it.
