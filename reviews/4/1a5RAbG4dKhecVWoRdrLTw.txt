I'm always up to try new food especially any fusion restaurants. I had the fusion burrito with spicy pork and the pork belly fries. They also gave complimentary tortilla chips with salsa and guacamole. I don't know what it was about the guacamole, but I couldn't get enough if it.

As for my fusion burrito, it tasted unique and great. The portion size was huge for what it was worth. For the fries, I got the half order for $6 and replaced bulgogi with pork belly for $2. The fries were cheesy with the right amount of spice, but I wish they gave more pork belly. I suggest getting the full order for $8 and just keeping the bulgogi.

This place is definitely worth a try though and the service is great.
