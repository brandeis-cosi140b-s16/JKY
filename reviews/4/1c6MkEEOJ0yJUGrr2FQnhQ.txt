There are two things that keep me coming back to this place: 1) the Mango Sticky Rice dessert, it comes with crema catalana and a mango sorbet sooooo good! and, 2) the Rou Jia Mo Street 
Sandwich, small but finger-licking good! I've tried other things like the tacos, the steamed buns with barbecue pork, and the fried rice. They're good too, but if I have it my way all I need is the sandwich and the dessert.
