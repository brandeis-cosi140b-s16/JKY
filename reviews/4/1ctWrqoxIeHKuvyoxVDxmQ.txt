Lately, I've been visiting many Mexican eateries, fast food, authentic, chain restaurants, you name it. It's one of my food phases I go through. 

This month, that phase is tacos. I'll have to say Rubio's Grill Gourmet Taco with Garlic Herb Shrimp was awesome. The blackened Ono taco, not so much. I'm sure having a fried fish taco would have sufficed, but I gave it a try. Not surprisingly, fish was pretty dry. I can't dock too many points, though, it's hard to expect good grilled fish from a chain, no offense. 

The staff was very friendly and very efficient. The store is kept clean, and of course I always love their salsa bar. I think this store is probably well run compared to other Rubio's.

I'll be back for more tacos till my cravings subsides...
