Highly recommend. Other locations have let me down a bit in the past.   Food was out of this world. My party ordered carne asada burrito, carnitas burrito, chicken torta.....I had a chile relleno  burrito. Slice of heaven!!

If you are looking for the service of 5 star dining at a taco joint I don't know what planet you are from....as per other reviews. 

Clean, quick cordial service, huge menu,  large portions, excellent food....what more can you ask for?!

Did I mention open 24 hours?
