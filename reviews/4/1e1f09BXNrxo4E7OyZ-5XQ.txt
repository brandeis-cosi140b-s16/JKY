Don't be SCURRED to eat at a taco truck!!

Stopped here the other night with some of the Yelp-izzles after Herbs & Rye. It was Jade W, Elnino F, Eleazar A, and I. We couldn't decide on where to go so Eleazar suggested El Pollo Mobile.

None of of has been here before, but we were all happy with Eleazar's pick!

I got 1 pollo taco and 1 carne asada taco. They were only $1 each. There is a bowl of guacamole by the veggies and I put a scoop on each of my tacos. I also ate some of the carrots after I had finished my tacos.

I did not get sick, so the food was definitely clean. I will mos def come back to try some of the other tacos!!
