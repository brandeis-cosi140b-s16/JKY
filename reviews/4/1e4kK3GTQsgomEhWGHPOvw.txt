Our first night in Vegas and we needed somewhere to eat that wasn't too far from our hotel. We were seated outside immediately and each ordered a drink. It was a cold night so we were glad they had heaters nearby. There was live rock music that night so we basically got dinner and a show! I ordered the green veggie burrito and my husband ordered the Asada tacos. He was very happy with his tacos but wished there was a larger portion. What he got was only fit for an appetizer! Our bill came out to be a bit pricier than we anticipated but I am sure that it being in the strip in a Vegas is going to drive up the cost. Service was good and the music was entertaining so we can't complain much!
