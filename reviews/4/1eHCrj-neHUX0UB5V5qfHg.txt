For a fast food type Mexican restaurant, I love this place.  I'm not sure they have the Blackened Salmon Burrito anymore, but that thing was amazing!  Their salsas (salsa bar) are pretty much average, but it's nice to have a choice.  I still don't like it as much as Chipotle, but it's a nice change once in a while.
