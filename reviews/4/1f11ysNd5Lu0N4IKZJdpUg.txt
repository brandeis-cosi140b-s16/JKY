This place isn't your fanciest Mexican restaurant, but for authenticity it's awesome. It starts with chips and salsa and this isn't any ordinary salsa it's hot and yummy! For dinner I had the golla burro with melted butter on top. I think it's their specialty. Anyway it's really fresh and delicious and authentic. I would give this restaurant five stars if the interior was a little nicer, but for taste it's a five.
