I went here for the first time for a work happy hour and it was pretty decent.  As someone that's not a huge partier anymore, I would recommend getting there closer to happy hour time but as someone who loves a crowded bar scene, it's a great option for late night as it got packed around 8 p.m.  Typical Mexican food options.  There's an awesome HUGE outdoor section that I'm excited to take advantage of in the non-115 degree weather!  There are private cabanas that you can rent (I think it's $250 to rent them) with a TV and a server.  Service is usually pretty good - plenty of staff on a Friday night
