We have no real Mexican grocers back home in Connecticut so this place made me giddy.  Huge drums of every kind of dried pepper imaginable.  Pinatas, sombreros and other toys.  Good selection of mexican cheeses.  The homemade corn tortillas were piping hot still.  People were buying the tortilla chips in bulk.  Only downside was the people working there, went out of there way to not be helpful.  Cashier says "I'll be right with you" and then says "How are you today?" and I say "Great, thanks..do you have tacos?" followed by her saying "I'll be right with you" again as I stood and watched her fiddle with the register for another 2 minutes.
