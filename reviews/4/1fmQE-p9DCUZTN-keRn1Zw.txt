Love the concept, pretty happy with some tacos, other dishes are pretty average. 

- chicken nachos, very meh, not sure if it's because nachos should never be made fusion style or the lack of the korean sauce ruined it. 
- Calamari tacos-- MEH, Do Not get.  Basically two fishstick like pieces of calamari with tartar sauce, Disgusting. 

Onto the good. 
- Fish taco is delectable. Very well seasoned and tasty. 


I've had shrimp and bulgogi at the other location and those did not disappoint, 

the Pork belly was average, nothing to write home about, not very flavorful, it sounds exotic, but it did not deliver.

Musubi w fried egg was ok. A tad on the salty side, and I would've liked more rice, but for 4$ for two giant pieces, I aint complaining.  Makes me miss Hawaii.
