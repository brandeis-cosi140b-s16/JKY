Decided to give this place a try based on the Yelp reviews. Walked in and didn't expect much. Restaurant is small, decor is simple. Service was friendly, everyone was pleasant and gracious. We ordered the mini chimichangas, fish tacos, carnitas tacos, wings and Pollo Fundido. Everything was great!  That Pollo Fundido was insanely good!  The tacos were a little pricey ($4) for the size. We're visiting from L.A.; those same tacos would normally go for about $1.50 - $2.50 back home. Would definitely go back regularly if I lived here.
