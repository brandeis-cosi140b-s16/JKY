I waited until eating here several times and trying different things on the menu before writing my review. Overall, I've been pretty unimpressed with Phoenix Mexican food since moving here.  Turns out La Frontera serves up what I consider to be the real deal. I'm surprised there's not more competition (send me suggestions!). 

Hands down, the shrimp taco from the seafood side is my favorite. Perfectly fried and comes with a nice sauce. I'd pass on the ceviche...I'm not a fan of the tomato juice they mix it with. From the meat side, I like pretty much everything but tripitas, cabeza, and lengua are my favorites. I usually get a mixed plate of tacos and for some reason, they always seem to mess up just one of my taco meats. Other than that complaint, prices and hours are great.
