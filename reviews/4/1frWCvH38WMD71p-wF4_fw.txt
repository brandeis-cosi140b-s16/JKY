I finally tried the Cancun Enchiladas which has cheese, scallops, shrimp, pico de gallo and Cancun sauce.  I thought I died and went to hangover heaven.  Wow.  It was absolutely delish.  Simple, but tasty.  

The banana crisp dessert was NO joke.  The servers always recommended it, so I finally tried it.  It's almost cheesecake meets banana pudding with nilla wafers.  Very gooooood.
