I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, but these guys really know what they're doing.  The carnitas is outstanding.  The Alhambre steak plate is wonderful.  I would eat here over Pedro's or any other Madison Mexican place.  The staff is friendly, though sometimes they seem distracted.  Get there early.  It fills up quickly.  They really need to move to a bigger place.
