Very innovative chef! Great ideas.  Masterful creations of small plates.  They change the menu often (which is good and bad)..  good because of variety, but bad because if I really like something, I want it again.  They could have a few more wine selections (on the medium-upper end)  Overall, I had a great experience. I've been there twice.  Great location too.
