We stopped here after a movie...We found the decor to be quite interesting.
I really loved the chicken soup with green chili. 
Hubby had the tortilla soup- that was much heavier. 
I generally rate a mexican place by the taste of their house margarita and their fajitas. We had to pass on the margaritas tonight, but we split the combo fajitas with steak and chicken. I would definitely come back for the steak fajitas. I'm also a sucker for sopaipillas and figure any place that can surprise me with a basket of them...is definitely a place I will return to.
