Wanted to give this place 5 stars to manipulate the average rating into being a bit higher. Couldn't live with myself.

It's nothing special in and of itself. The parking lot is a bit awkward to enter if you're traveling west on Sunset because you have to circle around almost back to the street. The seating is awkwardly designed as compared to other locations. I figure they probably inherited this place from somebody else. Also, the interior was renovated a few months ago and they do have sufficient service and condiments and whatnot.

I definitely don't mind stopping by here every so often because it's a convenient lunch spot.
