My friend and I went here for a late lunch and got in line just in time as after we ordered the line got long fast. Standard burritos bowls and we got a side of chips. The lovely calorie counts on the menu really make you think twice about what you are ordering.

The only off thing, is my friend and i noticed they had a B from the health department which skeeves me out a bit...
