Now THIS is a grill. As soon as you walk in, you can smell the charcoal and feel a bit of heat in your face. When I saw the fire raging in the small kitchen, I knew I was in for a treat. I've ordered a couple of items from here. A simple asada burrito, and a pork  quesadilla. Neither of them disappointed.

Once I bit into my food, I was overwhelmed (in a good way) by the flavor. Well seasoned...smoky...cooked just right. They really know what they're doing.

There's also a small beer selection. 7 oz. Bud light or Coronitas, with 12. Tecate/Tecate Light. But if you go through what I imagine to be a hassle to obtain a license, why not expand on that selection a bit?

I will be back to try the lengua, and the tacos pastor. The menu is small, but what they do, they do right. If you want BBQ from someone who does it better than you can, drop by here.
