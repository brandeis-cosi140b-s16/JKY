Been coming here off and on for over 30 years and it's still great a little mexican food restaurant. The sign out front still isn't lit at night so it's easy to drive by if you don't know where it's at. They've expanded to seat more people as the original only had a few tables. Only downfall is they charge for an extra bowl of chips. Might as well just order a nachos. Quick attentive service and decently priced.
