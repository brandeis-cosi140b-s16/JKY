I came here tonight with a Groupon with two of my friends.  The Groupon described this place as an upscale Mexican restaurant.  We sat down to an assorted chips variety of banana chips, blue corn tortilla, and regular tortilla chips.  There were 4 different salsas to go with it.  I was impressed with the banana chips thrown into the basket.

We ordered chicken enchiladas, vegetarian cheese enchiladas, and grilled fish tacos with rice and beans.  The enchiladas were quite a big portion, but they had unique flavors that I could not figure out.  My dish was the fish taco and it was the best fish taco I have ever had!  It was lightly seasoned with chipotle sauce and lime vinagrette.  It was the perfect size for 1 person.  I think some of their other portions like the enchiladas can be shared, or you will have take home food.

The ambiance was very modern and lively.  The service was great.  My only negative that may give this a 4-star instead of 5-star is that the menu is somewhat limited.  I am not a big fan of pork, and many of the dishes I would have ordered would have had something like scallops and pork belly.  I think their chefs are quite talented and should look into a few more dishes.
