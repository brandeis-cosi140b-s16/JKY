After a long day in Las Vegs, a group of four gals walked into Baja, with a desire to have some serious Fresh food.  The service from Alex was amazing.  He conversated with us and went out of his way to make sure that we were happy with our orders.  

Tortilla chips, Fire-grilled Skinny Chicken Bowl with AVOCADO!!!, and a diet soda. I was set.  The service was amazing, the food was cooked to order, and we were in and out quick, with no problem.  

If this wasn't a chain, I seriously would have considered giving it a five-star review.
