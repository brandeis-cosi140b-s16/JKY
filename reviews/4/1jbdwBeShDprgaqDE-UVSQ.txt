We ate here again tonight and again really enjoyed the meal.  We are creatures of habit when it comes to the Cantina.  My wife generally gets the Pollo con pipian (chicken breast with pumpkin seeds in sauce) while I get the Pollo boracho - chicken breast with a sauce laced with nopales (cactus strips).

The chips and salsa are usually brought very quickly, and the waitstaff has always been quite professional.  The bus staff here is above and beyond - the reason for the 4th star.  I never have to ask for an iced tea refill.  They are around before I need to.

We will continue coming here and enjoying these two dishes.
