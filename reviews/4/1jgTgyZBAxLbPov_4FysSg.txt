Not a bad place for your Mexican food.

Food - if you order a small platter, you will get a good amount of food. The larger platter will fill you up and beyond. If you are like me, I had to pack the rest for to-go. I believe waiting for our food, while loading up on their salsa/guacamole sauce + chips, really got me. Don't scrimp on the guacamole, it's good!  The tamales/enchilada combo was what I had ordered. Although, the shredded beef tamale was not wrapped in the corn shuck, which takes the fun out of unwrapping your tamales.  Enchilada looked messy, but surprisingly good!! Overall, I'd come back, when I feel for Mexican.

Service - good and attentive.  No complaints here.

Place - you get a good Aztecan vibe!
