The day this Chipotle location opened, I *may* have had a mini celebration. I had grown accustomed to driving to the South Park area when the Chipotle craving hit so this location gets major points for its proximity alone to me :)

This location gets crowded during typical peak times (lunch, 5-7 p.m., weekends) but the line moves pretty quickly. The only gripe I have about the quick moving line is that the employees are working so quickly that they're not paying full attention to the order given (plus the loud music that's playing) and will have to start over because of erroneous ingredients added. 

During peak times, the designated parking lot is A MESS so I suggest parking across the street in the food lion parking lot to save you a headache and possible fender bender.
