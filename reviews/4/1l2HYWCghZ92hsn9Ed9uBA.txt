Confession: I went to Carolinas at 9 am this morning for a tostada. I say it was a good breakfast. Also, in the early morning the restaurant is actually quiet! It's almost nice. Anyways, I'm glad they are open earlier, but I still haven't tried any breakfast options there.

Carolinas is not pretty. It was a chinese restaurant, which become clear as soon as you walk in the door and see the crazy colors and zodiac symbols. The kitchen is wide open and it's always packed with people, so it is very very noisy! 

However, if you are willing to brave the atmosphere, the food is darn good. I like the beans more than any of the meat products, so I stick to burritos and tostadas normally, but every once in a while a chimichanga is worth a try.
