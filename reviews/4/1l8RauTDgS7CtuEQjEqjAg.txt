I had to tell you all about one of the BEST MARGARITA I EVER had , (ok , so I had 3 ) DAMN They were good ! 

Not the chemical taste of the one that I had at another place . I don't like to mention names (Mad Mex)

I ordered the special of the day ( Mexican number 2 Dinner ) Little taste of everything , and everything was delicious. If your Hungry and really enjoy Mexican food , you should order this plate.

The staff all spoke broken English , ( True Mexicans ! ) Very Authentic.

The salsa was bland , could have used a little more spice , but I fixed that problem with a plentiful application of the hot sauce supplied on the table.  over all , a very good diner decision
