Used to come here years ago when it was run by the previous owners. Never ate mexican food here. Only came here for the ribs. When the new owners came in they bought the recipe and it was done really well. The ribs are the best I have ever had. I have not been here in the last year so I don't know if they have kept up the quality. Can't speak for the mexican. I think there ribs are the hidden gem here.
