Out here for a convention and decided to get some Mexican food. Pulled out the old Yelp and found this gem. Small but open environment and the staff is just amazing. Very friendly and helped us through the menu. Lots of great beers. Most of the craft is in cans or bottles (wish they had more on tap). Food was absolutely amazing. I would recommend that if you order more than 2 tacos only order 2 ate a time. By the time I got to the 3rd it was getting cold. As for the food I ordered the chicken tinga* carne asada and the al pastor. Everything was cooked perfectly and were amazing. We also got the table side guac and tried the bacon and corn on top. You can never go wrong with more bacon in your life (minus the whole cancer thing). We will be coming back here soon on this trip and futures trips.
