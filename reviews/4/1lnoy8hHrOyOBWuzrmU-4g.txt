I come here primary for the Tuesday and Thursday Taco specials and based on that I give it 5 stars! Never really a long wait in the drive thru. Crunchy Tacos on Tuesdays are always packed full and has that fresh crispy taco shell. Same goes for Chicken soft taco on Thursday's. Grilled chicken breast always tastes fresh with just the right amount of white sauce. Cashiers are always generous with the hot sauce. Good location in my book!
