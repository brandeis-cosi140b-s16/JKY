Haven't been to a Garcia's in some time so wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised.  This Garcia's is a fairly large place and the interior is very nice.  We were seated immediately and the waiter and salsa and chips were there quickly and our drink order taken.  The chips were very large and warm.  The salsa was mild but the bean dip that they also brought was much spicier (good first impression with large warm chips and bean dip along with salsa!).
     I ordered a two item lunch with a sour cream chicken enchilada and a red chili colorado burrito.  I thought both were very good.  They were large and the plate had lots of refried beans and a scoop of rice (I am not much into rice so glad it didn't overwhelm the plate like in some places).  My wife had the cheese enchillada and tostado which she liked quite a bit as well.  The waiter was attentive with the drinks and extra salsa (and I did like the way they gave us both a serving of salsa rather than having to dip from one dish).  
     The only reason for not giving the place a 5 star is just the lack of alternative meats as in prevalent here in Phoenix such as adobada, machaca, barbacoa, carnitas, etc.  I know they have stores in California as well and that is all most restaurants there serve is the chicken, ground beef, and shredded beef.  Other than that though, we enjoyed it and will return.
