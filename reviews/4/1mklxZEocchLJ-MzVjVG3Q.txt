I had the vegetarian breakfast burrito.  It was very good.  The tortilla and the sauce that came with it was spot on.  I really like potato in my b/fast burritos though and it didn't have any.  Lucky for me we had ordered french fries that were delicious and so I opened my burrito and put some in.  Perfect solution.

My husband and son shared the 18 piece chicken wings.  They thought they were okay.  Not bad but not the best they ever had either.  My son thought they were a bit dry but my husband liked that they weren't fatty.  My son also didn't care for the peppery taste vs. the vinegarry taste he is used to.

One of my girls had the turkey sandwich.  It was a hot sandwich and a hit all around the table.

Another child had the grilled cheese and it was just what you would expect a grilled cheese to be.

The lemon flavored sweet iced tea was real good!

Cheap meal for a family.  I don't know that I recommend it when hot out because the air conditioning doesn't work so well.  It does have video games and a couple of them were free.  Not sure if they always are or if we just got lucky.  This is the type of place that you order at a window and then pick it up to go or sit down.  Very easy for families.

If you want to tip and are using a debit or credit card then you need to tell the guy before he charges the card or it is to late.
