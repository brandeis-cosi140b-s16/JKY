I'm giving four stars. This restaurant has been around for a long time. I absolutely love their mini chimis. Tha jalepono cream cheese dip and mini chimi are very good. The only reason I don't give five was went there just last night, and the service was terrible. One refill on my drink, had to ask other waitresses for more chips, and more drink, while our waitress stood at the other end of the place a gabbed away...after looking again the bad experience was at the 35th Ave and northern location.
