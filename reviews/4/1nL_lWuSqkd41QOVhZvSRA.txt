Fast, fresh, inexpensive, and delicious. 

The meat in both the chicken tacos and beef flautas were perfectly marinated (not steamed, cut up, and drowned in salsa) and cooked slowly. Fresh tortillas, too. Salsa was very good.

Rice and beans were on the "pretty good" side of "Ok". (The airport location is not nearly as good).
