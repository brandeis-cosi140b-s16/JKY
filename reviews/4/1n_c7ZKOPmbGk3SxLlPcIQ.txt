I was so happy to find this place! My Mom was in the hospital the day before and wanted some home cooking. This totally hit the spot. It seemed to be a little under staffed and I felt sorry for the cook and the front counter person, but both ladies did an awesome job! There appeared to be a steady stream of regulars. That's always a good sign in my opinion. The carnitas and horchetta were spot on....so good! :) I'll definitely come here again.
