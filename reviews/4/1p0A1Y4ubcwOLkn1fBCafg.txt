On our daytrip excursion on the Apache Trail, we stopped into the saloon for a great lunch of a cowboy cheeseburger with fries - surprisingly good and fresh food for a town that has a population of 6!  Great atmosphere, good service and great food...a winning combination!  Make sure you don't forget to enjoy some prickly pear gelato next door too...yummy!
