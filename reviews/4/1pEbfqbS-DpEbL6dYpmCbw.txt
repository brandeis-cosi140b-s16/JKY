This is one of our go-to inexpensive dinner places. Their margarita's are good and very large if you get anything but the small. The food is good, I'm a fan of the La Mejor and my hubby always gets Pollo con Crema.  Take home boxes are standard for us at Monterrey having left overs for the next day.

The service can be hit of miss, but typically they are very attentive and food comes out quickly.  The dining room is a bit of a dive and sad.  The booths and tables have seen better days.  It could certainly use a face-lift.
