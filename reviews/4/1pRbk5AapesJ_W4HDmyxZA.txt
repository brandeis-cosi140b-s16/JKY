Finally had dinner there and I was happy.  First order of business, make my wife happy, check.  Second make the kids happy, less talk and play means they are actually eating, great.  Third, compare food and prices to other Mexican places I've been and ask myself if I would return, definite.  Three stars there and now for the fourth.

Fourth Star, I took advantage of their Facebook 1/2 off any Margarita, tried the Sangria, I liked it, would have had another, but I drove.  Make sure to check their FB for deals.  Tried their Tio Pancho, aka Poyo Fundido, and loved it.  Would have finished it, but when your 8yr old gives you that "I want it look", of course I have to share.  Portions are good.  When I was done, I was just right and that is a statement when I'm not interested in desert.

Service was friendly, fast, and helpful.  I always make it a point to ask what the waiter or waitress preferences are and I was happy with all of Jennifer's suggestions.
