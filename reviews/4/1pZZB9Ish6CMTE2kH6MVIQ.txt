Chipotle just opened several locations near where I live, so I decided to give them a try.  I'm glad I did because they are really good.  Very fresh ingredients, the tortillas were soft and chewy, the lettuce was crisp, the salsa was hot, but not too hot, and the meat was savory, tender, with a unique and pleasant texture.  I threw some guac on top to make my tacos complete, and I was a happy camper.  For about the same price as a Moe's or Qdoba, Chipotle offers a much higher quality meal.  I was very impressed and will definitely be going back.  I had the tacos with shredded beef, and also tried a couple of bites of my girlfriends chicken burrito...she got the hot salsa on hers, and baby ...it was hot!  But still good, fresh tortillas, great ingredients.  If you're in the mood for Mexican, give Chipotle a try.
