I had some of the best pizza I've ever had last night. No kidding. My hubbie and I decide to have our date night at Sal's Tomato Pies, and we were wowed!  

The only negative was the wait. We arrived at prime-time, about 6:45...which means our wait was about 55 minutes. But luckily we scored a window seat, had a few beers, and people-watched. They also allow you to provide your phone number and you can leave and they will text you. 

We ordered delicious garlic bread, and the Tangerine beer from Potosi. Both delicious. And then our pizza was the Carbonara with cheese, Nueske's bacon, a couple of cooked eggs, and arugula. Sounds a bit daring? Yes...but I highly recommend.  

The place is tiny and be prepared to leave smelling like a wood-fire stone oven. The kitchen is visible and right there as you sit and walk into the restaurant.  

The bar is also super small and has only 8-10 cramped stools. They have great beer on tap, and we were living the Pitosi beers. I wish their bar was a bit bigger.  I bet they do , too....as most people would leave and sit outside or go a different bar to wait. 

But overall ,  we enjoyed our visit and our food, and we will be back soon.
