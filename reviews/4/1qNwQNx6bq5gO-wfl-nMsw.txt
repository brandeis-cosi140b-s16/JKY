I love Del Taco. I don't know why, but they are just yummy to me. I only get their chicken soft tacos. Here is how Dottsy eats a chicken soft taco from Del Taco: Open the taco, pour a packet of INFERNO sauce on the taco, spread guacamole over it, and place 3 or 4 french fries inside the taco. Fold one end, the fold in half and take a BIG MESSY bite! Hey..never knock unless you've tried!

I will say that Del Taco uses REAL chicken pieces and every time I eat there my food is hot a fresh, even the yummy crinkle cut fries. Yes, it's a guilty pleasure, but Del Taco is a step up from other fast food Mexican food. I wouldn't even really consider it Mexican food, it's more Calexican food, a mixture of California and Mexican.

Hit Del Taco for a quick fast food fix, you might be surprised!
