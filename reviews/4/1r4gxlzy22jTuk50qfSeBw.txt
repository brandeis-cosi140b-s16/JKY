I have seen this place many times and decided to make a stop. What I found was a menu that had more than your usual taco and burrito. That's right, I ordered Birria. Goat. Let me tell you, the bowl came with lots of meat and the broth was good. Add the rice with some onions and celantro and every bite was great. The place did not smell greasy. The guacamole was freaking fresh and buttery with no seasonings to add with it. I have tasted the burrito and loaded nachos and it's not the same as others. I was satisfied. I hear this place gets busy so come early.
