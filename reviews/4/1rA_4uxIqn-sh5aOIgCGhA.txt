I'll make this a quick one. After a long and fun night on Fremont Street I had to have some chow before bed. Zapas is in The Plaza and we're staying here so my options were some what limited. 
I jumped in the line and ordered a chicken rice and cheese burrito and an order of taquitos.  I was not disappointed. The ordering process is similar to a Chipotle or Subway. You pick your ingredients as your going through the line. 
The food was ready fast and the staff was friendly and willing to answer questions about the different sauces and ingredients. The price was on par with the location and food. Give it a shot
