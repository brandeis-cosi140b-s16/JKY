My first time here and I was confused about how to order. The menu is in Spanish and if you don't know what cabeza, lengua etc. means then Google it. I had taken Spanish in college but I couldn't remember what was what. I had someone with me who saw this place and said it had great reviews so why not try it so that's why we were there. 

I ordered the al pastor taco. I had just tried the al pastor at some other place but I felt this one was a little better . If I can remember it was $2 a taco? Overall, this place is a hole in the wall. There were flies flying around inside and it was kind of empty for being the lunch rush. It was good but not memorable enough for me to always want it. 

They do take credit card but I think there's a $5 minimum. It's warm in there so dress appropriately.
