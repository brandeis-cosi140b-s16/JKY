After seeing Restaurant Mexico voted as the "Best Neighborhood Mexican Restaurant in Tempe" in the New Times: Best of Phoenix, I decided to give it a try. 

I ordered tomatillo chicken enchiladas, with rice and beans, and a side order of flour tortillas. The entire meal was scrumptious. Immediately after receiving the flour tortillas, which smelled so fresh, I knew I was in for a treat. Apparently they purchase the tortillas from an undisclosed location in South Phoenix, and they were top notch. Next we move on to the beans; they were smooth and thin, with just the right amount of salt. The rice was moist and had a great flavor. Lastly, the chicken enchiladas are sure to excite the taste buds with a spicy tomatillo sauce. 

Not only is the food delicious, but it is cheap too! Most entrees are $10 or less, which is shocking considering it is on Mill Ave. My expectations were surely surpassed, and I left Restaurant Mexico a fat and happy man.
