I really like this place.  

1. Its really big and the outside seating is badass... a little canal with a bridge you need to walk across, outdoor bar, quite isolated from busy Hayden Road... feels like you are on a neighbors back porch. 

2. The menus look like newspapers.  Enough said. 

3.  The food is pretty good.  Spicy enough.  Had the Enchantment Platter and it was awesome! Totally recommend it ... get to sample some of the best stuff on the menu all in one entree.  Margaritas are pretty good there too. 

4. Service is good.  Everyone I've ever encountered is really friendly and efficient.  

5.  The place as a physical structure is rad.  It feel like you are entering an Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland. A rough and tumble stone facade archway leads you up a ramp to the entrance.  Fake bats dangle from it.  A little waterfall, bridge... but no snake pit :)
