I tried most everything on the menu here. I really love this place, it's way better than chipotle. They have options like wheat tortillas and brown rice, plus fish and shrimp tacos which are great. The steak is actually pretty good unlike the little chewy pieces of rubber u get at similar chains. The guac and brownies are excellent. Only complaints are I don't care for the flavor of the carnitas and they are a bit more pricy than their counterparts.
