In Las Cruces, NM this place is a bit mediocre, due to some of the amazing competition there.  

When placed in Phoenix, it blows away much of the competition.  But I miss southern NM food, so I am biased.  

Get the rellenos - green chiles stuffed with cheese and then battered and deep fried.  

Love the salsas and free sopapillas.
