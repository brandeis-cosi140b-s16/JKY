Yes, it's a chain mexican restaurant & having so many choices in the Valley, I should be ashamed to go here, but I've been eating here for YEARS.  The service is generally very good, servers are friendly and quick, and the food is consistently good.

I love their salsa and bean dip they bring out with chips.  A little bit of bean dip + a lot of salsa = a happy mouth.
