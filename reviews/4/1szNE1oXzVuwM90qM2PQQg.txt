This location looks to be brand new.  I went through the drive-thru as it was kind of late (didn't even look to see if the dining room was still open) but the girl on the other end of the intercom system was very nice and my order was displayed on the screen in detail.

My only gripe is the wait... usually you can expect a pretty quick drive thru experience, but I had to wait a few minutes (seemed like hours since I was ridiculously hungry).

The food was hot and fresh and hit the spot.  

One thing to note if you are coming from I-77... this is a little far from the interstate.  Since it was dark, I just had to hope the taco bell was there and it was the "shining light" in the sea of darkness.... thank goodness.  I guess this area is still being developed so there are lots of gaps between civilization so it may seem like you are lost trying to get to here.
