As far as quick, easy food goes, Qdoba gets it right.  The general concept is subway's build your own sandwich, but with Mexican food.  They have the right balance of healthy food options, quick service, and savory flavors.  The overall concept is similar to Chipotle, which is right next door.  What sets Qdoba apart for me is their Queso, which now comes in 6 flavors, and which Chipotle does not have.  Also of note, this location offers the Coca-cola flavor shot machine allowing you to make your own flavors of soda.  UPMC employee's get a 99 cent drink.  All toppings are now included in the price, allowing you to get things like queso and guacamole at no extra cost.  There is plenty of seating, both indoors and outdoors.
