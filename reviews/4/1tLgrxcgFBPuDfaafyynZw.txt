Ate here on a Saturday night around 7 PM so it was pretty busy.  Started off with their free chips and salsa which was some of the best that I've ever had in my life.  The only problem our group had was when we found some dead mosquitoes in the bottom of the chips basket. But, after we ordered another helping 'easy on the bugs' that seemed to take care of that problem.  Would have probably grossed out some people, but were in college, and were broke, and it's free, so what can ya do? The food was good and cheap with a pretty generous serving and the staff was friendly and attentive. 

Bottom line: Good Mexican food if you don't want to make the trip out to Dos Reales on Prospect, but if you have a car, that trip is worth it every time.
