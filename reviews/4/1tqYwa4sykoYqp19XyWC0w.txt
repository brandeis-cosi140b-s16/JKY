The tamales were tasty and the service was great. My server, Angelica, was very friendly and helpful. I went here for lunch. The food was fresh, came out quickly, and was a good value. It was nice to have some authentic Mexican food this far from my home in Colorado, where I've gotten spoiled with its abundance.
