What I liked best about Filiberto's is when I ordered an adobada burrito, I got an adobada burrito!  No beans, no rice, just adobada topped with a little avocado.  Most burrito's whether at fast food places are in restaurant are filled with the cheaper rice and beans and very little meat.  Thanks Filiberto's!!
