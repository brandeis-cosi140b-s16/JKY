I love me some chipotle! Something about the way they seasoning food reels me in. The chicken has a slight spicy flavor and tortillas chips have a lemon zing. The standard rice comes with cilantro and lime. However, you can ask for plain white or brown rice. 

Best part about Chipotle, you're in control of what you want on your meal. Customers walk down an assembly line while meals are prepared for them. The choice of protein is naturally raised: chicken, steak, pork and even tofu! It's so DELISH!
