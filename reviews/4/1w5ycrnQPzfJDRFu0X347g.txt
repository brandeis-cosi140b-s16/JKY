I really enjoyed the restaurant.  There hasn't been a Garcia's on this side of town in decades and this brought back many happy memories.  

There was quite a wait on the Saturday we were there, but we were able to be seated in the bar at a hightop (at my 5-yr old's request).  The staff was friendly and attentive.  They really made waiting not a problem.  

We were served our drink quickly, orders taken, and the food served as soon as it was ready.  No waiting under lamps.  That was nice.  

It was crowded and noisy, but like I said we were in the bar. What do you expect?

The food was just like I remember it.  The quality was very good.  I think once the staff work out all the kinks of it being a brand new restaurant, brand new staff dynamic, things will run like a well-oiled machine.  

I will absolutely be back.
