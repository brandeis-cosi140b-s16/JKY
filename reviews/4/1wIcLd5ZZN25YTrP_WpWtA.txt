My friend who unfortunately needs to watch every penny hadn't eaten here before.  She told the server she'd have everything that was vegetarian in her salad when he walked her through the ingredients.  So, when asked if she wanted avocado, automatically said "yes" without consideration.

What a surprise to find out she was charged an extra $1.95 for a little avocado.  Sadly, she'd already left the store when she checked the receipt.  Even had she stayed, should she have asked it to be taken out?  Remade?  Were it remade that would be wasting food and not ethical in her books.

Simply put, the staff should point out if there are extras in pricing.  Not just ask about the flavors as it's so easy to get sucked into the yes, yes, routine.  I'm sure she's not the only person that's fallen for this.  

Overpaying for something mars the customer experience.  Now, I'm not saying this was deliberate.  I'm suggesting that the staff are properly trained to walk in the customers' shoes.
Thanks.

P.s.

I've been messaged that unless she had a meal combo with Sofritas or something else then the Guacamole ought to have been free.  Therefore, the staff overcharged.  Hope this helps others.  Stand up for your consumer rights but first, one needs to know what they're entitled to do so.

Thanks very much to the person who has informed me.  You're helping others here, too.
