It sucks not being able to find a menu online to order ahead...I can add that Tuesday lunch special is taco salad. 

The two enchilada combo was delicious and piping hot. I will definitely be going there again...it's surprisingly hard to find good greasy mexican food. I would plan on just getting takeout...unless you want to sit in an outdoor cage.
