I put off this review until they could get the kinks worked out...and thankfully, they have!  

The first time we went it was right after they opened.  We weren't expecting much because of that...but what we got was even worse.  I'm not going to go into details...bad food and bad/creepy service and waaaay over-priced.  Growing pains.  But the owners were awesome.

We went back again and I ordered the same thing I did the first time (ahi tacos).  Both times, sadly, the ahi was over-cooked.  We vowed never to return.  Until we did.

Third try's a charm.  We ordered something completely different...salad and soup.  Much better.  The soup came in a huge bowl and it was so fresh and tasty.  The salad was big as well and equally as yummy.  And, even better, they had lowered some of their prices.  It seemed like it was over-priced for the 'hood and now is about par with Bink's across the street.

I'm a fan...we'll be back for sure to try some other dishes.
