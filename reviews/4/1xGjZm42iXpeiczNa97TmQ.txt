Every since our favorite Mexican Restaurant ( La Rosa's ) closed many years ago we have been patronizing Garcia's ( 35th Ave & Peoria ) whenever we are in the mood for decent mexican food at a reasonable place, price and at a sit down restaurant.

The prices are very affordable.  You can literally buy the three item combo with rice and beans for $11.99 and feed two people and with the unlimited chips, bean dip and salsa your stomach will be begging you to stop eating.

Well since I am fat I like to buy the two item combo ( $10.99 ) with rice and beans.

The soda's are always fresh.  The margaritas look very delicious but I am not sure of taste or quality or even the price because I usually just pop in for lunch but one of these days I will give it a try.

I was at Garcia's last Saturday and they had a special of two cheese enchilada's with rice and beans for $6.99.  Are you kidding me ?  That's an amazing price.

Service is always prompt.  They are happy to see you and serve you.

In closing, I am not saying its the best mexican food in Phoenix but Garcia's offers the best service and price in town at least at this location.
