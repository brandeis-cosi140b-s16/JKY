Love the decor changes the new owners made. A vast improvement of chuy's.  Food was very good. Delicious chips and salsa.  Service was a little bit spotty. Slow on the iced tea and water refills.  The kitchen did make sure to bring out some more albondigas soup to my wife which was nice, when they delivered it to the table they said they would because hers was lacking some meatballs, they're call not ours so it was good to see them paying attention to that level of detail.
