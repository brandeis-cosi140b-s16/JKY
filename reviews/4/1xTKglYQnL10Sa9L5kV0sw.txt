Mexican Sushi? Yeah, it's a weird thought ... but don't let that steer you the wrong way!

Although, I didn't come here for the Mexican Sushi that's so popular I got an order of Carne Asada fries because I haven't had any that are on par with the famous San Jose Iguana's or La Victoria Nacho Fries here. Looking for the next best thing I suppose.

The shop is small, but with ample seating and serves tacos, shrimp cocktail, mexican sushi, dessert and of course carne asada fries. For drinks they have the aguas frescas and soda. Adorned all over the register are small snacks and candies, many of which I grew up eating like De La Rosa Marzipan, Vero Mango, Lucas, all the spicy Tamarindo types and pinwheel chips.

I ordered the Carne Asada Fries and Horchata for about $9, not bad for a large lunch. The fries aren't typical fast food fries and have that little battered type texture around the fries, meat is a bit small in portion. The sour cream and guacamole were scooped neatly on top. A bit plain in my opinion so I topped it with pico de gallo, lime, tomatillo salsa, jalapenos and that spicy mayo that comes on the side of their Mexican sushi. It was good, but nothing mind blowing. Their salsa bar is pretty good, definitely one of the better tomatillo salsa's I've had here. Still definitely better than Filiberto's Carne Asada fries that's for sure! Horchata was good, not too sweet but not the best Horchata I've had in PHX. Definitely needs a little more cinnamon, however still good and you can tell it was made fresh.

The shop is clean, big and the staff is friendly and fast. The only con is that the parking lot is limited and it's on a main road, so dining here during rush hour can be a struggle.
