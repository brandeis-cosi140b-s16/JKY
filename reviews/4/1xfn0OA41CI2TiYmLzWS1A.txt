For a fast food chain, El Pollo Loco is one that is a healthy choice and I'm not ashamed to say I'm a fan.  I come here often for lunch during the work week when I want something fast and good for me.  I was on a BRC Burrito and side salad kick for a while when I was avoiding meat, but lately I'm a fan of the Skinless Chicken Breast meal.  I also like places that have nutritional info available so I can check out healthy options before I get there and you can find that info on El Pollo's website.  The staff is always friendly and the food usually comes out quickly; if it doesn't, you know it just means they're grilling up more of that crazy, good chicken.
