"It's a good thing this place is near my work, or else it would have taken forever to take the time and effort to go here." That was my initial thought. Turns out, this place is very worth the time and effort to get to.

Never mind the interior design and the small parking area. The food here is good. I tried the bulgogi burrito for the first time, and I never knew it would be that tasty. A little spicy, but still it gives me a symphony of flavors. 

Although I was confused at first whether to order at the counter or sit down, I soon figured out it was a sit-down place. Doi. Go figure.

Anyway, the burrito is huge. Worth the price. They stuff it with tons of ingredients including the oh so tasty bulgogi. As I was halfway finished, the tortilla ripped apart and I was left with a pile of stuff. Delicious stuff. And I used my hand to eat it all up. You know it's good when you finish a mess with your hands.

Must go here again for more exquisite deliciousness.
