UNDER-RATED!!!!! Look, I worked at an award winning mexican restaurant in san diego for 5 years. I am a picky, picky person when it comes to mexican food. Actually, let me tell you that this is my first ever yelp review because I just feel like it needs to happen. That said, the fact that this place is sitting around with 3 stars is quite sad to me. Just appreciate this place for what it is, a hole-in-the-wall taco joint. Yeah, this is no 5 star place people, big surprise. But I'm telling you, they use pretty good product, and it starts with the tortillas. Tortillas are more important that we realize, and this place has great ones. Any good hole-in-the-wall mexican place has a salsa bar and...SURPRISE! they have one here! The meat is not grizzly and thats seemingly a tough enough feat for some of the Mexi food joints in town. Phoenix, if you continue to prefer Filibertos (really? come on people), then I will continue to prefer my short lines at the far superior Amando Bros!!!
