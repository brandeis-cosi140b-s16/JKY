This is actually the nicest Filibertos I've ever been to.  Most of them are divey or just drive thrus with some outdoor seating. This one was clean and more modern inside.

The service was decent, but nothing to write home about.

They had chips and salsa, which I've never seen at a  Filibertos.

I got the carne asada burrito, which was larger than the ones from Nico's in Tucson.  I couldn't finish mine. 

Since there are no Nico's in Phoenix, Filibertos is a good runner up.
