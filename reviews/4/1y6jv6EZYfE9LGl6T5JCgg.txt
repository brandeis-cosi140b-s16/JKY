I've been to this Rubios 3 times and had the Fish Tacos and chips every time. The first time was GREAT, 2nd time was Very Good and 3rd time was GREAT. The chips are crisp and the salsa and lime is fresh. 

The Fish Tacos on the 1st and 3rd visits were hot and crunchy. On the 2nd visit, the Fish Taco was warm and a bit soft. But, still very good.  

I think its best to get the tacos just as the fish comes out of the fryer.
