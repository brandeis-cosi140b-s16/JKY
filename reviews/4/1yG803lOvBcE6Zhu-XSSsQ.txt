If homestyle Mexican food is what you're craving, this is where to go. Just a hole in the wall place with consistently decent food at modest prices. I've eaten there since it opened for business, and they've never disappointed. I sometimes call from my driveway, and pick up my breakfast minutes later on the way to work. The owner has his act together, as do those he employs. My two favorites are the green chile burrito and the chile rellenos. Don't miss the pickled carrots, peppers, and onions. If only they had ample parking, I'd give it 5 stars.
