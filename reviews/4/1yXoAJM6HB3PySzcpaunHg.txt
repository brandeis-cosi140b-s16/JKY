First time at Roberto's and I'm not disappointed. I tried the number four, which comes with two tacos (beef or chicken), rice, and refried beans for $7. The rice and beans were excellent. At first i wad disappointed with the tacos as I did not think there looked to be a lot of chicken on them;  however, as i was eating them I quickly realized there was plenty of meat.  The hard shell tacos were good, but a little chewy. 


They seemed to have a pretty extensive menu with a wide range of entrees and sides.  The staff was pleasant.  I really liked that they have a little buffet where one can get their own salsas and toppings - they even have to go containers to make it easy! 

Overall, I will definitely be trying again.
