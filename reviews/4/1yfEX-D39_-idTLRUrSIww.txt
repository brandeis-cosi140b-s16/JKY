The food was good! Everything was well priced .  I ordered a taco and enchilada .  The kids had Carne asada burrito.  Beans came with the meal we very good. Like home cooked beans.  The meal also come with rice I never eat rice at Mexican restaurants but I ate theirs.  The chips that come before the meal we huge. (Whole tortilla ).   The only down side is they are not by my house.
