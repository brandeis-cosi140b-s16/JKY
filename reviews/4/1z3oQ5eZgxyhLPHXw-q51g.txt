Read Korinas review.... GOOD Mexican food. 

I had the Steak Ranchero, flour tortillas and rice and beans. 

The SR was like fajitas but with a little spicy sauce. Excellent
The Rice was rice... not the best not not bad either
The Beans tasted like a semi cross between ham hock and refried. Liked em! It was the Special of the day and was seriously only $5.95.

The tortilla chips were on the thick side and the salsa was on the thin side. I liked them both. 

I am not sure what style Mexican food this is but it was really good and not loaded with the cheese. It was a nice change. 

The building was clean! It looked like my mom's kitchen....you know what I mean.
