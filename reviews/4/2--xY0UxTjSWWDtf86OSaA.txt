I walked down to this new Chipotle in market square for lunch today. The place was pretty empty in comparison to most Chipotle restuarants I have been to. My chicken burrito with black beans, mild salsa, lettuce, cheese,  and sour cream was better than the burritos I usually get at the Oakland location. I'm not sure why but I could tell a difference. This location, like every PA Chipotle i have been to does not serve beer. The ones in Ohio usually do and that is always a plus.

The seating area is small but there are long tables with bar stools along all the windows offering a relaxing spot to watch the action on the square while eating. There is also outdoor seating.
