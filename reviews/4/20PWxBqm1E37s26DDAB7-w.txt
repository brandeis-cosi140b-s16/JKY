I love this place. It's my local spot, and the only downside is that it's not open late into the night. I have a craving the other day and got the super nachos and the chile rellano burrito. Gooey, cheesy, spicy deliciousness. I have tried almost everything on the menu here, and have never been disappointed. It tasted like overstuffed, inexpensive neighborhood burrito joint should taste.  I have friends come visit from back east and this is their first stop every time. Yum!
