My husband and I had our first visit to this place yesterday. Both of us were slightly hungover and needed a pick-me-up fast. The restaurant is just a few blocks from my house and I had driven by curiously a dozen times. I was surprised they were open on Sundays (only til 3 though). It's the kind of place where you order at the counter and they bring you your food. i ordered the 2 soft taco combination with carne asada. My husband had 3 soft tacos, 2 with carne asada and 1 with chicken. The carne asada was well seasoned and not greasy at all. They cook the meat when you order it so you know it's fresh. My husband's chicken taco was the best! The chicken was tender and succulent. The rice and beans were both very good as well, not at all greasy. I loved the salsa bar. They had a pico de gallo, a red sauce, 2 different types of green chile sauces, jalapenos, both pickled and fresh, and pickled carrots and onions. That reminds me of the Mexican places in San Diego. I have yet to try their burritos or fish tacos. That will be for my next trip!
