Just had a fantastic dinner here.  It was Taco Tuesday so I tried one chicken and one shredded beef taco. The meat was marinated and slow cooked to moist, juicy perfection.  Oh, and the chips and salsa were perfect. The chips were light and crispy and the salsa had just the right amount of heat with a wonderful fresh tomato and smokey flavor. Yummy chips, salsa and $2 tacos and beer? Yep, my new favorite mexican restaurant. One last thing, the service was great! Ramon was friendly and made great recomendations, plus he kept asking about refils and freash beers. This place is well worth a look.
