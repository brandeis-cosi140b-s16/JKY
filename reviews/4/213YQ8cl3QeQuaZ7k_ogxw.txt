Qdoba, Chipotle, and Costa Vida, are all very similar and provide the "Subway experience" with Mexican food. What sets Qdoba apart is that they incorporated some outstanding sauces into their food which give you more options. Instead of having a chicken burrito, you can have a Ancho Chili BBQ Chicken Burrito, or a Spicy Quesso Chicken Burrito. There food is great and the menu gives you a lot more options than Chipotle does.
