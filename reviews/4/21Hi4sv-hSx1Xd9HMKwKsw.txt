We went  for the first time tonight and we really enjoyed our dinner.the  green chili Is some of the best we've ever had, margaritas  were awesome love the fact that you have over 100 tequila choices, Service was great, food delivered fast and hot, couldn't ask for better experience. The owner John is super nice, and I join the Tequila Club, What a cool idea to have your own engraved shot glass waiting for you. We will be back next week
