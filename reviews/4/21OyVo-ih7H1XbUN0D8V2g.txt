Since arriving in AZ, I've been to about 1/2 a dozen Mexican restaurants. This, by far, has been the best. It was "late" one Friday evening- 8:30pm (well, late for AZ I guess- nothing else in the area was open) and my wife really didn't want to go in. It does have that "kind-of a dive, but not quite a dive" look about it. (Also has a drive-through)

We tried the grilled chicken-burrito dinner and it was fantastic! The beans and rice were plentiful and delicious and the Salsa Bar was excellent.  The chicken was fresh and really grilled- not shredded. 

I would definitely recommend this place. This was the first "non-disappointed" Mexican dinner experience since arriving from Chicago. And they're opened "really late": to 11pm!
