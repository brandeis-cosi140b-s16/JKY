These tamales are DAMB GOOD. It seems that the operators of Old El Paso Tamales are fully aware of that... The Tamales are, again.. delicious, and perfect in consistency, flavor, texture, temperature, and freshness, BUT.. they're about 1/2 the size of a standard Tamale and a little bit more expensive.. The place doesn't have a menu board.. it's just.. tamales! (i guess they make other things but.. I'm not sure they want you to know that. :) The Chicken was my favorite, but also the pork and beef are FAB.
