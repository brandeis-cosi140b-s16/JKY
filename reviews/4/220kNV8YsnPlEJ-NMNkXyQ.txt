I've eaten here for years. I love their bean dip and green chili salsa that comes out with the free chips. I always get the chicken chimichanga with spinach white cheese sauce (see "Special Chimi" on menu). So delicious and the only Mexican food place I know with that kind of sauce. I recommend this place to anyone in the East Valley area.
