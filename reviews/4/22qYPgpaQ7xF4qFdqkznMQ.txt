Had lunch here with a friend a few weeks ago. I had never been. My friend suggested we have the wings philly style, i believe. I was impressed by them. We also shared the chicken ceaser wrap which I thoroughly enjoyed. The fries were a bit of a bust, flavorless. 

Overall, I liked the atmosphere and layout of the place. Lunch during the week was not busy and I prefer it that way!
