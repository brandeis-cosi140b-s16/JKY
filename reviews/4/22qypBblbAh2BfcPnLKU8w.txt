Last minute later dinner turned out to be a fabulous idea. It was just me my oldest daughter and my 2 month little girl. She ordered the rice with cheese and chicken I can't remember the exact name but she said it was delicious! I ordered the taco salad with shredded chicken and also the tortilla soup. I was starving when we got there and thought it was a little cup if soup- WRONG! This was a dinner plate size bowl of soup! And soooo yummy! The avocados in it were so fresh as was the pico. 
My salad was also good and I brought home my leftovers which to my surprise were just as delicious the next day.  Would definitely recommend going here for some great Mexican food!!
Prices I have to say could be a little cheaper for the dinner crowd ( I see they do have specials for lunch though) but for good food and huge portions I can justify spending a little more though I know Mexican food isn't expensive at all to make!
