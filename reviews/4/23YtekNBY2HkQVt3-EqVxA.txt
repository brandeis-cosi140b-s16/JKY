Big Fan of this 24hr spot in the Biltmore area. Not the hood ...lol (Jason's post). As far as Mexican spots in central phx/biltmore area...this is your spot. This tops my list of places I luv late night but try to stay away from...lol...to avoid packing on those extra pounds.

I Totally recommend the Carne Asada Burrito and the Green Avacado salsa...soo good. I wish they sold it bottled up.

The food is excellent and you always get too much .....
