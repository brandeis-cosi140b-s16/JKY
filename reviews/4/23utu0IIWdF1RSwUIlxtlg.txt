When there are many choices, consumers win. In NY this is true for pizza and in down town phoenix this is true for Mexican food. 

Azteca fills the void between a generic Arizona Mexican fast food place and a sit down restaurant. You order at a counter, but the food gets delivered to you. The food is on a plate with a garnish, but the plate is disposable. 

The menu has all of the items one would expect, tacos, burritos, flautas, tortas etc. The one unique part you might notice stems from the "& bakery" part of the name. On the wall there are shelves full of fresh Mexican baked goods, like cookies.

I opted for a Chilie Rellno burrito $4.25. Like all meals this includes a small carboard tray of corn chips while you wait. The only salsas are the traditional red and green sauce, they were good but nothing special. The burrito was quite good, inside a nicely warm and toasted tortilla was a fresh chillie rich cheese and smooth beans, all garnished with lettuce and cheese on the side.

There are a few tables inside and a few more on the patio I think I group of 6 or 7 is the max I would recommend for this casual dining spot, that is  good for a cheap lunch.
