I saw some older negative reviews here. They're not true now. Guys named Billy & Edward own and operate the place now. One of them always seem to be there... insuring quality service & food. Their Chips & Salsa ARE great. Their wings are huge & meaty. All employees were fantastic. A lot of TV's for sports too. Awesome / Casual hang out.
