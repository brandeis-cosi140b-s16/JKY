Went on a late Saturday morning.
Ordered a breakfast item - Chorizo Burro and a lunch/dinner item - Chili Relleno Plate. I wanted to see if it was worth the drive for future visits in one stop. 
The chorizo burrito was very good. It has more seasoning than the "-berto" style joints in a 5 mile radius. I like this fact. WIll go back for breakfast.
The Chili Rellenos were the same as the others. I would not go back for the rellenos...but the fact that the burro was so good I would try another menu item if I was in the area.
