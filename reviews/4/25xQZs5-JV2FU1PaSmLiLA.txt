Came for dinner with husband and kids. Service was great. I was a bit disappointed that their chips and salsa is chips with two bottles of sauce (red and green). Sauces were yummy, but I like having a bowl of sauce/salsa to dip. Mexican pizza was delicious as was their rice and beans. Husband ordered the enchiladas suizas and the chicken was a bit dry but still tasty. I ordered the carne asada and what came out was a bone-in steak. Meat was seasoned well but not what I was expecting as I had to cut away much of what was on my plate.
