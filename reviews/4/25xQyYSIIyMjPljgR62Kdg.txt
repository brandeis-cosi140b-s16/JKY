One of those "hole in the wall" places you will drive right by if you don't know whats inside. No, the food isn't to die for, but its very good, especially the tortas (flat bread sandwich), and these are HUGE sandwiches for the price. All the portions are large, and prices are extraordinary. They have football (NFL) games on during the season, and have a nice, again inexpensive, happy hour. So it was always nice to stop in for a couple margaritas and eat chips n' salsa while we watched the games. The salsa isn't great, but they provide a green and red in separate containers which is nice. And the tortillas are not the best either, I don't know why they don't purchase from the tortilla factory right down the road, those are awesome! Service is friendly, they always fill our glasses up without us noticing, but can sometimes be slow if its busy.
