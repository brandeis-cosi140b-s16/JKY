Visited this place in Surprise, AZ on a busy Valentine's Day evening, because we didn't want to do the "overpriced no reservations" deal.  Pleasantly surprised, even though we did not expect much since we are Northern NM natives, and our region wrote the book on tasty Mexican food.  The chile rellenos were good, refried beans were good, and so was the shrimp cocktail.  We would visit again.  The red chile sauce was quite bland, but I'm sure they can't source the Chimayo red that we are used to.  The restaurant is in an ugly strip mall, so don't let that put you off.  The price is right too.  Good place for Gringos, and we'll try it again for breakfast or lunch.
