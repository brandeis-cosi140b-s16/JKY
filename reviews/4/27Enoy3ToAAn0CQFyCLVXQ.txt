I've always seen this place from the road on my way to somewhere else and I finally decided to drop in and see how their breakfast was.  Maria's is quite unassuming from the outside, but entering you will find a menu that has a multitude of items and a friendly, clean environment.  I can only speak to the "sausage, egg, cheese, beans" breakfast burrito...outstanding!
