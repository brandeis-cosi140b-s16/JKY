This Fili B's location is really new and very clean.  We stopped in on Taco Tuesday, obviously a very popular night because most of the tables in the restaurant were full.  You can't beat a $.99 taco!  I love their bean burritos because the tortillas are nice and soft and the beans are runny and delicious.  I love the choices of salsa on the salsa bar.  On taco Tuesday, my hubby and I ate for only $10, so that's pretty awesome.
