Used my @BoldBajaFresh @Groupon for lunch today.

I've always been a fan a Baja Fresh, and ate there quite often in CA.

The distance to the closest one here in AZ is excessive for regular visits.

I don't really know that they are worth reviewing, per se, but I wanted to relate my experience today at this particular location.

The chips we were given seemed stale to both my g/f and I. The manager took my old chips, and grabbed a new bag to hand me.
Rather than proceed with that action, he also discarded them, and informed me he would make up a new batch, and deliver a double order to our table.

They came out hot and fresh, and delicious!

It was a nice display of customer service, an increasingly rare trait these days.

Thanks!
