I really loved this place and the whole atmosphere. From the food, to the women making tortillas, to the old relics inside. I ordered a breakfast dish. It was huevos rancheros. They were so good! I cleaned the plate. I enjoyed my meal. The waitress was nice and charismatic. The thing that makes this place come alive is the decor and the hand made tortillas. 
Whatever the hell they put in the salsas were good. Both were red sauce and spicy. One was made pure with chile de arbol, the other one was a mixture of I don't know what.

  The eggs had a real good sauce to them that tasted like it had some type of spaghetti sauce but in Mexican salsa form, if that makes sense. I absolutely loved that the eggs were on top of a tortilla. The little potatoes looking tater tots were good. For what its worth they are nice. The beans take like everywhere, nothing special there. 

   The only complaint are the people selling good to you. If you aren't a patient person it will piss you off. First you get the people selling cheese, then the people (supposedly deaf) selling little packs of goods. They leave it by your table and then come back for them. You don't say anything if you dont want to buy it. Just leave it alone. Then at the end you get a Filipino guy selling god knows what. It's like let me eat in peace. I wish the owners would realize they are disturbing their customers. 

  I do think that the uniforms need an update and maybe some type later on the decor can use a face lift. The parking sucks somewhat, but tolerable. The prices are good for what you get. Weird thing was that the place had American football on tv lol.
