There were only 2 other occupied tables when I walked in for dinner on a weeknight. It was pretty quiet but there was some Bob Marley & the Wailers music playing the whole time. 

This was my first time here and I ordered the avocado fries, which were good, but they didn't blow me away. I also noticed that a lot of the items on the menu say they are spicy but I got the shrimp fajitas, which were marked spicy, and there wasn't a kick to it at all. But that is in no way a complaint. They were actually very very good and came in such a large portion. I was extremely satisfied!

There is no parking lot for this location, so we parked on the street, which I believe is free after 6 in that area (but don't quote me on that!)
