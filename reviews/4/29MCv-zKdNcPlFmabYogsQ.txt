I went the first week that they opened. They were busy and we were able to get a seat without a reservation. The bartender and server were both extremely friendly and helpful with the menu choices. They have over 150 tequilas to choose from! I had the sangria and let me tell you, it is not from a pre made mix they have sitting around. The bartender made a glass for me right in front of my very eyes! I had the carne asada and it was delicious, however very small for $20. I would suggest increasing the amount of food or lowering the cost for the current portion size.  I would definitely go back in hopes that they lower the prices a bit for the portion sizes they currently have.
