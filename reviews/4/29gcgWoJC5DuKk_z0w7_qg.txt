Went here one night after an evening of debauchery. My friend and were curious of this place. The way we rate Mexican food places, is based on their Carne Asada fries. Man, I was not disappointed. The meat was chopped into small thin bits(which was good), was very lean, and flavorful. But if they want to make it better. A little less guacamole, it overpowered the whole dish. Employees were very nice too. I defiantly recommend this place.
