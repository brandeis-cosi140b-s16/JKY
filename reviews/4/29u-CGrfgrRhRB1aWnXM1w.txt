This is one of our most favorite place for my husband and I to meet for a lunch date!! It's a convenient location for both of us.  But that isn't the only reason we like this place.  The street Tacos are awesome - particularly the Al Pastor.  The chips and salsa have always been refillable (so even if the portion size is small as another post said before, you can always get more!!). We particularly like their hot salsa - such great flavor!! 

What really sold us on this place... the customer service!! Always above average - consistently asked if we need anything, how out experience had been and everyone in there has a GREAT attitude!!  We often brig our 18 month old son and never feel bad for the mess he throws on the floor.  Every time we have started to clean up after him they stop is and finish the job, with a smile on their face!! 

We will continue to tell all our friends and family about this place!!
