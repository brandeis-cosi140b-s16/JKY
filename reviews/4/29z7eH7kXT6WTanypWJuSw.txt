This place is "Bandolero!" approved!

There are basically 3 things that you can do when you get delayed or have a long layover at CLT:  meander hours away on a white rocking chair pretending you are whittling a flute for your great-grand kids, be snooty at the wine bar, or get sloshed at the Jose Cuervo Tequileria.  I have always done the latter, to either get the party started or cure a wicked hangover.  

I'm a bit disappointed in the ratings this place was given.  

Is it over-priced?  Well yea, but you're in an airport.
It's not "authentic Mexican."  Well yea, but you're in an airport.
It's not "authentic Mexican, part b."  You're in an airport... in North Carolina.
Super slow service.  Well yea, but I'd rather be drunk here than at the DMV.
Food was bland.  Well yea, but it's called salt, babe. 
The waitress couldn't hear me.  Well yea, but she listens to jets take off all day.

All in all, I've had some great memories here.  The staff has always been super friendly, and when I get stranded here at off-times (yea, I've had a flight delayed at 2pm on a Tuesday), the staff will have a full on conversation with you if you're the only one in there, about tattoos, booze preferences, and what not to order from the menu.  The way I see it, you're gonna be stuck here, might as well make the most of it.  

Plus, who doesn't want to stare at Raquel Welch for a few hours?
