There are so many Mexican restaurants with bertos at the end of their names. And almost all of them suck. It sounds harsh, but really, it's true. However, Filiberto's stands tall as the best of all of these. As a Mexican restaurant, it is great, but as far as atmosphere goes, you're not gonna get much as far as this location goes. Luckily this is the only location I've seen that has a drive-thru, which is because the building was a Burger King about 7 or 8 years ago, then turned into an Eddie Chan's (I think that's the name) and now a Filiberto's. The Filiberto's was around for at least 5 years and is still going strong, which only attests to how good it really is.
