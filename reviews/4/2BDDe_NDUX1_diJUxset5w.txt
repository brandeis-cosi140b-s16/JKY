The best part of the Bally's casino - $1 margaritas, $1 tacos, $2 tequila shots and $2 draft beers. The margaritas are okay, super sour and barely drinkable, but for $1 you really can't complain. The tacos are decent, a slight notch above taco bell. We ate here for a quick bite before The Price Is Right Live show and there was a Cuervo promotion going on so we got free T-shirts and free shots. It's a good deal. Took our drinks with us to the theater so we didn't have to pay their higher prices. Have never seen such huge platters of Nachos in my life!
