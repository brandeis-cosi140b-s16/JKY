Best salsa ever. It's blended beautifully with a nice prominent cilantro flavor. Seriously couldn't get enough. They need to jar it and sell it.

I had the carne asada fry bread. Price is great and it was very tasty. The carne asada itself had a good flavor and the fry bread was delicious. It's a good size and piled on with beans, meat, lettuce and tomatoes and also came with side of sour cream and avocado. I couldn't eat the whole thing and took 2/3 of it home where my husband promptly ate the leftovers and he liked it very much as well. 

It's a tiny little hole in the wall and a stand alone building. I can see parking being a big problem if there's more than 5 people there. It's truly a family restaurant that's been handed down from one generation to the next. Very friendly and great service as well.
