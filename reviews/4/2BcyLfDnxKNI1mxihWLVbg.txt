Grabbed lunch there today - not near my normal stomping ground but it looked like a decent place so I took a chance.  Inside, clean and bright and a mix of biz people at lunch, local workers, some families.  Server was prompt, nice and spoke English fluently.  They brought out chips & salsa and the salsa was fantastic... fresh, home-made and had a nice kick.

I chose a $6.95 combo plate - taco, bean tostada and enchilada.  5 minutes after ordering it was served up.  What immediately stood out was everything was simple and light.  The taco wasn't greasy - just some tasty meat, lettuce and white cheese.  The tostada was similar - just a simple base with some really nice refried beans (def not from a can) and crispy lettuce/tomato and white cheese.  The enchilada was good as well.  I prefer  New Mexico style enchiladas, with a really hot sauce, so i rarely order them outside of NM because they are usually bland.  This had a red sauce that wasn't hot, but was definitely homemade and flavorful. 

Overall it was pretty straightforward, simple, yet flavorful fare and seemed a lot less heavy/greasy than typical places.  And I'm often fine with greasy, though the beltline would disagree.  I'd defintely frequent the place if it was near, though it's not so special to merit an out-of-the-way trip.  It's a place where they care about making good grub and that shows.  If you're near or going to be in the area, it's worth exploring.
