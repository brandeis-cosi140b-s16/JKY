I actually love this little place. It's clean and the staffs are friendly! 

First time I came here I got the Torta Cubana and the Torta Mexicana. Both tortas were good, but I definitely loved the Cubana much more. The torta (I think this is the bread part) is tasty and soft. I could probably just eat the bread itself, but the mix of meat and the juices...that's a whole new taste bud there...so good!

They have a few salsas and grilled veggies free for grabs. They also have ice cream or gelato; not sure which one. I haven't tried any of the desserts, but they look tempting. 

Came back and got the Tacos de Ribeye which is so good!!! They give you lots of meat and I love how it comes with a slice of avocado on each taco! 

I didn't even know they had pastry on the other side of the restaurant until the second time I came...LoL! I came here 3 times within the first week that I discovered this place. I'm actually not much of a sandwich person, but the Cubana satisfies me completely. =o)
