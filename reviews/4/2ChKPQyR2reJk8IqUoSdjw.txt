So excited I made it back to an old staple. So, I was craving a fajita, but they don't offer the lunch size portion on Sundays so I chose a lunch combo, which didn't disappoint. I chose a beef taco & chicken burrito w/ rice and beans. The taco was great, meat seasoned perfectly, hot, yet the shell held up great. The burrito was filled with all white shredded chicken, topped w/ a red sauce & cheese...a lot of cheese, yum! The chips were great, but I have to say I miss the old salsa. The new one seems to be a little more roasted, hot than what I remember. I cannot wait to get back...definitely a fajita next time :-).
