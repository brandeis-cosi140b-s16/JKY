Love this chain! I've only eaten at this particular location a couple of times but frequent their College/Horizon location at least once a week.  

Their food is always great and prices are very reasonable.  They have the best deep fried chicken tacos and they're carne asada fries are awesome.  The only thing I wish was better is the guacamole but it's not a deal breaker.  Try the taquitos with carne asada on top next time...it's not on the menu but they'll do it if you ask.
