I concur with other yelpers, this mexican joint often open twenty four hours is such a great Las Vegas institution. Although I do attempt to make my stops in frequent it isn't because it isn't amazing!!!!! Thr rolled tacos with cheese and guac on the side is my favorite thing and the red super hot sauce will burn your mouth, but really taste good!
