A great mix between an authentic Mexican taco restaurant and a high quality barbecue spot. We got in around 4 and the smell of delicious chicken greeted us. The lady serving us and taking our order was pleasant, bilingual, and able to help us pick something to try for our first time here. The salad was crisp cool and fresh with plenty of pollo. The burrito exploded with flavor and was enjoyable all the way through.
If you aren't in a chicken mood I see that they also offer carne asada. But I haven't yet tried it. It does get a bit more busy by 5:30 on the weekday so try to get there a little early.
