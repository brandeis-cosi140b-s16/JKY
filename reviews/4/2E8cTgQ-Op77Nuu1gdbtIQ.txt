These are my favorite tacos in Phx thus far and for $.99 each who can beat it?! The food and the price is more than right, the hours? Well that's very odd. Closed Sun-Weds. Then open until 6pm? They must make their money catering, but I'll make it work to get there when they are open because it's worth it!
