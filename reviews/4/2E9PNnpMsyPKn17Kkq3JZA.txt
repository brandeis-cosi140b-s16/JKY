Been here several times recently and the food has always been excellent. The way I found this place? I bought some engine oil at the autozone next door around lunch time on a sunday. Walking out into the parking lot feeling hungry I thought I would seek out a mexican restaurant neraby, I looked up and there it was in front of me. Fonda Las Cazuelas. Feeling up for an adventure, I opened the door and walked into a wall of  loud mariachi music. The food was delicious. They have lunch specials 7 days a week, and I had the chicken with chipotle sauce. The molcajete seafood dishes are excellent and they will split the order for a smaller party. I brought my family for dinner and we had the seafood molcajete and the shrimp were AMAZING. The fried fish was also delicious and not over cooked. So often fish becomes dried out when it is fried, but not here. It was still moist. The service staff is friendly. If you want to hear mariachi music come on a Sunday between 1-2pm.
