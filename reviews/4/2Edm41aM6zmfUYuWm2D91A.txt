I've eaten here several times usually the service and food is great, not this time. We walked in and stood there there and no one greeted us for at least 5 minutes. There was a line forming behind us with people waiting to be seated. We saw the hostess standing across the restaurant chatting with a server.  
Once we were finally seated, our waiter came and took the previous guests bill without even acknowledging us. When he came back to greet us he seemed less than thrilled to be there and simply said "what's up?" Service with subpar, he left dishes building up on our table. Other servers had to get our drinks, take dishes away, and bring your food. 
Food was good and usual.... Service not so much!

Update- I went back a week later- Service was excellent- Chelsea waited on us- great server with a great personality! Food was awesome as always!
