Just ate here for the first time in the Phoenix airport... I was looking for a burrito on the way to Minneapolis, and this fit the bill perfectly. I had their signature blue burrito, and everything tasted nice and fresh, including the tortilla. The only problem is that the person who filled my bag didn't put a napkin in... didn't realize it til I was sitting at my gate. Oh well.
