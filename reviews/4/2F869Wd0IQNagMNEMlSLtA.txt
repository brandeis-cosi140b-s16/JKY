This is a hole in the wall type of restaurant. Very small. I think it's pretty authentic when it comes to mexican food. It is family owned so when you come in the faces are usually the same and they very warm & welcoming. 

I usually get the Green Chili Stew which is by far my favorite from the menu. It's pretty spicy, has an extreme kick to it. If your palette can't handle spiciness, I wouldn't recommend this stew. The portions are pretty good size. I've ordered chicken nachos here before and boy were they good and I wouldn't have been able to finish it by myself.

The Sopapillas are delish as well. I usually just get it regular without any add ones. They bring out honey to put on it. Oh my gosh, it is so warm fluffy. yum!

They have $3 margaritas everyday so that's a plus. Prices are reasonable. Overall, great place!
