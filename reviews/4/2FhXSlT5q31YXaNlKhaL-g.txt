If you're not Hispanic or look Hispanic you might turn some heads going into this place. Speaking or at least understanding Spanish would also be a plus as the menu is mostly in Spanish with a little English to help out the Anglos a bit. 

They have a juke box with Mexican music that was playing very loud , so loud that I was tempted to leave when I first walked in but I'm glad I stayed. 

Very authentic Mexican food and the portions are huge. Service was fast and friendly even after the waitress found out I don't speak Spanish?
