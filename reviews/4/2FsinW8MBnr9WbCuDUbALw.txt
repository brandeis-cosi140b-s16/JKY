After 4 visits I decided to add my 3cents worth of review. Having spent a considerable time in Mexico I was very surprised to find a Mexican restaurant that reminded me of the fantastic food I have had through out mexico. They actually have sopapillas (sp) on the menu!!! This place is worth a visit. It is a bit small but prices are reasonable and the food has always been excellent. A couple of things... they don't offer coffee... too authentic??? The other is that the service has never been as good as the food. This recent visit was no different with our having to wait for a desert while the other was served...not good. Reason given...cook was very busy... that doesn't cut it. It is a management problem more than a cook problem. That's why the 4 stars... I still recommend them over all the  multiple Mexican restaurants I have visited in north Phoenix.  When you go look forward to stellar food - not stellar service. Hopefully they will work on the management issues... I still look forward to visiting again.
