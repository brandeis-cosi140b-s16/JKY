I've lived in San Diego and had " most likely," the best burritos in the word. Not to mention making many trips south of the border, the burrito I had was above average.
  The only down side was towards the end it was a little cold.
  I suppose being in an area with so much Mexican food could effect the rating, if this place were in South Florida or Hawaii, I'd have to give it five stars. Believe me there aren't any great Mexican restaurants there.
