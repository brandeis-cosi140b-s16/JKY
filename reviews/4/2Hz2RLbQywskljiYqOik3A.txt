I love Mexican food, and Pepe's has some great AUTHENTIC Mexican.  It's not the best in terms of ambience or parking or location but I come here for the food.  I usually get the carne asada torta and it's usually enough to hold me over until the next meal.  I like to mix the Pina and Jaimaca for my own little concoction, which I would recommend.  And they have taco specials on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  So if you get the chance to try this place out, taste the food first and you'll probably be coming back.
