Three cheers for a good restaurant right next door to the movies! Yea!

We've been countless times, both for lunch and dinner and always enjoy a delicious meal. If you get there at the right time, there's live music as well.

On to the food! The Tostones are so good...smashed fried plaintains topped with either ground beef, shredded beef or shrimp. We always get the shrimp and they're always tender, crisp perfection. My favorite appetizer is the Papas Rellenas. I could eat these every day. They're a humble, comforting dish...mashed potatoes rolled into a ball with a surprise of seasoned ground beef hidden in the middle. They are then fried to a delicate brown on the outside and served with a crispy plaintain chip. This and a salad is lunch perfection for me! Also nice on the appetizer menu is a mini cuban sandwich when you just can't handle the big one. My kids always order it as the kids menu only has ham and cheese. The black bean soup is everything you want a black bean soup to be. The only salad I order is the Ensalada Havana...sliced green apples, oranges, cashews and chicken over greens with shaved manchego and a sweet vinaigrette...so good!
Let's see to the entrees... The traditional Cuban sandwich is exactly that. Traditional and perfect. The bread is crisp on the outside, soft on the inside with the right balance of pork, ham, cheese and pickle. Vaca Frita is seasoned, shredded, seared crispy, tender beef served with rice and black beans. Ropa Vieja, shredded beef in a savory tomato-y sauce. Too many good things here...the Bistecs are delicious as well. We've never made it to dessert...hopefully someday we'll taste their flan!
