No Complaints.  Carne Asada was nicely seasoned, tortilla wrap was nice and warm with just the right amount of char on it.  I'm guessing they heated it up on the grill or some kind of press.  Fish tacos were tasty and massive.  Two very nice portions perfectly fried.  Salsa was good and not watered down.  Will be local stopping point when heading the the mall area around here.
