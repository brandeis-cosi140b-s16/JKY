After joining a few friends for tacos this weekend, I'd have to say I'm a fan of Tex Tubb's. I had only been here once before on a whim several years ago for the brunch menu. That time, I felt a little rushed, and just ordered the first thing I saw that sounded okay off the menu board behind the counter. That's what I got. Okay. 


The layout has since changed, and I appreciated the time I was given to look over the extensive choices. I was told that the tilapia tacos were great, so I ordered the blackened variety and wasn't disappointed. I also had a fried catfish and carne asada taco as well. The catfish was very good(but not as good as the tilapia), but the carne left something to be desired. They just didn't have the great flavor that it's fishy companions did...I didn't mind all that much, because I felt about to burst halfway into that third and final taco. I'm not sure what kind of stomach the previous Yelper has, but my Fish tacos were quite filling, and not at all tiny! 

Each taco was around $3, not too bad in my opinion(and next time I'll only order two). 

The salsa bar is also a plus(although "bar" is giving it too much credit, it's a sink w/four salsas). The verde was tangy and fresh! 

We live closer to the University Ave location, so that's an excuse to try THAT one next!
