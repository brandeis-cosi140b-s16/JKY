This place serves Mexican with a Spanish bent. I've been here for dinner dozens of times over the years, and finally realized I ought to review it. 

We stopped in last night after a 49ers Men's soccer match (beat Elon, 1-0). My son wanted to go to Dish, but Plaza Midwood is 20 minutes away at best, and it was 9:00 PM. "Whaddaya want, Trev?" "Nachos!" 

Well, he wasn't disappointed, even if he didn't get to pick the 'rant. They started us off with their usual never-see-the-bottom trays of chips and salsa. You really do have to be careful with these, because you can ruin your appetite for dinner by filling up on warm, crunchy tortilla chips and hot, complexly flavored salsas!

Restraint was worth it.

I had a wonderful Pollo Asado Burrito (very healthy chicken and veggies with a tomatillo sauce over it all). My wife had the La Union Chimichanga, which she loved. Portion sizes were HUGE, so we ate lunch off of our dinners the next day. 

The boys got what they wanted. My "all American twin" got his usual chicken fingers and fries, and his brother got a taco, rice, and beans.

They have decent draft beer, and various daily drink specials, so if you're thirsty for relaxation, get something from the bar.

This is probably my second or third favorite Mexican restaurant in town. We go here, because it is close to us. I love Cantina 1511 on East Blvd, and Las Margarita on Independence near Sharon Amity, too.

That said, this place is flavorful, consistent, and the service is great. They also have some interesting and colorful decor. Occasionally, they'll add live entertainment, too.
