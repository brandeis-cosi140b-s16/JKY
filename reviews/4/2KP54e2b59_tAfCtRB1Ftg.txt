Beautiful new place. We were seated promptly and water drinks chips and amazing  freshly made salsa brought right away. We ordered and had our food within 10 minutes. Wait staff was friendly and professional. Food was hot and delicious. Prices were very reasonable .  A great spot for a good appetite after hiking.
