I've personally invested in Chipotle stock and this location is decent at best. Awesome staff but judging the other reviews, they're right for the most part. Meat is typically old-looking and tasting and/or running out quite often. Parking is "as-expected" due to it being in a small complex. It can be either slow or packed but lately during lunch it's seemed packed. Nonetheless, when I crave Chipotle due to my work location I come here opposed to up the block.
