This place is roughly 4mi from my house so it's not convenient, and it is right across the street from 24hr subway so I don't go here often enough when I'm over here for late night food, but I love their cheap tacos and their 99cent churros. Never had a problem as far as customer service goes, the staff is friendly unlike most McDonald's and Jack in the boxes. Would recommend somebody to go here for cheap mexican food, I actually prefer their cheap tacos to Taco Bell's 89cent tacos
