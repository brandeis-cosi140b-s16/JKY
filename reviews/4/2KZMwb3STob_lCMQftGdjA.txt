Dude. Baja Fresh is GOOD. I had a shrimp diablo burrito. Now while the burrito tasted nowhere near as diablish as i would have hoped it would, it was still good. I thought it would be spicy. Not so much. But the shrimp were large, they tasted grilled, and the burrito was stuffed to the gills with them. 
I noticed that at the salsa bar they now have a monthly rotation of a new flavor? Is this new or have I not been to a Baja Fresh in quite a while? Anyway, they had this awesome pineapple-onion-cilantro mixture. Sounds weird - tastes FREAKING AWESOME. I could lap up a gallon of that stuff on its own. 
Another plus - customer service at this particular location is off-the-hook awesome. I left a personal belonging in the store and they held it for me to pick up the next day. Sounds typical, right? The personal belonging was cash. So yeah, they're awesome at this store.
