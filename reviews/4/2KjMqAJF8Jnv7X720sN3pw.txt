After trying their Salsa, Guacamole and Ceviche at the Yelp Event, I couldn't get it out of my mind, it was so good, so I went to have lunch here today! 

Let me tell you How Amazing our food was!!! 

To start I ordered the custom Guacamole, they give you a list of ingredients and you check which ones you would like, I chose everything except onions and word to the wise, do yourself a favor and make sure you get the pomegranates (see pics) 
WOW OH WOW, that was the Best Guacamole I've ever had, seriously!!! 

For my entree I decided to order the Acapulco Shrimp Ceviche (see pics) 
It was Delicious just like it was at the event. 

I also ordered the Chicken Taquitos (see pics) OMGosh! These were absolutely the highlight of the meal, definitely not what I was expecting and I mean that in the best way possible! 
Freshly stuffed with shredded chicken and bacon and then rolled and fried to a golden crisp, yet they were so delicate and flavorful. 
I would go here again and again just to order these babies! 

My hubby ordered their cheese enchiladas with two fried eggs on top, which they were more than willing to accommodate him with even though it was not on the menu. (Sorry No pics), but he LOVED every bite, only problem was he wished they had been served with a bit more of their tasty charro beans. 

And despite getting the generous discount card from the event last night (get $15 off $40) We didn't even hit $40 dollars ordering all that! I think their prices are very fair, especially for the quality and amount of food. 

My only complaint was, the place was still Bombay Spice-ish, decor and music wise. -1 star 


Please go get some decorations to liven up the place and give it some character along with playing some more fitting music, I'm not talking mariachi or anything but some Island beats would have been better suited than Loungey dance music. 

**The Food was a definite 5 stars for me though**
