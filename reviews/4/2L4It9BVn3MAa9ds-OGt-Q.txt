The food was very flavorful. I ordered the steak burrito chipotle. My wife ordered the lunch special #5. We both agreed that if they were located in the Matthews area this would be our "go to" Mexican restaurant. The only downside was service was a little slow even though they did not appear busy, but overall we enjoyed the experience.
