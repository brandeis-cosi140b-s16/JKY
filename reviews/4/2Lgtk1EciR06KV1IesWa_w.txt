These guys ventured to the Gun Store parking lot so I made the trek over in order to sample some of their offerings. One thing that I like about these guys is that they were active in responding to twitter questions I had asked the night before, a show of initiative that I always appreciate. 

Walking up they have a small stand-alone sign that has their menu written on it. it's a small menu of only a few items; 2 burgers, their signature Sloppijo, 2 kinds of tacos and maybe one or two other things. They also offer Bluesky beverages, scones and muffins which is a nice touch considering their hours are all over the place.

There was a girl standing by the window who fielded the orders and handled the cash transactions so that the guys doing the cooking could focus. She was pleasant to interact with and happily described what was in the items. While I was waiting, she helped a guy customize his order so that he could avoid burning his palate. The prices are reasonable and the food was hot and flavorful.

 I brought their Sloppi Jo and the red burger home for my boyfriend and I to share. The Sloppi Jo was just that; sloppy! but very good :) it made the paper container start to go soft due to all the porky juices leaking from the red-chile drenched pork and egg. It was served with sauteed onions and a warm tortilla; the kind of food that would be delicious after a late night of sinful activities. The red burger was cooked to a nice medium rare and also had the sauteed onions with melted gooey cheese, an aioli sauce and bacon. 

Overall, it was satisfying, tasty food reasonably priced. If I'm ever in their neighborhood or they in mine, I'll be sure to stop by again!
