You want Salsa, you want Micheladas, you want Margaritas, you want to watch great dancers and so much more it is here.  I am not a dancer nor do I know how to Salsa but I found out on Thursday nights before the real festivities begin they do have free Salsa lessons!  Yay!! I nor my boyfriend however are big dancers, so now auditioning for a willing dancing partner... 8/  The nice thing is I did not feel like I had to dance, us and our friends sat there happily watching the dancers and the instructors float around the floor increasingly better as the evening went on munching on our food.

On to the food this is a pretty hard core mexican joint but the waitress we had, spoke fluent english and seemed really happy we were there and to tell us about the food they offered and even more excited when we asked about the Micheladas she was a bit surprised at that.  The Micheladas were perfectly made to the beer of your choosing with the seasoning on the side of the glass.  The Margaritas were strong and flavorful.  The food was huge in comparison to the price, the price a bit high but trust me you get your food worth.  I kind of hoped for a bit more spice but I think now that I know that, I would let them know I want it spicy, they might assume because of my ethnicity I may not have been able to handle it.  Little do they know...

The waitress really made the night that much better she was just so happy to help us, cheerful, helpful, happy and attentive.  She made my night, Thank you.  I did not feel out of place and had a great time I recommend to anyone to come down earlier in the evening if you are not familiar with the place looking just for food and do not speak spanish.  It does get louder and way more of a party atmosphere/nightclub in the later night hours.  So, for great food and Salsa lessons early for a party later but I cannot comment on that part of the night.

I will be back for some fun and food...
