I love this place. The BEST MARGARITAS! It does take a while to make them.... But it's because they're made from scratch. They make their own simple syrup, squeeze the limes themselves and all. Amazing. I like mine frozen. Not to mention they're huge. You can go for the top shelf ones if you want but the house one are just as good. The fajitas are awesome, the salsas are great as well. I've tried tons of things from their menu and never been dissatisfied. Love this place.
