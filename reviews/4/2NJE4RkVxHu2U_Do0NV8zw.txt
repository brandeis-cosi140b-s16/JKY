Chipotle has great food and I eat here all the time... There always seems to be someone who is new and training though that can't fold a burrito... I love the place and this one is clean but I docked a star because the last 3 times I was here someone new is on the line poorly folding the burrito... Sometimes others come and help the newbie... Great place great food
