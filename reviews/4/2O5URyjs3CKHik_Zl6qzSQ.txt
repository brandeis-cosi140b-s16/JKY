Just found Los Fav even though I've been living in Tempe for a few years. OMG! Gem of a taco shop. This place can get busy but they are fast! We usually call our order in and it takes about 10-15 minutes on average. Very authentic Mexican food. You can look in back and see everything being prepared from scratch. The service is always great and you can't beat the prices! I haven't had anything I don't like yet. Both their red and green hot sauce is fantastic! Spicy but not too spicy and they both have great flavor, not a flat chile flavor like some places. They have the best Vegetarian burrito! Simple but oh-so-good! Rice, beans, pico, guac, lettuce all wrapped in a giant tortilla...you can add cheese too! They have fresh tortilla chips for dirt cheap, very good with the hot sauce. 75 cents for a small bag and $1 for a large...yes... that cheap! Good enchiladas, quesadillas, etc...You can get a huge dinner for two for less than $10 and I mean, a lot of food! This is the perfect little taco shop. The kind you can roll out of bed to, in your pjs, after any kind of night and know you're taste buds will be taken care of. Definitely recommend.
