Stopped by on Sunday around 3pm for a late lunch...place was packed!  Nice to see...had Sopes e Carnitas, Shrimp Cocktail and a Torta Milanesa....

Sopes and Shrimp Cocktail were great!  The Torta, not so much..bread was old, the fried steak was too thin and tasted old...it was edible...so Tortas are not their strong point.
