Our family ate dinner at Los Taquitos tonight after watching the great review it got on Food Network's program, "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives."

The review by Guy Fierri was right on point. We had quite a variety from the menu starting with the Shrimp burrito that my youngest pronounced "Oh, yummy!" to the delicious red menudo thick with honeycomb tripas and a side of red onions, lime slices, and cilantro. My older daughter stated "I'm just a menudo kind of girl," as she slurped down every last bit from the huge bowl she ordered. There was even  a  hot fresh tortilla to nibble on the side as well as home made pickled hot carrot slivers, jalapenos, and fresh cut lime quarters.

I ordered the Chimichanga dinner made with the succulant pork ala Pastor. The chimi was huge, very crunchy to the last bite, and loaded with fork tender chunks of pork and spices. Hubby had the three enchilada  dinner made with beef. The rice and beans were fairly typical Mexican restraunt fare, but the red and green sauces (which I believe were home made) and the special care that our server gave us more than made up for the so-so sides. And anyway, who cares about sides when the meats were all done with such care and tasted so wonderful? The only thing lacking at Los Taquitos is about 10 more tables as they are going to be so busy!!!!
