The meal I had here was very good (I had that Barra Vieja shrimp), though not spectacular.  The mashed potatoes were probably the best part.  What struck me was the vibe of the place.  Granted, it was 8:30 on a Monday night and the place was more or less empty.  But there  was a snarky, fedora sporting bartender playing cards with the wait staff and a drunk patron, employees drinking at the bar after hours, a random dog running around, a primered chevy pickup and a neat row of bicycles in the parking lot.  The vague disinterest in customer service might have been due to the fact that the place was empty, and there's almost certainly a contingent that would find this off-putting, but it worked for me.  In contrast to several other reviews, my food came out very quickly and my glass was never empty for long.  This is probably a place I would frequent if I lived in the area.
