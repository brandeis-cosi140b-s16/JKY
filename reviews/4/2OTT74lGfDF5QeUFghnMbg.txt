Went on Sunday 03/23/14 at 2:30 PM and it was 72 degrees.  Sat outside on the side patio in the back.  Had tons of mimosas and the chilaquiles.  The chilaquiles come w/chicken.  It was good.  Love the mexican brownie and did not love the mango tres leche.  I normally love mango but would have preferred plain tres leche cake.
