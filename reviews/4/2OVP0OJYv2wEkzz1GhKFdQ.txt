Love this place and the Matthews location. 

The Queso is phenomenal. When they bring out warm nacho chips definitely get the queso to accompany. 

The service is excellent every time. The waitstaff is great and the food gets out almost immediately. Clean facilities as well. 

Pollo Con Crema and Pollo Fundido are both excellent dishes. I recommend the latter however as con crema can be a bit heavy. 

Very reasonable prices for the amount of food. Definitely recommend.
