La Flor De Michoacan was a great Yelp find.  I found myself in at the high school across the street attending a soccer game.  This place popped up on my Yelp app and I dropped by after the game.  Glad I did.

This is a Mexican restaurant that offers up a typical fast food style menu plus some additional things I'm not familiar with.  You're bound to find something to your taste on the menu.  They also sell hand dipped ice cream and other snack items.  

I ordered the No. 1 combo, beef taco and enchilada (my go-to Mexican meal).  My food arrived promptly on a plate instead of the typical Styrofoam carton.  The presentation was nice: two tortilla chips were sticking out of the beans and the lettuce and tomato were on the side as opposed to on top.  They also placed a piece of wax paper under the taco so the the sauce wouldn't soak in.  Brilliant move!  La Flor De Michoacan is the only place I've been to that does this.  Anywhere else I have to gobble the taco so it does not get soggy.  I topped the taco off with the house salsa.  Good eats!

The dining area was clean and tidy and a step above what most will expect from a local Mexican joint.  It's fitting to dine in with others or family.

I eagerly look forward to the next Phoenix Monsoon game as I know I have found the place I will eat at after the games.
