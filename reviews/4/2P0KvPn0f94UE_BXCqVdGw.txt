This little "hole in the wall" - "where the heck is it" Mexican joint is amazing.  It is CASH ONLY so beware before coming in.  The food here is incredible and a very different set of flavors than most Mexican you'll find in the Phoenix Valley.  I've sampled much of their menu and the main standout feature is the sauce.  They have incredible sauces! From the salsa's in the bins to the salsa that comes with the chips or the sauce they put over the quesadillas it's all amazing.  They have perhaps the best torta I've had.

This is a very different and unique experience compared to the majority of Mexican available in the city.  It's homemade menu, not the standard "[fill in the blank]-berto's" menu you see at most places.
