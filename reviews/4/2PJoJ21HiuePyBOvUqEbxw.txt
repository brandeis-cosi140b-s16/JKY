Definitely one of the best Mexican places I've been to in Charlotte. I have a lot of food allergies (peanuts, nuts, and shellfish) and this place took it very seriously. The manager came over to make sure everything I ordered was something I could eat. Plus I don't often get to eat chips at Mexican places because they fry the chips in the same thing as the shellfish, but this place had a separate fryer for the chips. I was in heaven and literally could not stop eating the chips. I will definitely be visiting here a lot more once I officially move back to Charlotte. 

I also got the queso with the chips and it was really good; however, I feel like there wasn't as much queso as I would get at other places. 

Overall this was a great experience and the perfect lunch spot!
