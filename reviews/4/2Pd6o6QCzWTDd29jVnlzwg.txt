Wife wanted to go to Macayo for their baja burrito, so we went.
    I had the poblano chile stuffed with chicken , cheese and covered in baja sauce.  It is deep fried in a crispy breading and it was very good. Almost like a chile relleno , but crispier and IMO better
      . My wife's favorite is chile relleno and by the way she was eying my food , I know she was kicking herself for not taking my suggestion again and ordering this dish, but I gave her a taste anyway , just to tease her. Lol 
     We also had the green tamale bites as an appetizer ,  it came with Baja sauce.           The tamale bites are sweet masa balls that are deep fried and are addicting.. Service was fine.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the food ,We will be back
