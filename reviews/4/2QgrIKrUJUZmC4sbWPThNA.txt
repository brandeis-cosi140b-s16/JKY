Ended up here during a 3 hour layover and decided to give them a try. Wow! What a good decision for me! The guacamole was incredible and the quesadilla with chicken was equally yummy! Price was a bit steep for the food but average for airport fare. I will definitely eat here again if I have another layover in this terminal.
