I took my family of 5 (three kids) to Serranos in down town Chandler on a Monday night. The food was very good, the service was outstanding. The kids meals were large enough to fill up my 10 year old son who can eat an obscene amount of food. Also they make a Guacamole Ranch that is AWSOME. With your chips and salsa you can get bean dip and three kinds of salsa before your meal. The prices were very good. Most dishes were under $11.  I will be coming back on the regular.
