Z'Tejas is a great restaurant with reliable food and service. I've come here for work lunches as well as dinner with friends, and haven't had a bad experience. There are a lot of choices for vegetarians, which is great. I really like the mushroom enchiladas, mac & cheese, and chopped salad. Their complimentary cornbread is awesome too!
