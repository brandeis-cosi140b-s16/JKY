I have pretty much been to all of the Lindo Michoacan locations in Las Vegas and this one tops all of them based on location/view!  It's amazing! The view is a beautiful skyline of the Las Vegas Strip.  

As for service, our busser Angel was a bit more active than our waiter in terms of ordering.  The Dessert Inn location seriously has it down when it comes to overall service.

As for the food, the salsa, beans, and chips are something you must watch out for if you plan to eat your main course!  The salsa combined with the beans has just the right amount of heat that you lose yourself in them, and the busser just keeps them coming.  The tomatoe based fideo soup served before the main course is also good.  It reminds me of my moms.  I normally stick with Camarones Abuelito Timo, I was happy to see that the flavor is consistent between the other restaurants.  bacon wrapped, cheese covered shrimp, with a delicious mayo/Tabasco aioli....can't go wrong with bacon!

Overall the location, food, and environment is great!
