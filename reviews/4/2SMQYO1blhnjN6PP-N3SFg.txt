Would I go back here if/when I return to Scottsdale? Heck yeah!!!!!  When we were there last November there were 5 adults and one child in our family group wandering around the area looking for something to eat.  The one place we tried to get into you couldn't get in without a crowbar so we wandered past this, took a look at the menu and said why not!

So glad we did!  Good sangria, interesting patio area (felt more like an alley but cool), great chips and salsa, and good food at a good price.  No one, not even the kid complained about their food.  And this was the first time in my life I had fajitas with zucchini in them! YUM!  Plus, most veggies that come with fajitas are usually limp beyond limp and on the bland side.  Theirs had some spice to them.  

With drinks and food our whole bill for all of us was around 100$.  Not bad for a place in Old Scottsdale.
