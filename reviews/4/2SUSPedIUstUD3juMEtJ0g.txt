One side of me longs for the Chuy's in Camarillo, CA, which is quaint, casual, easy, and low cost. This Chuy's had to overcome many great memories.

The word is Chuy's are owned by one group west of Texas, another from Texas east.

With a purpose, we met during the 4-7pm Weekday Happy Hour, which has a complimentary queso bar. You can have regular queso or you can add ground beef. Both ways are tasty. 

The chicken tacos are quality. The green chile rice is flavorful.

The burrito is gigantic and a great amount of food for the price.

For Southpark, the food prices are reasonable in general.

Great patio - partially covered in one area, open in the others. Keep in mind that the sun goes behind the Residence building in the early-to-mid afternoon.

The "Perfect Margarita" is far from it. It's a glass heavy-handed with Rose's Lime Juice plus tequila. It has a very specific lime taste to it, not reminiscent of a top shelf margarita. I suggest their house Marg or simply telling them to make it how you like.
