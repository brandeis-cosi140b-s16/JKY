This place is a little fat Mexican girl's dream come true! They have yummy ribeye tacos, nachos, fresas con cream, paletas, pan dulce, thirst quenching agua frescas, even their darn soups are the bomb! Whether I'm stressed, bored, or need a treat...this place and its huge selection always deliver.
Only con, place gets packed so you have to run to get an open table and clean it too; since staff is uber busy. :-/

Dress: come as you are!
