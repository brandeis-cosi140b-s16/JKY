I have been meaning to try this place for ages, so after driving by so many nights, last night we decided to stop. The husband and I shared a burger and a chocolate shake. The burger was legit... very large, juicy, and flavorful like a burger should be (not a fancy type burger.... a casual type burger). It comes with two patties (why no one patty option?), cheese, lettuce, tomato, 'secret sauce' served on a buttery bun. It was definitely good for a drive through burger. I think it would be made much better if I got my own burger and added jalape√±os and grilled onions (which the husband doesn't like), but I'll find out next time. The shake was also decent (I don't love shakes)... it tasted like straight up chocolate ice cream, which isn't a bad thing. The service was fast and personable. If I were craving a drive through burger again, forget In and Out, I'd stop here.
