The first time I ate here was so so, but Grant was very receptive to my feedback and said he'd do some changes and the second time trying this out I was much more pleased with product. They've addressed most of my complaints from chow down and improved on them in pretty creative ways.

I feel like they're slowly working out the kinks since they're fairly new so I'm sure with time it'll get even better. The slow service from chow down is a bit speedier this time which is probably because they're not being mobbed by tons of hungry people. They've replaced the sushi with hibachi due to some conflict with the city regulations. The underseasoning and undersauced situation with the tacos has been amended, apparently they add in the sauce to the filling as they are being cooked now, and it shows the ingredients still taste super fresh while being infused with whichever type of sauce you decide on for your hibachi or taco entree. Even their hibachi is quite a bit healthier than the normal fare! They make their shrimp sauce with a less butter and no mayo instead opting for a lighter yogurt based sauce which tastes pretty delicious.

I feel it's worth mentioning that all of their food is organic and freshly made to order so the prices are really quite reasonable. Only thing I'm left wanting for is gimme them desserts and side items! I want sweet potato fries and those fruit and chocolate fried wontons I tried at chow down. Otherwise Keep it up Maki Taco!
