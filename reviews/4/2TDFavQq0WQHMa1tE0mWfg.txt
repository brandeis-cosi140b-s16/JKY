Had a great lunch here recently.  After the awful Cabo Wabo margs, we had to try again here.  Really good drinks - and at a reasonable price.  We went with their fresh lime juice version - nummy stuff.  Good balance of tart and sweet, and tequila flavor.  Had the grilled jalapeno appetizer - different, but liked it.  The worchestershire was a strange but tasty addition.  We both had tacos - carnitas was my favorite, followed by the beef cheek my husband ordered, then the steak.  Nothing bad in the selections.  And if you're craving your yearly portion of bone marrow tacos, yes, they have it.
