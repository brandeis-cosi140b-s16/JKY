Good chips and salsa.  I usually order a burrito and taco combo.  I love the shredded meat in both.  I hate when you get chewy pieces at some resteraunts but they never seem to have this problem.  Rice and beans are also good.  For a "fast food" place they have really good food.  Good prices too, I always have leftovers for lunch the next day which is just an added bonus.  I think I might hit their drive-thru on the way home tonight...yum!
