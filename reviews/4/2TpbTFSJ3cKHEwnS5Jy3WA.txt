Adios, El Sombrero.

After 66 years, this longtime downtown eatery is closing its doors, so we decided to stop in for one final meal. We got there a little before 1 on Tuesday, and the waiter told us we would be the last customers of the day because they ran out of food! Good news for us, but bad news for the dozen or so customers who came in after us. One of those groups instead asked for a carry-out order of chips and salsa, and the waiter scrambled to comply; these were obviously longtime customers, and they said they'd be back later in the week for a complete meal.

Most times I've eaten here, I've had the taco and chile relleno combo plate, so I decided to stick with tradition. The relleno was as good as I remembered it, and the taco was even better. My husband had a beef taco and a chicken burrito; both were equally good.

Service was good with quick refills, which was appreciated because it would be easy to slack off when you have only days left on the job. It seemed like everyone in the restaurant was a longtime customer, and while there was an air of sadness due to the imminent closure, it was clear everyone was enjoying their "last meal."

El Sombrero wasn't my favorite downtown Mexican restaurant -- that would be Casa Don Juan -- but it will be missed. Sorry to see another Vegas tradition bite the dust!
