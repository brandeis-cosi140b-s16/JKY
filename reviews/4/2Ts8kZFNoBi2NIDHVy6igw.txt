My husband and I tried this place for lunch the other day and were really impressed. The portions were humongous, and the prices were very reasonable given the portion size (and quality!). You know, sort of like Applebee's current "right portion, right price" promotion, except that at Vaqueros, the portions make you feel like you're getting a lot of real value for your money. The decor is no-frills, but the woman working at the register was super-friendly, and the free salsa bar with pickled carrots and chips was a great way to start our lunch. 

I had the carnitas (~$7.50) and my husband had the burro/enchilada combo plate ($6.50). The carnitas weren't as savory as the ones I've had elsewhere (Los Dos Molinos is a good example), but they were seasoned well and came with some of the best rice and beans I've ever had. My husband's seasoned beef (in the burro) was also not intensely fllavorful but was still decent. His enchilada was a real standout; the sauce had just the right amount of chile flavor and spice and the cheese was perfectly gooey - not soggy, not congealed. We wished we had forgone things with meat and just ordered 6 cheese enchiladas as our meal! Overall, though, we were definitely impressed with the food and would definitely return. 

Just as an FYI - they do take credit cards but charge a transaction fee ($.50) so you might want to just bring cash. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention - they have a drive-thru!
