My new go to spot for a quick yummy lunch!

I found this place through a friend and fellow yelper who told me about their lunch specials.  I arrived to be greeted at the door and immediately sat down, there was about 5 other people in the restaurant so there was no waiting at all.  

As many others have mentioned, they brought me the chips with beans and salsa. I went ahead with the enchilada lunch special which was wonderful.  All of the lunch specials are $10 and under, and for what you get, you really can't beat that! 

My service was quick, the staff was friendly, the food was delicious.  I didn't go 5 stars because I didn't get that, "OMG wow the best thing in the world", but it was still very good
