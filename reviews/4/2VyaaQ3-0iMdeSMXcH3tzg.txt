An Open Letter to Filiberto's:

I don't know what caused your franchising department to approve this location in Ahwatukee, but I'm really glad you did. Everyone loves deliciously decadent and insanely cheap Mexican food. You're not the best food out there--far from. But you don't pretend to be anything you're not. You unapologetically peddle your wares to us enlightened folks that eschew the crappy breakfast food served at virtually any other fast food place.

Oh, and thank you for giving me hot sauce no matter how I answer the question, "Do you want hot sauce?" Because even though I always say no, I always want it by time I get home. And you give it to me. I love you.

Sincerely,
Andy G.
