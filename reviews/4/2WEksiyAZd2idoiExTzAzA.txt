My only tip to them would be to use real guac, not that creamy taco bell crap like they gave me on today. If they would have - 5 stars cause my machaca chimi was dang good.  I enjoyed the machaca more then then anywhere else in the area.  I would suggest hitting this place up if you are in the mood for Mexican Food, and NOT Serranos .... My wife said her plate was 3 stars, but would come back and try more.  based on mine alone .... I will be back!
