The restaurant was nice and quiet. The food portions were generous even for a lunch. The food was served quickly and was correct. I had the red chile burrito served enchilada style with rice and beans. Chips and salsa at the start of meal is a must and they had them. The only issue I had was I had a glass of iced tea with no refill or offer of refull. Other than that a good place to eat. I will be going back. If you are headed north on 7th Street it is just past the bus depot on the right.
