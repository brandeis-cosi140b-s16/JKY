This place isn't bad at all as far as Taco Bells go. If you can stomach the food or actually kind of like it, you're good 9 times out of 10 here. There are times when the tomatoes aren't fresh enough or some minor thing seems suspect, but generally nothing tragic. Combine several hundred calories from here with a Rockstar or Red Bull and you're ready to start the f**kin' day! Yeah! And then spend the afternoon in bed! Seriously, this food isn't good for you.

But for fast food, it can be very tasty on the cheap. Sometimes they're busy, but not that slow considering I'm always stuck behind the mom ordering enough food for a football team and all I want is a burrito. Anyway, overall solid Taco Bell. Just beware the weird parking lot. It's an accident waiting to happen sometimes.
