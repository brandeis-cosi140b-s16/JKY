Old spot, I mean REALLY old, still having that look like time stood still here since the '70s.  The decor (including the lifesized cardboard John Wayne) is super rustic.

The food is truly home-cookin'.  There's nothing fancy about it really at all but it will fill you up nice.  You kind of get the feeling like someone's mom cooked it up just for you right there.

It's decent--with a surprisingly large selection of food from burgers to Mexican to fish to breakfast available anytime.  Nice service.

If you're driving down the road, and you're looking this spot up to see if it's any good, you can rest assured from me that it's fine for you or your family.  

Nothing's wrong with a good, cheap bite--if you are of the same mind, you'd like this place too.
