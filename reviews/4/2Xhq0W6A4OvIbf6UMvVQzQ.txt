Other reviewers have pointed this out, but I must be emphatic - Los Sombreros does not do ANY of the standard Mexican dishes done in the other Phoenix Mexican restaurants.  To reiterate - Someone used to our Mexican food will not find one entree on Los Sombreros' menu that they have had before.

It is with this new found reality that my family found itself desperate to find the waitress before she filled our drink orders so we could leave.  I really do have some of the most closed minded eaters around me.  No cheese crisp!  No fried logs covered in enchilada sauce!  We all looked and looked through the menu and even though I'm pretty familiar will most of the dishes, even I couldn't find something that I thought they could do.  

Our waitress appeared with our drinks (yikes!) so I explained our ignorance and asked her for recommendations.  She was so understanding, and immediately asked each person what they usually like and directed them to something on the menu that filled the bill.  Every person at the table loved what they got, and they even sent over some chips and salsa to help us feel more at home.

I had the chicken with mole, and it was seriously the best mole I've ever had, even in Mexico.  It was light, whereas mole can sometimes get very rich.  The tacos the others had were excellent.

By the way, the wine list is by far the best I've seen at a Mexican restaurant.  I had a really good glass of Pinot Noir.
