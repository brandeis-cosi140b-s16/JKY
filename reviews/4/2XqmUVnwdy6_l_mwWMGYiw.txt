We used to eat at Qdoba in our old town before moving south since it was convenient to pick up to go either on the way to or from our kids' ball games.  The food was always fresh and it was a reasonable price.  We miss it so when we travel and want something fast, we'll hit up Qdoba.  We stopped at this location on our way through town today.

The menu had changed since our last trip to Qdoba.  A little bit more expensive but there weren't a hundred add ons so it wasn't a bad thing.  The food was as it always is but the employees need to keep their drama to themselves.  No one wants to listen to girls whine about other employees while they assemble my burrito or mutter under their breath when they're re-stocking the forks.  Come on girls, your job isn't that hard and this just isn't the place for your teenaged nonsense.
