OH!  I could get fat from their chips and salsa!

I love going to Veracruz for lunch!  I work in Oakland and have a number of "mexican" restaurants at my disposal (including big chain Chipotle and Qdoba) but will 9 times out of 10 go for the 'Cruz!  It's so much more authentic.  I feel like the chef's only speak Spanish (at least that's how the cashier communicates with them) and there is always some Spanish soap opera or talk show on adding to it's authenticity.  Never usually packed- it's quick and filling.

Totally worth a try!
