My dad and sister were in town for Thanksgiving, and this was the only non-chain restaurant open for dinner. But my dad has always wanted to try it, so we did. 

The service was very slow, but I'm blaming that on the holiday, not the staff. The duck carnitas empanada was a perfect appetizer while we waited for our steak tacos and our chorizo porchetta. The tacos were great according to my sister, and my chorizo porchetta was very tender with a light skirt crust....I just didn't like the flavor of the chorizo too much. We skipped dessert because we were having it elsewhere. 

Pretty decent pricing for what you get, and the manager came out to greet us when we got our appetizer (maybe just for the holiday?). I was kind of annoyed though, because I requested sweet corn puree with my porchetta, and the waiter, though he checked back several times and audibly noticed it wasn't there, never brought it. 

But I would certainly go back for an occasion or just a nice, inspired meal.
