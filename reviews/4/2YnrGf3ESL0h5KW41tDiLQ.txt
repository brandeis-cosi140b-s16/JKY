So we were headed downtown to the Beef Jerky store, and we stopped in at Macayo's for dinner ... is 3:30 pm considered dinner?
Mr. Abbott ordered the carnitas plate(it comes with pico, guac and sour cream, rice and beans and tortillas) because apparently it is Macayo's anniversary and they have specials running through the month of August.
Happy 50th Maycayo's :)
I ordered the Baja Chimichanga which came with rice OR beans I chose rice and the chef gave me both by mistake *BONUS*  I wonder if I could add stars based on that fact :).
OH and we ordered a TCT for an appetizer  (toasted cheese tortilla)
Let us begin with the chips and salsa ... 
Warm chips and two sauces  one chunky one smooth. 
I prefer the smooth, which is good because Mr. Abbott prefers the chunky (I can't even say the word chunky) kidding. 
We barely ate half the chips and the bus-girl came and had another pile of warm chips. 
My water with lemon? My glass never made it past a quarter empty . They also brought a little bowl of lemons. *nice*
Then the TCT came and it was this amazing flour tortilla with wondefully  melt-y cheese ... so delicious when dipped into the smooth sauce . 
Then the baja chimi.... A chimichanga with chicken and ranchero sauce on top with a cream cheese-y sour cream sauce) what tasty goodness that was such a big portion that i only ate half and didn't eat any of my rice or BONUS beans.  (Don't worry they made it into a take home package)
Mr. Abbott's carnitas were over filling too and apparently quite good because he didn't even try to steal any of mine.
Wow three bonuses already I should probably change it to five stars, 
but I wasn't crazy about our waitress she had the personality of Sean Connery's shoe. 
Will I be back ... ohhhhh yeah!
