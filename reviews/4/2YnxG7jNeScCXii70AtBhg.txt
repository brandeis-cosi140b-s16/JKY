I was pleasantly surprised when I visited Don Jose's, the food was actually pretty good!  My order was the carne asada plate, that and a bottle of Diet Coke was just over nine bucks, a little pricy I thought, but I grabbed some of their salsas and sat down.  My order arrived quickly and the portions were big, I left STUFFED and I couldn't even finish everything.  The beans were a little looser than I would have preferred but tasty nonetheless.  The carne asada was well seasoned, chopped up into chunks with no mystery gristly fat pieces.  Came with a good scoop of guacamole, rice, beans, and a steamin' bundle of tortillas.  My only gripe is that they don't give you chips to go with the salsas-you have to buy a bag.
I enjoyed everything and would certainly return when I'm in the land of the blue hairs :)
