This place always delivers. The Tecate Micheladas are so good....I think they put some kind of tamarind chile in them too.  I haven't ordered a thing on the menu that I wasn't delicious.  I must admit I don't love when they play the banda musica really loud, but it's part of the style if the restaurant. Definitely go!
