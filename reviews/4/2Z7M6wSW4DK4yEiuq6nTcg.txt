I ate here once and can't stop thinking about how refreshing the Horchata is. It's so rich and cool on contact. Tacos were decent, a little tough to chew. But seriously though, the Horchata is bomb. Thanks for the horchata. Ok, you get it, how many times did I mention the horchata in this review. 

...That's the point.
