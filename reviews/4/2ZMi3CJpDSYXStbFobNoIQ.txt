The atmosphere of this restaurant is great; there are smaller, more intimate dining rooms inside, and a gorgeous patio with a fountain. I had an original and a peach margarita--both were good, although they could have been stronger. Before the meal came, the server brought homemade spinach tortillas and cheese butter. Amazing! The tortillas were soft and delicious and the cheese butter went very well with the spinach tortillas. For my entree, I had the Red Enchiladas, and all I can say is, HOLY CILANTRO, Batman! Unfortunately, the main flavor I tasted was cilantro, and I can't stand cilantro. A person who isn't as adverse to this flavor may have no issue, but I did. The corn tortillas that were used for the enchiladas were fantastic--I just wish I had a better idea of what the red sauce tastes like, but the overpowering cilantro prevented that...
