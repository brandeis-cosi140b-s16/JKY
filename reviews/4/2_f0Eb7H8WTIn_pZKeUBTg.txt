Came here on a fluke and boy was it one on the best one's yet.

Hands down the best menudo in town. No hominy (the way i prefer it). It is soooo well seasoned and not at all overly greasy. It doesn't stink or taste dirty, if you eat menudo you know what I mean. It's $5 for a large portion of this stuff. A great deal if you ask me. 

Fish tacos - okay. not to die for. not the best.

Carne asado - decent. good. 



But i come here for the Menudo. Plain and simple.
