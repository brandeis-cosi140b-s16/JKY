I've been here twice and both times the food was phenomenal.  The only reason that I'm not giving it a big whoppin 5 stars is because of the wait staff.  

The first time that we went we had a waiter that almost seemed like he was afraid of us.  When we spoke to him he took a step backwards.... very odd.  And the second time.... was interesting to say the very very least.  Our waiter supposedly was experiencing some "marital problems" and was totally blitzed.  He couldn't get our order right, his eyes were glazed over and (here's the kicker) he ran his fingers through my husband's hair!  We alerted the manager out of concern for the waiter- was he drunk?  Did he mix meds?  Is he having a meltdown?  He was sent home and we received two impressive complimentary desserts.  

The food makes up for that crazy experience though.... and I doubt that waiter works there anymore.  After all that the manager kept checking in on us and the food is so amazing that it hardly matters.  The food is beautiful and so delish..... as are the desserts which are prepared tableside.  Will definitely be back- we'll just hope for a sober waiter.
