This is the Northern branch of TEG de Tijuana, B.C.  I caught the Strip bus up from my convention at The Sands for lunch, and was glad I came!  TEG is just past the edge of  'Turisto Vegas' and firmly planted in the 'Residents' Vega's (all the surrounding store-fronts seem to Hispanic, or Korean, or Lebanese- oriented.)
 If you love tacos, then this place is for you.  A little confusing at first, there were snaking lines of Mexicans and Haole all queued up inside the door, for different ordering stations, where incredibly speedy preparers hammer out the variety meats for the tacos and tostadas. After you pick up your order, you take your tray, pay the cashier lady at the front door, and then take your tray outside to a canvas & mylar tent, and grab a seat on a picnic-style bench.  I skipped the more authentic organ-based lines (tripas, cabezas, sesas, etc.) and  just went for an assortment of tacos in my comfort zone: carne asada; lengua; chorizo; adobada.   All were hot, a little greasy, and served on these great little thick, 4" diameter Masa tortillas, with lime wedges, and nice crunchy radishes.  Delicioso!   I'd probably give the place  5 ***** -- if they could only serve a nice, cold beer ( I settled for an icy can of Coke, which was a good choice for the chiles!)  Skip the flan, which is the standard Industrial article, a thick gluey disc that is squirted into those little plastic cups. 
 After eating, it is a short walk back South to the Wynn Hotel complex, where you can enjoy wandering around the waterfall park complex, and watching all the rich folks do their thang before heading back to the heart of the Strip.
