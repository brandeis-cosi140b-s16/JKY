Love this cute little local place! You have to know about it to go, but damn is it good! Huge portions, cheap, and good chips and salsa, I'm in!!

My dad discovered this gem a few years ago, and I love it when we go. Love the hole-in-the-wall vibe and the staff is really friendly. 

Green chile burro=YUM.
