I have always enjoyed Ajo Al's but don't live close to one so often choose to go other places.  On Sunday, I went for a late lunch craving the Pizza Nortena.  Unfortunately, because I am gluten free, the pizza isn't for me.  But, I mentioned it to our server and she came back to tell me that they could make it gluten free for me.  I had never even thought to ask but here she took the initiative to find out for me.  I haven't had that pizza in almost five years but I can tell you that it is still delicious even when modified with corn tortillas as the base.  The service was excellent.  Overall, this experience was my best one at any of the Ajo Al's locations.  

On a side note, they have the best spicy cream cheese and their salsa is yummy.  If you enjoy Mexican, you will love Ajo Al's.
