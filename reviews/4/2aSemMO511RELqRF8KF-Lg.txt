My family and I going to Qdoba. The staff is friendly and most importantly, my daughter loves the rice, chicken, cheese and peppers in her burrito bowl.

The food is always fresh and like the ability to pick and choose what fixings and toppings you can place on your taco or burrito.

I know this may scorn some, buy I'll take Qdoba over Chipotle anyday!

The place is always clean and usually served quickly.

The chips with guac is a tasty addition to any meal.

We try and hit Qdoba once every few weeks and never disappoints!.
