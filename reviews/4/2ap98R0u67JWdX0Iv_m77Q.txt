Not too shabby for airport food. Very tasty carnitas burrito, excellent black beans, standard rice. Few chips and pico de gallo instead of the usual salsa. $9 for a beer? (what part of AIRPORT did you fail to comprehend?) I agree with the comments about speed of service, but that might get fixed if you tell your server when your boarding time is.
