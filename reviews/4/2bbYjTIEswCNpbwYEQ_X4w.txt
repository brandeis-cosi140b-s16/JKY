This is my initial review based on lonely one visit.  

I first passed this local on Saturday, hoping to get a breakfast burrito.  Seeing boarded up windows I assumed they were now closed.  As I found out on Sunday, I had mistaken the boarded windows for the wrong business.  Ramiro Mexican Restaurant is definitely not closed.  This is good news for me as I love Mexican food and I love it even more when it is only 400 meters from my home.

I dropped in on Sunday and had a classic Mexican breakfast Burrito (eggs, potatoes, chorizo and cheese).  it was very good, hot, fresh and was served by a very friendly cashier.  it was so big, I would consider asking them to cut back on the potatoes next time.  

A big plus for me was that there was a salsa bar.  It had two red sauces, a green chile sauce, limes, cucumbers and pickled carrots, garlic, onions and jalapenos.  This was a nice touch to spice up the burrito.  The green Chile salsa was good, the smoky red one (chipotle?) was so so.  The pickled veggies were very good.

The site is clean with plenty of parking and a drive through. I will be back to see if they are more than a one hit wonder.

Update 4/20 - had a wonderful green Chile carnitas burrito - fantastic, earning an upgraded review. Also, much better horchata than my first visit. I am a very happy neighbor!!!
