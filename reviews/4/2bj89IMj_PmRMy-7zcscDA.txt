What a pleasant little gem not to be missed the food and service is just like being at your families place. The food is simple and complex all at the same time. Clearly homemade salsas very fresh addictive and the red one will put hair on your chest or burn it off you choose! The dishes are few simple classics but done well. Irma is a very sweet woman who really cares if you like what you are eating. Don't pass it up.
