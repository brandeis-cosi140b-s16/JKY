I had gotten a Groupon because we were going to be in the area but didn't know anything about Casa Ramos.   It was a good choice.  The food was excellent, the portions are so big they are on a plate that almost doesn't fit on the table.  Our waiter, Juan, was very knowledge at suggesting items on the menu, drinks, etc.  He came back to the table often sometimes just to visit with us.  He made us feel very welcome.  We will definitely go back.
