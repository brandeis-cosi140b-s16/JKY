A real popular place among the UNLV students. I've been here many times but I'll focus on my visit last night.

Hostess staff was not very friendly at all. There were two standing up there doing something with the cash register and completely ignored me and my party. Waited two minutes until a 3rd hostess appeared out of nowhere and promptly seated us. The other two girls never even made eye contact.

Like most Mexican restaurants you get complementary chips and salsa. They provide two types of salsa - a mix between mild and medium that is going to be way too hot for the strictly mild crowd, and a weak hot variety. 

Our server was very nice and attentive throughout the meal. The food here is always delicious, and made well - but it's nothing to rave about. It's your typical Mexican fare with plenty of options. The decor is warm and inviting. It appears that you're eating outside in a Mexican cafe, with adobes and faux porch lined balconies.

If you want good, authentic Mexican food ( and even some American choices such as chicken fingers,) you can't go wrong here.
