What a cute hidden gem!  We were looking for some quick, traditional mexican food in Scottsdale.  We started looking at reviews and decided.... let's take a chance!  

First off, you'll have to look for it - its in a shopping center/strip mall so we passed by it once.  Keep your eyes open!  Now let's talk about experience.

Let's start with the atmosphere.  As you walk in, there's the counter to order and on the left... about 9 small tables.  It's definitely set up more as a fast food style service.  I wouldn't go here to spend an entire evening sipping on margaritas - Cantina Laredo would do for that - but this place has become a staple due to the experience and food.  I'd say... think a local version of Rubios.

We've also had great service -  always nice, smiling, and making sure we're happy.  That alone makes getting quick food nice and more relaxed - although lunch can get crowded.

The food: pretty darn good - quite a surprise.  We've tried the carne asada burrito, quesadillas, fajitas.  I love their guacamole which is a great addition to a burrito.  It's also nice not to have it filled with rice, beans, instead of protein - they are quite the opposite and generous on the filling.

Cons:  Their salsa is pretty runny and not quite exciting.  Nothing to write home about.

Overall, fun little place.  Great for a quick bite and I will keep coming back
