Fry bread convert!

I've been looking for some heat outside of Asian food. The stuffed sopapillas and Navajo taco definitely satisfied this craving. It wasn't as spicy as I had imagined but it was enough heat that you didn't have burning sensations when the food came out the other hole. As for meat, I think their pork verde is cooked perfectly. On the other hand, their chicken is not so great. I believe it was all dark meat and it didn't go well with the sopapilla because it made the dish heavier than it already was. If they had a white meat option, I'd definitely go for that! Lastly, we tried their chicken tamale and forgot to get it "sauced." It came with a salsa and green sauce but it wasn't enough to help this plain tasting tamale. On the upside, the chicken was white meat. 

I'm definitely a fan of Carlito's and will be coming back for more!
