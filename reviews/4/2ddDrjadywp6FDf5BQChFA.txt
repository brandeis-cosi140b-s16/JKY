Brought a group of 16 people to dinner.  For having a big group they did a good job attending to us. Set us up outside real nice set up with lights and nice weather that evening.  
Food was very good, if you like spicy food, this is a good place for it.  Platinum margaritas were delicious, wish the would sell by the pitcher, cause their prices for drinks were a little high.  Margaritas should not be more than $10 dollars for top shelf, unless your seeing 12 oz or more. 
Nice place for a night out and location gives you options to walk and see art gallery and hit many of the other bars in the area.
