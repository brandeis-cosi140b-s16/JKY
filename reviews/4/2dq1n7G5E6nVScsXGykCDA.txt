My experience today out did any previous experience. Usually when I come in here, the managers (usually 3 of them) are intense and so focused on the employees that the personality of the store is missed. Today was quite different. Service was friendly, the employees seemed relaxed, no managers hovering, chicken was hot, flavorful and fresh.  The restaurant was clean, salsa bar was stocked, and everything was running smoothly. (I hope the managers noticed this)
