My husband was eating here, I swear, at least 1x a week with this soccer buddies.. he'd always come home and tell me about the awesome ceviche, tacos de marlin, and tacos de governador, and mojarra frita he had there.

So we all went with the in-laws in tow to have lunch there one Sat afternoon.  I had the tacos de marlin and everyone else ordered the vast list of things my hubby recommended.  Let's just say no one at our table was complaining nor disappointed - everyone polished off the food and the ones who couldn't, well, it's only because the mojarra was so huge.  Since I only tried the tacos de marlin and liked them, those are the only ones I can personally say were yummy.

The prices were very reasonable and the food was plentiful and very, very flavorful.  We did, however, get seated in their back section.. squeezed up against another large family which was a bit annoying since there were 2 huge tables in the main area that said 'reserved' on them (but we noted no one actually ever sat there).

I'd go back again if I got the craving for it... 

btw, it's located in a strip-mall and sorta hard to find if you don't know where to look...
