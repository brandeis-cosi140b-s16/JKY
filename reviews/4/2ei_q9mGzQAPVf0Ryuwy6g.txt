Went here last Friday night and was very impressed. The last time I had been out to this restaurant was about a year ago and it really didn't seem too great to me, hence the reason it took me a year to come back. Im not sure if they are under new management, have a new chef, or are just improving. 

Friday night was of course a busy night so we had to wait about 15 min for a table for 2, not too bad. Our server greeted us right away and we had our drinks and appetizer ordered with in minutes! I love fast service! We ordered the Firecracker Stuffed Jalape単os. I wasn't sure how different they would taste from original Jalape単o poppers, but I am so glad I ordered them! They were delicious! A mix of cheese, cream cheese and chicken stuffed in a jalape単o, then deep fried! Add the cheese dip they give you with the order and your mouth is in Jalape単o heaven! I decided on an appetizer as my main dish also, for I wanted a variety of food dishes, I ordered the Sampler Platter and SO glad I did. It comes with chicken flautas, chicken quesadillas and steak nachos. It's the sampler so it's a pretty large portion, you get a few of each item, the flautas are my favorite. The chicken had a great taste to it, mixed with the different seasoning, cheese and peppers. My bf ordered the chicken chimi, obviously you can tell we like our chicken. I tried a few bites of his dish and it was also pretty tasty. I like my chimis to be very crispy, so was a little disappointed that the tortilla on this chimi was semi crispy, when they aren't crispy they get a little soggy. It was stuffed with chicken, seasoning and peppers, not a bad combination with the rice and beans.

The staff was very friendly, courteous and quick! We had a great evening!
