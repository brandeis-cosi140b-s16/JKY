Finally went to Maize for the first time today after reading a bunch of reviews online. Maize does live up to its hype. For such a small space, the owner did a great job making this place feel warm and inviting. Seating is cramped and very limited, but I guess Maize is one of those hole-in-a-wall neighborhood restaurants that everyone loves. Food was very fresh and authentic, and everything tasted good. The portion was small, so you're going to have to order a couple of things, but price is reasonable for the quality of food. Service was also very friendly too.

Pros: authentic, fresh mexican food. very friendly service. 
Cons: limited parking and seating.
