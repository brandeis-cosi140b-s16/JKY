I'm on the edge of 3 and 4 stars here. We have been here twice now and neither time has been bad. The staff is very nice and the flavor is solid. A few key things for me here; the first time we came the beans were good but the second time they were bland, not a big deal, but I like consistency.  The chips are ok, add lime and they get a lot better! The burrito was packed with tomatos and guac and a little bit of chicken, the chicken was really good! So we will be back again definitely even if it's only to figure out exactly how we feel about it. And I want to try the fish tacos!
