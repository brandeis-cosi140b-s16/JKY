There must be new management because the place is MUCH cleaner then it's been in the past. I avoided it for those reasons for several months but have been back recently and was happy with the food. I agree with the reviewer who said he prefers to eat at home. I almost never eat there. Never occurred to me that I could bring it into Tally Ho!
