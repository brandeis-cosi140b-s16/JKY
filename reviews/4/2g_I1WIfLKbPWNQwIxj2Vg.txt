Lindo has some really great upsides...awesome and efficient service, great margaritas and a large/option filled menu. 

The downside...every time I leave I feel fat as hell! I don't think I have EVER had a meal there and not napped afterwards! lol 

The chips and salsa and good, the Don Fransico is amazing and the live music was really enjoyable! (Top 40 remakes)
