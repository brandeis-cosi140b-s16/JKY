Cave Creek is such a cute little town and everytime I go to AZ I stop by the town it is so old west!!! We were wandering through and were hungry and saw a sign for Indian Fry Bread!! YUMMY!! So basically you go in through the souvenier shop and walk through a little alley/kitchen and there is a small dining room 5 tables or so nothing fancy.. I was very much like Mexican food with the beans ect, the bread was really good and the owner was so so friendly love it!!!!!
