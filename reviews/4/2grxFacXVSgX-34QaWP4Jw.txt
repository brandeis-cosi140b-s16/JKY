This place is cute.  Cute!  Tables and chairs are festively colorful and it really brings out the cheer.  You won't need to order appetizers because you'll get yummy chips and salsas (red and green) and a small tortilla with ceviche.

Can't remember what fish platter we had because the menu is plentiful long, but it was a white fish served with veggies mixed in with rice.  Very delicate and pleasing.  

And how, the molcajete!  Requested the waiter if we could have it served without red meat or poultry, so he brought one with seafood only.  Sizzling hot, tasty, filling.  Took home leftovers and ordered a whole fried fish to go as well.
