Not just a salad. The Mexican chop salad was muy bueno! I added chicken and requested dressing on the side. There was no need for dressing at all. The salad is full of corn, black beans, guacamole, pico de gallo and other delicious goodness. I was a member of the clean plate club. I also recommend the hibiscus green iced tea. Is was awesome! I'll be going back to Blancos. Need to try the tacos and margaritas.
