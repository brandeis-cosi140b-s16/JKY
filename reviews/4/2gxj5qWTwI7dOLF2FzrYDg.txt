I've been coming here for awhile. Whether at a table or at the bar, service is fantastic! Start with chips and salsa, ask for the saut√©ed veggies (jalapenos and onions) tastes great with the salsa and chips. I love the pork enchiladas. Service is very fast, so if you're looking to linger, take your time ordering.
