This girl I really like works in Florence. Since I like her so much I came out to see her for lunch on my day off. Twice in one week. We already tried the amazing Greek place so we wanted something different. So Mexican it was. Someone in her office got something from here and it looked good so we decided to give it a shot.
When we pulled up to the restaurant it looked a little scary on the outside. It was pretty nice on the inside though. The hostess was very friendly. We both decided that we wanted the Pollo Fundido. Our waitress said that was a good choice.
It was pretty good. Maybe a little too much sour cream but still good. Chicken was cooked very well and everything worked together nicely.
This is definitely a mom and pop restaurant in a small town. Everybody knew everyone that came in and some of the customer's orders were already known also.
This was another good find in this small town. I will definitely come back here if that girl ever wants to have lunch with me again.
