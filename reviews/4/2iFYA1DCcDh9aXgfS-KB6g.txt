To Marty F:  this place started as a Don Pablo's, a now defunct Tex-Mex chain.  this interior hasn't changed a bit since being taken over by Al's.
We go here frequently, mainly because of the extensive menu and the large variety of street tacos.  I can actually eat here and not blow my diet with all the grilled chicken options.
Their bean dip is exceptional and their drinks are good.  We have never had a bad meal here and go about 2-3 times a month.
Things they can improve upon:  Please don't sit my husband and myself next to a party with a crying toddler.  We don't like sitting by the kitchen because there sometimes are flies (yeah, big eew on those days).  And they could stand to touch-up the paint around the booths and do some deep cleaning.  
This is a good, solid reliable place to eat that's a local chain.
