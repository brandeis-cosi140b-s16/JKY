cabo's is a mexican restaurant with a nightclub feel. big screens everywhere. lots of help & lots of partiers. there is a bar right when you enter and booths all along the main wall. the atmosphere is very comfy & busy. the service is impeccable-fast,friendly and very helpful. the food is great. chips & dips for free and all the entrees are good. we usually do fajitas,chimichangas,enchiladas and taco salad.
very suprising for a casino. nice & spicy. fresh & hot!
(at palace station)
don't go. what a mistake thinking the same place in the palace station would have the same quality of food.
the menu is the same-the decor is old-mexican with a cantina(tables & chairs) in the front. no tv's in the restaurant. the chips were stale. the salsa was not fresh. and of course the entrees-suuuuucked!! cold-bland and awful-taste like everything at the palace station!!
i would go to the red rock!!
