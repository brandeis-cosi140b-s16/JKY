I see other reviews say it's not authentic.  What?  Huh?  Whatever.  I thought the Salsa was awesome.  Had a great Fajita-like dish with Steak and Shrimp.  It was everything I hoped it could be and more.  So, let's see:
Great Food
Great Service
Good Atmosphere (quietish, which is preferred to crazy)
I am looking forward to a return trip soon!
