This weekend we went to Macayo's to celebrate a birthday.  We had a 7:30 reservation and the table was set up early! I brought a cake to the restaurant and they were nice enough to put it in the refrigerator until we were ready for dessert. Many people in our party have a lot of specific food needs and our server, Kyle, made suggestions to help each individual person. He was so helpful and kind. Our meals were hot and even though there were a lot of special requests, they came out perfect.
I would go here again
