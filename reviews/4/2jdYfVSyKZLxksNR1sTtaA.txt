I live right around the corner from LU LU's and it is fantastic. It is a little hole in the wall with a mish mash of restaurant tables and booths. It is not the most aesthetically pleasing place but that's not what gets me to come back to a place. 

Salsa bar is good. Three kinds, very fresh, carrots and jalapenos are all free. Yes chips cost money. The food is fantastic. They serve authentic Guadalajara style street tacos. Yup they are small and like a buck fifty each. They are wonderful. Very very tasty. The chicken, carnitas, and machaca are all fantastic. They have delicious burritos in delectable tortillas. The chicken, machaca, carne asada are all wonderful. The lengua is the BEST! Tacos and burritos! 

If you are looking for a delicious place to eat good Mexican food on a day where you wandered out in shorts and flip flops.......go here. It is definitely worth a try.
