I'm always satisfied with the fish tacos Rubios put out. The battered ones are my favorite but I've been going with the grilled Mahi tacos on my last few visits. With tasty salsas available at the side bar and extra limes, that's how I prepare my tacos. Service was a little slow to start the ordering process but on point after we sat down. I will be back to get some of my favorite fish tacos soon.
