Finally, a place to get some great tacos for cheap. Tortillas are homemade, the salsa is amazing. If you want great service and table clothes, this is not your place. If you want three amazing chorizo tacos with rice and beans for 8 bucks, this is your place. Light on the wallet, amazing on the palate. I'm hoping this place sticks around!
