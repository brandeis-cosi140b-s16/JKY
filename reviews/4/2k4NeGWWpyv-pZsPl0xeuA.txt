Went here with the husband one of the first evenings they were open maybe a month or two ago. This place by far has the best service with super friendly and helpful staff. If weather permits, seating in the outdoor patio is a must! Very nice waterfall wall and palm trees beg you to order just one more margarita. I wasnt too hungry so ordered taco salad, which was good, but the meat was a bit bland (but no doubt, still good food... And cheap!), and the hubby ordered carne asada which was delish. 
Trying to talk the other half into taking me back for dinner tonight!
