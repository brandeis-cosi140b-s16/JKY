I love their tacos.  They have these amazing corn tortillas and each taco is two tortillas, some meat, onions, cilantro, and some limes on the side.  On the back of the menu you can pick and choose among tacos, tamales, huaraches, and some other things I'm forgetting.  The tacos sand out to me.  Go for the cecina (marinated beef), lengua (beef tongue...just trust me!), or pork.  Oh man I love those tacos.  The tamales are real good but they'll fill you up right quick so limit yourself to one.  Leaves more room for tacos!  Otherwise the huaraches are only $4.50 and huge, a meal in itself unless you're going for a glutton festival.  But I mostly love the tacos.  Them's some proper tacos.
