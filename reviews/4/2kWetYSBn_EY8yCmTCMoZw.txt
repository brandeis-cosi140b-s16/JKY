Pollo Relleno.. so amazing! (The plate is enough for two so bring a friend or come hungry (and thirsty ;) The plate came as: chicken breast stuffed with poblano chiles, caramelized onion, corn and goat cheese finished with poblano cream sauce. Delicious!!  Don't forget to try their calamari! Friday evenings, live music and great fun.
