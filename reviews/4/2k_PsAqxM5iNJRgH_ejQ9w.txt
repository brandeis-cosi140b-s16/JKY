Carne asada chimichanga fundido style is delicious, one of my favorite items on the menu. Flavorful carne asada cut in to cubes, covered in a slightly spicy fundido sauce. They also have the best fresh hot chips thin tortilla chips. The hot salsa that they have is really good but can sometimes vary in spiciness, there have been a couple of times where it has been much hotter then normal.
