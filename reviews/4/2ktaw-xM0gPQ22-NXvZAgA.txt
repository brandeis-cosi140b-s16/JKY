Chipotle is no secret place, but maybe I can still give my 2-cents worth and readers may still find it worthwhile. I go to this particular Chipotle during my lunchtime half-hour during those days I don't bring my lunch which for me is few and far between. Chipotle in general is great because it can be healthy fastfood eating. It's healthy depending on what combination you put together. One of the great things about Chipotle is they aim for ingredients grown within 100 miles; warning - that doesn't necessarily mean ALL of their ingredients are fresh. They also aim towards making their newer facilities "Green".

My particular experience with this location has been great overall. First of all, it's really awesome that I can pay for pick-up on their website and select the time that I would like to pick up; second, it's really awesome that I can go straight to the counter to pick up. I always order the same thing: chicken bowl with veggies, no rice, no sour cream, black beans, mild or hot salsa, cheese, and avocado, which is about a buck or two extra. My tip here is when ordering online, you may want to specify you would like your bowl filled up because on two different occassions they fed me like I was ordering a side. I finally learded my lesson.
