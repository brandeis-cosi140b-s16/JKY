Food is great! Tastes delicious and even better when they have their $2 tacos on Tuesdays and Sundays. I would go for the Lomo (steak) tacos. Also, the Potato wedges are sooo flame!

Service is mediocre but very friendly. Sometimes I feel like the waiters get confused at what they're doing - doing too much or doing too little. 

Drinks are pretty good. Except they forgot to put salt on the last margarita I ordered... huh?

Atmosphere is great. Bathrooms are clean and tidy. Outdoor seating is very nice too.
