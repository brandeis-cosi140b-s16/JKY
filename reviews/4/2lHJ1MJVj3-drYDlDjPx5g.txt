This is probably the nicest Zaba's I've been to. The ordering process and food is essentially the same: type of entree you want, rice, beans, potatoes, meat, salsa, filings. What stood out to me at this location was the soda machine that they had. They have the one soda machine that has hundreds of different kinds of drinks in it and that honestly makes it a lot more appealing than the standard 8-12 selections you may have at any other restaurant. Overall the staff was still very nice and the food was pleasant. If there is one thing that will definitely make or break your visit, they have charging outlets at some of the table. No adapter? No problem, they have USB outlets too so you can definitely charge your device if you have a cord. Have fun eating at Zaba's!
