Margaritas and daily taco special were both amazing! A great bargain.  I liked the atmosphere as well. Great and friendly service.  I would have given it 5 stars but... Then I tried the corn on the cob that everyone was raving about. It was disgusting. Do you people not know what real corn on the cob is supposed to taste like?!? This was like eating cardboard, slathered in butter and cheese.  I had to drink two more margaritas just to get that awful taste out of my mouth.
