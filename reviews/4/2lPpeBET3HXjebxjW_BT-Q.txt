Laurita's is way better than any of the Roberto's I've been too. Very authentic. Homemade everything. They have so much on the menu I haven't been able to try them all. Tacos and burritos are always great. Also with it being open 24 hours - huge plus for me and my crazy hours. I had a Carne Asada super burrito and loved it. The salsa was on point. Definitely going back!
