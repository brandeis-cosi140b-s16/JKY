One of the first Mexican Restaurants I dined at, just after moving to the desert. Probably been here like 30 times since.. 

From experience, my preferrred orders:

Carne Asada Burrito or Tacos: The burritos here are wrapped tight and more long than thick. The meat isn't super tasty but it does carry that authentic flavor without and trace of grease! 

Bean and Cheese Burrito: Their Beans here are among the best refried beans I've had! Beans may just be a filler to some but I always pay attention and adore beans in my mexican food! Sometimes I add sour cream.. 

Other great options: carne asada fries or nachos (could feed 3-4 hungry peeps), california burrito, cheese enchiladas..

* They got this habanero sauce that they don't have available at their 'get it yourself' condiment bar (they used to). For those brave, hot chili sauce lovers, try this! You must ask one of the staff members for it because its in they now store it in their kitchen fridge.

Decent food and prices, staff are friendly and place is looks and feels like a typical mexican joint should..
