i love the place,pretty consitent,i love that they dont use LARD in there beans,so veggie friendly for all of you greens out there.the place isnt no 5 star dining expeirence.but it isnt dirty,the staff is not friendly but not overly happy seeing how they have to deal with late night drunks and they all to common family that doesbt quite know what they want and ask there advice as if the employees give a sh*t.all the time your in line,might as well be on the phone.go there its better than filiasquirtos.
