Yeah!!! Time to celebrate! Pinata Nueva has died and Ocho Locos has risen from the ashes to replace it. This is excellent traditional mexican food with expedient service. Although the chips aren't homemade the salsas are yummy and the mexican pizza is to die for - fresh ingredients and lots of flavor if you choose the shredded beef. Can't wait to go there again.
