You had me at margarita.

Claiming to be the first US outpost of Hussong's Cantina of Ensenada, Mexico, which in turn boastfully claims to be the originator of the margarita, how could you walk past this place?

We were in the middle of some hardcore Vegas shopping and stopped for a quick bite to eat to recharge our internal batteries.

Hussong's offers a very relaxed interior, decorated with an obvious nod to Cinco De Mayo with an abundance of skulls that are quirky rather than morbid, the bar staff were warm and friendly, service was fast without being rushed and speaking as someone who normally opts for a booth I'm happy to advise that the bar stools are surprisingly comfortable.

While there we tried the following:
Baja Style Ceviche: excellently executed appetizer, zingy and refreshing.
Stacked Quesadillas: generously filled appetizer, tasty and packed with flavour.
Margarita's: I'll admit, it was me knocking back these beauties as The Hublet isn't really a cocktail guy.  There were very, very good and the more I drank the better they got.  Weird huh.

Great stop for a quick, tasty bite to eat and a must try if you like margaritas.  If their entrees are as good as their appetizers you'll be fine.
