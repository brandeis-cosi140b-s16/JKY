I was introduced to Tony about a year ago and my life has never been the same. Now a dietary staple, the shredded beef burrito with the spicy red sauce is my happy place. I have tried a handful of other items that are tasty, but nothing compares to that burrito. 

Tip : whatever you get, throw the spicy red sauce on there. Churros included.
