The new location just opened close to me and I grew up going there as a kid in south Scottsdale.  I was hoping for a good experience and got it.  The service was great and our server recommended anything with fundido sauce, great recommendation.  My husband had spinach enchiladas in fundido sauce, awesome.  I got the green chile burro in fundido sauce, very good.   Nice atmosphere, certainly worth a visit.
