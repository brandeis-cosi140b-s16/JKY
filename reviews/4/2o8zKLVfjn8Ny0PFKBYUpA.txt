I first encountered cochinita pibil at the Taco Bus in Tampa, Florida, and I've been searching for it ever since. Although there is a version of it at Border Grill at Mandalay Bay, I wanted something a little less upscale, and when I read about Los Antojos on Yelp, I couldn't wait to try it.

My husband loves cochinita pibil even more than I do, so he ordered the plate lunch. For less than $8, he got a platter of tasty pork (seasoned with citrus and achiote) with the traditional picked onions, along with rice, beans, and tortillas. I had two cochinita pibil tacos, which were like the small street fare I expected; and a small bowl of the consomme loco, which is a simple chicken, rice, and cilantro soup topped with avocado. Although the soup was tasty, next time I think I'll stick with the tacos, and maybe try one of the others listed on the menu -- the ham and pineapple (jamón y piña) sounds intriguing.

The restaurant itself doesn't look much different from the dozens of similar strip-mall establishments located throughout the city, but the variety of menu options -- especially the inclusion of the aforementioned cochinita pibil (did I say how much I love it?) -- make this "hole in the wall" one worth visiting.
