Dropped by for a quick lunch, ravenously craving a bowl of noodles. Ordered the Unruly Monk (hand-cut noodles/wood ear mushrooms/poached egg/spicy sauce) .  It came so steaming hot that I'm surprised the server's hands weren't on fire. The handcut noodles had a good texture and accompanied by a really tasty broth and the tiniest serving of XO sauce.  Pretty good attempt at homemade XO.  It added the perfect touch to the already rich and comforting broth.   A bit pricey, at almost $18 for the bowl, but you're talking about and Andres restaurant on the Strip.  

Those fearing asian fusion fare will be relieved to know the fusion is minimal. There is a Chinese side and a Mexican side, with some dishes borrowing from both cultures.  Again, an indulgence, but curious to go back and try the dim sum and tacos.  Didn't hurt that Jose was wandering around, in town for some celebrity asian chef-fest.   Wish it was a bit more casually priced, but still a tasty meal. Bring some amigos to share.
