I went to Phat Burrito and ordered the steak quesadillas.  They were delicious!!  There was plenty of steak and yummy cheese.  It came with a side of sour cream and there is a little salsa bar near the food window where I filled up on fresh pico de gallo.  I was seriously in heaven.  My friend ordered the BBQ Chicken burrito and let me tell you kids, it was indeed a PHAT burrito.  Not only did it taste good but it was huge!  The burrito is stuffed with your choice of refried or black beans.  I sampled a bite of hers (with the black beans) and I was in love.  My only disappointment was the guacamole.  It was mediocre and the only ingredient I could really taste was lime.  The chips that came with it were great but for some they may be too salty.  Instead of eating the guac, I marched back up to the salsa bar and experimented with a variety of salsas.  It was pretty fun!  

The atmosphere is very casual.  It has a funky, laidback, almost carribbean feel.  The staff greeted me when I walked in and took my order right away.  I decided to order a beer with my quesadilla (another added bonus) but I had to use the restroom before we sat down.  As soon as I came out, the cashier called my name and had my beer opened and waiting.  Good service!

My meal costs around $9 with the beer and I was fully satisfied.  I will definitely go back and would consider swinging by for pick up!
