This place is yummy. The service might not always be, but the food is. They have a sexy bar and great intimate decor and a South West feel that isn't done with terra cotta colored paint and teal cacti pictures. I love the Jelapeno Benedict and they have AMAZING margaritas. And they serve brunch till super late.
