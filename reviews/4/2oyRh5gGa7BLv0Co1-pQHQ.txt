I have always been a fan of Chipotle restaurants. That's after I got sick and tired of haHaha Fresh. Some would say that this is not authentic Mexican food but I would have to disagree. Freshness is the key factor for their success. Sure, I like dirty "C" rating hole in the wall restaurant but not everyday. The service is fast, efficient and friendly. The establishment is clean and very well maintained. I always get a burrito and I always try to mix it up every time I order just so I can taste the variety. My favorite is t he barbacoa and  carnitas. All the accoutrements are tasty. I rarely get the guacamole because it sky rockets the cost of your burrito and the added $ is not really worth it. Basically, a burrito will set you back $6.50 but that is not bad because you get somewhat of a bang for your buck. I agree with some of the yelpers that they can skimp out on the meat at times and it's a bit disappointing but overall I am very happy with the end product. I am always in the mood for Chipotle.
