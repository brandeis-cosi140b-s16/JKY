Okay, so I admit that this place wasn't first on my list of restaurants to visit while in Vegas.  However, the people I was with were starving and when this place came into our line of sight, we pretty much decided this was it for the evening's meal.  Since we are east coasters, we were there earlier than most for dinner.  We got seated right away and the place was not busy at all.  Our server was fast and brought our drinks, chips and salsa right away.  

Everyone at our table ordered different things, from fajitas to tacos to burritos.  Everyone enjoyed their food and the price was not bad considering how high it could have been for its location on the strip.  

The waitresses all dancing every half hour (or whatever it is) is actually entertaining because some of them are really into it and others are definitely not.  It entertained our group at least.  

Decent food, decent prices, excellent location.
