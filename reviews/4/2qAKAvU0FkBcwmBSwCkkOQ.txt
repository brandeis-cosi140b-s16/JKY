This is a great restaurant, I always get their staple dishes. We tend to go for brunch and I love getting the pinto bean mash with spuds and putting mild salsa on the pintos. I enjoy the casadillas and the tacos. They do have great blue corn pancakes and great coffee. For later, they do have an awesome selection of tequilla and some of the best margharittas in town.
