After two visits, I have tried the chicken tacos, barbacoa and fish tacos, as well as chips and salsa and Refried beans. Unlike other Mexican restaurants, Taqueria is fresh, light, and delicious. Although the owners and servers are extremely friendly the service is very slow because, from my two visits, it appears to be just the two of them. Upon arriving both times I waited at the door because the wife was in the back cooking. However, upon being seated, she explained everything, and when I say everything, she went thought the entire menu, as well as gave me her recommendation. Overall, the food is too die for, but I do wish they would get a few more servers and offer a little better salsa for the chips. I will be back.
