AYYYYY MUCHO CALIENTE PAPIIII~!!!!

haha I have been wanting to try this place just because the pictures look so darn cool! Coming in I knew that we just HAD to try the flaming fajitas I mean if it's in the name of the restaurant then you should probably try the dish right? HAHA Walking into the place it's your typical family run Mexican joint nothing fancy but it was very clean and colorful. There is a full bar and patio area to the left and then the main dining room is comprised of both tables and booths.. I even think they have a little dance floor area. 

We ordered:
-Table-side made Guacamole: ($7.95) They make it exactly to your liking so if it tastes bad it is your own fault!
-Chicken & Beef Flaming Combo Fajitas for Two: ($25.95) I don't even like fajitas but these were so good. Good quality meat and you gotta love the little fire show that you get.. I love that the plate is indeed sizzling and pretty much stays sizzling so your meat/onions/peppers stay hot! 
-Combo comes with guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, rice, beans or you can substitute the rice+beans for VEGGIES yay.. I love how they bring 2 separate plates of these instead of 1 to share between the 2 people! Combo also comes with a choice of corn or flour tortillas (6 total!)
-Complimentary Fideo soup which is like a tomato based soup with some noodles.. was a little salty for me but I still liked it!
-Complimentary Chips, Salsa & Bean Dip: The chips were mixed with the standard yellow chips and red and green chips.. served warm but not oily.. The salsa tasted fresh and was not too spicy and the bean dip was a little too salty for me but still tasty! 
On the menu it says the first round is on the house but that they charge after that.. They asked us if we wanted a refill and I said yes but they didn't charge us so maybe it's 1 per person? 

Awesome friendly service from all of the wait staff.. Food took a little bit longer than I had expected but I didn't really notice since I was too busy munching on chips.. I told Juan I found them through Yelp and he said Yelp has really helped them.. I definitely recommend trying this place out.. If you don't like fajitas they have a bunch of other items (no a la cart items though) & they have a daily HAPPY HOUR 3-7! 

HOT TIP: print this coupon before you go.. I forgot to print mine so they didn't accept it but oh well haha: https://mobileapp.moneymailer.com/IcfV2/getIcfImage.aspx?im=sat&o=7ACFE9EB-ADE7-4468-B58D-244231566823&di=&t=HOTPDF&p=F
