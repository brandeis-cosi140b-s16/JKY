We love Raceway Bar and Grill.

My fianc√© and I found this bar about four years ago when we were living in Maricopa. It's approximately two miles south of Harrah's and a mile west on Papago Road. You can drive your car, your motorcycle or even ride your horse to this grill.

It's a very eclectic place with old signs and memorabilia all over you can even find an old phone booth. 

Great place to have a few beers (if you're not driving) watch a game or NASCAR, play some pool or listen to some music. 

The food is typical bar fare but good. We particularly enjoy the fish tacos and the Candied Pecan & Craisin Harvest Salad of course the pizza and burgers are also excellent.

Next time you want something to eat and you are in Maricopa stop by you won't be disappointed and you will have fun too.
