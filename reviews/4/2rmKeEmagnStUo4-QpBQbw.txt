I still haven't decided whether I like Chipoltle or Qdoba better; it's a close call. Either way you can get a huge  vegan burrito for under $6, how can you complain about that?

Bonus for Qdoba is that their pinto beans are Vegan(Chipolte's are not). I usually grab rice, black beans, fajita veggies, corn, hot salsa, lettuce, gauc - done. They also have some veggie tacos and another grilled veggie burrito but I usually go for the staple above(make it more healthy with a bowl, no rice, double black beans).

The service is usually friendly enough and consistent. My family and friends in the far reachs of Northeast New England long for Qdoba - I am not sure if I would go that far but it satisfies this Vegan.
