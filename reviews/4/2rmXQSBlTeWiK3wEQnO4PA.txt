So on another Friday in Lent I find myself looking for fish tacos. I indecisively drove around and came across this drive thru. I think, why not and order 3 fish tacos. It was one of the best food accidents I could find. Big pieces of fish in the huge tacos. Let me start by saying I'm a big kid and I only had 2 of the 3 tacos for dinner. The 3rd was 'breakfast' on Saturday. Would I come back- for fish tacos YES. Their breakfast burritos are pretty good too, but I'll review those in another review.
