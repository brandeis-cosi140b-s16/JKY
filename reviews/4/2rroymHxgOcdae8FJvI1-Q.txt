The tacos here are delicious! They are bigger than what you are used to if you get tacos from a truck! It is twice the size of that. I have tried the chicken and carne asada tacos and both were able to satisfy my hunger at the moment. The chicken tacos were okay.. it could have had more of that grilled taste, but nonetheless, I would eat it again. The carne asada tacos were my favorite! It was filled with a lot of meat and toppings on top! At the restaurant, they have a few sauces in bottles. Its fun to just try a whole bunch of sauces, but be careful if you do not like a lot of spice! The bottles are just red and green and you do not know what the spice levels are!

My favorite dish from this place that I crave all the time like a pregnant woman (i'm not expecting, however.. I just love this dish that much...) is the CEVICHE!!!! Their shrimp is made perfectly and it is so juicy with the sauces they put on top! It is dry-- not your typical wet ceviche but for sure.. THIS IS A MUST TRY dish! It is so addicting. It does not come with a lot of chips so make sure you ask for extra on the side.

Overall, this place is one of my favorites. It is a bit pricey, but I think it is definitely worth it!
