I love the happy hour here! The place is big enough answer the seating is very spacious, the food is always cooked great and delivered quickly to the table with that just out of the kitchen heat. Oh, and the burro wings and Hawaiian gone fishing appetizers are amazing as well as the drunken shrimp.  Hands down the best buffalo wings in town! So crispy and juicy with tons of flavor!  

On Sundays it does get really loud cause of the games and the people cheering and the live band playing that you can't really hear yourself speak...  but hey that's just one day. And I don't need to chat when I'm devouring the yummy wings anyways!

Also the staff is always very kind and prompt! Kudos to the great team this location has!
