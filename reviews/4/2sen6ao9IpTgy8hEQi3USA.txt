Simple. Righteous. My two words for this taco stand on Brookline blvd. I've said it numerous times, and I shall say it again. Brookline is a hidden gem of Pittsburgh. GO THERE!!

Las Palmas is just another great reason for you to go. I had two amazing tacos with a spicy pork and had the choice of a many different salsas and toppings. Las Palmas is a great little spot that everyone can come to and get taco'ed up and feel great., especially since each taco is $2. 

You really only need 2 or 3.
