Found this joint using the Yelp App.  It was 11 am on a Thu and was getting hungry.  I lucked out and found a parking spot right in front of the joint.  The place has the vibe and is decorated in a 50's Diner motif.  Music played from the time period and there's a soda like bar in the center of the restaurant.  The server gave me the menu and after a few minutes I decided to get:

Texas BBQ Burger (Cheddar Cheese, BBQ Ranch Sauce, Onion Rings, Bacon) - $6.15

The food came out pretty fast.  I was pleased to see 2 large pieces of real Bacon sticking out the side of the Burger....yum!

I went for that first.  The Onion Rings in the Burger were nice and crispy and had good flavor.  The BBQ Sauce was slightly tangy and went well with the other ingredients....and of course there's the Bacon.....perfectly cooked, not too burnt not too undercooked, just right!  All together it was an awesome Burger.

Next up was the Hot Dog.  The Dog comes split in half (I like it that way).

Cooked just right, the Hot Dog had a nice slight 'snap' to it.  The Onions and Relish were fresh and went together well with all the fixins.

Fries came with both orders.....there was too much, so I didn't finish them....but they were very good.  The server was very friendly and was always checking on me.  It was a great dining experience.
