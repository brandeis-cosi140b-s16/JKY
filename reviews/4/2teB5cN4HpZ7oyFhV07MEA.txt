I really like this place! Very reasonable prices, plus 10 percent off for City of Mesa employees. The wait staff are nice, the salsa is good. Food came fast. Only thing I didn't really like is, it's rather dark in there and a little stark so that is off putting in my opinion. Once I was seated though, I was fine. I highly recommend!
