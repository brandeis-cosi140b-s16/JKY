Hooooray! Carlsbad now has a house wine available all the time for $5 and it is good. We had not been back in a year because the wine was so expensive. Had the Carne Adovado and the braised Chicken and it was crispy with an adobo/chipotle rub, both were excellent. Tracey was our waitress and fantastic. We will be back soon!
