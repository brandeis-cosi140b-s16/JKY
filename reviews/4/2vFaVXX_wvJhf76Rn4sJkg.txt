This small, casual place is very clean and organized. You order at the front counter, seat yourself, and bus your table when you're done. I ordered the grilled chicken quesadilla. The tortilla was soft with slightly crispy edges. The chicken, which had a strong  charbroiled taste, was mixed into avocado and sour cream, making a soft and moist filling. I quite liked it! The chips were average, but good. And the guacamole was fresh and not overly spicy. Since it's close to CSN, I'll definitely come back between classes for a quick lunch.
