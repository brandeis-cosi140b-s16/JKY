Stopped in last night for dinner....around 7ish...so a little busy, not crazy, but steady.  We ordered a chicken bowl and burrito....  He told us it would be about 6 minutes for chicken...so he asked us just to go to the front of the line for a couple pops and they'd let us know...  So we took our free pops and had a seat....sure enough about 6 minutes later a gal came out and flagged us over.  I appreciated that the guy gave us a time frame and also didn't try to talk us into another meat option.  The free pops were also appreciated.  We will be back, thank you Chipotle!!
