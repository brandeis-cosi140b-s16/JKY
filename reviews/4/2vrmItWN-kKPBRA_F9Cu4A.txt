What a great find! This was my first time checking out Rubio's. Honestly I was thinking this was a certain "other" mexican place in Aliante. But I was willing to try this one instead. Glad I did! I thought it would be a good late lunch while waiting for my movie to start...I was pleasantly surprised! YUMMY YUMMY street tacos! Now I am a huge fan of street tacos, but these were amazing! Especially for a "fast food" place. I'm used to the little vendor stalls at local events and was not expecting to be blown away. This really was like eating tacos in Mexico! Only I didn't have to worry about getting sick! haha
I had the 3 little carnitas street tacos with chips and beans. A small side of the mild salsa and an ice tea! I asked for it to go, since I don't usually manage to finish a complete meal. Was I wrong. I ate all 3 tacos which were warm and juicy and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the cilantro and onions on top! I am a huge fan of cilantro, so if you are not you may not appreciate this as much as I did, but it's not overwhelming like some other Mexican places I have eaten at. The side of beans seemed small at first, but combined with a bit of salsa and the chips it was perfect! My mouth is watering just writing this review! The beans did need a bit of salt to meet my taste...just saying! The mild salsa was a bit too "tomatoey" for me, but they do advertise it as tomato based...I'm going to have to try their tomatillo salsa next time. 
They use Lipton leaf tea here so I was pleased! Even unsweetened it was delicious and refreshing. (Just an FYI, I managed to walk into the movie theater with this cup and nobody batted an eyelash!)
BONUS!
So, I don't know what the service is like on a weekend or evening, but since Monday afternoons are my movie days now I thought this was a perfect lunch on my perfect day off! Thank you Rubio's and Aliante station for making my day wonderful!
I hope everyone can enjoy this location!
