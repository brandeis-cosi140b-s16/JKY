I'm giving this 4 stars for the grande margarita.  OMG, it was tasty.  It is not cheap at $8.50 but it is soo good.  One of the better margs I have had in a long time.  It ranks up there in the top 5.

Wasn't real busy when we went here and I haven't been to this particular location.  I decided on the taco plate.  My only complaint was that the machaca was a little salty IMO and I like salt.  The beans and rice were just ok nothing special.
