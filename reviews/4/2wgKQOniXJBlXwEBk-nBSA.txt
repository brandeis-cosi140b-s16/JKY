I liked the environment, modern hipster like. The bartender was very nice, just not super attentive to detail, but that's not such an important thing to me. The food was okay, I had 3 different tacos just to try them, but it's hard for me to justify a $4+ taco. The fish taco had basically no fish, but the calimari was good and the pork belly was good. most disappointing part was the bathroom. The trash was over full, the toilet wouldn't flush and it was so dark I had to open the door to see myself in the mirror. But, still liked it okay enough to try it again.
