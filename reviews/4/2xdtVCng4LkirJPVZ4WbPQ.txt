I was a Chipotle lover when I live in the Twin Cities. I was super excited to find out that there was one less then 10 minutes from where I lived when I moved to the Southpark area. 

I know many people go there for their burritoes,but I go there for their soft tacos. I always get the steak and I love that everything is so fresh from the meat to the veggies. I always get mines super hot and their salsa's will do just that! 

If you want quality tacos and burritos I suggest going to Chipotle and not Taco Bell! Its a little more pricer but its definately worth it!
