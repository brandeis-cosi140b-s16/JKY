i used to love this place when it was a Filibertos years ago. i was actually sitting at the drive thru window when this place was busted my immigration officers about 9 years ago..i was so upset afterwards...it went from a 24 hour food spot to a place that closed at 10pm :(

ohh memories. i haven't tried it since it changed to Federico's but lets face it. all these places are pretty much the same. cheap delicious food that is a gamble every single time.
