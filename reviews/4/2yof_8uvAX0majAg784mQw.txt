I went here with a meetup group last night. We ordered chips and guacamole and chips and salsa as appetizers. Good stuff! Then, we all ordered drinks. I tried the Spicy Mango margarita. It was delicious and I loved that you get that spicy kick on the get go. Others had the sangria and El diablo. Everyone said the drinks were tasty. :) 

I had the pollo torta for my entree and it was really good. The chicken wasn't dry and the flavors were nice. Everyone else's food looked delicious too and I didn't hear anyone complain. It was a good night out with good food and tasty drinks.
