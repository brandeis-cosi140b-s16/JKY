Found this little Mexican place on accident. It's really close to our house so we decided to give it a try. We ordered the one thing we order no matter where we go, chile rellenos. They have 2 options here, regular or crsipy. We ordered the traditional ones. No bueno. They were tiny, dense and the wrong cheese is used. The beans were AMAZING. Addicting I would say. The rice was pretty good. The shredded chicken sope was delicious. The chips and salsa were ok. Service was great. Our waiter was very attentive and nice. We will be coming back to try a few other dishes but we will make sure to stay away from the chile rellenos.
