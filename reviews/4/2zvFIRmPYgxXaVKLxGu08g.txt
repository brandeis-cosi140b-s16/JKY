If you're in the area and want a quick fix from south of the border, you won't be disappointed.

These guys used to be at the Filiberto's near 32nd st and Indian School until about two or three years ago. I remember going inside that location at one point and they were passing out flyers and said to start going to Juliobertos as soon as it opened up.

Since I lived just up the street and the dudes were always cool, I gave Julioberto's a shot and was not disappointed.

I always place my order inside, as the inside is open 24 hours as well, not just the drive thru. If you go inside they have a Salsa Bar with several different types of Salsa's, one of them being an Avacado Salsa, which is top notch in my opinion. They also offer pickled carrots, onions, and jalapenos at the salsa bar.

Everything that I have yet to try has been consistently good for this type of establishment. The carne asada burrito always seems to be a classic among the white boys like myself, and I must say that I have yet to encounter a burrito that contained fatty meat or a dried out tortilla. The meat has always been seasoned well with all of the condiments inside and the tortilla was fresh and hot. The red salsa and the avocado salsa combined on this burrito or any other adds so much flavor.

The five rolled tacos with cheese, guacamole, and sour cream are always a great late night snack when you're on a diet...I highly recommend..lol ;)

The machaca beef and eggs wasn't bad, nor was the chorizo and egg burrito.

They seem to keep the salsa bar area well stocked and clean, as people make constant messes at those things, but they always seem to be on top of it.

The staff has always been friendly, and the overall experiences have always been consistent.

I highly recommend this place if you are in the area and can't decide which Mexican Fast Food joint to grab your meal from.

Cheers! :)
