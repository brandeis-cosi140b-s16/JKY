This is probably the best mexican food i've had in Vegas, which isn't saying much but it is pretty decent. They have lunch specials daily and the portions are generous. The salsa is delicious and the margaritas (though premade) definitely hit the spot. Since i'm a UNLV student I can get them for less than $2. The service could be better but it looks like they try and it's prompt for the most part. 

I have been here twice and both times there have only been maybe 1 or 2 other people. I'm surprised this place doesn't have more business considering it's across from UNLV and the food is cheap. 

If you're a student or just in the area, give this place a try.
