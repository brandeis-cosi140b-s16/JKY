when we were looking for this place we saw, from a distance, some flashing red and blue lights and we thought the police were there.  we almost reconsidered coming here, but then we realized the flashing red and blue lights were just some strobe lights they had hung outside lol.

I was a little unsure about going in because the place seemed a tad bit sketchy. but my boyfriend declared "I see old people in there, it'll be okay" so we went in...

What James L. said is true: come here for food as the SECONDARY. come for drinking and whatever event of the night (karaoke, trivia, etc.) as the PRIMARY reason for coming here and you won't be disappointed.

my boyfriend and I wanted to check this place out bc it's really close to where we live and thought it could be a fun hangout with friends. it's not very big inside -- maybe 30 seats total?  we came on a Sunday night and there was karaoke going, VERY loudly!  so we decided to sit on the patio.

would come back here with a group to do karaoke/trivia.  but I might skip the burrito and just stick to appetizers and drinks or something.  the burrito was pretty underwhelming.
