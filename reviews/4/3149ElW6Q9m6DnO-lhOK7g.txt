Well I've only been here once, but that's only because I live in Tucson. I still think about their chilaquiles a month after having had them for the first time. Must be love!

All you have to know
1) Chilaquiles: the most basic of Mexican breakfast food. The presentation at Gallo Blanco sexes up the dish by a whole lot.  Whole tortillas used instead of the usual strips/bits. Alternating layers of tortilla, salsa, veggies, and egg. A minor work of art. 

2) Chilaquiles at Gallo Blanco are not only good looking but delicious as well. I ate EVERYTHING on my plate.

3) Hipsters like chilaquiles. They were EVERYWHERE. 

In summary:
Basic. Sexy.  Delicious. Hipsters. Got it?
