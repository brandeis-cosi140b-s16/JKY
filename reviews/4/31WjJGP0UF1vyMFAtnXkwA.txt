Star Mexican grill is what a small owner operator mexican restaurant  should be, it is not a white linen $20.00 entree type Mexican but the food is very good, stick with the basics Tacos, enchiladas, and Burritos, they serve rice and beans with most dishes really like the chicken or pork enchiladas. the prices are $5.00 to $7.00 a few dishes higher it is served on disposable plates and plastic silver, they have some sauces on a small bar area if you like hot there hot sauce is very good and home made. This is just what I expect out of a small Mexican diner. good cheap food, you will like it
