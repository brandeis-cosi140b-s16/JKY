WELCOME TO MOE'S!

We stopped by Moe's after a long day of walking around a cornfield.  Wow.  That sounds "country," doesn't it?  Actually, we were working our way through a corn maze for almost 3 hours and needed some nourishment.

Moe's ranks between Qdoba (#1) and Chipotle (#3) for me when it comes to fast food burritos.  However, the best thing about Moe's is that you get a little more value for your money than with the other burrito places.  Moe's gives you FREE chips with your burrito and offers a FREE salsa bar.  After eating my sandwich AND chips, I feel like the stuffed burrito.  

I typically like spicy salsas, but Moe's hot salsas are too liquidy for me.  They're basically just hot sauce, not salsa, so I stick to the green tomatillo salsa from their salsa bar, which is out of this world.  It's not spicy at all, but it's so full of sweet flavor that I forgo the hot sauce and go straight for the tomatillo.  I just wish they had bigger containers to spoon it into.  I go through about 5 of their little salsa containers and it seems like a lot of wasted plastic (or a lot of running back and forth to the salsa bar with my tiny cup!).

This particular Moe's has a nice, big outdoor seating area, which was perfect for us to enjoy the sunny, fall day.
