My family and I are regulars at Jalapeno Inferno.  We live near Thompson Peak and Pima so the new location is SUPER convenient.
The location is amazing; great ambiance and staff.  My meal was below average.  I had a machaca beef chimi plate my first and only visit to this location.  Every meal (20+ visits) at the pinnacle peak location have been top notch.
I won't return to the Market Street location until I see additional positive reviews regarding the food.  My guess is it was a fluke but you know we have many choices!
