This was my 2nd visit to a Rubio's....this one is in my neighborhood.  My 1st experience with Rubio's was great and I was hoping this one would be good too.  I was right!

I ordered a Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans ($6.29).  It came out shortly and I went to the Salsa Bar to get their Spicy Salsa....it has some pretty good heat and I enjoy the flavor a lot.  The Burrito was very good and satisfying.

I'm glad I found this chain and that there's one near my house!
