Great place for a quick bite, and a few drinks before heading over to .... "Hey, where are we going?"

We had these jalapeno poppers with shrimp, and mini chimichangas (I think that's what they were ~ in the appetizer section) and they were SO GOOD! 

The girls ordered some tacos, and the food was so good -- it was the first time we were quiet in 4 days. 

Good times, we were pleasantly surprised with the food, drinks and service! We also enjoy to rubberneck, so we sat *outside* at the little pull up bar instead of inside the restaurant.
