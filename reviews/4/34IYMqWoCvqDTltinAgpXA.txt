I met a group of people for dinner tonight as Las Margaritas.  Most of the party arrived separately, but chips and salsas were plentiful as we waited.  The menu seems to be reasonably varied, and had a number of items that sounded good to me.  Plates for the entire group (around 10) came out very close together, which I appreciated so much.  It is SO awkward to be the one stuck at a table for 20 minutes without anything, while the rest of the table tries to decide if they should be polite and wait for you (and subject themselves to cold food) or to dig in and be rude.

I chose the Pollo Asado, which arrived on a GIANT plate.  I received 2 pieces of pounded, citrus-marinated chicken breast, rice and beans, and a pico de gallo that was different from the one served on the table (spicier, and a bit more macerated.  Also yummy).  The chicken had just the right amount of char, and the marinade had clearly served it well, since it managed to remain flavorful and not dry.

Service overall seemed to be on point, yet unobtrusive.  Our server didn't bat an eye when we announced that each of us would like separate checks, and to go boxes were brought without me feeling like I was being rushed out the door.  I enjoyed my meal, and would return when I happened to be in the neighborhood.
