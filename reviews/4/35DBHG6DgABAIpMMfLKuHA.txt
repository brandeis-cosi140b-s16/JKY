Plenty of outlets for travelers that are in need of some power- both at the bar and in the booths. Extremely fast service and food delivery (a plus for quick layovers) - but they're not quick to make you leave if you've got time to kill, either. I ordered the chicken tacos (tacos come in corn tortilla- burritos are larger in a flour tortilla) - seriously delicious. Keep in mind I'm a goat cheese fanatic - so that played into this crazy happy review.  I will definitely make this a regular stop for upcoming PHX layovers!
