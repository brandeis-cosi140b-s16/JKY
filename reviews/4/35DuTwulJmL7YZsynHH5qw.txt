Cocina Real was accurately described as sorta upscale Mexican. Maybe Mexican diner for Americans... which isn't a bad thing. It's consistently pretty good. We've been coming here for years. Margaritas are decent, the main dishes are suitable for sharing.  In general, they are busy the service can be a bit slow... if they aren't busy, the service is fantastic. 

Tonight we split fajitas Guadalajara - pork, chicken, beef. It's decent and plenty big enough for two.
