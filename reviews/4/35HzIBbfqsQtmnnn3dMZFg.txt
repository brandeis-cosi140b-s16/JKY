This is a very nice upscale place to sit down with friends and enjoy a real good Mexican food with great service. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and provided great service.

For starters I had the Mexican Shrimp Cocktail and then ordered enchilada dish that consisted of three enchiladas, two beef, and one chicken along with sides. Overall, a very good experience and would visit them again real soon  

Great menu and service.
