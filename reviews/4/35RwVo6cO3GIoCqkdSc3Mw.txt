A couple of weekends ago, Darren and I were looking at houses in Beechview and found this cute little taco shop. 

All I had was a taco with chorizo sausage, and it was soooo good. The corn tortilla was so exotic, and the meat was rich and spicy. 

Darren wanted to eat a dozen of them! But I stopped him!

The people who work here are really nice and welcoming. They even have Jarrittos Mexican Sodas which washed down my taco great.
