I love Rivas. I would have given 5 stars except that lately their food isn't consistent. I normally order a bean and cheese burrito for my kids, the rolled taco supreme, Carne asada burrito and sopes. Honestly, their food is always good. Lately though I don't know if they changed their meat provider or what the deal is because the carne asada has been really fatty and with a lot of grizzle. Then I decided to get the carnitas instead because of this. The meat was good but I could tell it had been reheated too long and had started to become really dry. Normally their carnitas is moist and good with the perfect amount of crisp on the edges. I really have nothing bad to say about the place. 9.5 times out of 10 that we go its amazing!!!
