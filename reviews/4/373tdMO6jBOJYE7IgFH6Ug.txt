I just recently tried this place for the first time. My boyfriend and I shared the Pizza Nortena, which was like heaven in my mouth. I love those fried chicken chimichangas with the spicy cream cheese sauce on them (pollo fundido I believe they are called) and I love pizza. This is basically pollo fundido on top of pizza. Sooooooo good, and gigantic. We had left overs, which tasted a-may-zing cold. The chips and salsa are delish too, and they aren't afraid to refill them for you, which is good for me because I like to spoil my din din by going to town on freebies. 
The service here is also good. The servers are nice and attentive. And a big plus for me is that it is CLEAN. I cant even count how many times I have had Mexican food in a filthy restaurant. Now, don't get me wrong, I love hole in the wall places, but in a sit down place that charges normal, not hole in the wall prices, I don't want to swat at fruit flies while eating my pollo fundido.
I haven't tried anything else on the menu yet, but I will definitely go back.
