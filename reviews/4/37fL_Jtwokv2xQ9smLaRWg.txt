I really love when I go to a restaurant and I am able to get a unique flavor that I can't find anywhere else. This love of mine gets harder and harder as I try more Mexican restaurants here in Phoenix. Los Taquitos reassures me that these places still exist though, and they do it with the Bombero. The Bombero's sauce is an enchilada-style kind of sauce with the twist of ketchup tang. It threw me off a little at first because I didn't know exactly what to expect, but as I munched on each bite, and the spiciness of the sauce began to take over, I knew that my taste buds had made a new friend. The al pastor and the chips were also very tasty, but I don't think many people will be blown away with those items like I was with the Bombero. 

I also want to add that the staff was extremely friendly during my visit. The cashier walked me through what I should try (recommending the Bombero if I was a fan of heat) and she didn't once seem impatient. That's always a huge plus to me. 

I'll definitely be back soon! I already find myself craving that Bombero sauce. You should definitely check Los Taquitos out if you're in the neighborhood. It's solid Mexican food at decent prices. If they add a happy hour, this will definitely be a busy spot! Next up for me, the original location!
