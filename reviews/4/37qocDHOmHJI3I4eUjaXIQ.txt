My family went to Rancho de Tia Rosa on a Saturday night and boy did we enjoy ourselves.  Our group of 8, including 2 kids, enjoyed our food thoroughly.  The music and the balloon guy were added pluses.  In fact, even the adults were entranced by what the guy could do with balloons.

The menu had many vegetarian and gluten free options and my pork chop was delicious.  Even the corn side dish was some of the best I have ever had.  I highly recommend it.
