Love this place, a friend showed it to me one night and have fallen in love with it ever since.  Great salsa with there chips.  The place has been recently remodeled and it looks great.  Our waiter knew the menu well and was friendly.  Really refreshing open air place unlike other Mexican restaurants.  

Went with my family recently and they loved it, good, efficient service.  No waiting to be seated.
