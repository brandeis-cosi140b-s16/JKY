I came here because of the positive Yelp ratings and it didn't disappoint, however, I attempted to visit on a Saturday night and the mad line inside turned me away. I returned Sunday for lunch and the lines to order were much more reasonable so I did order tripas and suadero tacos. The tacos were well above average, yet I expected the tacos to be the same quality as those from Taco Y Taco a few miles away. If you are in the area and crave authentic tacos, you can't go wrong as long as you don't mind long lines. I prefer Taco y Taco on Tropicana as my favorite taco spot in Vegas.
