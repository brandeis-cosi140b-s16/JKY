Love the new space since they expanded the resturant back in the summer! It is so nice not being squeezed into the tiny little space where you were sitting mere centimeters from the table next to you.

We arrived at around 6:30 and were seated immediately (yay, no wait).  I noticed that they had added a couple of new items to the menu.  I was tempted to try something new, but ended up going with the mole which covered a ginormous chicken breast.  Their mole is very thick and rich - it was good, but not quite as delish as the last time I had it here.  David had a combo plate which came with a choice of tacos, enchiladas, rice, etc. He was pretty thrilled wih his chicken tacos. 

The service was good - our server was quick and efficient and made sure we had everything we needed. 

Our tab came to around $41 which included an order of cheese dip for our chips, 2 entrees, and a beer.  We did well though since we had bought one of those coupons where you pay $20 for $40 worth of food.
