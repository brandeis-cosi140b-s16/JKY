I really adore this place mostly for their lunch special, and their guac is a particular favorite of mine since it's how my mom always makes it =)
Their portions are always large so you really get your money's worth.  Sometimes the food can be a little bland, but I feel like that's more a failing on my part for not putting the right salsa on whatever I'm getting.

Their sweet green salsa and mango salsa are particular favorites of mine, and I'm happy to keep going back to a local business.
