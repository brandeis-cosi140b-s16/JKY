Got the bean tacos with hot sauce for lunch yesterday. The sauce was super spicy, which I absolutely loved, and everything tasted very authentic. The tortillas were some of the best I've ever had.

My only complaint is that it was a little heavy on cilantro, but that's not keeping me from going back for lunch again today.
