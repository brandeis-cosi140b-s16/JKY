You know that it's a good stop for Mexican food when Drive Thru is spelled Drive Trhu on their business sign and they spell Height incorrectly - Hight - on the overhang in the actual Drive Thru.

Rienda's is one of those quick Mexican places that proves you don't have to spend $10 at a sit down restaurant to get really solid and tasty Mexican food. Plus, it's open 24 hours for the hungry human that wants some greasy food late at night.
