We came here as a last minute option, but have to say my meal which was the fish fillet with garlic sauce rice and beans was Fab! My date ordered a grilled shrimp meal that came with beans and rice. He loved it! They had some live musica in the dining room. And we drank Coke imported from Mexico. Good place, we definitely will be back.
