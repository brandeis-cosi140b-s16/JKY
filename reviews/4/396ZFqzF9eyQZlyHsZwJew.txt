I came here as I received a birthday coupon for a free entree as I would frequently visit the Rubio's at Monte Carlo as I worked at ARIA.  While I was impressed by the gentleman's professionalism and wishing me a happy birthday, the food was mediocre.  I ordered a shrimp quesadilla and there was substantially less shrimp in my quesadilla then there typically is at the location at Monte Carlo.  Disappointing for the food but excellent service!
