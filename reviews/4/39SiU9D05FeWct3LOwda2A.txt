I always forget about Johnny Burrito, its tucked away in the wachovia atrium building where its not front of mind. But when I do remember I am very excited to go there! 
The food here is pretty good. I usu sally get the salad (with chips and lettuce). They have very fresh ingredients to top your burritos and salads. It is a little more expensive than salsariats and qdoba but you get more food for your money and you are helping a small business by going here! 
The line looks so long but as others have said it's fast moving! It's another great place when you want to change it up with your lunch options!
