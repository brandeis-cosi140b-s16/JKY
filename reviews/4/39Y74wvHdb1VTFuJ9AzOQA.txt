This is the best Mexican food I've had in Charlotte since moving here from California. Having lived in LA, I have very high standards as far as Mexican food is concerned. Their staff is very friendly and greet you as soon as you come in. I've had their asada, carnitas and chorizo tacos and they're okay. Their chile rojo is pretty good, it's also really spicy so if you can't take heat I'd stay away from that. Their chile verde is okay. I had their chile rojo wet burrito and it was pretty good as well. I was hesitant after reading all the mixed reviews but decided to give them a try. Just as everyone else says, don't be fooled by the location of the place. It's in a small strip mall and you can possibly miss it but overall it's good. I'll be returning to try other items on the menu.
