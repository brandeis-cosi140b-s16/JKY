Super delish bottomless chips and salsa!!! You get three kinds of salsa to dip your tasty, salted chips into, and at only $2.95, you can't beat it!  The prices of their entrees and other appetizers are a bit over-priced.  The staff is super friendly, and the manager came by our table three times to ask if we needed anything...we'll definitely be back!
