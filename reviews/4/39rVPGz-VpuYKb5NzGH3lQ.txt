The food for the most part was delicious. The Steak Fajita Salad was okay, the steak lacked flavor and could have been more moist. The Chile Relleno and chips/salsa were good. On the other hand, the Pollo Fundido was one of the best I've ever had. The chicken was very moist and had lots of flavor. I would go back for that reason alone. Also, the service was good, the waitress we had was very attentive.
