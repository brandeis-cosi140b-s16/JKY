The food here was very good, but I'd suggest you open your patio for more seating as this place is a claustrophobics worst nightmare.  I seriously wished I'd taken my food to go.   

And if you are running the register and a customer shows you a picture of a plate of delicious tacos from your own restaurant on your own restaurant's Yelp page on the Yelp mobile app and asks you if you know what kind of tacos they are don't give them an annoyed glare and say "How am I supposed to know?!?!"   Uh, you are supposed to be able to identify your menu items because you are running the register, and because your menu doesn't exactly give a lot of description to your different offerings, and because it's just good customer service?   

I'll be trying this place again because everything was tasty the last time (for basically ordering the items blind) but if I get treated like an idiot for a simple inquiry again I definitely won't be back.
