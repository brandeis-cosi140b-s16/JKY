Great food for a good price.  Not to be condescending, but initially I thought this place was going to be another fast food Mexican joint (a la Roberto's) and we stopped here only because it was nearby and we didn't want Subway.  We rolled up in here and I opted for the Camarrones al Mojo de Ajo, or the Garlic Shrimp to the non-Spanish speakers out there (sorry if I butchered it) and it was really good surprisingly!  Although it wasn't the best Garlic Shrimp I've EVER had, this one was leaps beyond the Roberto's plate I usually frequent and it definitely worth mentioning.   Furthermore, is there anyone out there besides myself that doesn't like the "red" sauce?  Well try the Santander red sauce and be amazed.  I can safely say that the red sauce here is my favorite in the valley.  I barely even touched my "green" sauce and I love that sauce!  Plus, there is a wagon out front that they cook on nightly and you can even stop by for a quick bite if you're not interested in sitting in and eating. 

Food is great, price is reasonable, staff is friendly.. give it a try, you might be pleasantly surprised like I was.
