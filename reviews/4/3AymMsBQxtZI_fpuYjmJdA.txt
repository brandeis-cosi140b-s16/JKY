My girlfriend and I stayed in the Clarendon for a little staycation and managed to have both dinner and breakfast here.

Dinner:
We were there during happy hour. We both got cocktails and tacos. The "El Julio" was delicious, like a little alcoholic key lime pie in a glass. The carne asada tacos were good, but nowhere near as good as the grilled shrimp tacos. We split a lime tart which was both way bigger than I expected and very tasty.

Breakfast:
They serve Lux coffee which is always good. I got the Chilaquiles and it was simply a mountain of crunchy tortilla, perfectly frilled chicken, cheese and the perfect amount of heat from the green sauce.

Overall I would call this place a little Gem and a good place to take some visitors for a bit of Arizona chic.
