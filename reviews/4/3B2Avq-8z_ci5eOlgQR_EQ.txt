Ok, I didn't retry the Carne Asada meat yet, which got a bad review, but I'm trying other Mex favorites on menu. Today, Chorizo Torta with sour cream. Delicious!! And it was a healthy portion. Torta bread, which ruins a lot of Torta sandwiches if not good, was warm, soft, toasted, and moist. I would definitely eat again and recommend for anyone looking to have a good Torta.
