Little expensive for what it is, but it comes with the location I suppose.

Overall, HUGE positive review for Zapata's. This is one of my favorite spots to go for margaritas and tacos with the coworkers for birthdays and other celebrations. Never had less than stellar service and they're always very prompt. 

The white sauce over burritos is THE. BEST.
