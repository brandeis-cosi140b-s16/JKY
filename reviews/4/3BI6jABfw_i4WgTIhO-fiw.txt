Ordered lunch for a co worker and I . I ordered the honey grilled chicken burrito and nacho cheese and chips. The burrito itself was pretty good, next time I'll get the chipotle chicken, I felt the honey chicken was a bit overly sweet for a burrito, other than that it was great! Delivery was fast and food was hot!
