When I wake up the next day, still thinking of how wonderful the meal I ate the night before was, that's great food.  I had eaten here before, and really enjoyed it.  They changed the menu: it  now has more  classic Mexican dishes but they become something at a higher level in this restaurant.  We started with a made- at your- table guacamole: a lovely young lady prepared it the way we wanted- she offered a menu with selections such as mango and chipolte-really excellent - I could taste every flavor and it tasted so fresh-then we had ceviche- a separated trio of halibut, ahi tuna and shrimp- there was watermelon and other flavors and textures that made it really fantastic.  I then had their black bean soup;  I have eaten black bean soup all my life, but this was the best I have ever eaten- smooth and flavorful- I devoured it.  We ordered only one entree, and I was already full, but the presentation of it was so appealing and it tasted so good, I couldn't stop eating it: Pork Pobil  - the meat was just right, tender and the flavors, again, were complex and perfect.  There were rice and beans with the dish,  and they were both fresh, with great texture,  it was a substantial dish, but it was light and didn't make me feel like I'd eaten something heavy, at all. The shot of Mezcal I wanted for dessert, was smooth and the perfect finish.  This food was on par if not better than the many gourmet restaurants on the Strip I dine at frequently, but the biggest and best difference was the much  lower bill at the end.
I also enjoyed the enthusiastic service, the atmosphere and the duo that was playing on stage.  I look forward to going back here.
