7/28 came for lunch and bet the crowd. Had the fusion fries. Bulgogi topped fries. Good, meat was tender, it's a strange combo I'm used to carne fries so the sweet meat was not what I'm used too. Needs sour cream and guacamole . It was good. Not sure if I will order it again. Also ordered the pork belly musubi and that was so good and tasty my fave. Hubby ordered the tacoa chicken and pork. He liked the chicken the pork was too sweet. Love how they serve the hot sauce on little containers. Also that you not only get chips and salsa but guacamole too. Be prepared to wait, the sign says they make everything fresh so it takes awhile. Oh and they sell Mexican sodas too not only come but Pepsi etc.
