Great food. Not impressed with the Salsa, but who cares it was free on the table. I had the shrimp taco. Excellent. My semi-picky kids loved it as well.  Great atmosphere. We got there at a perfect time. Sometimes  the line can be long. The Banana Cheese Cake was perfect.  Over all I will go back to try more of the menu.
