I went to Steel Cactus with a large group for happy hour drinks and dinner.  Decent, not great beer selection.  Service was very good and we had no problem splitting checks in a large group.  I love the space Steel Cactus has, the rooftop seating area is roomy and heated when needed.  

I ordered the Camarones Tacos (grilled shrimp, sweet chili sauce).  The tacos were very yummy, but I am admittedly a sucker for faux mexican.  If you like Mad Mex, which this place will inevitably get compared to, you should be able to find something you like at Steel Cactus.  I wasn't too excited about the rice and bean sides, but I ate them all, so that says something (I can eat an unlimited amount of any quality of rice, though, to be honest).

During my happy hour I did hear people's disappointment with the Yinzerita, as others have reviewed here.  My advice:  avoid it, go for happy hour, enjoy a Dogfish Head or two (or more), and don't expect to be transported to Mexico CIty.  It is what it is, folks.
