Let me begin this review by saying that I hate Mexican food,  authentic or not.  

Last night we took my in-laws to the container park because I had heard from friends about how cool all the restaurants and bars are.  We were surprised to find out there are only a handful to choose from, so we picked Pinches, and I of course bit the bullet and decided to give it a try.

Mom ordered the enchiladas with beans and rice. The tortilla was on-point and the chicken was moist and flavorful, but the red sauce is too sweet.

Dad ordered a burrito with lengua. It came with guac, cilantro, salsa, onions, beans, and rice inside.  Everyone really liked it. He also ordered a chicken taco, which was also delicious.

Sean ordered a carnitas torta with onions, guac, Mexican creme, cilantro, and beans inside. It was good- the bread was almost like a flat bread.

I ordered the asada "not nachos", which had cheese, guac, beans, green salsa (everyone else's orders came with red), home-made chips, and sour cream (I asked for no onions, so there weren't any).  It was f***ing delicious! I'm craving it even now as I write this review at 9 am and I'm not even hung over!!! The steak was honestly the shining star; it was so flavorful and not overly chewy or hard. Also it was kinda refreshing- everything was fresh and went well together like a flavor explosion in your mouth.  My nachos were definitely the table favorite.

I think we'll be back soon!!!
