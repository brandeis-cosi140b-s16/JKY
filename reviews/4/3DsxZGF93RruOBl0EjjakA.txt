The staff here is always so friendly and warm!!!  The first time we went my guy had ordered the menudo. It came out with a really pasty consistency, almost like gravy. Really odd considering the more broth like soup I had been accustomed to. I later learned there are various ways to make it and this was one. Either way we brought it to out kind waiters attention and he took it off the bill and was very understanding. 
The food was too authentic for me to never try it again...... So I've actually been back numerous times since... For business meeting, lunch specials and just for fun. 
It's fast becoming my FAVORITE Mexican restaurant !!!!! It's a little pricey, but this can be avoided mainly by going during lunchtime! :) I'm sure they'll get another start once I've tried more on the menu. 
Love love love this place!!
