I liked the atmosphere at Pink Taco.  The service was prompted and the food was tasty.  When I first got my burrito I thought it was small, but it is filling.  The funny thing about eating at the Pink Taco for dinner is you see a lot of people from Rehab earlier in the day.  So the party never stops and we all seem to recognize each other.  I wouldn't mind spending more time in this place if wasn't headed to party at a club.  It seems to be a fun environment.
