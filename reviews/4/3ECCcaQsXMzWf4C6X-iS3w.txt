Very clean and friendly spot in south phoenix that I will most likely visit again. I wanted so bad to give four stars but will most likely review again on my second visit. The soda I wanted was out in the machine and the surf and turf burro was supposed to have chipotle shrimp and it seemed like it was missing sauce or seasoning on it. Everything else I saw there looked very good and I wish I had more time on my original visit to study the menu to order the wipeout burro which looks fantastic and has a yelp deal. The counter staff and cooks are all very friendly and well kept and you can tell they are trying their best to put a good light on their establishment. The salsa was fresh and tasted very good. The burrito was a good portion and filled me up for the rest of the day. The crane Asada and Quac tasted great. Overall I would recommend this place to those looking for a good bite where good restaurants are hard to find area wise.
