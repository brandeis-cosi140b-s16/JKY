I went there after getting a mailer and found out it was dollar taco night.  I tried one Pastor, Carne Asade, and Chicken taco with rice, beans, chips and salsa.  The tacos were served on good flour tortillas and were substantial.  The meats were very tasty, but perhaps not as fresh as I would have liked.  They have a few salsas (mild and hot green and red) and an avocado sauce that are really nice on the tacos.  The chips and salsa was very week.  The chips served were store-bought, and were not appealing at all.  The salsas were the same options served with the tacos.  The tacos are most like street tacos you get in Mexico, but are likely much more safe for consumption.  

The first experience was good enough that I went back for a breakfast burrito.  It was about 10:45 am.  Their website advertised that breakfast is served all day, and when I asked for a breakfast burrito they seemed unsure if they had the proper ingredients.  They confirmed that they were able to make breakfast burritos, and I was very pleased.  The breakfast burritos were huge.  I had one with eggs (probably 3) bacon and potatoes, and it was fresh and delicious.  I also added some of their salsas, and I have to say that was probably the best breakfast burrito I have ever had.  And I have had many.

I recommend Zlantro.  It has great, authentic Mexican food, at a great price.
