What can I say?  It's Chipotle.  There is nothing really special about this location over any other.  So if you like Chipotle then you know what to expect!

They do burritos and "bowls" (which are basically burritos without the tortilla for those worried about carbs).  The burrito is generously large, and the ingredients are flavorful.  They make it in front of you very quickly.  There are several options including chicken, steak, carnitas (pork) and barbacoa.  Several salsas to choose from (or you can mix...I usually do).

For fast-food this is top-notch.  Much better than McD's or KFC or something like that, about the same price range for a meal (maybe a little more), and very tasty.
