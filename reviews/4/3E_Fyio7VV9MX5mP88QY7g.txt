This was some of the friendliest service I've had in awhile. Our server was very sweet and did a great job with making conversation while not being overbearing. The chips served were pretty tasty, they serve a pickled pico-style along with a traditional mild salsa. 

We each had the chimichanga's with beef and they were excellent- very crispy served with guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, tomato, pickled veggies, rice, and refried beans. The dish was HUGE. We left completely stuffed. For a mere $25 we had two dinners, two drinks + tip so it was an incredible value.  I can't wait to go back and try their very reasonably price mojitos (under $5!) 

Enjoyed it and will be back again for sure!
