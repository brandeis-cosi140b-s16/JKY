I've been going here for at least 12 years. They have great, friendly service, really good sauce with a spicy kick to it. The cheese crisp is fantastic (so simple yet so satisfying) and the tamales and chimichangas are very tasty; vegetarian versions are more to my liking because the beef in the enchiladas is a little dry but the sauce is good. Oh, and please get the Albondiga soup! Clear, tasty broth and lovely meatballs (just too few of them is all). 

All of the food is about above average, but not too heavy like other Mexican places and for the price point ($10 for rice, beans, taco, tostada, and enchilada?!), it's verging on fantastic.
