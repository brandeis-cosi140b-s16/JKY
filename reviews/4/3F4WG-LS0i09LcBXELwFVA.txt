The experience was a good one.  It was a busy afternoon at Rubio's and we had a BIG order for 5 girls who were getting ready for a wedding. I stood in a line of about 4 people ahead of me and then, when it was my turn, I made a $32 order.  One burrito order was pretty much deconstructed (down to the whole wheat tortilla substitution) and then reconstructed.  But they got it all done in a sufficient amount of time and they did it all with a smile.  No attitude whatsoever.  

Everyone enjoyed the food and the salsas.  OH...a worker came out to spiff up the salsa bar while we were waiting too.  I love that with even a busy crowd, workers can work in some side cleaning.  That says a lot about the staff.  

Definitely hit up this place.  Better than greasy Chinese food or even greasy McDonald's.
