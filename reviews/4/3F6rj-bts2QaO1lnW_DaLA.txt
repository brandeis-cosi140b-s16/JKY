Place was clean and food was good like all the other Chipotles we've been to.  Staff was friendly.  

I wanted to come here for our short date last night, but my husband didn't care to.  He would've rather gone to Panda, but they were completely packed and way out the door.

We were in a hurry somewhat. Hardly anyone at Chipotle's, maybe 6-7.  Maybe a couple people sitting in the dining area.  San Tan is the one we usually go to, which is always packed, but we know they are always quick.

So we thought within 5 min or so, we'd be up.  Nope.  We stood in line about 20 min before even getting to start our order.  They had about 8 staff working.

The line moves at a snail's pace.  Actually last we with Pita Jungle packed inside we were able to dine there quicker than the sparse customers at Chipotle.  This caused us to almost be late for our daughter's karate event.

If you're in a hurry, avoid this place.  They r so slow.
