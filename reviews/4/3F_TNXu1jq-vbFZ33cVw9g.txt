We went here for a happy hour session with friends Saturday night. Our bill included 2 rounds of $4 happy hr. margaritas and beers, chips and salsa, onion rings, and steak skewers. We all ordered their taco trio deals. Kind of weird you can only order one type of taco per trio, but it was fine because each of the 6 of us ordered different types, and then "swapped tacos." I tasted the grilled fish, steak, and carnitas...all were great! They were just as tasty, or maybe even better, than any other tacos on Mill or in Scottsdale. The margaritas were drank quick, and were great! Servers were friendly, tenative, and were good about checking on us. A dust storm was close by and our umbrella wanted to fly away, so it was quickly taken down by staff without us having to ask. All in all, cool place to grab some margaritas and asy food. I'd go back when on Mill.
