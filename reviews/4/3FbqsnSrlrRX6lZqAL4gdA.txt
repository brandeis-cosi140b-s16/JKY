Cabo wabo deserves more stars! The patio is such a fun place to people watch and sip on margaritas! The food and service was really great too and a decent price for Las Vegas. The chefs lobster burrito special was on point and you can't go wrong with the fajitas! Also they have killer margaritas. The seating for the patio can get a bit crowded. But overall, I'd recommend grabbing a bite here if you're craving some tex-mex and checking out Bellagio fountains while you're in the area.
