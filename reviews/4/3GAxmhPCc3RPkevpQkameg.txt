In a lot of ways, El Toro is your typical Mexican-American restaurant--same options on the menu, same cheap prices, same piles of free chips and salsa.  The things that make it even more worth checking out:

-Great service, even in massive groups with complicated ticket-splitting and lots of different drink orders
-The fajita quesadilla is particularly delicious, only $8, and huge enough to eat half for dinner and half for lunch the next day
-Gigantic margaritas for cheap every Thursday!  Try the strawberry-banana, but they'll mix anything up for you.

Overall--not particularly authentic Mexican food, but definitely one of the better Mexican-American places in town.
