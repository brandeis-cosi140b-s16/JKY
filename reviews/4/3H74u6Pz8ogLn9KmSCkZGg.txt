I was craving a fish taco so my hubby and BIL drove to Glendale.  We discovered this place some years ago simply by accident and loved it.  The broiled fish taco did not disappoint.  If was fresh, hot and yummy.  Their pollo asado taco is also tasty.  They have a small salsa bar and give you chips with your order.  Service is quick and the price is excellent.
