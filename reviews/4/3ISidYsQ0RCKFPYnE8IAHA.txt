This restaurant is the best "garage" ever!  
Most of the staff is incredibly friendly and welcome you as you walk past. 

Decor is all moto... Shop rags for napkins, wheels for the base to booths, drop-light lighting, wrench chandelier, truck and motorcycle parts on the walls & ceilings, side mirror collage over sink basin, and the list goes on.  So very creative.    
Big screen TVs everywhere for the sports fans.   
The food is a mixed lot.  
First visit we ordered nachos... Thankfully only one order as they serve a HUGE amount.  (Seriously 1/4 sheet cake piled high). We chose the pork with prickly pear salsa and the meat was melt in your mouth perfection.   

Second visit I had the best hamburger that I've eaten in years.   No bun, but they do offer Gluten Free buns. Woohoo! Drag strip chicken was pretty good, dredged in corn flour, no wheat!!  Hubby had chimi, again like the nachos, the portion is HUGE.  ( good for a big dude )

The fries were undercooked and a little cold, but have potential.   

They were out of their "special" (cannot remember what it was that day).  Good thing they have plenty to choose from.   And GLUTEN FREE options.  Which is good for those of is with intolerance or mild allergies.   I hope they are successful and stay!!!
