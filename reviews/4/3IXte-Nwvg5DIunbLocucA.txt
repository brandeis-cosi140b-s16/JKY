Casa Del Sol serves up pretty good Mexican grub. It's not the most authentic joint but that can have its advantages. By this I mean a bigger menu, bigger portions, tons of cheese, and most importantly good drinks. They also have a great kids menu. For instance: You want to go out for Mexican and your younger children don't want to. No worries! They can get chicken strips or macaroni and cheese here. What a smart idea. Not something you will find at some of the more authentic joints in town.
