I saw the reviews for this place and decided to try it. The food was awesome and the service was really good. We ate outside next to the fire and had a really good waiter. The chips and salsa were really good. I would totally recommend it to anyone. I really loved the chile relleno and margarittas. Great food. Great atmosphere. Fun place to hang.
