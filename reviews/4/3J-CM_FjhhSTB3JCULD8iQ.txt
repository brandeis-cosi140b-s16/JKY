I grew up in NM, and this place has some great food that tastes a lot like home - Mexican food that has much bolder and better flavors than a lot of the other "Mexican" restaurants found around Phoenix.

I had the machaca enchiladas with red and green chile, and both chile sauces were excellent.  I'm tired of so many restaurants that don't have a green chile sauce but instead serve some green tomatillo stuff, and the New Mexican Grill was welcome relief with their sauce that is delicious.

The mild salsa was good, but I'd like to see the same thing with a medium or hot version.  The hot salsa was a more liquid-type of salsa which I'd give 3/5 stars.

Refried beans were 4/5, and the rice was slightly lacking in flavor, but still tasty enough I cleaned my plate.

I was very satisfied with the value here - good portion size for the price, and delicious.
