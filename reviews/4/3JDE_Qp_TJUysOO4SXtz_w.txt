In a town that's hard to find good Mexican food, Super Mex is one of the better choices.  The staff are nice and accommodating, the chips and salsa plentiful.  The carnitas are good but missing the "crusty" bits. The chili relleno was tasty. My family enjoyed their orders of tacos and taco salad.  I'll go back.
