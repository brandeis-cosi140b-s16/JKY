Having moved out to Chandler from Phoenix, I was pretty spoiled on good Mexican food there, so I had to find some places out here. This place is pretty decent. It looks very Mexican with the bright yellow building. You can't miss it. They have a bar area which is usually not in use during the daytime. I've eaten here 3 times so far. the first time I got take out. I always get the number 1, 3 carne asado taco plate. the second time the rice was overcooked and the beans tasted old, but the next time they were good. the tacos are always good, they put some special bbq sauce on the tacos as the owner pointed out to me. I do wish they had self serve fountain drinks, but other than that, as long as I can get some good tacos, I'm cool. Like this place.
