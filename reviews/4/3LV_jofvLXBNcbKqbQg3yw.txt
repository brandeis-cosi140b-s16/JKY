Carne asada burrito so big it's kinda daunting to try to eat all by yourself.  Luckily that is no my order, but my other half.  Lengua tacos to die for.  All fresh and made right there with all the sauce you can ask for.  Very funny stickers and art on the walls and there is a drive thru.  24 hour drive thru is also a blessing because who doesn't want Mexican food at 4am.  There is a lot more on is menu to order but as for right now I love the lengua tacos and Mexican coca cola bottles.   Decently priced also makes this place a must go to.
