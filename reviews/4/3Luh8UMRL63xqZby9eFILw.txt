This place is way out of the way. good parking.   It is beautiful inside and out.  Place was empty at 11:30 am on a weekday.  Service was good.  Food was excellent.  Everything was fresh and beautifully presented.  Service time was longer because everything is fresh and individually prepared.  Lunch prices were very reasonable.  The staff went out of its way to accommodate a group of 11 persons.  The AC was too much.  We asked for it to be turned off.
