Great atmosphere and great food.  Not sure what impressed me more  - the delicious food or the warm and friendly service.  Found Barrio Queen while walking around aimlessly  (I'm from out of town ) and was extremely pleased.  Tge fush tacos were hot, spicy,  and tasty.  Accompanied by a Dos Sequis Amber,  I had a perfect combination.  I'll definitely be back.
