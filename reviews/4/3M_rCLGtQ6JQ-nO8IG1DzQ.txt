Fantastic place! 
Great salsa bar, warm and crispy tortilla chips! 
Friendly service! 
Ordered 3 tacos. Shrimp, Carne Asada, Carnitas. 
Delicious (from what I could tell) homemade corn tortillas packed with fresh ingredients and delicious meats! Lots of flavor, very good meat. The Carne Asada could've been just a bit better, but I am spoiled as hell by the Mexican Food all over the Valley! A place I will definitely go back to if I am that far West!
