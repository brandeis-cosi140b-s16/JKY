I'm pretty sure this used to be another Mexican food place a few years ago, because I definitely had been in there before. However, it was before it was Mucha Lucha with its amazing glittery luchador murals and counter tops. The man and woman who helped me were both very nice and didn't look at me weird when I asked for cabbage in my breakfast burrito.
It's set up like a Subway or Chipotle, where you order what you want and they make it for you with the ingrediants you choose. Since it was still early, I got the carne asada breakfast burrito which included egg, beans, cheese, and whatever other fillings and sauces you wanted. it was pretty big and was served wrapped in foil with a handful of chips. I also got a Mexican Coca-Cola. A very filling, delicious breakfast for under $10. I almost didn't finish it! 
It seemed to be a favourite spot of local construction teams, so be prepared to share the spot with a crowd of loud, dusty guys. But that's also how you know it's got to be good!
