Let's examine this place on a number of differnet levels.

THE FOOD

I would call it above average mexican style food.  They did have an extensive menu with some authentic dishes.  I am only one guy so I tried a combo plate for a little variety.  The Chile rellano was actually pretty decent, not quite homemade, but very good.  The other diners in my group were all very happy with their food.  The entire meal was well prepared.

THE SERVICE

I think this is what seperates this place.  The service is very good.  It is fast with out anyone trying to hurry you up.  Plenty of refills and they remove plates, bottles, ect... promptly.  There seemed to be a sincere welcome felling - as if you went to persons home...

THE VENUE

This place has been in the same spot for some time.  It has a bar with 3 seperate dining areas.  It is plenty big enough.  It had a charm to it - they didn't over do it or try to hard.  Very homey.  The place appeared to be very clean too.  

THE INTANGIBLES

The restaurant was jam packed full of Mexicans.  I was even dining with Mexicans.  My logic is if the Mexicans like it then it must be good.  Not that they are culinary experts but they do know something about mexican food.  The place just has a good vibe to it.  It feels like a mexican restaurant.  Also, It is locally owned and operated.
