Hooray!

Luncha Libre have gone brick and mortar....and they're in my hood! They were my first official post-Scotland hangover meal this morning after I was re-christented at the Swizz and Bar One last night.

You'll find the same menu as their food truck, so I can now have my Steak and Bleu Dilla, with a side of chips and salsa, whenever I want!!! They also serve street tacos and luncharitas, and fresh churros for postre. They also have a small cooler with Mexican coke AND Fanta!!!! Yup, FANTA!!!! Orange AND grape flavor!!!!!!

They're starting smart with a tiny but cheerful spot with two tables, some counter space and a few sidewalk tables. Very cheerful place, with the same great yummy menu we've all come to love. Worth checking out!
