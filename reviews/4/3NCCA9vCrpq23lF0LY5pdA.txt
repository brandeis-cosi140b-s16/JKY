Not bad when you're looking for something healthy after only having the option of a sesame seed bagel with peanut butter on your hellish overnight stay in Columbus's CMH.  Not awful pricing either for airport food.  Tortilla is a little floury, and it's not strictly authentic mexican food, but it is probably your healthiest option here for the price.  I got guac extra on my veggie burrito.

And believe me - a big burrito is NOT what you want just before getting on a plane.  You'll end up passing out and wake up with angry people who have requested a seat reassignment.  Small burritos at airports rock.  What, you're going to save it in your bag for tomorrow?  Good luck with that . . .
