Food. Yum. Belly. Full.

Those were my key takeaways after I gobbled down a delicious burrito at lunch. My choices included: whole wheat tortilla, black beans brown rice, spicy salsa, and fish. Normally when I go after "alternative" tastes, they never come out the way I had hoped, but I came out on top with this combo.

The food was prepared quickly. Think of it like a Chipotle with a more diverse menu. Shrimp, Fish are options. Quesadillas, nachos and salads are on the menu here as well.

The restaurant was clean, the food was tasty. 

I should also mention that Coke Zero is available in the fountain. Another big plus.

I prefer this place over it's similar competitor: Chipotle. Just because of the menu variety. 

I'm done.
