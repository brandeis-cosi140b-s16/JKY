Chipotle takes the cake for me.  I like Chipotle better than Moes or Salsaritas for two reasons:   the spice on the chicken and the white rice.  (They also have brown rice but I am addicted to the flavor of the white!!)  All of the rest is normal - different heats of salsa and the usual toppings.  I always get the burrito bowl - the friendly folks that work there will walk you through the ordering process in case you are a newbie :-)

Most Chipotles sell beer - yay!!  This location is still working on getting its permits to sell it.  (Remember the 'Noon' Rule here in NC).  

This location is located on the corner of Central across the street from Target.  It is a small location with a patio and tables outside.
