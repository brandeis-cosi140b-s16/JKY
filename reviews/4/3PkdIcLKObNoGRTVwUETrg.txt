My review is from a dinner we had about April 23, (Taco Tuesday)  was excited to see that the old Arturo's was reopening from a place we have visited on Indian School rd.  The staff was super friendly and right on top of service from chips & salsa, drink refills, dinner being served and prompt return of the check.   Food was good and reasonably priced.
