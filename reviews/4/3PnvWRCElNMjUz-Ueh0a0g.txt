A no frills Mexican  taqueria with delicious food. I like the fact that they serve breakfast all day.The staff is super friendly and their prices are very reasonable.

I've tried a multitude of their dishes on separate visits, from the breakfast plates and burritos. They also have a  salsa and pico de gallo bar. The menu is very large and has everything you could possibly dream of in terms of Mexican food without making a hole in your wallet.

This morning, I had their egg, bacon and cheese burrito and it was scrumptious.! 

Their bathrooms are super clean,which is a plus in my book and last but not least, there is always Mexican music playing which gives the restaurant a nice ambiance and little feeling of being in Mexico!

Supposedly, this location is open 24 hours and also has a drive thru. Highly recommended if you are looking for a quality meal without breaking the bank.
