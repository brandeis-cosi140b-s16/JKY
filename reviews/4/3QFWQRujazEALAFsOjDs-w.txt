I don't eat Mexican food often though, if I had one of these places close to where I live, I would probably turn in to a burrito.

I'm talken lip smaken, melt in your mouth, wanna slap someone flippen DELICIOUS!! 

We got one order of there cheese nachos which was AMAZING!! I have not had nachos in years so, this was a major decadent explosion of cheesy goodness that feed the deep rooted cheese addict in me.   I also ordered some sort of Cheese Chicken quesadilla though, it was called something else- It was A Thick fluffy tortilla, stuffed with thick chunks of chicken with again, the most incredibly flavorful cheese I literally have ever had, all with some superbly fantabulous guacamole on the side....needless to say, I felt the size of a super burrito when I left.

This place really is addicting. I don't know what kind of flavor they add to there cheese though, it is any cheese lover's idea of heaven.

The overall appearance of the restaurant is nothing fancy and just a typical Mexican chain joint , the service is probably a hit and miss though,  the food.....you just have to try.
