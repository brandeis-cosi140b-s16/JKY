Don Tortaco always comes to mind whenever I'm hungry in the wee hours of the night. And surprisingly enough, I'm always craving this place while I'm 100% sober.

This is your go-to place when there's little to no options at night giving you good food at a reasonable time with a reasonable price... For Mexican food. My four stars is strictly based on my usual order: rolled tacos, regular tacos, carne asada fries/nachos and quesadillas.

If I want burritos, I'd go to Phat Phranks off of 2-15 & Decatur (they're not open 24/7 though) but I'll get into that in another review. As of right now, right around the block type food, this is the place. And it's right next door to a Neighborhood Walmart making your late-night errands run smoothly.
