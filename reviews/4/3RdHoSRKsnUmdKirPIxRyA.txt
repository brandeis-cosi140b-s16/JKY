My fave Chipotle location! This one gets pretty crowded so be wary.

I always get bowl here whether it is steak or carnitas with everything on it! The workers here do a great job with portions and are so friendly! Price is a bit steep for essentially the contents of a burrito in a bowl, but the quality and freshness makes up for it. They serve alcohol and soda as well.

Good, open seating indoors and a patio out front.
