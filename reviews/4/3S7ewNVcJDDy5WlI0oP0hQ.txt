My first trip to El Burro, my neighborhood's new burrito shop/taqueria, was this afternoon.  I won't say much about the speed and service, which wasn't the greatest in the world, because it's really only their first day open to the public.  They had a "soft opening" last night, and their full menu isn't even in production yet.

But it's worth waiting for them to work the kinks out because the food is FANTASTIC.  My husband ordered a carne asada burrito and loved it.  It was gigantic. I got the rolled potato tacos (wanted street tacos, but they aren't yet available), and they ended up being AMAZING.  I was surprised when I opened my take-out container and found four giant taquitos smothered in guacamole, pico de gallo, and cheese.  We also shared an order of chips and salsa.  Both are homemade.  Seriously, is there anything better than fresh, homemade tortilla chips straight out of the fryer?  I think not.  Heaven.  Their salsa is mild, with a cilantro-y kick.  I liked it, but ended up adding hot sauce.

Right now, this is pretty much take-out only, which is fine with me since it's a block from my house.  However, the inside of the restaurant is lined with bar counters so I think they will probably add stools eventually for an eat-in option, but even now, you could stand and eat at the counter if you wanted.

I am so, so excited to welcome El Burro to the neighborhood!  If you're on the north side, give them a try!
