I am just s sucker for a chips and salsa bar. This is the only location I am aware of with one.
Inside an ex McDonalds sits this Filibertos, on island in a decaying parking lot. The menu is standard for fast hole in the wall Mexican. This may not come as a surprise to my readers but I opt for the chili rellno burrito. I really like their take on it. It consists of the obligatory chili rellno but it is surrounded by guacamole and a tortilla, simple rich and oh so good.

As I stated before the draw of this location is the free chips at the salsa bar. The chips the usual well ground corn chips slightly warmed, but the free party really adds to the meal, on average I think I can add over 1000 calories for free to my lunch. 

Adding to the self serve fun this is one of the few locations with a soda fountain that you can access for free refills.
