TASTY spicy pork taco plate.
Chili Relleno was a little disappointing... too small of a chili inside the egg batter. The sauce was killer, though.

The chips were a little greasy.

The details were all very good, though. The salsas, the rice, the beans... all very well done.

I also had a little taste of their poblano mole... oh yeah... it's good!

The main thing here is probably to order the right thing... the menu is extensive and not all of it is perfect.
