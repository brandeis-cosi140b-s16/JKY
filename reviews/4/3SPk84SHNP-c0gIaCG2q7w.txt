My husband seems to eat at Roberto's on Decautur at least once a week. He usually orders the 5 taquitos and this time ordered the chili colorado. He said the meat was somewhat tough and overall lacked flavor. Luckily, he got a breakfast burrito for the morning so he had something else to eat. Maybe it's just this location with the not so great chili colorado. My father in law ordered the tortas and said they were great. They were so big, he got 3 meals out of it.
