Seth, our server was great.  Always checked in with us.  Made sure our drinks were always full.  

Salsa was a little weak (no kick) and chips were good.  Got the chimi dinner in enchilada style with shredded pork, just one word WOW.  Love the minor kick of hot (I am a WIMP, so to others it is probably nothing).  The shredded pork was real good.

Everyone ate their food happily, then after drinking for a couple of hours the munchies started.  We ordered the salt and pepper wings & habanero wings.  S&P wings were DAMN good.  Fried to gold perfection and the right mixture of salt and pepper on them.  Habanero wings kicks you in the lip, mouth, tongue, and fights you all the down the hatch.  If you like hot, then habanero wings are for you.  

We ordered the kings brownie explosion to top off the evening.  The warm brownies were SO GOOD.  The ice cream and whipped cream just added to the wonderfulness.
