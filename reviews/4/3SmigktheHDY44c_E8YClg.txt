My sister and I stopped in here for lunch for the first time. The employees were very helpful and knew the menu well. I asked for my veggie burro without a tortilla and they were happy to accommodate and it was delicious! They also informed me they don't use lard in their beans, which is a plus in my opinion.
The veggie burro was a lunch special item, it came with a drink, rice and beans, all for $5.50. They also gave us complimentary chips and salsa. I would definitely go back. I've heard good things about their fish tacos, Id like to try them next!
