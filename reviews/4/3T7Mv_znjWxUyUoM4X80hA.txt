A solid choice for great tacos, if you pick the right taco. The house specialty tacos really preform and reach that 5-star level. But a few of the standard taco's are uninspiring. 

I was very pleased with the drinks and starters.

 The service could use a little work, as I saw more than a few parties neglected. The seating near the entry way, where I dined, was a bit tight. 

But overall, I was very pleased.
