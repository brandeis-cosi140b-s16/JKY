This is for the new Glendale location- we've never been to the one across town. I'm definitely a fan of this place, and we'll be back for sure. This place fills the niche for good Mexcian food that isn't heavy and greasy. It was empty when we walked in but there was a steady trickle of people in and out. The waiter was extremely friendly. He explained portions of the menu to us, chatted a bit, and the service was prompt and polite. 
The salsa bar wasn't all that I'd hoped for but it was interesting. Lots of different salsas but many of them were spicy and I didn't really love any of them. Hubby did though so that might just have been my issue. The food, on the other hand, was delicious. Hubby had mole and it tasted like mole is supposed to taste. Like chili and chocolate and all sorts of yumminiess rolled together. I had an Arabic burrito which was much more delicious than it sounds. They happily made it without onions for me and it was awesome. 
Oh, and order the horchata. Trust me. They make it in house and if horchata tasted like this all the time I'd drink it way more often.
Parking is in the back and there is a surprising amount of space considering they're on the edge of downtown Glendale. I also appreciate that the parking area is VERY well lit.
