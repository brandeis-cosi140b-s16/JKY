I thought the food was pretty darn good, especially for the price.

I got 3 tacos (cabeza, al pastor y adobada) and a carne asada sope.  Wife got something very similar.  All that plus a beer for $16.  

The waitress was really nice, I mean service wasn't 5 stars but didn't expect it to be when you pull up to this joint.  Nothing to complain about except the smelly rags they used to wipe the tables next to us.
