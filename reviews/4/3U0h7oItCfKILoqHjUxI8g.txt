I go here at least once a week.

Amusingly, it's basically a Subway with Tex-Mex, but higher quality.  The meat is all organic which makes it actually pretty tasty.   They do a pretty good job at moving the line through too and never have an issue with custom orders (extra rice, extra corn, etc).

Always get a similar item, and regardless of where you go, most Chipotle's are similar.   The corn might be a little hotter in some places versus others, but that's about it.

Believe me.  You could eat here every day for weeks on end.   I have before.  And it's just.... so... yummy.
