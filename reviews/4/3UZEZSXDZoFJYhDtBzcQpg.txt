This place is so bomb!!!! But surprisingly there is never any people inside eating? Maybe I'm not coming during the rush but I'm not complaining at all. 

There baja fish tacos are like crack to me. SO GOOD!! There chips are addicting. Just the right amount of salt to go with there even better tasting salsa bar
