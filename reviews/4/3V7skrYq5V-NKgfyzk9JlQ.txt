I have to say I frequent this location once a week and for years I've never had one issue. The food is amazing. I originally was going to give 5 stars until they increased the prices. For that they only get 4 stars.

Pro-tip: Go inside and get a burrito punch card so that you can get a free burrito after buying a few.
