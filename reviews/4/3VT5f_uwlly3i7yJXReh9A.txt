for the latest yelp event, we were absolutely thrilled at the delicious food they offered. there were loads and loads of tasters, ceviche, guacamole, tostados, goat cheese? yes, goat cheese and it was good. 

my favorite was the shrimp gazpacho. it was cold and tomato-ey and had a quick punch to the taste buds with its heat. i also had the rice and beans sampler and that too was extremely tasty and filling. my drinks consisted of count em...2 skinny margaritas (gotta watch my figure!), and they were mighty powerful for a skinny drink. the crunchy big salt chunks were a nice addition!

i would come back for their regular menu based on how good their food was for the event!
