I love Chipotle. I know it's a chain and all, but they do what they do so well! In Northeast Ohio, where I'm from, the line will stretch out the door and around the corner.  Not so here in the Southwest, but that's to be expected, as there are more Mexican restaurants (pseudo and authentic) to choose from.

The fresh, organic ingredients at Chipotle are a real draw for me. But I admit, this is a "gateway "restaurant; when I'm falling off the raw/vegan/whole foods wagon, I come here because they serve fresh, organic, whole foods- so how bad can it be? But honestly, it's a slippery slope from here.  

What I love about Chipotle is that their chips taste fresh, their guacamole is the best of all the chain restaurant guacamoles I've tried so far, and they season their foods nicely so that everything is very flavorful. I feel like I'm getting a good deal for my $8. Their menu is small, but that's fine- a bigger menu may cause them to slack off on the quality. Can't have that!!  

I always get the Burrito Bol. It even tastes good the next day- just get the guacamole and sour cream on the side.
