Dear Mixteca,

How I love thee.  Our relationship started so long ago when I was only 16, and you were located on 43rd and Olive.  How far we have come since my lovely high school days.

I am proud to see that you have decided to move closer to me, sweetheart.  I am happy that we can now share the delicious treats that you provide.  Oh how I love your seasoned beef; I crave no other than your lusciousness...your salsa sure does spice up our nights.  I couldn't be happier of the cheapness of our dates...AMAZING.

Thank you so much for giving me the flavor and freshness that I crave in my life.  I know our relationship will continue to go on strong.

Love Always,
Rebecca
