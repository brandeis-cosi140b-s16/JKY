I usually don't like to pay for fancy Mexican food when I'm perfectly content with a fix from Roberto's or Amigos Tacos. But my experience at Lindo Michoacan made it all worth it.

I went with a party of ten (including two babies) and was seated promptly since we had a reservation. We were hoping to get seated where they have an amazing view of the valley but that wasn't available.

They were quick to bring warm chips, salsa and bean dip. You can seriously get full just from the chips. The servers continuously refilled our chips to ensure they were warm for us.Try the fresh guacamole! It is made table side so you know it can't get any fresher.

I ordered their shrimp enchiladas (over $18) and although it was good, I felt it was overpriced. Good thing I filled up on chips and their complimentary fideo soup.

I give this place 4 stars because of their excellent service. Our water was never less than 3/4 full. We were checked on regularly. And even though some people in our party came late and we ended up being there for three hours, we never felt rushed.

They have a live band which adds to the fun ambiance. I prefer restaurants where I don't have to yell to talk to the person next to me, but just know that's what to expect here on a Friday night.

Kudos to the staff at Lindo Michoacan for your attentive service!
