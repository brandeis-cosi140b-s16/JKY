Really nice food from an unusual restaurant that is both Mexican and Chinese. I went for all Mexican food - since can have Chinese food any time!

First dish was basically tortilla chips/nachos with cheese, peppers and chorizo. Tasted delicious. I also had a couple tacos. Not the hard crispy things you get in the UK but almost like savoury pancakes. Nice and juicy. I had one with pork and another one with a fish. However, I think they may have been some confusion as one taco came late and it tasted like pork - and not any sort of fish I  have had before.
