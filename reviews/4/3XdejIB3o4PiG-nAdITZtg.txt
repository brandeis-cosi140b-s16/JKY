First time ever coming here, in fact I never even knew this place existed, but when looking at the prices I was taken aback... $6 for a burrito, I say to myself. But nit eating all day I decide to "take the hit". Then I see why, the burrito was massive and almost forced me to use knife and fork. I got chicken with Brown rice. Though everything is in warming trays, the rice was fine, not dry at all, and the chicken was of good portion. It was a good choice. One I'll make again.
