I visited this restaurant as part of a civic group annual meeting in the private back room.  The meeting was slated to start at 7:00 PM Friday night.  Bitzee Mama's had all that I desired in a restaurant.  Delivery of my dinner was not delayed, the food was warm, quite good quality and well prepared.  Once I had eaten, my dinner plate was promptly taken away.  Traffic was low.  I can say I had no complaint and would recommend the experience and the establishment.
