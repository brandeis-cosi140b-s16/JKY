This place is super delicious if you have any craving for shaved ice (raspados). I used to drive 15 - 20 min to a different place for my raspados, but come to find out that they opened one next to the high school I went to and it's 5 min away!!  Definitely love the chamoyada. The only thing is that they close early when you're having a craving for it at 7pm. Melissa is a nice employee whom I've know for a few years, and she makes my raspados very deliciously.
