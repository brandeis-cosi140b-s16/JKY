OK, Cantina. WTF is up with your pricing? Buyer, keep an eye on what you're being charged!

First, NF and I come in and he orders a Basel Hayden. Or Bulleit. I forget which. Does not matter too much though. So, the girl isn't sure of the price, but says it's $6.50 or $7 and she'll go find out. It turns out $7 is the going rate. Unless you add ice. NF asked for ice and was told that there would be a 50 cent upcharge (which, granted, is still cheap.) He looks incredulous and then she says "All bars do this." No. No they don't. And he would know, since he has worked as a bar manager at several different places. Maybe all bars in Pittsburgh do this, but even that seems doubtful. Still, I could let this go.

Except.

During the patio opening celebration I bought a Jim Beam and coke on the patio for $5.90. Which is a weird price, but I didn't think much of it until I went inside and ordered the same thing. Inside I was charged $5.50. The patio apparently involves a pretty significant markup. And now I'm thinking of doing a cost comparison before choosing where to order.
