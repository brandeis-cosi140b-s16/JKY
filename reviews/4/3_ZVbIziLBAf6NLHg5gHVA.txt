Finally, this place has opened up. I didn't realize it had opened up already so I was pleasantly surprised when I was getting some froyo and saw people inside.  Plus it was taco Tuesday so even better. Chicken and asada were good, al pastor was amazing. My son had the quesadilla which you can't really go wrong with, at least to a finicky 3 year old. My only thumbs down is th at there are no juice or milk selections for the kids menu. Have to go with fountain drink options which I'm not a fan of. HOWEVER, I will say I was way impressed when the girl managing for the guys in the back to make him some fresh pineapple juice. Amazing service for them to even think of doing that for us. I would prob also like it if you had the option to get rice and /or beans instead of chips with the kids meal. 
Bottom line is, food is delicious, quirks are expected when a place just opens up so I won't harsh ice tea machine not working. 
Can't wait to be back for some yummy fish tacos
