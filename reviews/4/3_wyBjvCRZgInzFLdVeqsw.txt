I went here with some girlfriends last weekend and everything was great! We had great service and the food was amazing. Cocktails and drinks were tasty and if you go one must try the Black Cherry Sangria! 
Their staff was helpful and friendly and very patient as we took almost 2 hours to order!
The only complaints are that parking is a disaster and they are only open until 10p on the weekends which is very inconvenient.
