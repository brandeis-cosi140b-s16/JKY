I have eaten here 3 times now all of which have been exceptional. The cashier asked me if I liked spicy dishes which I do and recommended the #4 which is a green chili pork burro enchilada style. Amazing is all I have to say about that dish. 

Second visit I decided to explore the menu a bit and got a steak quesadilla and a taco, quesadilla was good taco was a bit over priced for what I got. 

Third visit was back to the #4...my wife got nachos which looked ok, not great but ok.

Needless to say given the value and the #4 I am pretty sure I will be back many times...planning on exploring the menu a bit more though.
