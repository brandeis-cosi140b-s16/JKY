Dude..    I keep looking for the Taco...    the one that I can write about in loving terms...    the one I can make my go to Taco...      still havent found it but these are good...    really good.    

This place isn't pretending to be anything its not...    its a little place...    4 tables...    right next to a gas station...     but what they do, they do darn well.

I should really say...    since I have bee reviewing tacos lately...     that I keep looking for the taco that comes close to the taco I had in Tampa Florida...   Place called Caiifornia Tacos to-go.    By far the BEST I'VE EVER HAD.    I think that there fish tacos could solve the middle east peace process....   ( Ok   I my like them too much...   my bad..    I digress)

Now Apache...    cool vibe...    The owner is there and he has a great sense of humor.    He led us throught the choices and we sat and got our food...      good...    really really good and at a pretty darn great value as well.    

Oh and another thing...   if you're close by...    you have them as a choice for delivery.   I cant tell you how many times I wanted somthing delivered, but didnt want Pizza or Chinese...     Yes tacos are now a delivery option.

Listen...   may not be a regular, but I will be back and really...    if your in the mood for a taco, just go...   you wont be dissapointed.
