After five years, we're back to Don Pedro for a late lunch on the weekend. It hasn't changed at all. My daughter and I ended up in one of the booths along the wall.

The food is still good and the portions are -massive-. The plate in the entryway is what you're going to end up with so be ready. I had the Deluxe Burrito and there was a ton of it. It might be hard to tell in my picture, but buried under that sour cream and guacamole is a large burrito stuffed with chicken.

My daughter chose the chicken fajitas and there was also a lot there. Only three tortillas, but plenty of chicken, onions and peppers.

Drinks were refilled. The queso is no longer a problem - it probably wasn't poured into a cold bowl so it stayed cheesy until our entrees arrived.

Service was quick. Table-side guacamole is available too.

If you're looking for fancier Mexican, you've found it. Don Pedro is a step above the usual Mexican places along Burrito Way.
