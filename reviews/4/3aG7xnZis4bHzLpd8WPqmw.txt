Pittsburgh is definitely not well known for its Mexican cuisine.  However, Los Cabos is one of the best and is certainly worth your visit. I've been back in Pittsburgh for a few months now, but tonight was the first time I had heard of, noticed, and tried Los Cabos.  Will I go back?  Absolutely.

At a friend's suggestions, I ordered the beef Chimichanga.  And a soda.  I was told that the Chimichanga was going to be huge, so no appetizers for me.  The staff was very friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be on the job.  Once we ordered and sat down, we were given chips and salsa to munch on while we waiting.  That  was a nice perk.  

Food arrived a plate or two at a time (there were 6 of us), but that wasn't a huge issue.  My food was last to arrive and when it did come, I was shocked at how huge my $7.95 Chimichanga was.  And man was it tasty.  I couldn't finish it, although it was begging me to finish.  Now I'm not only completely full and satisfied, but I also have lunch for tomorrow.  

Go try Los Cabos.  And order the Chimichanga.  Do it.
