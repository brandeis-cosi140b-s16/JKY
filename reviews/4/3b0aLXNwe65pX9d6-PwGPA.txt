Nom, nom, nom. I finally got around to trying Sloppi Jo's at the latest StrEATS. The wait for the actual food (post-ordering) seemed way long, but it was so worth it.

I had a difficult time deciding what to order. After much deliberating (hey, the ordering line was long too), I went with the green chile cheeseburger. OMG! It was pretty much the winner of everything I had at StrEATS. The flavors were so perfectly balanced. And having it wrapped in a flour tortilla so totally worked (I had some initial doubts).

So the green chile cheeseburger is a standard burger, topped with green chile and pepper jack cheese, and wrapped in a flour tortilla. The green chile was spectacular! And combined with the pepper jack, the flavors were popping and there was just the right amount of spice. It wasn't so hot it was overwhelming, but it was hot enough to remind you why spicy food rocks. And wrapped in a tortilla! Who would've thought that a burger wrapped in a tortilla would be so awesome (certainly not me), but it so totally was. Loved it!

But I can't give them 5 stars just yet as they definitely don't have the art of the food truck quite down yet. There were glitches, the wait seemed longer than it should've, and the staff weren't all that friendly and nice. (Sorry, but Slidin' Thru set the food truck bar pretty darn high.)

However, I am officially a big fan. And I can't wait to visit again and try some other menu items (though, admittedly, it will be difficult to order anything other than the cheeseburger as it was so good).
