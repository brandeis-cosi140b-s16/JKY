Pretty amazing Mexican food at the heart of Southside. 
This city definitely lacks authentic Mexican restaurants, and having seen reviews of La Palapa as well as tasted some of their items at the Yelp Halloween event, we decided to give this a try.
I was thrilled to know they have Mexican flavored soda (Jarritos). I got a order of guacamole with chips as an appetizer. My only complaint is that the chips were really oily!  But the guac was fresh and extremely flavorful. Then I got the enchiladas with green sauce for the entree. Oh man, I was so impressed! I absolutely loved the green sauce, which tasted so delicious and mildly spicy. The chicken was tender and flavorful. I really enjoyed this dish! The waitress was friendly and genuine! The place is BYOB, but there aren't a dearth of bars just around the corner. Overall enjoyed the experience and would go there again.
