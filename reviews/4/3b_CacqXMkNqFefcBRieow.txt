This is a great place for couples and families.  The prices were very reasonable, the food was delicious (and tasted authentic), and the setting was aesthetically pleasing.  The staff was exceptional, as was the services.  Our server always made us feel welcome and did a great job suggestive selling.

The drinks could have been a little stronger, but you can never go wrong with beer, which they had a great selection of.  I recommend for either a night out for dinner or lunch date with a pal.
