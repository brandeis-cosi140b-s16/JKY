Great taco shop - my husband's favorite!

We've been here a few times and on our second visit, the gentleman who I assume is the owner, says to me, "I'm so glad to see you again Senorita!"  He is always so warm and welcoming it's like going to a friend's house for lunch.  I know that's cheesy but sometimes a good meal is more about how you feel while you're eating it than the actual food itself.  

However, the food IS good! The menu is basically Roberto's and/or Fausto's but I think the food is cooked much better and tastes much fresher than the others.  My husband especially loves the rice and the tamales.  I love the rolled tacos and the chips and salsa (which is a pico de gallo loaded with cilantro, my FAVE).  We hit Rosarita's every couple of weeks and I really want to try their breakfast burritos as I hear they are delish!
