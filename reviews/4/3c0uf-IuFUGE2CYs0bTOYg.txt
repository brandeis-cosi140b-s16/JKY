The wait is over. I had been driving by this place for months waiting for the grand opening... Now wait no more.. hop off the 15 and come step into the ring with Northtown's new Taco Champion! Tacos El Gordo is simply the best taco in the Valley.

El Gordo tacos are flavorful street tacos that will run you only $2 bucks a pop! You have your choice of meats which include asada, chorizo, adobada, suadero,buche, lengua, tripa, & sesos . You can get everything on it which includes onions, and a red & green sauce. The corn tortillas are made fresh right before your eyes. Flour is also an option.

This is a popular joint that always packs a crowd. One thing to be aware of is that you can only order certain meats in certain lines. Look for the sign before you commit to a line. This can be a little confusing on your first visit. Once in line it's kind of fun to see how they prepare the tacos with swift precision and relentless repetition. 

Parking is a little tight and the lines are long at El Gordo, but it's worth the wait. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.
