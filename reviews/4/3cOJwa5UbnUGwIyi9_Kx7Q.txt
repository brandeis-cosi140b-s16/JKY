Not real complaints about this place, though, I wish you could buy a half order.  My husband and I always split one bowl as neither of us can eat a whole bowl.  Not a big deal, but if I went by myself, then I would need to take leftovers home, which, in this heat, not good to leave food in the car if you have errands to run.

So prices is my only thing.  You basically if you only got a bowl, you'd be spending in the $7-8 range.  For families, this can get expensive, if you include drinks, add guacamole, and chips.  But, that is a lot of food.

So, for our family of 5 today, we spent about $40, but that's only because my husband and I shared, but the kids did not.  Those little piggies.  j/k.

The place was pretty busy and it came in waves of busyness.  They seemed to be fairly organized and we got through the line quickly as did the other people.  

This place is located at the end of the San Tan Outside Mall by Barnes and Noble.  We've been here a few times in the past year and they are consistently good.  It had something for everyone, including my daughter's vegetarian friend.  Though, i think a vegetarian bowl or burrito should cost less than the meat ones or at least more less.
