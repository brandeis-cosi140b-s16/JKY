This small neighborhood restaurant is in an old run down building, and is kind of scary looking for most (I cant get my wife to go there) but they have really good food. Great carne asada tacos, with traditional cabbage and authentic salsas. Service is ok, they do serve beer and have a small dining room. Great place for lunch, much better than the filibertos chain.
