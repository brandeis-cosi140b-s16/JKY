Edit: You can't beat a good restaurant within walking distance of your home. You also can't beat the fact that this location doesn't have nearly the waits (if any) of it's southside counterpart. The food is excellent, the service is friendly, and it is spiffy clean. I love the green jalapeno/tomatillo salsa and the red chili burro enchilada style, but that is one spicy meal!

+1 for being close -1 for the firebomb it leaves in your stomach
