I've wanted to try this place for some time now, concept seemed interesting. I'm glad I did because I believe the nachos are worth trying. My family and I ordered the Thai chicken nachos, spicy buffalo chicken nachos, spicy chorizo pizza and steak quesadillas. We wanted to try a bit of everything. I would say the nachos were the best part of dinner. I didn't think the pizza and quesadilla were anything special. Loved the buffalo chicken nachos! I'd go back just to eat that again and try the different unique nachos as well. They also had a special on drinks that night (buy one get one of their Daddy's margarita & $1 off draft beers). Our waitress was also very pleasant and came back to check on us often. Only thing that was done wrong was our order of steak quesadilla came out without any meat in them, but it was fixed immediately and we also got to keep the plain cheese quesadilla for free. They also have tv's all over the restaurant if you're looking for a good sports bar. Overall, I'd say I had a good experience and I'd definitely go back.
