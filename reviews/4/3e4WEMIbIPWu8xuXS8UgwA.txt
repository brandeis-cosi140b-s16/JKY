So I actually tried Burrito Express on a Sat morning with my brother and my daughter, my daughter was buying (she has a job now and can afford to take her mom out haha) and told me I needed to try this place, so we did.

I had a breakfast burrito, it had ham and eggs but also threw in some chorizo into and ask the guy to hit it with some red chile sauce, and don't be shy, while it was cooking and he did! Man that was a kick butt breakfast burrito!! 

So that made me think um wonder how their lunch time burros are. So I went to check them out at lunch time and ordered me a steak and salsa burrito, it had steak, cheese, lettuce, and salsa! I made it combo so it came with beans and rice.

While I was paying the guy asked if I wanted hot sauce, and I said yea  both red and green, (sn: their green sacue is really good! Def do try it) and he said one of both, I said more like 2 of both ( really I wanted atleast 3 of both, I like my food packed with heat!) he said can you eat them all.....pls he does not know who he is talking to,,bring on the heat baby! I can handle it!

So I paid and was getting ready to walk out and go next door to Starbucks and he said do you want your food, I was like wow its ready? He said its not burrito slow, its burrito express, too funny.  I like people with personality!  And guess what!! This place delivers!!! How freakin cool is that!! 

I think I have found me a new little joint and ready to try the rest of the menu out!
