I have heard that Cafe Rio was a decent place to eat and Favored by many of my friends and coworkers so on a whim and an empty stomach I stopped by.  The place is about as close to a Chipotle Restaurant as you can get literally there's a Chipotle right next door. The concept is a copy as well but that's not a bad thing and if it works go for it. But the Chipotle style is not why I came I came for the food and can see why so many people like this place the food is fresh and it's a lot an d for the price mine being about $12 it's not bad I was a little disappointed though that they didn't have a brown rice option and for that reason I am not going to give it 5 across the board just because I think that people should have a healthier option. All in all it was good and I will be back
