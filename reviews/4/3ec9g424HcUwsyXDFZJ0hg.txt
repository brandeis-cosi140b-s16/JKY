The service here was great.  I say that because we arrived here about 10 minutes before closing, on two occasions in the past 6 days.  Even though they were already cleaning up and putting things away, the employees still managed to get us some food and send us on our merry way.  The reason we arrived so late is because we were on a road trip and by the time we got into town, all we wanted were some salads and some chicken.  Each time we were here, we ordered about 5 salads and a lot of chicken (ordering for 10 people).  Never once was there a grimace or a sigh or an odd look as if to say "don't these customers know we are closing soon."  

Thanks El Pollo for putting up with us and feeding us right before closing time!
