More like 4.5 stars...but Pretty dang good!! I got the 5 mini tacos carne asada with an horchata. And my husband got a California burrito. Both were excellent! He absolutely loved his California burrito. After hearing so many raving reviews about it, we were not disappointed.
Only 2, slight negatives. It wasn't AS cheap as I had expected and hoped for. We were looking for a quick and cheap meal. But still, it was a TON of food!
And the other is that there were some kinda gross chunky, plasticy feeling bits of fat (just a few) in my steak in the tacos. But I am also picky when it comes to that.
Over all, definitely will be coming back. 
The service was also kind and quick :)
