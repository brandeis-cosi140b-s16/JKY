A negative review of Someburro's can only come from the mind of the clinically insane.  Their food is always superb, but most importanly, it's consistent.  It's impossible for me to eat here less than twice a month, so I must maintain an intense workout regimen to offset the calorie onslaught.  I would drink the hot sauce by the gallon if not for fear of liquefying my gastrointestinal system. Having a rough day? A Pollo Fundido or Rod Burro can turn just about anyone's frown upside down in a hurry. The owners have carefully and slowly grown the brand, careful not to compromise quality or consistency.  Bravo for your many years of excellent restaurateuring!
