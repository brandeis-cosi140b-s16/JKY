The food was delish,  but after asking if they offered gluten free chips and/or tortillas the world shuttered and they had no idea as to what I was referring to. Four people later, including a supervisor on duty and we finally got a less than definite answer.
Thankfully, there was a lady in line behind us that DID know.  Good Grief!  Learn what's in your food people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The only reason you're getting 4 stars is because the food is bomb!  Customer service was crap.
