I really like this place and have been there about 5 times now. I love the fact that you get free chips with 2 salsas & bean dip when you arrive. I typically order vegetarian dishes so I can't comment on the meat dishes. I have thoroughly enjoyed their cheese enchiladas and their rice & beans get 10 stars!
