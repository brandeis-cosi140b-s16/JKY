I'm a taco man, and tacos el gordo is a great local favorite. It's not slap yo mama good, but it doesn't disappoint if you need a quick meal, or just something to settle you from a long night of drinking. Tacos are $2 and lines to get food are separated by whatever meat you want. This location isn't as busy as the strip location thankfully but it does get packed at certain times. The downside of it not being in the strip is that it closes earlier. 
If you're hanging downtown and need some dank Mexican food then this spot is perfect for you. The tacos are quick and good.im not a particularly big fan of their quesadillas and  The nachos are middle of the road, but somehow the nacho fries are off the chain and probably their best item. It's something that I would recommend sharing because they are big and filling. They also have good jamaica and orange bang if you're into those drinks.
