it's fast and greasy, and i eat here once in a blue moon when i'm up way too early on a weekend for home-improvement, on my way to lowes or the depot. 

quick and cheap, and the simple egg and cheese breakfast burrito keeps me full for about 3 days (but i never poo in those 3 days either, so it's probably not that healthy ).
