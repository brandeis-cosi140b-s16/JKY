When in Scottsdale AZ on the corner of Scottsdale road and Shea you will find this place and not be disappointed . I had the Grande Tostada loaded with Carne Asada,
Warm beans and all that goes with a Tostada. The Margareta's are top notch and not watered down. Give it a try--it's well worth the trip.
