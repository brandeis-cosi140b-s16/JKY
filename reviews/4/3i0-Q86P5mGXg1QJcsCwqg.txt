This is a great Mexican fast food joint! The establishment is very clean and is always well kept. 

Food is great! Anything carne asada is my favorite here lol (burrito, taco, quesadillas, nacho, fries, etc) It may not be on the menu but if you ask they will make anything with carne asada. 

Another plus is that they are 24hrs so when ever you have that late night craving this place is the spot! Especially after a night of drinking, this food will help you sober up.

Fast food prices and they also have several specials through out the week such as $3.99 chicken burrito combo on Monday etc.
