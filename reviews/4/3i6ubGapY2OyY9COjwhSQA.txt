I couldn't quite imagine Mexican food and Asian food together but it was so good! Lots of great options and you can mix and match to your hearts content! Open cafeteria type seating so it's not the best atmosphere and it can get loud but the food is great for a casual lunch or dinner and the portion sizes are large.
