Surprisingly fun and affordable mex place on Mill Ave. 

My boyfriend and I wanted to eat a different mex food than usual and he thought of Fuzzy Tacos since I hadn't been there.  

I had the fajita chicken and veggie taco both w/ corn tortilla. My boyfriend ordered the pork, fajita chicken and beef tacos with flour. 

The pork taco was by far the best! All the tacos had a garlic sauce, melted cheese and feta cheese +fresh lettuce and tomato. I know the feta cheese is kind of unexpected in a mex place, but it actually works perfectly- also I am a fan of saving calories!! *Lame I know... 

I had the margarita and my boy had the beer. Both served in a cold glass, a BIG cold glass. The margarita had a fun taste and was not too strong, which I like. PS. I asked the bartender not to make it strong, because I was driving. 

Also, everything was served with a smile and the cashier and bartender checked up on us a few times. The place looked very clean. 

Happy hour margaritas are $1.00 off (around $4.50) and huge!!
