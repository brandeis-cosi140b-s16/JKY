Of all the unassuming Mexican "taco stands" in Phoenix, this one takes the cake... or uh.. el pastel.. as it were.

There isn't much to write because there isn't much to this place.  So let's keep this simple.  

Call ahead and order.  Pick it up.  Pay with cash.  Take it home and enjoy the food.

And enjoy it you will.  I'm a fan of the beef tacos but I'm positive you'll find something you like.  Take my advice: Get some of that red sauce.  I swear they put crack in it.

Please don't go here expecting anything more than a run down building that churns out some of the best tasting Mexican food in town.

If they wanted to deliver this food in the setting of something like Gallo Blanco they could.  But let's cut to the chase, the food is the best.

And that's all.  Thanks.
