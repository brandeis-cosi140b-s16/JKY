Delicious start to finish. Extensive menu to choose from. Probably the best fresh salsas I have had at any restaurant--flavorful without overpowering spice.
 The tamales my daughter ordered were especially delicious. My wife raved about the chile relleno (non-battered). The house margaritas were excellent, and the 3 dessert special totally completed a wonderful dining experience. Service was prompt, efficient, and friendly. We will be going again.
