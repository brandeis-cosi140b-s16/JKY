It was a pleasant surprises. We ordered a variety of tacos, burritos and fajita. The chips and salsa to start was warm and spicy. Our tacos were delicious. I specially liked my corn tortilla. The white tortilla wasn't as good. Every taco option they had was juicy and delicious. My fav was the beef. Will sure go again!!!
