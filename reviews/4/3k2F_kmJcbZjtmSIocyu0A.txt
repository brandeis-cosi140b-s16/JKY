This is such a nice getaway from the pretentious, overpriced Old Town places crawling with posers. 

Hands down the best margarita in town. Nice happy hour with good drink specials. Overall, nice ambiance, good music and not too loud. 

The food is pretty good too. Good soups, nice apps, (tres hummus plate is very good - veggies instead of pita is a nice, healthy touch). Arizona fire corn is unique and delicious, and the sweet potato fries are a winner.

For the entrees, if you like fish, the Pescado Veracruz is very flavorful. Also, the sonoran veggie wrap was good- but DRY, which is too bad because the sonoran sauce is delicious. Here is a hint:  you need to put it on the whole wrap, not just on the last bite! I must say I was looking forward to the Rocky Point Pizza and was a little disappointed. I expected shrimp on the pizza, not shrimp flavored puree. It was still good, but not special.

Finally, this is just a nice place to chill out at the bar after a long day without obstreperous music and irritating patrons.
