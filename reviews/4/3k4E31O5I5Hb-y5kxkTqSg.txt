The food at this location is fresh and the service is good - their rolled tacos with guacamole are great and the horchata is not too sweet. 

They are open 24 hrs and have a drive thru.

 The downside is that it takes a really long time to get your food -- you may be waiting up to ten minutes or longer for a small order.. Even in the drive thru. But on the plus side, you can be sure that your meal was made to order and was prepared specifically for you
