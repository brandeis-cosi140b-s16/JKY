From  all  the  Taco  Bells  that  I  know  I  feel  that  this  one  is  the  one  with the  best  customer  service.   I  have  been  here  many  times  and  have  to  praise  the  employees,  If  something  goes  wrong  this  location  will  make  it  right.  I  have  always  been  under  the  impression that   they  really  care  about  customers  (and  I  am  not  a  big  fan  of  fast  food  chains).
