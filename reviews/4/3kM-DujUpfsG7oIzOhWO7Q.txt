Coming from San Diego, my expectations for Mexican food in Vegas were not high.  We came here because we were staying in the hotel and I was pleasantly surprised. 

Our meal consisted of steak enchiladas and chicken flautas.  The enchiladas were super yummy and the flautas were the perfect complement to my massive hangover.  Food was cheap and the only annoying thing was our pushy up-seller server.  NO I don't want to hear the whole story of inventing the margarita, NO I don't want a $20 souvenir glass of beer, but she just kept trying.  Not a deal breaker though.  

This place is not a dining destination, but definitely does the job if you happen to be hungry and in the vicinity.
