Long time customer of SM. I love their chips which are giant fried corn tortillas. Fresh salsa always. I'm in love with their garlic cream sauce on their combination plates. I'm a Texan, so I'm all about the ground beef enchiladas. They are awesome here! 
My absolutely favorite is their grilled veggies. I'm not a girl that usually goes straight to the veggies but the way they saut√© their squash and onions is amazing. I'm always trying to repeat it. They also have a separate counter for the take home customers. Grab a burrito at night and take it home for lunch the next day. Nom nom nom! It will be possibly two lunches!
