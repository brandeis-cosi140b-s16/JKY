I've visited this restaurant several times now so it certainly has that "IT" factor that keeps ya coming back for more.  I typically come in the evening times so its usually fairly busy but never to where my date & I have to wait to be seated. In face we've managed to get the same exact booth on every single visit (what are the odds of that LoL) The staff is really good about letting you know what drink specials are offered as well as food to recommend. My date has always been a huge fan of the "unholy guacamole" (and now i'm a fan too) which is freshly prepared right at the table side to make sure it's just like you want it. The classic margarita is solid but the grapefruit version wasn't all that tasty (or was just mixed poorly) so drinks maybe hit or miss there. The main course usually does not disappoint, I have been experimenting with various tacos, the traditional seems to go better with the hard shell, but the soft shell works better with the more exotic choices on the menu. The meals are filling and haven't been able to muster up room for desert but they do make sure to offer it to you if you desire it. The atmosphere is pretty lively, they have a patio area if you choose to dine outdoors and there are also plenty TV's locked in on sports if you want to catch a game. I'm looking forward to hanging out here Cinco De Mayo or really anything you are in the mood for a good mexican dish, I would make my way over Paco's pronto!
