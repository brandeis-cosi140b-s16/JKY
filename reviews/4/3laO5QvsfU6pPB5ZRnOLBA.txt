This place is a very solid four. Our service was exceptional. The salsa bar is great. It's hard not to give it five stars since it's so affordable, but the food won't wow you. When was the last time you would seriously give the food at a Mexican restaurant five stars? You can't go wrong at this place. The value in unbeatable for this area of North Scottsdale.
