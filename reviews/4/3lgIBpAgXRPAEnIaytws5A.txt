So, Gallo Blanco, the popular restaurant that opened a few years ago and was debuted in the cover of Phoenix magazine during their 25 Best new restaurants, stopped operating in the Clarendon Hotel.  However, a modern Mexican restaurant does operate in its place and is doing a very fine job.

I have stopped in here for drinks and come for a couple meals since GB closed.  My favorite thing on that menu has to be the other-worldly delicious flapjacks!  Oh my word.  I never would have expected this at this establishment.  Those things taste better than any pancake I have ever had in my life.  And bonus... breakfast is served all day at this restaurant.  

The tacos are good too.  I love the SOBE boutique feel of the hotel.  

I had a few custom crafted cocktails and the bartenders did a pretty good job with my list of favorite ingredients.
