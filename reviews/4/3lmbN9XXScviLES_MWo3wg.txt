mmmmmmm tostada. i didn't realize how delicious it was until i finished 80% of my salad in there. then i broke off a piece and fell in love. it's so crispy/buttery/savory. i loved it!! 

the burritos and taquitos were very disappointing, though. the rice, and apple sauce was NOT enjoyable either. 

this place deserves 4 stars because of the condiment bar and tostada. free pico de gallo and salsa? yay!!!!!!
