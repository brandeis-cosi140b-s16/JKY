Well crap... here I am, in Tempe, on Mills, and I'm just looking for a place with good food and drinks.  There are plenty of places to go to, but here it is, Canteen... okay, I was attracted to the pretty awesome sign. 

The place is a mix of lounge, restaurant and bar, all in one.  

I came here for the food, after being seated by a friendly/lovely server, it was clear that this place was filled with young people, with smiles all around.  I got the pulled pork sandwich; my buddy got the Angus burger.  Classic fare, for my food, the pork sandwich tasted right, with plenty of sauce, juices and flavors, there was a finely cut slaw on it, that balanced out the flavor.  The meat was cooked perfectly; the only ask could have been slightly better bread. 

So this is a shorty review, but if you are in need of food for a reasonable price, that is good, over conversation, and drinks, you might want to consider this one of your stops.
