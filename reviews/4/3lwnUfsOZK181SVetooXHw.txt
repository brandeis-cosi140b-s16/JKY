Surprisingly good little tourist spot on the way through the Apache Trail,  this historic landmark was once a stop for the stagecoach.  We expected bland and standard fare, but got good quality fast food and good service.  I give it 4 stars for these points I note, and recommend you stop if you want a quick bite in a cool spot.
