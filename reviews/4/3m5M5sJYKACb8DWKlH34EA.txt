Ordered take out from this place a few days ago. I had the beef enchilada, beef taco with rice and beans. My husband had the shrimp enchiladas with rice and beans. The beef enchilada meat was seasoned perfectly as were the refried beans. The beef taco meat however didnt seem to have any seasoning. The meat was good but just no flavor really. I would assume they would use the same seasoned shredded beef for the taco that they used on the enchilada but I guess not. Either way the food was very fresh and flavorful minus the beef in my taco. Prices were good for the amount of food you get. Service was a bit bla, but I was ordering take out anyways. Will definetly return to try out the rest of the menu.
