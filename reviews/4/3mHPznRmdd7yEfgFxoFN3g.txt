Viva Tee Pee! 

Was driving down the road and said " I gotta try this place" and I must say what a gem.  Not disappointed at all... The buildings a little rustic but it's a 50 year old establishment , it just leads to the character of the place.

All 3 of our meals were quality and would highly recommend to anyone desiring Mexican food to stop in.  

Don't listen to the haters , it's all good!
