I've been to Tortilla Flats several times in my life.  Both on a Harley and a vehicle. On my last trip we took the Apache Tl down and stopped at TF for some gelato.  Prickly Pear gelato that is!  Wow, awesome.  We also had a piece of fudge.  Also good.

After getting our gelato we walked around the building of TF.  I've heard that this place has burnt down several times and had to be rebuilt.  I have been inside the restaurant a while ago, and their burgers were great.  If I was actually hungry I'd go inside to order one.

Our stay didn't last long though, after touring the building, we finished our gelato and made our drive back to Phx.   

One last thing, the drive is long, and twisty, but it's very beautiful and worth it to come down here.
