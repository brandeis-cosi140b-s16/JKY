Best chips and salsa - hands down.  Jalapeno bean dip is excellent.  The service was great, they made special orders for us with no problem.  They are not cheap, but you get quality food and good service.  If you want cheap, go across the street to Tacos Jalisco.  I have also heard that they have really good margaritas.....hope to try one soon
