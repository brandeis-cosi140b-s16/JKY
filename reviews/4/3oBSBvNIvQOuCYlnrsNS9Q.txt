Located in another unassuming strip mall in Mesa, there's Matta's. It's relatively easy to spot. When you walk in you order at the counter and you're then escorted by a hostess to a free table. You get your own drink and they bring you chips and salsa. 

I ordered the special shredded beef taco plate (forgot the name) but the shell is deep fried and very good. It was near perfection, the beef was fantastic and moist and the rice and beans were great. The place was packed on a Friday night. Fifteen minutes after we arrived there was a line of 10 people waiting for tables. It appears to get busy but they bring the food out so fast, you more than likely don't have to wait very long for a seat. The salsa is also great and just the right amount of spicy which is so important. 

My date got the ground beef tacos and while it was good it's no shredded beef. I wouldn't recommend it, that's something that can easily be made at home. Shredded beef is always where it's at.
