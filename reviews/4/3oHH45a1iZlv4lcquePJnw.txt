We were first timers to El Pollo Loco. It was actually really good for a fast food place. The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 was the amount of shrimp on the Chicken Shrimp peas and sausage bowl my husband ordered. There were 4 small shrimp. I would've given it 5 stars for mine. I ordered the mexican cob salad, the dressing alone was great; but the difference salsas they have on their bar were all good. :-) The staff were all really friendly! It was a great change of pace!
