La Tolteca has become our go-to Mexican restaurant near Madison.  The selection is fantastic with great prices especially lunch specials.  Their hot salsa is fresh, hot and tasty - sometimes you eat it until your meal comes and your tongue burns the rest of the meal.  The cheese sauce for the chimichanga is very good.  The cheese dip is very cheesy and the quesadilla cheese is tasty!

The service is second to none.  They are so friendly and responsive.  Also the food comes out with urgency even when it's busy.  

This place I recommend to everyone because it's good.
