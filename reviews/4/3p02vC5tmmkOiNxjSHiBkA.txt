This is a favorite lunch spot for me. You can customize the veggie burrito to be vegan and it's not bad. I would give the burrito itself 3 stars, but you get unlimited chips and salsa from the salsa bar for FREE and who doesn't love free unlimited chips and salsa?!

On a few occasions they have goofed up the order so vegans beware, more beans would be nice in the burrito but overall it's decent and something different compared to heading to Chipotle, Rubios or Baja Fresh (plus, these guys are local!). 

They have a nice patio for when the weather is accomodating and enough staff and seating so that at lunch time service is always good and speedy. Give it a try.
