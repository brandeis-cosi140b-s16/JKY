Even on the nights with drink specials, they definitely do not skimp on the tequila in their margaritas. Every drink I've ever gotten from there has been on a little on the strong side. If you don't usually drink, you may want to ask them to go a little easy on you. For a little bit extra, you can also get top shelf tequila. Most restaurants use the cheap stuff, but La Fiesta has a large bar with many options.

All of their entrees have been really good so far, but I have only sampled 1-2 things. My boyfriend always gets the same thing, their 'Burrito Loco'. It's a huge burrito with steak, chicken, cheese, refried beans, veggies, and it has cheese on top. It is a monster amount of food for a very reasonable price. All of their entrees are in the 7-8 dollar range, and you get a huge plateful of food. I always have leftovers. 

The staff is always very friendly. My drink never runs out and our chips and salsa are constantly being topped off. If you come in for friends for drinks, a lot of the time the manager will give a free appetizer to the table for you to snack on with your margaritas. 

It's not the best Mexican I've had, but all the entrees are pretty tasty and large for the price.
