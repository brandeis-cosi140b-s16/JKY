Came here on Friday night (around 6pm)........should have known better and made a reservation. Since the Eagels were playing that night, Vida was slammed! Without a reservation, it was an hour and a half wait. We had other plans for the evening, so we decided to see if we could grab two seats (or heck, one would work!) from the bar. No such luck. I felt bad cause there were many couples, like us, hovering around the bar just waiting for one of those coveted seats. No joke, we literally stood behind these two women sipping their beers for almost 45 minutes. Probably, two of the most slowest beer drinkers I have ever met....but I digress.....Anyways, we soon discovered that the wait to sit outside wasn't very long and we put our name on the list. We were seated outside (wasn't too cold....they had a heater out there but it wasn't turned on).

We ordered a bucket (5 beers) of Coronas and some guac. I really really love guacamole.....like, it's an issue. They have some fantastic guac. Nothing truely beats the guac I make, but this is a close second. We also chose to split a burrito meal. We were bar hopping that night and figured we didn't need two meals. Man, so glad we split. The serving was huge!! The burrito was delish. The grilled corn as the side was so good! 

All in all, I would have given this place 3 stars, but the food was so good it made me forget about standing behind the slow beer drinking women! Since we walked here, I can't comment on parking. We have been here numerous times in the past and will continue to return.
