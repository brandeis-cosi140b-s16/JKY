Wow,  new place in town is giving every other Mexican place a run for its money.  

Carlitos is quickly making a name for itself and its here to stay.   It's small so tables can be hard to come by, but that just tells you it's worth the wait or hell just get take out cause it's that's good.  

They not only have some of the best street tacos in CG, but some of the best I've had including the Phoenix area.  The carne asada is very good. Not chewing or full of fat or greasy.  The salsa is fresh and a great addition to whatever you order.  

The service was excellent as well. Vey fire fly and happy to bring you more chips and salsa. 

Why go on a juicing diet when there are tacos this good in the world?
