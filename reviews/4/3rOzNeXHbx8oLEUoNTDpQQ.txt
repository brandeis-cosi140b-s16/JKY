If you have kids this is not the restaurant for you. The flavors are way to complicated for a simple pallet.  That being said, my husband and I loved it! The atmosphere is warm and cozy, the chips hot and fresh and the salsa hot! I had the lazy tacos everyone at the table tried to steal them from me.
