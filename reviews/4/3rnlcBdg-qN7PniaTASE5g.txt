My waitress "Severa" was polite and prompt. 

They offered mild & spicy salsa. The only difference between the two was the "spicy" one was more watery. Not chunky like a poco de gallo. They did have a nice flavor. The chips were just chips nothing special.

I ordered the Prickly Pear Margarita. It had a great flavor.

I ordered the Achiote Pork Street Tacos. They tasted great bit were very small. They tasted great. They were served on what looks like a "wonton" stand. That tasted good as well. The quantity of meat is half what is pictured in the photos. I'll include both.

The black beans were just normal black beans. There was a pile of cabbage larger than the tacos. I ate some, as I was still hungry after eating everything else.

It looks like i would be leaving hungry, so I decided to order a flan.

The flan was ok. It was not a five dollar flan to match its price, but it was ok.
