It's Cinco de Mayo and the team is super disorganized.   The service is always hit miss but the food is excellent.   No happy hour on this holiday.  Boo.  This is the first time I have ever had food come out before anything else. The people next to me have been here much longer and they had to ask twice for their beer.  Very unusual.
