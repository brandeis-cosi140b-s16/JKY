I loved the Barrio Queen! Fabulous patio, super cool bar area inside, and a quirky, fun restaurant. This is the kind of place you can come with a group of friends, or just one really good one, order some margaritas, some tacos, more margaritas and spend the afternoon... Yes, our waitress was NOT good during our visit, but the waiter in our section more then made up for her short comings. And no it's not the most authentic Mexican resto around. But it's in a great location right off the canal in Old Town Scottsdale; all in all, I had a ton of fun and will definitely come back again.
