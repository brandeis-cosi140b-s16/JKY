I love CHIPOTLE! It's like my favorite fast food spot.  Too bad it isn't the healthiest spot, don't be deceived by the fresh Veggies! LOL, the rice and the burrito's push you at almost 700 calories....BUT I FIND IT WORTH IT! hahaha!  When I order, I usually get a salad with steak, tomatoes, extra corn, and hot sauce.  Take the lemons for the iced teas and squeeze that baby all over your salad, TRUST ME! It's delicious! haha. 

I love the atmosphere of this place, I have yet to receive any bad service from here.  Everyone's so nice to me.
