I saw this business while riding around on my motorcycle.  It looked really inviting, so I wrote down the cross streets and came back the next day with a guest.  I will start out with the bad - the service was just adequate.  Granted, it is a newly opened business, but we were the only ones and we had to ask for some more salsa and my water never was refilled.  OK, now to the great part - the salsa is among the best I have ever tasted.  It is not too hot, and is a pallet full of delightful spices and flavors.  I had a taco and enchilada plate - some of the best enchilada sauce I have ever tasted - definitely very fresh.  Beans and rice were fabulous as well.  If they don't change the recipes and improve the service, this restaurant is sure to be a hit.
