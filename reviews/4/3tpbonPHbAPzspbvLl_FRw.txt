I have NEVER been here when the weather was warm enough to go out onto the fabled patio.  Am I missing something?  How awesome can a patio be?  I'm sure I'll make my way there eventually, but for now I can only imagine the wonders said outdoor patio holds.

Round Corner Cantina is pretty good indoors too.  My relationship with Round Corner Cantina is simple & pure. If I'm breathing, then I want tacos.  They have good tacos, and they'll bring tacos to my table in a friendly fashion.

They've got good cocktails, good beer, and I think they are reasonably priced.  They have fun drink specials.

I like coming here for food, I don't know if I'd come here to hang out because I feel like I'm too old for their crowd  ...although their lack of lighting could help me blend in.  In the one back room, its really dark.  

So if you're on a date with someone who is not exactly a feast for the eyes, take them here.  There's tacos and it's dark.  Your situation will immediately be improved 100%.

tip:  this place is ALWAYS packed.  If you LOVE to sit during happy hour, I recommend getting here early to stake your claim to a seat.
