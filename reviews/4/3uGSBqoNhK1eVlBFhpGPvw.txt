Best authentic Mexican near where I live = clutch.  I've had the carne asada, the chips and salsa & their breakfast burritos.  All of which I recommend and will be getting again.  The service is great and the ambiance is what you want out of a Mexican restaurant.  Best time to hit this place up due to my schedule is the weekend, which I'll be doing as long as I live near South Mountain!
