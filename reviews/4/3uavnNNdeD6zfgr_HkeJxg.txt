Hmm Mexican or Chinese food...ok both! Yep I did it again, found Chino Bandido where they combine both! Super good and sorry I didn't come up with that idea earlier. A must stop in Phoenix, AZ! Pollo Diablo and Jade Red Chicken with Fried Rice and Refried Beans would be a good start! www.ontheroadeats.com
