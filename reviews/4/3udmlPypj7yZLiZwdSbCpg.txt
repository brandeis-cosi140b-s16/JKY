Went here last night for the first time with some friends while I was visiting from outta town. It was delicious! I will definitely be making a trip back next time I'm in town. I got a combo plate number 5. It was such a good deal for the amount of food you get, it came with a taco, enchilada & tostada & only $7.50. The service was good. It was near closing time so you could tell they were exhausted & ready to wrap up the night. 
But overall it was great food & good service. It's my choice before macyo. Ooo & their watermelon margarita was so yummy!
