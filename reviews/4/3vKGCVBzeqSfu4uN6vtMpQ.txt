Tired after a long ass ride from Ventura to Phoenix,  with a gorgeous detour up into Pine Cove, my stomach reminds me that I haven't eaten all day. 

Since good vittle options are limited in this part of Mesa,  I bust out my trusty little Yelp app for a quick scan. 

It's a coin toss between Mexican or Salvadorean. Much to my chagrin,  Mexican wins.  Not because I don't like it but because the idea of washing down a few pupusas with a nice cold beer was quite appealing and a welcome surprise given the sea of fast food and crappy chains which make up the culinary landscape around these here parts. 

So off we went to nearby Casa Ramos. The place is cute and the service welcoming. The menu is your standard gringo-mex. The homemade salsa was devoured within seconds and the house margarita was decent. Rosario, our server,  was delightful. 

All in all, this joint gets my seal of approval. Fin clapping begins here. 

Good times in the Sonoran Desert!
