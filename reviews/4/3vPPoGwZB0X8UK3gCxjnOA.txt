I would have never thought this place would have such great food! It's in the middle of a casino off strip and we were tired and hungry by the time we arrived. The prices were cheap for Vegas! (3 item combo $13) beers were $3 domestic and $4 for imports. The chips are served with beans and salsa both of which were very good. The chips themselves were great as well. The chile Rellano was amazing and I will definitely return the next time we stay at Tuscany.
