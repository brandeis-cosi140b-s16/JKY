So far we have tried this hut 4 times and I have yet to have any issues listed below. 

I usually order the carne asada either in a burro or on chips and they are usually the best around here in the great Goodyear tire.

Wife has had shredded beef Tacos, surf and turf, or the super fries. 

I suggest ordering it without the salsa fresca and just using their red sauce because it makes it better.

Food has always been hot, and a reasonable value and I have not had any issues with service so far. Food has not made me sick, but then again I have eaten around the world and I believe I'm fairly immune to the taco bug.

Check this hot spot out, I think it's worth it.
