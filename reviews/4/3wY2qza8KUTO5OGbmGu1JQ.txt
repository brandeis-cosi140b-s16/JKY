I have now been to El Rico's several times and thought it was time to give it a review. I went last night with a small group, and had another great experience. 

Although I usually get the same thing when I go (shredded beef gordo burrito...2 meals in 1), it's awesome each time. They do have great chips and salsa to start off with, and everyone I've been with has always enjoyed their food. The service has always been good to great. Although it is kind of in a weird location, the building it is in is definitely unique. We've always wanted to go in the evening when it is cooler out to sit outside, but have never made it. El Rico's is its own place, which makes it cool...it's not a cookie-cutter restaurant. It's my favorite mexican place out here.
