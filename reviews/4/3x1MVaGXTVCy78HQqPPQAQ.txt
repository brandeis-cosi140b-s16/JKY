Over ten years in PGH, the only real Mexican food outside of Texas, or the southwest I've had are the Las Palmas street tacos. My daughter was in the mood for a meat dish so we agreed on Cocina Mendoza. (This was my first trip to a Mexican restaurant in sw PA).
     We picked a booth with two very cool, and familiar pictures of Pancho Villa staring at us. The chips, and salsa were good, not pico de gallo salsa, but a nice tomato saucy blend of cilantro, maybe a splash of lime, and very little seasoning. The chips were warm, unsalted, and nicely crunchy. I honestly would've been happy eating chips, and salsa while my daughter ate her beef fajitas. 
     I ordered Combination plate 11, cheese chile relleno, one chicken enchilada, and one beef enchilada with rice, and refried beans. It's been a few years since I've had a good chile relleno, and Mendozas was okay. The charred poblano pepper was about the size of my hand, (5 inches long), and filled with queso fresco, dipped in egg white, and fried. My first time having a chile like this. The shredded chicken enchilada, and the ground beef enchiladas were good enough to stifle my cravings until our summer trip south. The Mexican rice, and refried beans were comfort food on their own level. My daughter picked Mendozas fajitas over Emilianos since she's had both to compare.
     Some might describe the food being bland, but I would guess a lot of ethnic food establishments are trying to not scare off those with sensitive taste buds. Fortunately, Cocina Mendoza provides salt, pepper, and Tapatio hot sauce at the table, don't hesitate to use them!
     The decor was inviting, very traditional Mexican restaurant style, and our server was friendly, maybe shy. I'd go back to Cocina Mendoza, it hit the right spot, and was worth braving a gray, cold January day.
