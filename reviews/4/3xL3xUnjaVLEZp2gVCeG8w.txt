I like to come here every Sunday with my two bros after blacking out the night before. They know us a regulars but we always look like absolute garbage when we are here. They are okay with it though. We talk about our night and make fun of who was the biggest idiot the night before. Usually me but Taylor gives me a run for my money. Get the steak rancheros burrito. It's a hangover cure even in God's eyes.
