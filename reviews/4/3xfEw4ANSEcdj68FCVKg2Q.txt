As others have written, this place is like QDoba, but much more authentic.  You order your food and they prepare it as you move down the line. Five of us had dinner on a cold Friday evening and there were no complaints. I had a torta - I have never had one - and it was delicious. It comes on an enormous grilled bun and then I topped it with carnitas, rice, black beans, salsa verde and cheese. I could only finish about half of it, definitely worth the price!  Others in our party had the tacos and burritos and everyone said their food was tasty. Tacos can be ordered either on corn or flour tortillas. The chicken, as others have reviewed, is a strange blaze orange color, but the taste was good. Beer, Margaritas and sodas in the can are available. The Margaritas are pre-mixed in a dispenser, so I went with a beer.  The two men working behind the counter were fast and friendly. If we find our selves near Stoughton Rd., we will definitely return to try other menu items.
