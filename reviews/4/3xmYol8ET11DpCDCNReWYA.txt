Yes, I am now of fan of Tortilla Flat.  There's not a lot of options in the eastern Phoenix area and this is a fun, historic place.  The drive is beautiful.  The bathrooms are unique, there's no phone service, dollar bills cover the walls, bar stools are saddles.  We had burgers & fries, and all was tasty.  We visited the general store and had some prickly pear ice cream.  It was a fun outing and we'll probably go again when visiting MIL in Apache Junction.
