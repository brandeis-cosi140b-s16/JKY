Great family restaurant for REAL authentic Mexican food on the South side of Phoenix. Busy on a Saturday but the wait was worth it. Again another good place to bring our baby. 

The prices were cheap for quality. We got two entrees, an appetizer and two drinks for $20. I got a chicken taco and asada taco dinner combo. The asada taco was amazing! Beautifully seasoned and not over cooked. The refried beans were the second best thing I ate on my plate. OMG. Best beans ever! The chicken taco could have been a little more seasoned for my taste and the nachos we had for appetizer I will probably pass on next time. They reminded me of the nachos you can get at a baseball game. 

Overall, I'll definitely be back! Yum!
