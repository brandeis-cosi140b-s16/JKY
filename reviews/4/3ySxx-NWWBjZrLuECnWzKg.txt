Coming from Southern California, this is on par with some of the authentic places from back home.  The flavors are what you would find at the border towns, not this 'American-Mexican' food you find at most chain joints (probably why so many bad reviews, some people don't know good food when they find it)

The service is on the ball as well and they recognize you even if you haven't been around in a few months.  Most of the staff is the same from when we first went there and they are all great.

The prices are a bit higher than a chain restaurant, but you get what you pay for in my book.

All in all, this is one of our favorite places in town for great Mexican food
