Went back today because I live close.  I had a much different experience this time around.  One of the employees, I'm assuming the manager or shift supervisor, was seriously on his A-Game.   Dude takes pride in his job, and was helping out the other workers.  He actually re-steamed my tortilla because a different employee didn't do it right.  Usually don't see that kind of pride in work at fast food chains.  Really impressed.  This place may have turned a corner with this supervisor running things (think he's a supervisor).
