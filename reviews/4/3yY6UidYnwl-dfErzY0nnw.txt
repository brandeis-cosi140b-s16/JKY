Comparable to Tacos El Gordo? Definitely a yes! Great customer service and friendly staff. Try their sweet potato fries with chicken - absolutely amazing. And their Al Pastor tacos with pineapple salsa - to die for. I'm glad a great taco spot opened up on this side of town. It's about time! Also their horchata tastes like Christmas in your mouth.
