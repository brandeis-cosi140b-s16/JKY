This is very good upscale Mexican food.  My only problem is I find it hard to swallow $20 - $30 for a plate of Mexican food.  I know it is very good quality, but I feel for that kind of money I could have a better experience elsewhere.  If the price doesn't bother you, then by all means, it is very good.
