Very good mexican food if you dont mind making your way to the TI which isnt one of my favorite casinos.   Steak Nachos and guac. were fantastic.  Chicken soup was very tasty and a good thing to order if you want to maybe split a full entree but want a little more.

I had the steak "tower" or something to that effect and it was good -- maybe not as great as i expected but very nicely presented and tasty.
