You dont come here for the decor or the parking and maybe not even the service.  You come for the food.  I typically get the half chicken which is quite a bit of food.  I dig the beans too.  They also serve the coke in bottles which is made with real sugar and they taste much better.  Service isnt great, they're a bit slow and parking is terrible but the food is really good.  I have yet to go and NOT get good quality food.  If you want good authentic mexican food, you need to try this place, just dont expect much else.
