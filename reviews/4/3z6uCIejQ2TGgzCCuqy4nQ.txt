Came here with my parents and two daughters. 

Very beautiful restaurant inside and out. 

The waitress was attentive and helpful after browsing their very large menu. 

My father raved about their cerviche, he said it was really good. 

Our plates came out fast and are food was pretty decent. 

Would return to eat when I am in the mood for Mexican food.

Only downfall: all the food was made with corn tortillas instead of flour. Wasn't given the option to change it either when I ordered the enchiladas.
