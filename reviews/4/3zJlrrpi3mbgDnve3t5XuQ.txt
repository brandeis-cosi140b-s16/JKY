Awesome Mexican fare. Service was a little inattentive but generally ok. Had no problems communicating with the staff as noted by others. I loved their decor, especially the large booth we were seated in. 

I had the Fajitas Texicana or something of that nature and the Caso Con Pollo. Both were flavorful and the chicken elements of the dishes were moist and tender. Portions were very adequate also. 

What I'd like to see improved is the cleanliness  of their restrooms. It was horrible. A food establishment should police their restrooms like hawks. 

I'd return if I was ever in the area again. It's definitely a solid 7 out of 10.
