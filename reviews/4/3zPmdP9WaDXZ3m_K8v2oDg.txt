I've been to numerous Valle Luna locations and the food is consistently good.   This is a reasonably priced, casual place to get some mexican food.  I went last night, though, and all the bus and chip boys and girls were too busy playing grab-ass with each other to refill our chips.  Just thought I would throw that out there in case management is reading.  I thought it was entertaining if anything. Waitress was excellent though.
