The food is fantastic for the budget Mexican category. This favorite (or favorito) is in my neighborhood and is a regular stop. I prefer not to eat there (unless you get turned on by fluorescent lights and beat up furnishings). No, I prefer to eat my Favoritos at home. I have heard that some folks take their meal next door to the Tally Ho (a dive bar) and enjoy their tacos with a cold Corona! Crazy!

Nachos covered with cheese and Jalapeos for only $2! Tacos and tostadas of perfection. They also have a mini salsa bar with several dimensions of heat and flavor.
