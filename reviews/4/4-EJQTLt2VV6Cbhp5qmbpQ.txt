Delicious food for really good price. Had two crispy bean tacos, a chicken taco, and a carne asada plate. Service was good and cashier was friendly, but cook and service was a little unorganized. I had to go up and get each item separately, rather than the meal coming out all at once. Salsa bar was okay. There was green and red hot sauce, which were not spicy. They also had spicy pickled carrots and cucumbers. These were good, but did not have a lot of flavor.
