We have been there at least 5 times now and I'm a huge fan!!! LOVE the table-side Guacamole, bean dip, chips, and salsa's to start.  We have tried the carne asada taquitos, the enchiladas, the Carne Asada, the beef taco's and chicken chimichanga.  They were all tasty!

The beans and rice are standard.  Love their fideo soup.  Service has always been very good. Prices comparable to the other Mexican restaurants in town.
