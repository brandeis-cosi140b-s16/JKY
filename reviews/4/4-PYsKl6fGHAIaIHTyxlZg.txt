The fall theatre season has started at UNLV so I stopped here for dinner last night and had a great meal.  I did their Thursday Special of the Day, Barbicoa.  For $12.95, you get soup of the day - in this case it was an excellent cream of mushroom, the barbacoa, cubes of pot roast that are cooked in Mexican spices, rice, and whole beans.

When I asked about the spiciness of the barbacoa, the waiter said it was a red sauce with a little spice.  When informed that I liked spicy food, he said he'd tell them to make it spicier.  He did, it was, and boy did I like it.  Extra red cili seasonings gave a zip to the dish.  The beans were also well spiced and had some wonderful cotija cheese for garnish.  The rice was standard Mexican restaurant rice--nothing terribly good nor bad about it.  You also have your choice of flour or corn tortillas.

Service was excellent as usual.  This is a great place to eat, but it's a bonus when you an have a quiet, enjoyable, and reasonably priced meal before heading east on Flamingo to get to UNLV.
