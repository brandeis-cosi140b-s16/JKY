Roberto's is one of those Vegas places that can vary from place to place. One expects they do not have exacting standards for all their locations as you will often find differences in the recipe from one shop to another. 

Of course, the service will always differ between the various locations around the city. But this Roberto's, in a rather unassuming neighborhood of East Vegas, offers an excellent mix of all the good things you come to expect from the chain.

A recent remodeling may have had an impact on this place. I don't know what it looked like before, but it looks good now and I think that has an affect on the staff as they are friendly and do an all-around good job. 

The food is as good as any location in town and the portions and price are what have made Roberto's a local favorite.
