Torta ahogada=your mouth will be on fire. no joke!
fast service (we ordered to go.) this place is a hole in the wall but it does not disappoint (so glad i started yelping and came across this a while back ago! ) I wish the tortas were a little bigger... they're not big enough to share if you're really hungry. 
overall, we're addicted to the spicy sauce and can't wait to go back!
