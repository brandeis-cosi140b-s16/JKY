It was good... possibly great.  Coming from San Diego, it's hard to satisfy my taste, but this place is authentic, especially considering we're in the midwest.  I only had the street tacos, which were great, and yes, you can definitely mess up a dish that only consists of 4 ingredients. It's fast, you get chips and they serve up coke in a bottle.   

I'll definitely be back to try out the other dishes; although, there really is no reason to stray away from good tacos.
