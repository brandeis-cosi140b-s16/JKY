I really like this place. It's a nice, cheap Mexican joint with good, greasy food, and probably my favorite Mexican place in Champaign.

I've only been to the new location once, but my experience was positive. The food was good; I had the chicken quesadila and my girlfriend had the steak fajitas. There were only three tortillas with the fajitas, but that's only a bit of a quibble. Portions are nice and big, and I liked the chips and salsa. The margaritas weren't the best I've ever had, but they're okay for the price, and they're pretty strong.
