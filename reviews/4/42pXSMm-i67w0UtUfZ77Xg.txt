This is a friendly local restaurant.  The service is quick and the staff friendly.  It's a good place when you want Mexican food but want a step up from fast food or casual quick.  I will say, however, on both of my visits, my meal was good but arrived at my table barely warm.  Would have been better had my meals been served hot.  Dinner for 2 including drinks and tip was just over $40.00.
