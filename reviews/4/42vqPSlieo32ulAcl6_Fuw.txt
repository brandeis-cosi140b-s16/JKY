Two friends whom I hadn't seen in awhile and I decided to have a girls' night dinner.  We arrived and were seated quickly.  The hostess was very polite and our server was wonderful throughout the evening.  I was happy to find that they had some local craft beers on tap, so I ordered a new one I had never had... it was great!  Shout out to the NoDa Cavu blonde ale!  They each had very tasty margaritas (lucky me, I got to sip).  The complimentary salsa was very good - not too spicy, but with a kick.  The chips were brought to the table warm, just the way I like.
We ordered the tableside-made guacamole... holy moly it was delicious!  She made sure were were good with all the ingredients as well as how spicy we wanted it.
We were slow about ordering entrees just because we were having so much fun catching up.  Our server occasionally checked in to make sure we were good, but we never felt pressured or rushed by her to go ahead and order.  
When we did, I got the Fish Tacos and requested for them to be grilled rather than battered and fried.  I love when that is possible, because it means they aren't just pulling pre-breaded fish out of a bag.  And to me it tastes so much better!  Inside the 3 flour tortilla tacos was the grilled fish piled high with slaw, pico de gallo, and valentina aioli.  They were fantastic and perfectly balanced with the sides of Mexican rice and refried beans.  
I was absolutely stuffed after two tacos, so I got to enjoy the 3rd along with some leftover rice and beans the next day for lunch.  I will definitely be returning when I'm in Charlotte again.
