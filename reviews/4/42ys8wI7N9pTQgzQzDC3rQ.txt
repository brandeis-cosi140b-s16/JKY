Went yesterday through the drive thru.  I'd only been to Del Taco when I was inebriated and remembered it being amazing.  
Got a deluxe taco salad with beef ($4.59) which was good.  The shell was nice and crispy and it was full of shredded lettuce, refried beans, salsa, guac, ground beef, and sour cream.  
Also got a chicken quesadilla ($3.31).  It was amazing...the outside was crunchy and the inside was hot, gooey, melted cheese and chicken.  Loved it.  
The food came out quick.  The area is a little sketchy...I wouldn't want to park and go into the location but the drive-thru is okay.  Lock your doors!
