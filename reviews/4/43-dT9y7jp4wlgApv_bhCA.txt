Went in for a late lunch and while it was too late for their lunch special, I ordered a Polo Asada burrito. When it arrived it was enough for two people and was quite possibly the best Polo Asada I have had in Arizona. The service was great, my glass of water never hit empty. The prices are good as well. I would certainly recommend them to others. The restaurant has a very coastal Mexican feel to it, very colorful and enjoyable.
