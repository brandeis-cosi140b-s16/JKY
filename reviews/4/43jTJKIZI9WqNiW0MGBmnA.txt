After a long day in the sun it was time to cool off and grab some lunch.  I went to Tradiciones and am very glad I did.  The food was amazing.  I had the pollo en mole and it was very good spicy yet sweet.  After dinner I had the tres leches cake which was also very yummy.  To wash all this down I had the millionaires margarita and it was very potent.  It had grand marnier, tequila, and Chambord.  Overall the meal was great and I will keep this on my list of favorite mexican places to eat in Arizona.
