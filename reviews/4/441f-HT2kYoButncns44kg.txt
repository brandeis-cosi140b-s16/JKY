YAY for YAYO!!!  What a fantastic surprise this place was.  Totally laid back atmosphere, great seating options inside & out and friendly staff.  I have only been here once but am planning on going back on Friday.  Mmm Mmmm so good!  They have some really interesting Taco choices from the #10 which is a chicken curry taco...( It was SO GOOD!)! the Fish Tacos, Shrimp, Tofu, Veggie, they have one with a spicy peanut sauce... the options were aplenty! I cant wait to go back!  Super easy on your wallet too!!  Definitely worth a stop in.  This is not fine dining by any stretch of the imagination but this is just good food at a great price with a great selection.  And I was REALLY surprised at how much meat was in the tacos.  They truly dont skimp! The Quinoa is a yummy side dish as well as the black beans.  My daughter had the sweet potato fries and loved them too!  My one word of caution would be not to go here expecting your traditional Carne Asada or Chicken Taco's.  I was really surprised by my carne asada taco as it seemed more like a roasted beef or pulled beef taco than the steak I am used to.  It was still good, just not what I was expecting.  Just come expecting to try something different in a graffiti saturated super chill place.  I only wish it were closer to home!
