I admit, I'm a regular here. It's on my way home from work and they have taco specials on certain nights. Some things they just do better and more authentically than other Berto's. Lengua, Tripas, Machaca, Menudo. I just crave it! And they always remember me and if they think I might show up, they save my favorite for me because it's so good, it goes fast! fast! fast!!!!
