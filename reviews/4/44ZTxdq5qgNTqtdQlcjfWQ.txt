Food has always been good at this location: no food poisoning and tastes great! The wait can be a little long sometimes but only like 3-5 minutes longer than your average fast food place. To me, it seems like the longer wait times are due to the fact that they make to order things since I've never seem the employees be lazy/slow and even with no one ahead of me, it always seems like they are making the order just for me!
