We headed here for our date night after a suggestion from a friend. It was very casual and had good (nothing over the top) mexican food. I had the chicken taco salad and the hubs got the fish tacos. We also got table side guac which was really yummy. 

The overall experience was great; wonderful and friendly wait staff plus the usual mexican food choices. I will say it's super kid friendly, so if you want a little peace and quiet, come after the early dinner rush. It's also nice they have a patio to sit outside.
