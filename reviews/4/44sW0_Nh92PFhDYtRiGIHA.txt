I have gone here a couple of times in the last few weeks and have to say we had great service each time.  We went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and they only had one waitress working but she was attentive, personable and our drinks were always full.  

I think the food here is good albeit a dollar or so overpriced.  I have had quite a few items but I can recommend the Red Chili Pork Tacos over everything I have tried so far.  The food is good quality and the salsa is reliably tasty.  These are two requirements for my Mexican dining needs.

Another plus about this place is its sizable patio.  Nothing beats eating outside during our awesome  AZ winter.
