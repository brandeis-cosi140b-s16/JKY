The Ajo Al's on 16th St has always been my home for good mexican food.  Until this place.. HOLY...  I love this place.  First off, the actual building is incredible.  Kudos to whomever designed this place.  It looks awesome.  

Their chips are great along with the delicious salsa and hot sauce.  My only complaint is the last time I went , the chips were old tasting.. I could tell they gave me the bottom of the chip drawer. 

I  love this place and will be coming back often!
