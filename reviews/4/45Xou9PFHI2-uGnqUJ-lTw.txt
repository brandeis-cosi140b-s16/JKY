As a native Southern Californian I grew up on Mexican food whether prepared by my Mexican American Family or at any of the multitudes of taquerrias throughout  Southern California. Forget the multitude of restaurants and roadside cartas within the great country of Mexico I have been fortunate enough to come across on my journeys south of the border.
The greatest thing about Zapatas Mexican Cantina "The Employees" the food is good for what it is, dumbied down Mexican food for the average Joe. It wasn't too long ago there was no other choice but to put up with the dumby downed mexican restaurants in Charlotte but over the past ten years or so there has been an influx of great authentic Mexican restaurants and Taquerrias springing up all over Charlotte mainly on South Blvd and Central. 
If you are not as adventurous as The Epicurean Cowboy. Than perhaps this is as good as it gets for you. Again not a bad place and made even better by the great staff. Escpecially Olevera our favorite. BTW the special salsa upon request is perhaps the best in Charlotte. As a matter of fact I will go on record and declare it is by far the best I have experienced in North Carolina.
