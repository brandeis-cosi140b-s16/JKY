Came here for lunch, my bf loves their Street Tacos, personally I wasn't a fan of the tacos but Wow I was impressed with my Super Cheesey Gooey Chimichanga.

I was skeptical at first but it really isn't overloaded with cheese like I was worried it would be, like too much cheese and not enough meet.

It was SO good, loaded with shredded pork, and the green sauce gave it good flavor. I wasnt too sure what "jalepeno cream cheese" meant, but it turned out to be this really delicious cheese sauce with a nice jalepeno flavor and kick to it. 

The fresh pico de gallo along with the shredded pork and creamy sauce just came together so nicely. Will definitely come back.
