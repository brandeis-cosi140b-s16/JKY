We went to this place to visit a friend who was working and decided that we would have lunch as well.  I am normally a picky person when it comes to Mexican food but this place was actually A-Ok in my book.  Is it 100% authentic, probably not but they do have some things that are actually pretty good and decent.  They start you off with chips, salsa and some kind of bean dip.  The salsa was good but the bean dip I thought was amazing!  I had the red chili burrito with rice and charro beans.  The burrito was good, the chili had good flavors.  The charro beans were good as well but the rice was a little overdone.  My bf had the chicken/steak fajitas which looked and smelled really good.  There was a ton of food left over that he took half of it home!

The decor is really nice and they have a beautiful outside patio.  If you go there sit in Rich's section, he will take care of you!  Oh and thank you Garcia's for putting an extra large bottle of Chalula on the table!
