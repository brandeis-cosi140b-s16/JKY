We had a delicious meal on Friday night and fantastic service! I wish I could remember the servers name! We had chips, salsa and guacamole that he was very quick to refill, even with a table of 5 chowing down after a tough workout. I had the Crab Cake Salad which was phenomenal. The Jalape√±o dressing had the perfect amount of kick! Everyone at the table was impressed with their meals, Street Tacos, Nachos, Tilapia Salad!
