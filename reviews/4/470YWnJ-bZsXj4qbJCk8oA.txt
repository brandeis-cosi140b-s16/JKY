This is a great restaurant if you want inexpensive American-Mexican food in a clean, casual environment with top-notch customer service. My boyfriend and I eat out A LOT, and we like La Fiesta for quite a few reasons. 
First, and this is a biggie because we're both grad students, its reasonably priced. The more expensive items on the menu will run you around $15-16, but the majority of the full entrees (including: chips/salsa starter, meat, veggies, tortillas [when appropriate], and usually some combination of rice and beans) will be about $12. 
Second, they have AWESOME customer service. The employees are very friendly, and are quick to fill water, chips bowl, and your orders. You are greeted with an "Hola, amigos!" and sent off with a smile; they have one waiter in particular who is really friendly and does a great job. 

Food comes out in less than five minutes most of the time. Usually when this happens, I'm skeptical of the quality, but Fiesta does a decent job being consistently good (not wonderful, but good...see below). 

The only downside is that the food isn't the "best" Mexican food in town. For that, you might want to go to Huraches Moroleon down the street, or Maize on campus. However, their food is yummy, relatively healthy (they don't douse in oil), and tastes fresh. The shrimp fajitas are great, and my boyfriend always gets the "quesadilla supreme," and is always happy with the choice. 

Overall, if you're in southeast urbana and hungry, this is a solid, reliable choice.
