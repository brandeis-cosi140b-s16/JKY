My sister and I went to Salty's for Cinco de Mayo. We actually had a great time! The place has a lot of open space, I love how it's like a big backyard party with all the amenities! The food was simple, but totally tasty (chicken burrito). Service was pretty good. We were lucky we got there early because there was a huge line later in the evening and they were only letting people in as people left. I would have personally never waited that long to get in. Margaritas were cheap and gave the typical heart burn from the pre-made mix, but we had a good time!
