Love this place. There are several locations, but this is the one we visit. You get seated very quickly. The staff is very attentive. I had the Beef Chimichanga and my wife had the Chicken Burrito. Comes with rice and beans. Huge portions and the price is right. I highly recommend the Tres Leches for dessert. We will be making many return trips!
