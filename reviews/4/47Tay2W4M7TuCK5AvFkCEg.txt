Here is my take on La Tolteca in Sun Prairie:
Food = 3.5 Stars.  Huge Menu, Huge Portions, Good But Not Great Food.  They have a ton of different combinations so that you can try a lot of different things.  Their lunch specials are also super cheap for what they give you.
Service = 5 Stars.  The staff is always on top of things.  You can get in and out of this place in 30 minutes if you have too.  When you order a carry out it's literally done in 15 minutes.  You won't catch yourself waiting long for more chips or a refill on your soda cause they are always watching.  
Overall, I say check it out!
