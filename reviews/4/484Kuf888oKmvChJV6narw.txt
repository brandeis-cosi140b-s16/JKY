The best enchilada style burros in town.  And if you like New Mexican style food, possibly the best anywhere.  I go there about twice a year, yet think about it twice a week.  It's like a drug for me.  I have to ration myself fearing I'd become an addict.  

I only go before 11:45 or after 1:30 for obvious reasons.  (Keep that between us please). There is limited outdoor seating and to-go isn't an option for me.  I couldn't possibly resist smelling the food while I drive back.  

Tips:
Bring cash
Be weary of wearing a white shirt
Expect to share your air space with a few flies.  
The tables are mesh, so scratch anything white.
