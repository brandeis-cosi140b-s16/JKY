A resturant in the same building as your hotel room. Yes you just died and went to heaven. I love Mexican food, and I was super excited to eat here. The decor was nice, very mexican-ish. The service was eh okay. Not good-not bad kind. I enjoyed the chips and salsa. I order tacos, they were done pretty well. I don't really have many complaints for a place I didn't have to really walk to. I suggest you try them out. Order a beer and some tacos and enjoy yourself, you won't be dissatisfied.
