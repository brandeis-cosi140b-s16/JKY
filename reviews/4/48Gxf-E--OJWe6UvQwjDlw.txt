I love the taquitos and beef tacos. I rarely order anything else. And they are always tasty. But wverytime i walk in someone is eating the shrimp ceviche and boy does it look good.

I started coming here before they had the current name because my husbands office was down the way.

The only reason i am giving them 4 stars is because the bathroom is outside and the drive thru is at a weird angle.  Also, the beans are a bit on the dry side.
