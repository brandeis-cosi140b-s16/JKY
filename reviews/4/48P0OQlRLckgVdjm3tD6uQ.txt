This is a place we always go to for lunch. It usually very busy but worth it. Try the Carne Asada taco with everything or the Taco el Pastor. Another great favorite is the quesadilla. You must must must get the tortilla chips and salsa.  tortilla chips are made in house and they are crunchy and salty and delicious and the salsa is made in house every day and it's fantastic.
