Omg Felipito's is my favorite mexican food spot in Vegas. I've been coming here ever since I moved here about six years ago. Who would've thought a little shack like spot would be so good. First thing that caught my eye was the sign, I thought it said Filipino's hahah. Anyways the food here is sooo good, I usually get the carne asada fries and a fish burrito.  They also carry a wide variety of choices. Definitely a great spot to hit up, located near the corner of Tropicana and Maryland. Great place to get more bang for your buck.
