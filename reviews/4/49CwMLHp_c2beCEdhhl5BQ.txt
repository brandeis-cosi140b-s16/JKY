HO. LY. HELL.
I've been wanting to write about this place for a while now.
This was my first weekend outing for me in Old Town since I moved here.  WHOAAA! The music!  The Drinks!!  The CRAZY!   I was with a group of four, and we decided to embark on our first Old Town club crawl.  I've heard good things about this place, especially if you're looking for a Vegas-y experience.  THAT, we had.

Since we were in a group, there was definitely a bit of a wait, which in heels, can be annoying.  However, we were pretty close to the front of the line, and the bouncers were really nice and funny, making jokes with us about the party music.  My boyfriend was chatting it up with the door guy with glasses, and soon after that they let us in!  

As we entered the club, my eardrums wanted to die.  BUT, after a few tasty cocktails, my ears didn't care.  Service was  definitely slow and getting drinks was really difficult, but I guess thats any club on a busy night. 
Unable to really talk to each other, we all decided to throw caution to the wind and dance our asses off.  It was a BLAST!   After about 2 and a half hours of crazy house music, people dancing on the bars and booth (even some guys booty dancing!), girls blowing whistles at everything, and ourselves getting shitfaced, we decided it was probably time for food and rest.
I heard their food menu is spotty, but we hit up the pizza place around the corner for some late night rejuvenation. 
 
Probably wont make this wild place my weekend home, but for special occasions, Hefe is the place to be!
Great nightlife, surprisingly non-douchey bouncers, super fun girls, probably some permanent ear damage, but overall, an AWESOME club!!
