We came on a Sunday evening and ordered 
1. 2 item: Beef enchilada and chicken tamale, 11.99
2. Fiesta carne asada burrito, 11.99
for $16 (Used a Advisor BOGO entree coupon) 

- In Fiesta Henderson. Next to Fuego. 
- Free chips and salsa bar. Also has refried beans. 
- Quick service. Hot plate. No hassle. 
- Left the pitcher of water for us. Bonus
- 2 item came with a salad. Basic. 
- Tasty tamale! Lots of flavor. Recommend. 
- Lots of carne asada in wet burrito. flavorful.  
- Left overs. Enough for the next dinner meal. 
- Get chips to-go! yay. 
- Compared to other cantinas around the area; Chevy's, Jaliscos, Coyotes, I feel that this is the best in terms of value with the use of coupons.
