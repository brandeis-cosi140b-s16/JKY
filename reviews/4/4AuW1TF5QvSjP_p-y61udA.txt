Tuesdays here are the JAM! After 2:30, the classic fish tacos are $1.50 each! They're great, too. And coming from SoCal, I know my fish tacos. Sure, Wahoos Fish Tacos are classic. I've been going to the original shack in HB since I was 16. And those are tasty and healthy, no disrespect. But the RUBIOS tacos are TASTIER and UNHEALTHIER... and cheaper- What's not to love?

The salsa bar is good. For some reason, the salsa bar at any local El Pollo Loco is still my favorite, but I usually question the freshness of the EPL salsa bar, although I can never turn down the guacamole salsa, even when It's 85° and I am scraping the bottom of the cilantro-cluttered bowl.

Back to the fish tacos. I get them with an extra side of white sauce and extra cabbage. The fish is usually golden fried and of ample portion. Stay away from the lime, however, they are usually very potent and overpowering. Use a little salsa verde and a little chipotle salsa- Voilá!

And I usually only get 2. Very filling, although when I feel like a fiesta I can order as many as 4 (that's pronounced 'quatro').

The staff is friendly, the girl at the Lake Mead location rides a GSXR- Whoot Whoot! And they always throw in some free corn chips. Love it.

Try 'em, you'll like 'em.
