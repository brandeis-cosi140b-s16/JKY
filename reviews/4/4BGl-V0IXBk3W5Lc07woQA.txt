We have been to Bajio dozens of times since it opened a few years back.  I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed in a meal.  There have been a lot of changes over the past couple of years, with the recent change to being a 'cantina' with flat screen tv's, alcoholic drinks, etc.  The ordering is very simple, it's an assembly line (a la Chipotle).  If you want (or don't want) something, all you have to do is tell them.

The three of us went for a weekend lunch, and the place had a pretty good crowd.  The line still moved pretty fast.  I got a chicken quesadilla with rice and beans, rather than my regular nachos.  The quesadilla was good, though I'll probably get the nachos next time.  The rice and beans were also good.  The one problem with the meal (and all of us thought this) was that the sodas seemed to be on the flat side.  At first I thought it was a problem with my drink, but when I mentioned it later, everyone else had the same problem.  

This visit, Bajio earned a solid 4 stars, marking them down for the odd tasting drinks.  On an overall/portfolio, I'd give them 4.5 stars.  (Note:  I did have an issue with them a couple weeks back when somehow I got subscribed to their text club.  I mean, five texts in 10 minutes is a little ridiculous, even if I had knowingly signed up.  Luckily, I talked to a manager, Jan, who was extremely helpful and took care of the problem).  I will definitely be back to Bajio.
