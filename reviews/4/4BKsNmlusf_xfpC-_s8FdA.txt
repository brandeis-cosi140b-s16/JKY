I really only give 4 stars because of value. I used to go to Moes every Monday for about 6 months straight, I always loved it. It was $5, filled me up and tasted good.  I go less frequent now, not because I am unable, but I almost feel the quality is going down rather then up like its competitors. I starting eating at Chipotle more and the quality of food is night and day, by the taste and texture. I will prob still go to Moes often because it doesn't taste bad but only on Mondays. At $6, you are still getting a great deal with burrito chips drink and salsa. On a Tuesday- Sunday, I will be getting my quick burrito at Chipotle.
