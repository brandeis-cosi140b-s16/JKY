This place opened up a few months ago so I finally went in to give it a try. Walking in I notice its very nice and clean. The food was better than I expected. I had the 2 Carne Asada taco plate with beans and rice included. The tacos had pico de gallo and guacamole on them included. Everything was delicious. My boyfriend had the Shrimp Burrito which we asked if they would make it a Chimichanga and they did even though it wasn't on the menu. The Shrimp Chimichanga came with shrimp, rice, tartar sauce, pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole and cheese. He said it was amazingly good. We are definitely going back plus very close by to us.
