This was our first time going, despite having lived right around the corner for a couple years. Was surprised to see how big it was inside. Always thought it was more of a hole in the wall, but it's quite expansive inside. Nice enough decor.

Our server (Chuy) was great, but the bar was slow making our drinks. It wasn't busy, so I was perplexed. I had a beer, practically impossible to screw up, and my partner had the Mojito Mexicano. I hate mojitos, but as a bartender, I knew it was a good drink. Was on the stronger side, too. Which is NEVER a problem!

DO order the guacamole fresca. Our server made it table side, and it was exactly the way I like my guacamole, fresh and creamy. YUM! I'll be back for this reason alone. 

We both ordered the Baja Fish Tacos. They didn't look that delicious, but they were pretty damned tasty. Lots of tilapia inside. Usually I have no problem downing a order of three, but had to pack one up. The beans and rice served with it were yummy as well. Everything was piping hot, which is a pet peeve of mine. Points for that. 

All in all, I'm excited to return and try some of their other dishes.
