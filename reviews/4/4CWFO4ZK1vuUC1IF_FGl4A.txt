Joyride makes up for some inconsistency in flavor profiles with a super cool ambience, friendly and capable service, and reasonable pricing.  Some of the tacos we ordered were well-seasoned and flavorful, and others slightly bland - the shrimp could have been fresher.  The nachos were to DIE for, but the side of pinto beans was heavily over salted.  

The setup is open with a hip and inviting color scheme that speaks to the casual and laid-back vibe.  There is a sizable bar with interesting drinks (aguas frescas) which are all spike-able.  

The hostess was probably the friendliest person I've ever met and servers were definitely capable and friendly.  A little more work on food consistency and this place would easily earn a 5-star rating.
