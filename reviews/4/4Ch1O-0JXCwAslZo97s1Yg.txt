i've been here several times now.  at first i wasn't sure how i felt about it.  it never seems to be very busy, but the service is always very polite and friendly.  the food i feel mixed about.  it's  GOOD.  the meat is always tender and the dishes are really flavorful, but i never really found anything that i LOVED.  and yet i continued wanting to go back and give it another try.  (the chips and salsa are really good -- and of course if you know me, you know that i like to mix the regular and the hot  for my perfect salsa).  nothing just really grabbed me.  their pork isn't shredded  like  i'm used to, they use pork loin which is good, but the consistency of it just doesn't seem to mix well with the food.  and the beef is super tender, but i just hadn't found my perfect mix of flavors yet.  until i tried the shrimp rellano.  so good!  i've been burned by rellanos in the past so i don't usually get them anymore.  this was the best rellano!  it was breaded perfectly (not too much like some places where the breading completely overwhelms the other flavors) and the cheese was super smooth and just oozed out.  delish!  and our server recommended something for the wee one that i didn't see on the kids  menu (i could have been totally blind) and he loved  it!  bonus!
