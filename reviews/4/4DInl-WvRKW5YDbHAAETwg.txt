So, I wanted to try a new place and came across Secreto on Yelp. I stopped by on a Friday; I was the only customer there. The service was excellent (I would hope so!).

I ordered the smothered burrito with the adobada and green sauce. This came with yummy rice and beans. Everything was good. My only complaint was everything was not bland but not spicy at all (to me), which is surprising given the style of Mexican food they serve.

I got a side of their habenero salsa which definitely spiced things up. Bit I would recommend they kick it up a little bit.

Nice atmosphere, the booths are Richardson's-like.

I would definitely come here again.
