I'm a picky eater and and thought the steak fundido was great.  Order a Boss margarita with this and you are guaranteed to enjoy your experience.  I would have given them 5 stars but the wait was frustrating.  We were told 20 minutes which really ended up being almost an hour.

One of their bartenders was our waiter and he did a great job turning our frowns upside down.
