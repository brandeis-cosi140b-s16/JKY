Everything you know is wrong!

The place has changed owners and names. Now called Taqueria Los Pioneros. 

When I went by today at about 6 p.m. I saw a restaurant building with a Closed sign in the window, and a small trailer out in the parking lot. 

You can see where they erased the Tacos Azteca name from the trailer -- the guy behind the counter said that he is the new owner.  Yup, it's new -- the health inspection certificate (Rated A) is only one week old.

 I should have asked for more info (is the storefront closed permanently? Just closed for the evening?) When I placed my order I missed a big clue when the guy behind the counter politely asked, "For here or to go?" ("Here"?  Where?  I'm standing in an empty parking lot!)

My order was simple -- Pastor (marinated pork) burrito. I thought it was large for only $5, and came with an ample supply of lime slices.  Not sure if it was the greatest burrito of all time* but it was certainly tasty and spicy. Worth another visit.

*The joke is that every time we eat out anywhere my mother-in-law always leans in while my mouth is full with my first bite and asks, "Is that the BEST BURRITO YOU'VE EVER HAD?" and I never quite know what to say: "Um... it's fine. I'm enjoying it. But the best EVER?  I dunno... Can I wait to answer until I've had a second bite?"
