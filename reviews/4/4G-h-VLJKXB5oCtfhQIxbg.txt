Side note: I NEVER come to this part of Gilbert (don't live close by), but there's a cute few blocks of restaurants & I'd definitely venture out here again to try some other places. End aside...

I met a friend here for HH and really like it! It was on a Tuesday which meant "Taco Tuesday (all tacos are $2 each)." I had a crispy fish taco, that was good. The breading was crispy & the slaw that was on it was crisp as well. I also had a carne asada taco. The meat was a little dry, but it was still very good. We also had chips & salsa, and honestly all of this would have been a good meal. The tacos are pretty decently sized. 

However, since it was HH I ordered a quesadilla as well (intending to split it) and it was HUGE. It was thick, full of a ton of cheese, and was yummy. During HH Joyride does certain apps for $4 (the quesadilla was one of these) & $6. I saw a lot of people were ordering nachos & the platter they were served looked HUGE! 

I ordered a couple margs as well. I started w/a prickly pear even though I generally don't like flavored margaritas. Honestly, it was a bit sweet but still good. I also got a regular marg. It didn't stand out it in any way, but it was still good. 

The service at Joyride was good, as well. I'll come back!
