A Chipotle-style eatery with a Hawaiian flair. This place has now been added to the occasional lunch place rotation since it is right across the street from where I work. 

The staff were super friendly and helpful. I like that they let me sample the meat before I decided which way I wanted to go. I chose half steak and half chicken for my bowl. 

The place was clean and I liked the cozy booths that they had as a seating option. The only thing I was not a fan of was their sauce bar. They had a variety of sauces to try but they were extremely sweet. I prefer heat over a syrupy-sweet sauce on tacos and/or bowls. 

They were offering Groupons at one point, so be on the lookout for them to try, especially if you are near the UNLV campus often for lunch.
