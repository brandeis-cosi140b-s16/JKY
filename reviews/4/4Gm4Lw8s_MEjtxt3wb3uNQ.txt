This is for sure FAT MAN FRIENDLY dinning. $2 tacos that are tasty and aren't small either!! They can be brought up to your room via room service too (Still $2 but you need to order at least 4). The party I was with did what everyone else was doing and that was getting the nachos. They were big and packed with toppings. If you had a hard time figuring out what to order and you see that plate of nachos come out of the kitchen you will be instantly sold!! We also ordered their "Electric Fishbowl" which was over 100 oz. of tasty drunkenness!! They broke it down into two tubs to make it easier on us for sharing. With our $40 tab (including a very small tip) all 4 of us caught a buzz and our bellies were pretty damn full. They have a burger challenge I'm sure I'll have to come back and try out. If you are staying at Bally's I don't see why you shouldn't eat here at least once. 
***Would of gave it 5 stars but the service was slow*** (NOTE-it was right in the heart of lunch time on a Saturday so speedy service was not expected)
