Went here for late lunch. Had a togo order of two burgers, one with cheese, one with grilled onions, fries and a short rib taco. 
The wait wasn't too bad, about 10 minutes. If you want food fast, go to a burger chain. 

The burgers are good. Better than any chain.  If you are expecting the best burger in the world, you're expecting too much for around 6 bucks. They are good burgers and I think they are worth the price. 

The fries are....... Salty!  Yes after reading other reviews, I have to agree. They need to change their seasoning to have a third of the amount of salt that they use. It looks like it has other spices like pepper, but still way to much salt and I think they need to watch their temps on the fries as mine was overdone. 

The taco I had was the short rib taco. For almost $3 it is tiny. The meat was a little dry, and I'm not faulting anything else about it since mine was togo and food changes consistency when you wrap it in foil. They just need to watch how long they cook the rib meat.  Until they figure that out, you are better off buying another burger instead. 

I would definitely go back, and next time I would ask for fries with no salt and to watch the time on it in the fryer.
