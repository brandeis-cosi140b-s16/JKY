Very good service, family restaraunt so if you want quiet ask to sit away from the family's like we did.  Had pitron margaritas for $9.25.  Good but not as good as Jimmy Buffets Margaritaville.  Shared the enchilada trio and the street tacos.  All very good.  Unlimited nacho chips with two types of salsa.  Also very good and attentive staff.
