Yes, I do love Filibertos.  Yes I do !!!

I first ate at one of their stores in Albuquerque.  It was on the east side on Eubank and Constitution.  Wow, it was so awesome.  But back then, Phoenix seemed so far away.  I had never been there (here) and it was like a distant dream.  And, New Mexico is really a sweet, sweet place to be and live.

Anyway - I did come to Phoenix and now I live here in Mesa.  Fortunately, there is a Filiberto's right around the corner so to speak, on Southern.  I love this one, it is my favorite in all the valley.  So delicious and I have never been disappointed in any meal I got here.

Ok, so some people may complain about the 'service.'  What service??  it's a drive through.  There is no service except a couple of really busy guys trying to get through all the orders of people backed up in trucks, cars and standing there on foot in the 112 degree heat.  So, no.  There is no 'service.'  But, there is really good food at very decent prices.  I have to limit myself to once a month because I get a python effect, it takes me about a day to digest my way through a good meal.  I am like a dog tho, and if I didn't control myself I would be eating here every day.
