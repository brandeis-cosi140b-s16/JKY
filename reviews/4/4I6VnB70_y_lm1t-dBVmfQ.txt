Ridiculously good pizza with unique ingredients. Went with the larger size with half as the day's special (carnitas, pineapple, poblano, queso fresco) and half Forestiere (bacon, creme fraiche, melted Pleasant Ridge Reserve). Skipped the bacon cheese bread this time - it's a favorite from the Sun Prairie menu that's included at Johnson Street. 

Visited early - 5 PM on a Saturday to avoid the wait. The dining space was a little loud.
