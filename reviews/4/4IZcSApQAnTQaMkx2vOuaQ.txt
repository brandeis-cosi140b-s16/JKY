Fun place to go for a drink.  Nice open layout.  The bar has upstairs and downstairs levels - the lower level has games like cornhole and a giant Connect 4 set.  The house frozen margarita is deliciously limey with a nice layer of salt around the rim.  The food is on the pricey side.  The buffalo wings claim to be a "full pound", but at six pieces I'd be surprised if the dish weighed a half pound.  They are deliciously spicy, though - if you don't like too much fire, let the server know and they will tone it down for you.  The seafood street tacos were so small that we laughed when they were brought out.Good flavor, though.  The other street tacos are also small but tasty.  The best value is to order the 6 pack.  You can mix and match on the fillings.
