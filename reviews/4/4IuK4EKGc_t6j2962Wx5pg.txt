This was the first place that I ever tried Qdoba and I was hooked. I had never seen anything like this before and I was hesitant about trying it out but I had a friend who worked there so I figured, why not. Well. Got the steak fajita burrito which was terrific. 

The place is really clean and I do recall them serving beer here. The guacamole is delicious but I hate how it costs more to get it. The regular burritoes are good but I'm not really a beans fan so I usually get the steak fajita burrito.
