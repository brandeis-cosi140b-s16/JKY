we went for 1/2 off food after 11pm (the night before payday AND you're really hungry type of night) we enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere/music (crowded, but it's Oakland & we didn't have to wait for a table)  the service was great from the servers and hostess. I want to make sure to go back during regular hours and see how it is.. maybe with a little more cash on my debit card too to enjoy a margarita! :)
