If you wanna take me to get some Mexican, this is one of only three that I would pay for with my own money. This isn't gourmet or anything, but everything I have had here is super tasty, they have some of the best chips and salsa around, even if it is reused :)  It is kinda cramped inside when it is busy, but the seats are comfortable and it has been around for years and has some history.
