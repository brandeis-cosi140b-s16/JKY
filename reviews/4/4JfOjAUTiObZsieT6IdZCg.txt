Stopped by on the second day they were open, but it already feels like they've been here forever! Decor is sparse but comfortable, they've got a respectable amount of beers on tap as well as in bottles, but let's get to the important part.

The pizza is darn good. I got the carbonara, one of my friends got the fig and gorgonzola, the other got a salad, and we all split the burrata appetizer. The burrata was definitely the stand out-so creamy and fresh! Paired with roasted garlic, toasty bread, and cucumbers, it was definitely worth it! My carbonara was also delicious. The eggs wre a bit more raw than I like, but I also don't usually go for runny eggs with brunch so I'm probably in the minority there. The bacon was awesome, and the arugala was a great touch! Tried the fig and gorgonzola, and it would be perfect for those who love the combo of savory and sweet. Not my jam, but I still enjoyed it regardless! Can't really comment on the salad other than it looked fresh, but why would you go for that when you could get pizza??

All in all, I know where I'm going now when I am craving an unique pizza in Madison!
