After a LONG day of travel and an unexpected 2 hour stop in Charlotte, a fresh option like Salsarita's was a nice surprise for airport food. I'm a fan of the "build your own burrito" concept, so that helps... I know it's not everyone's idea of a great meal.

I had never actually heard of Salsarita's, but judging by the previous reviews, it must be a chain... and apparently this airport "Express" location doesn't have all of the usual options. That's okay - they had everything I needed, including various meats, beans, salsas, and veggie toppings. 

It was definitely a much better choice, tase-wise, than the Papa John's and Burger King located on either side. The line was much shorter, too. Honestly, for about $6 for a huge burrito, it's a great airport food option. A small can of Pringles costs $3 on a plane, after all.
