I've eaten at this place two times.  First time, food was good and service was great.  Second time....OMG!
Went there with a $30 Groupon with a friend.  First off, the waited didn't speak but a few words of English.  Are you kidding?  
We finally get the order straight with our no hable Ingles friend, the waiter, which, by the way, took some time.  But we weren't in a hurry and it was ok.
Food was surprisingly okay again.  No complaints there.
Then we get the bill:  $27.63 on the bill.  We give him the $30 Groupon which more than covers it plus a $5 tip.
He comes back with another BILL for the balance of $2.37 and stands there.  Being engrossed in a conversation, we didn't get why he was standing there WAITING FOR MORE MONEY when we should have gotten more back.  Finally my friend gives him another $2 just to get rid of him.
For gosh sakes, Rancho Papa Chulo, hire someone who speaks some English at least.  
I'd give the food really a B+ cause it was pretty darn good both times, but the service the second time was really an F+.
Just for clarification:  1st time I ate there I had the fajitas, 2nd time I had the quesodillas with fajita meat.
