I know there are already tons of reviews for Mi Patio, but I wanted to throw my two cents in because I love this place so much! 
This is my go to local restaurant - they serve consistently good food, it's pretty inexpensive, and it's only a few blocks from my house. Now, I'm the first to admit that I'm not much of a food snob, but when I want delicious, no-frills Mexican food and a cheap margarita, this is the place to be.  Don't get me wrong, they do have tons of unique offerings on their menu, but they haven't forgotten about the old classics. Luckily, they provide chips and salsa  to keep you company while you mull over the menu - there are a lot of great things to choose from. Some favorites are the quesapilla (like a sopapilla, but cheesy), the salmon flauta (served with this crazy-tasty pesto sauce), and the Baja Chicken Chimi (cheesy, fried, baja sauce-smothered goodness). Oh, and there was also a time when I was totally addicted to their beef tacos. I mean truly addicted - I craved those things like my sis craved peanut butter and Cheez-its the last time she was pregnant. And it didn't help that their take out taco special is only 6 bucks for two tacos, rice, and beans. Yum.
P.S. I also have to mention that the service is great, the food gets to you super quick, and you never have an empty drink for long.
