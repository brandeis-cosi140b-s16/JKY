The original fish taco's...yum, my favorite! I have also tried other things here and enjoyed them all. But my go to is their original taco, hold the cabbage. 

The only non positive thing I have to say is that I am not a fan of any of their salsas. But that ok because everything I have had doesn't need them.

If you are looking for something affordable and tasty this is a good pick!
