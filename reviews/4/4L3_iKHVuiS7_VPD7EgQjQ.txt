It's got a panda that looks like Pancho Villa.  That's an A+ in my book for style.  The food ranges from "That was okay" to "That was awesome."  Serving time, really quick.  I'm not down with their cookies, but my friends think I'm insane for thinking this, so perhaps it is just me.  Thumbs up for serving cookies though - if you're going to mix Mexican and Asian food, why the heck not add cookies?  Overall, good price, good food, Panda with guns.
