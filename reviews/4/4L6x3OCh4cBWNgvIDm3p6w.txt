Los Favoritos makes the best breakfast burritos that I have tasted so far!!! I get the egg, potato, and cheese burrito. The eggs are fluffy, the cheese plentiful, and the potatoes are FRENCH FRIES! If thats not love, I dont know what is. Haha. I love mixing their green and red sauces on my burrito to make a christmas sauce. Their burritos are not huge but a pretty good size and a pretty cheap breakfast when you compare to how much you would pay to get full at McDonalds or Wendy's. The only issue I have is that they don't speak much english there. Other than that, the breakfast burro with no meat is great and the atmosphere, although a little plain, is clean which is one of my biggest fears in little taco shops like this. I have been to some Filibertos that I felt were not very clean and honestly was a little skeptical to even try Los Fav's. Now that I have, I will have to give more of these little taco's shops a try and start listening to the hub a little more!
