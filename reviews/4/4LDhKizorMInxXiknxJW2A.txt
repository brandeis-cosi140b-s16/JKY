My roommate at Vista Del Sol was raving about this place so I figured I'd give it a shot.  I was very impressed.

I love chipotle so I figured I'd love this place too, and I was right.  I've only been twice but both times were very good experiences.
 
First time I had the pork carnitas on the workers recommendation and I was not disappointed.  Seasoned perfectly, and tasted awesome.

My second time I had the breakfast burrito, for $5.30 this was an absolute steal!  Cheese, eggs, beans, potatoes, salsa and your choice of meat (highly recommend the chorizo).  Very good!

And when you sit down they have numerous hot sauces for you to use, thought that was kind of neat.

All in all, highly recommend this place.  Only down sides are it's only one person working so it takes awhile if theres a line and they stop serving breakfast burritos at 2.
