My sister dragged me here tonight and our dining experience did not start off well. We were seated and ignored for about 15 minutes. Other tables were being served so we were wondering what the French was going on! Our waiter took our order he said he would comp our drinks and apologized. I appreciated the gesture and I was over being upset about waiting. I ordered the red chile with rice and beans and sour cream on the side. When I got my meal they forgot the tortillas and my sour cream. The waiter apologized again and said he wouldn't charge me extra for the sour cream. When I took the first bite of my meal I forgot about the bad service and remembered that I come to Sylvia's for the best Mexican food in town and not for the service. The food is worth the crappy service.
