I tried the pastor, asada, and pollo tacos. All three were good, but the pastor tacos were clearly the winners. Also loved the watermelon agua frescas. Need to try other things on the menu but so far tacos are terrific. 
One additionally note: The parking area is small and the rooms inside are pretty small.  But this shouldn't be a reason not to try great Mexican food.
