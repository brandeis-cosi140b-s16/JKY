My mama & I came here this afternoon for lunch. Walking up to the door  I could smell wonderful food being made. It was pretty crowded on the main side of the restaurant so we were seated on the pretty much empty side. But that was fine with us, we wanted to chat any way. 

Mom ordered her usual sprite & I ordered an arnold palmer. Sprite came in a can, eh. Arnold palmer was very tangy, good-but I've had better. For our entrees: mom ordered the ensalada cortada & I ordered the carne asada burrito with a side of white rice. Mom didn't really care too much for her salad, I thought it was pretty good though & helped her eat it. In exchange she had about a third of my burrito, which she loved. The carne asada was so tender & flavorful, it was so yummy I finished almost the entire thing which is rare for me. The rice was good but a bit over cooked & on the dry side.

I would love to come back & try: the guacamole everyone raves about, fish tacos & amazing sounding chocolate pudding! :)
