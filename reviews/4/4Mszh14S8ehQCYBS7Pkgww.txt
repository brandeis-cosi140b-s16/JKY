My first time here, and I have to say I think this is one of the better Mexican joints in the Anthem/Carefree area.  I had the Deluxe burrito with picadillo beef.  I thought the beef was very tasty and the burrito was a good size as well.  I also shared an order of nachos with my brother and they were delicious!  I think the nachos could have used more guacamole but that's about it.  There were 6 of us at dinner and everyone enjoyed their meals.  It's a bit small inside too, but was busy, so you might have to wait but overall I was pleased. I'll be going back.
