Everyone knows that the barbeque pork is their best meat. And, I eat it every time I'm here. But recently, I discovered their nacho cheese. It's ridiculously good. They give you about 2 servings of cheesy dip that is creamy, salty but well rounded, and has specks of salsa in it. And they give you a whole plate of chips. I'm not a big fan of gringo food but I have to admit that Cafe Rio does gringo food good!

Oh and yes, this cheese goes directly to your thighs.
