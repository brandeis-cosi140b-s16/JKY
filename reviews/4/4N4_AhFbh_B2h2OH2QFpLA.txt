Whenever I'm in the mood for a delicious big burrito, this is where I go. This location of Chipotle is on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Warm Springs Rd so it's relatively easy to get into and out of, which I like. I feel like it doesn't matter what time I arrive at Chipotle, there's always a long line, but for the most part, the line moves quickly. I once ordered online to pick up at this location, but I still had to wait to jump in and pay for my meal. In fact, when I online ordered, they hadn't even made it yet so they made my burrito quickly.

The food is yummy, like most Chipotles, and the price is reasonable for the amount of food that you get in return. I always take my burrito to go, but glancing at the rest of the restaurant and I see that it is usually clean though filled with people eating. The downside to this location is that it opens at 11 am (boo!) and there is always a line. But hey, it's totally worth it for a Chipotle burrito so I don't mind.
