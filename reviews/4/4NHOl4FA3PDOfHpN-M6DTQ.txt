Went for the dinner buffet.  Not the best selection of food, but it was sitll pretty good.  I stuck with the chicken fajita mixture which was pretty good and some kind of green chili chicken.  The beans looked like they had been sitting out for a while though so i stayed away from those.  The rice was pretty standard mexican rice, but still adequate.  The salsas were good, but they didnt offer any chips, which i was pretty bummed about.  For $8.99 i got my money's worth, but limited in terms of variety.  If i went back, ill probably order something from the menu.
