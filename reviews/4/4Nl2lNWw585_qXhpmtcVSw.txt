Driving passed the place you may think it looks sort of sketchy, but believe me, it's so worth. If you like authentic Mexican food, this is the place for you. Not may places like this exist in the 'Burgh (the last I remember was Taco Loco in the South Side, which is now closed) so it's worth the drive. The menu is huge and not too pricey either. Always check for the lunch specials as well because you can find some good deals. Another plus is the free chips before/during your meal. The exterior isn't anything special, and definitely reflects what you see on the outside. To be honest, it sort of looks like they just transformed a house into a restaurant. However, I think that's how the place gets its charm.
