Talk about GOOD food! I first tried Espo's back in April 2006, I had just moved here and was tired from unpacking so I ventured out and came across (almost missed it though, it can be a bit hard to spot) Espo's, decided to stop in because the little mom n pop hole in the wall places always have good food.

I've been continuing to eat here for the last seven years. Sure, it's decorated a little cheesy and it's the kind of place that, sometimes I think, I probably don't want to know how (un)clean the kitchen is, but damn is it good food. 

I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered there and will continue to go and recommend it to my friends looking for good, authentic, Mexican food.
