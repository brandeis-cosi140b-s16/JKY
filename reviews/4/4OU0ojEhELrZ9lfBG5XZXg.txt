My girlfriend is not a big fan.  Yet her mistake is thinking of this as a Mexican restaurant.  I would instead call it, 'mexican themed.'  If you go in and say, this isn't going to be a typical Mexican restaurant but instead mixes mexican dishes with different ingredients, it's really good.  Got the garbanzo bean stew and the taquitos.  Yum.  Price is right, too.
