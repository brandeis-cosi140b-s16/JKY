Similar to Chipotle, Qdoba and the rest of that ilk, Rubios is a quick service Mexican restaurant, that, in addition to burritos, offers enchiladas, fish tacos, and more.  Think Baja Fresh, but with more options and a bit more delicious. 

Prices were good, the service was great (they offered to fresh cook me just mushrooms and peppers with no onions), and the food was out fairly quickly.

They have a salsa bar with mild yet delicious chipotle salsa and salsa verde, and it's all you can salsa (if you take it to go, they have to go cups as well).

Food was good.  Not quite amazing, and I personally prefer Chipotle, but Rubio's is definitely delicious and was worth a stop on the way from Phoenix to Tucson.  I'll be keeping my eyes open for more in Phoenix.
