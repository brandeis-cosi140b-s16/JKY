I've been going to this restaurant chain for the past four years and love it because of it being 24 hours opened right in my neighborhood. Warning: this is not for those health conscious and is more for those who need a late night Mexican fix and want something better than Taco Bell. Health nuts should just get cucumber from the salad bar or should already be home asleep after a night of clubbing. 



My go-to meal is the carne asada burrito. My cousin's go-to meal are the carne asada fries (and trust me they don't stiff you at all on the carne asada unlike other restaurants). Before, I would sometimes get the carne asada chimi chonga meal but no longer. 

The facility is clean; they always have a stocked up bar of salsa, lime and fresh cucumber.
