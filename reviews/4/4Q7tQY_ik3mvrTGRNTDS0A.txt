Working in the Capitol area for 15 years, La Canasta Capitolio is a must. There are very few places to eat near the Capitol, but La Canasta not only provides a place for a bite to eat, but some good food as well. I don't like veggies, so I generally stick to the red chili beef burrito, which is very good.  Prices are reasonable, too. I think their main business comes from the government workers in the area, and lot's of police and fifi's (firefighters).  If the PD and fifi's eat there, it must be good.  Free chips and salsa (very GOOD salsa) is a definite plus! Also, I've heard their breakfast burrito's are excellent.
