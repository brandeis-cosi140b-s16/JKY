I keep meaning to explore more restaurants on the South Side, yet I'm failing due to the unerring pull of Yo Rita.  Their tacos are interesting, fresh and delicious.  My personal favorites are the pork belly and the calamari.  I tend to always order their special taco of the day, which varies from good to great.  One particularly impressive concoction was the meatloaf taco, including gravy and (of course) fries.  Yes, fries.  On a taco.  Only in Pittsburgh!
