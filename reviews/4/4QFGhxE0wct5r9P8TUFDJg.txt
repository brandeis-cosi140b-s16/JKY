Rubio's can be found in the shopping center at Eastern & Serene with the Ross' and Home Depot. It is the far south east corner near Papa Johns.

I love their fish taco's! The fish is Pollock that has been dipped in a beer batter and fried to perfection. I don't find it too oily at all. You can pick between corn or flour tortillas, I chose corn. The original is topped with cabbage, salsa and some white sauce.. cheese maybe? Not too sure what it is, but it is delicious! The Especial comes with gaucamole, onions & cilantro and cheese. The plate comes with a side of their "no fried" beans and chips. I changed out the beans for their side of rice. I found these sides to be kind of small in servings. My boyfriend added a side rice to his and it was only $.50, but it was small. You can also switch it out with black beans as well.

I found the establishment to be very clean. They have a salsa bar near the fountain drinks. They have 4 different salsas. Salsa verde, picante, mild salsa, and chipotle. They also had an onion/cilantro mixture, and of course pickled peppers & carrots (like robertos!)

Service is quick and they are very helpful. 

I haven't tried anything else yet, because I really like their world's famous fish tacos.. but they also have mahi and chili lime salmon and shrimp. They also have chicken and beef for all you non-seafood lovers out there. Their food is very fresh and their tortillas are pretty awesome too!
