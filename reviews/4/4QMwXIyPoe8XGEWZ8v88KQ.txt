Service is pretty fast.  Nothing special in regards to the employee's I like the food.  I got a Tostada bowl, man it was delish.  I loved how light, crispy and airy the shell was!  It had chese, sour cream, and guacamole on it.  It's a very nice size, enough to split it.  I also tried there nachos!  OMG, I love nachos.  And these were enough to share as well.    I It's my new favorite salad and some nachos
