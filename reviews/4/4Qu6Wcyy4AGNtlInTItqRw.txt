I visited Chicago Style Taco Shop today for the first time, intrigued by it being "Chicago style". The food did not disappoint, nor did the service. Joe warmly welcomed my friend and I to the shop and was happy to share information about the different menu items. The flavorful sauces were icing on the cake!
