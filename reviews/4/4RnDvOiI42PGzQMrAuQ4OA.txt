I came to Cabo Wabo to use a Groupon ($30 worth of food for $15) and because, frankly, I was intrigued by the schizophrenic Yelp reviews for the place. I had an early lunch around 11:30 am on a Wednesday and sat outside to watch people walk by on the Strip.

I had a pretty good experience at Cabo Wabo. The Cactus Pear Margarita was surprisingly tasty, and I'm not always a big fan of margs. I had the guacamole (not as great as some were saying, but pretty decent) and the jalapeno cilantro chicken. Nothing was spectacular, but nothing was terrible either.

To me, the big downer on Cabo Wabo is the price. But come on, it's right on the Las Vegas Strip - what do you expect? My drink, guac, and entree came to $34, so I used up my Groupon and then some. Between the price of the Groupon and the amount I paid in tax/tip, the whole experience ran me around $26. Without the Groupon it would have been $41, which seems awfully high for one person. However, Cabo Wabo does have a happy hour from 4-7 pm with half-price drinks and appetizers. I'd imagine that would be worth your time - if you can get a seat.
