I come to Rubio's for one thing, the herb garlic shrimp tacos with bacon. I was craving these and I was on this end of town so I stopped by. This Rubio's has great seating (inside and out) and super friendly service. They were also sampling food options as you waited for your food. How awesome is that?!
