Excellent! The CC Sizzle is delicious. I meant to share it with the hubby but it tasted so good ... I finished the whole thing! Hubby had the Chilaquiles. It was tasty but the eggs were scrambled so not my favorite. They make everything from scratch so we had to wait a bit for our food but it was worth it!
