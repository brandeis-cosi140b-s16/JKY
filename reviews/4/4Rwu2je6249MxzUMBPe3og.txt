I ordered the ground beef nachos with queso. They were really good and spicy and my friend also mentioned how there was adequate toppings and the chips stay crispy.  Got guac on ths side but totally not necessary. I could barely finish  it.  Mens bathroom apparently was a nightmare(took away a star)  vomit in sink,urine and feces on floor  :/  womens bathroom was fine.  FYI Get a free meal on your birthday if you sign up for their emails
