I had a date at Lindo Michoacan on NYE, even against the warnings of some friends who said the Centennial location isn't as good as the other Michoacan restaurants in town. The way I looked at it, if the date was going well, we probably wouldn't be paying much attention to our meals anyway! We were tended to in a very friendly manner, the entire time. I was se√±orita'd a handful of times which always makes me giggle on the inside. I'm not a burrito kinda girl but my date's grande burrito looked delicious! &, well, grande. I made sure to be as generic as possible & got the chicken enchiladas combo plate. The rice had alot of potential but it was crunchy, I had a couple bites of the beans which were good, the enchiladas could've been saucier but the chicken was seriously so darn juicy & flavorful, I ended up picking thru most of the tortilla & going straight for the pollo! I so wished I could've eaten the 2nd enchilada. But!, here's what really impressed me... Knowing it was NYE, I called earlier in the day to check how late they'd be open (I saw alot of places were closing at 8 & 9) & was told they'd be closing at 10. My date & I are talking & talking & talking & it hits me that the place is QUIET. We look around & see we are literally the only people left so I check the time... it was 10:40! We thought it was awfully kind that not a single person did so much as hover to indicate it was time to get the hell out... 40 minutes ago! That sort of thing goes a long way for me. Overall, I'd definitely go back (not overstaying my welcome!) & recommend to others.
