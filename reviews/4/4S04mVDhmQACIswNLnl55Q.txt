I have eaten here for 15 years, and I always get the same thing, the Chicken Melt. It is chicken, cheese, tomatoes, avacado, and bacon melted on a crispy tortilla, I love it. It also comes with yummy charro beans. Some of the servers are slow but it's worth the wait. They have a large window looking into the kitchen, that's always a plus.
