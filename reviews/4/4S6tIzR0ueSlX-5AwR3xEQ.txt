Ok here's an update. Just to give a little back info the owner of JJ emailed me through yelp because he was concerned about my low review and bad experience.  I thought that was kind of impressive he would actually care that much. He was nice and I had kind of forgotten about it.

Well it was a really pretty day in AZ and I happened to be in the neighborhood so I decided to give it another try. Maybe it could have been an isolated incident and I don't like to be an evil yelper. I choose to sit outside since it was so nice and I was immediately helped and got a drink fast ( good start ).  Ordered the veggie tacos which came out promptly.  This was about the same time I ate here last time just for reference. Taylor my waiter informed me there is a salsa bar so I headed inside to grab some salsa verde.

The tacos were quite good as well as the rice and salsa verde. I'm not usually a fan of black beans, but they really were nice. I would give it 3.5 stars for food, but maybe since I am in a good mood today and Taylor was a very cheerful and excellent waiter I am going with 4.

I'll be back, but so far seems like I just hit them on a bad day last time.
