IT AIN'T PRETTY BUT THE TACOS ARE SOMETHING ELSE

We must have been their big catch of the day.  One lady is munching on her two 99 cents tacos with no sides, three ladies were talking in broken Spanish about the restaurant while ordering nothing from the counter and visiting the restroom. And here we are waiting for our Chicken Taco & Chicken Enchilada for $6.50 plus a Chili Verde Plate for $7.75. Not to forget two large fruit drinks. Just in front of us is one of the help asleep (looked like he was recovering from the morning rush of released inmates) in front of the TV with Clemson playing at Maryland. BTW, across the street is the Henderson Detention Center, but no cops in sight. Do you get the picture ?

This is not a fancy Michoacan restaurant by any means. If you really want to know how sparse, even a Taco Bell seems fancier. Roberto's would the opposite extreme. So don't complain about the prison cell ambience. It's a place to pick up your cheap meal and eat behind your desk or at home. Wonder if the inmates across the street are thinking the same?  LoL

Loved my pan fried chicken taco and enchilada. Chili verde plate was exaggeratedly much too tasty as Yu-go chauffeur finds out later. He's drinking water like he had been lost in a desert without water for three days and nights.

SRTS has another location on the south side of Lake Mead Parkway on the way to the Lake. Looking forward to trying their Tuesday only Breakfast Burrito for $2.99. The 99 cent tacos are available everyday and so is their Ground Beef Burrito for just $2.50. With all the construction going on at the gigantic Cadence housing development, it should be an early Xmas for that other location.
