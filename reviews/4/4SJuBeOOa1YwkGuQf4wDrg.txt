Came here for a late Sunday lunch and paid under $20 for two people.  Their lunch menu is great - almost every dish was $6.99!  Good chips.  Salsa was ok.  The Mole Poblano Enchiladas were very good (not a lot of places know how to make a good mole sauce which is a rich, dark chocolate colored sauce and is made with onion, garlic, a variety of chiles and a little bit of chocolate - savory and delicious! ).  I wasn't too crazy about their black beans (and I normally love black beans)  it tasted a little off.  Although I did like their refried (pinto) beans.  Overall, it was great place to grab an inexpensive and satisfying lunch.
