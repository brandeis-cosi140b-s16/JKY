I ate lunch here alone while my husband was in a conference and it was perfectly okay.  Served 3 salsas with my chips - all delicious and different, the agave margarita was delicious and obviously hand-made (not cloying-sweet sweet-n-sour mix).  I had the steak fajitas - I measure all good Mexican joints by their ability to serve me steak and peppers - and this one measured up.  Great food, friendly service.  As a feminist, I worry about women who have to wear skimpy clothes to work, as many of the servers here do (I know - it's Vegas - but still, have we not established that women have brains instead of just bodies?).  My waitress wore black pants and a black t-shirt and was perfectly pleasant.  This was a solid place to eat and a great value for the Vegas strip.
