Had my Daughters graduation from NAU/Mothers day dinner. I hate black beans and my dish came with it. I can happily say I will eat thier beans any day! My seafood enchilada was packed. Most places would be skimpy. Service was fast as we had 12 guest. Our party had absolutley no complaints and we all left very happy.
