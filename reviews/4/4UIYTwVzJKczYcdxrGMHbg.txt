This place is pretty awesome. The ambience is cute, the service is friendly and incredibly fast, and the food is good and really affordable. I've never been dissapointed by anything I've ever ordered here.
I have no idea what "real" Mexican food tastes like having been born and raised here in the midwest but from what I've had of Mexican food this is one of the places I like best.
