We went for a drive today and got hungry and decided to try Penasco's.  I was a little apprehensive to try a strip mall Mexican joint in Maricopa but I am glad we did.

The place is on the small side, the layout is a little awkward but it is nicely decorated

The salsa is very good.  It is chunky, but not like pico.  My wife thought it tasted a little cooked but still had plenty of fresh notes.

My wife had the chicken salad.  The chicken was flavorful, The salad had a great mix of fresh greens, avocado, pickled onion and carrot.  The mango dressing was a little sweet but it was good.  Other dressing are available but my wife had hers with a little sour cream and the salsa.

I had the two enchilada plate and basically let the server choose for me.  He suggested shredded beef and stated the green chili and the vodka cream sauces were a specialty and I could have it half and half which I did.  It was a great choice.

I couldn't really choose a favorite between the two but they were both a nice departure from the typical red sauce and beef was great.  The refried beans and rice were good but nothing special.

The kids had a chicken quesadilla. It is shredded chicken and cheese served open faced.  They liked it.

At first I thought our server was a little disinterested but when I asked him about the Penasco beans as I was paying he said he would bring me a sample to try and said there were quite good.  He brought a to go container for them.  It turns out he is just kind of laid back and really won me over.

I tried the beans later and there were great, whole pinto beans and chorizo in a flavorful broth, it was almost like an excellent bean soup.  Next time I will get these instead of the refried beans.
