I know its a chain, I also know its not authenic Mexican food, but every now and again I get a Taco Bell craving I just have to satisfy!
Plus if you make some wise menu choices, you can eat good without ingesting a whole lot of fat grams. For example, I get 2 steak soft tacos fresco style which is pico de gallo instead of cheese and sour cream. The pico is very good and you can taste the fresh cilantro. This drops the fats grams to only 4 each. Add a side of rice (only 3 fat grams)  cover in fire sauce and add an unsweet tea or diet coke and you eatin' good for only 11 grams of fat! Pretty good from a fast food joint, huh? I also get a side of guacamole that really good, but I don't count it as it has it has all the good kinds of fats that are good for you! A win win situation.
I aslo thinks its pretty damn tasty! Thats right, I said it, I LIKE TACO BELL!!
Plus most locations I have been in are clean and the counter service is friendly.
I don't eat here once a week or even once a month, but when the craving does hit, I'm  thinking outside the box and making a run for the border!
