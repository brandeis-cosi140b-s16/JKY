I have been going to Mi Patio for about 8 years. Yes, many boyfriends accompanied me and now my husband ;) 

The place is CONSISTENTLY GOOD. Which you cannot say for a lot of places. I almost always, for 8 years, have gotten the spinach chimi with feta cream sauce. Yummy! It comes with rice but I always get rice and beans as I like to mix em! 

I have also gotten their chicken guacamole tacos here too, they are good as well, tons of fresh guac! 

My husband gets the spinach enchiladas as he dares to be different from me, he loves them as well. 

The margaritas are cheap, not a lot of alcohol, but refreshing none the less and two of the big ones do suffice, I think they are $2.75. 

The chips are not my favorite but the salsa, albeit mild, is super tasty and always fresh. The service is usually good and sometimes the server will bring you free fruity shots for dessert. The sort of shot is never known, it's free, I don't ask, never has a roofie in it. 

Love Mi Patio!
