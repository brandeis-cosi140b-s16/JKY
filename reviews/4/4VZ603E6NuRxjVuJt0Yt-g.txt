Great tacos and burritos!  Visiting the restaurant in Goodyear.  Lots of parking space available with available outdoor seating.  Restaurant was spacious and well lit.  Staff were friendly.  Service was prompt.  Food was fresh and tasty.  Loved their sauce bar where you can help yourself to their various hot sauces.  Particularly like the variety in the menu with fish options!  Definitely will be back to try it all.
