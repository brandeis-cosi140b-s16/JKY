I love chipotle and tend to only eat at this location  , my food is always yummy and filled to the brim . Occasionally I will get a stale bag of chips , but I tend to eat them anyways. On my recent trip it was about 8:30pm and everything was great . The best part was I decided to order a bag of chips and I saw them coming straight out of the grease . Seriously that was the highlight of my night . I watched them squeeze fresh lime and salt over them and carefully pour me a serving in a brown bag . Absolutely delicious ... If you ever  seen them cooking fresh chips runnnn and grab a bag . You won't be disappointed .
