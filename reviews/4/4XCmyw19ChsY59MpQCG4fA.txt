I come here for lunch all the time! Clean, orderly authentic restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere. Lots of room for groups and the staff is always friendly. Price is a little higher compared to other fast food style Mexican restaurants in the area (about $10/person for a full combo meal) but worth it. Carnitas is the best meat on the menu (al pastor and carne asada are sub-par)
