I was a skeptic of this chain at first, I blame that on the South Park skit, now I might just be a fan.

I am surprised by how fast the food is prepped and how fresh it tastes.  The portion size is something kind of huge.  I can't believe how much there was.  Enough for me to eat two meals from.  

Not really much more I can say about this place that hasn't already been said by previous yelpers.  Did I mention this was my first visit to one of their establishments?
