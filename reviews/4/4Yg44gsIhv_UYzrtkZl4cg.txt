My family and I absolutely LOVE this place! Their food never fails us. Its always hot, fresh and full filling. Their portions always leave us in a coma! Lol! The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star is because its always packed. Most times we have to wait 5-10 mins for a table. With the business they get, they really need to open a bigger spot. But other then that, they are the best Mexican food joint out here in STV, hands down:)
