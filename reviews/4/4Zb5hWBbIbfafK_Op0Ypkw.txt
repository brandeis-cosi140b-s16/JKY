Called Del Torta Mexican Grill now.  

My local spot for yummy CA burritos, carne asada fries/nachos, and tacos!
I've never actually eaten inside, but when I do come in  to pick up my take out orders it always seems clean.

They are very polite on the phone and always make sure that I know where I'm ordering....  And they are SOOOO quick.

The menu offers a lot of good stuff... that I have yet to try because Mexican food is one of my faves!!! BUT... I always result to my CA carne asada burrito w/ extra avocado... OR my carne asada fries/ or nachos... whichever i feel like.. and occasionally I'll order Carne Asada tacos... or Chicken tacos.

I'm never unsatisfied or turned off by the food.  It's always yummy!
