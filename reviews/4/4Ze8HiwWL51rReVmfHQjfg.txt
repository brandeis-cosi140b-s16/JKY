This place is solid little find for BBQ.  I know everyone talks about the burritos, but I've been addicted to the brisket sandwich!! 1/2lb Brisket Sandwich add a scoop of slaw!! Man I've been telling myself I'd order a burrito each time I've come back but I have always gone to the brisket sandwich lol.  Great BBQ spot in the groves on Val Vista near 202 (north side).  I wish they did Ribs on more days then just Saturday.  They make there own BBQ sauces and they are amazing.  Only thing I'd like to see there is a good Potato Salad and some baked beans would be some awesome additions, only sides offered now is Macaroni Salad, Cole Slaw, Chips and Salsa.  All in all I'd recommend J Bucks if want some great tasting BBQ but they only have Brisket and Pulled Pork and Ribs on Saturdays.  So not many options but the Brisket is really good.  I can't speak on the Burros but the BBQ is worth stopping in for :-)
