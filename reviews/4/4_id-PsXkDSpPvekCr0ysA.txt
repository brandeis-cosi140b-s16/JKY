Absolutely, love this place..   I gone twice, and have not been disappointed!  First time I had:

-Pinches Combo which consist of  3 street tacos with our choice of meats (I choose Carne Asada).  Served with Rice, Pinto beans, and some chips
-Cheese Enchiladas
-Mexican Corn



The second time:

-Tostadas
-Mexican Corn
-Side of Rice

The tostadas are so fresh, and the crunch of the corn tortilla was legit!  So yummy, and they were not stingy with the carne asada.. The corn, well it is just mouthwatering, and I crave it all day!!!  Perfect flavors.  Sometimes Mexican corn can be too much, but they get it right every time...

Overall, my experience there has always been awesome!  Prices could be a little cheaper, but you can't put a price on authenticity..  The workers make it feel like your walking into their home kitchen.  

I love that it's in container park as it's an amazing place to be.  Last night, I felt like I was somewhere else, almost like a mini Pike Place in Seattle or Pier 39 in San Francisco (without the water of course) .  Its a perfect combination of Urban meets Art Gallery...
