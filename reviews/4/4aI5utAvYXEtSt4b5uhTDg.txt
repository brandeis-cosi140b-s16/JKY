I've been going here for a few years, so I figured it was time for a review.  I usually get rolled beef tacos with guac.  8 out of 10 times I go, the food is spot on, but the other 2 times, it seems a little "off". Like maybe the rolled tacos were deep fried too long or the meat was old or the oil needed changing.  That's my only criticism.   If they were more consistent, I'd give them 5 stars.

The salsa bar is really good and they even keep it stocked during breakfast hours.  Their breakfast deluxe burrito is enough to feed two people and if you slice up some of their grilled chiles on it, you'll be in heaven (with a hot mouth).

Another favorite is the Carne Asada Torta.  Not a lot of places can do homestyle Mexican food right, but Senor Taco has AWESOME Tortas.

The food is reasonably priced, the staff is always friendly and the dining area is always clean.
