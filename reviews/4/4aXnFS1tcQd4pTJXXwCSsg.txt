I was suprised this place is way better then philumberto and all the other .....umberto's places! I got a carnaesata burger witch was amazing! And I got a chicken burrito! The place was clean it's not a high end resturant and some people may think it's dirty because people have wrote on the walls, when I was there it was very clean nothing on the floors or tables. The food is inexpensive and good! I think I found my quite little mexican spot when I come to visit here!
