Its 11:30 on Friday night and had to go pick daughter up from her job, and we started talking and she said she was starving, and I said ME TOO buy me some food,,,yea she just got paid LOL we were in the mood for something spicy (but that's a normal thing for us) and she said Mom you should try Moreno's, now I have driven past it many of times and never gave it any thought. So I said well since your buying I can't be choosey right? So we went to Morenos, now I don't know when this place closes, but let me tell you at 11:30 is was still poppin, we went inside and placed our order, I got the carne asada burrito enchilada style and a big bottle of sprite, my daughter got a bean n cheese burrito and a fresa (strawberry drink that sort of like strawberry milk). We were taking the food to go, so I loaded up on the salsa and wanted to try the green guac sauce, man glad I did, that guac sauce was delish, mad that I didn't get more LOL We got our food and was headed out, but I swung by the guy grilling dogs outside, man they looked and smelled so good gonna have to try one of them next time! For a late night snack or grub this is the place to go, the food was great, the service was friendly and fast and the place has a nice vibe to it. ...
