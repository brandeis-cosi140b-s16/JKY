One of the things I've missed most about Las Vegas, Roberto's is the perfect cure for a night out on the town. We visited this location right after we landed and I think it's new since we were last here. Very bright and clean inside and, of course, the food was as delicious and greasy as always. I'm partial to the chips and guacamole but, as I recall, everything hits the spot.
