If you want fancy high end Mexican food (that isn't very authentic) don't eat here.  If you want homestyle Mexican food that isn't fast food (a la Filberto's) then this is the place you have been looking for.  They have a number of locations and all of them seem pretty consistent.

The breakfast burritos are fantastic but everything on the menu is good.  This particular location doesn't have a lot of seating, but the take out service is good.  Looking for a meal to bring home.  Los Favs has you covered.
