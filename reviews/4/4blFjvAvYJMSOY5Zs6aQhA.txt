since I cannot show my face in Gallo Blanco ever again, this has now become my fave gourmex establishment where they will trade food for $!

the tacos are good. the salsa is better. the only downfall, is NO ALCOHOL! ...which may be why I am still able to show my face in here...and perhaps why the hairspray is not sticky... NO ALCOHOL!
