Think of it as Vida's more casual, laid back little sister. (I was going to say loose and realized wait that sounds completely inappropriate)

Vida is a restaurant that just happens to have a bar. Vida Vida is a bar that just happens to have food.

Tons of flat screen tvs, roll up garage doors, canned beers, frozen drinks, fish bowls, music... it's a super fun vibe. Burritos, tacos, salads, chips and the usual suspects. Tacos come individually or in platters. Bring some friends and go the platter route. It's a much better deal. My personal fav is the Philly Cheesesteak. Drink-wise, I go with the Spicy Jalapeno Margarita. A mix of spicy and sweet. 

Sundays usually feature a DJ. Monday is karaoke night. Tuesday is We Run Uptown... Charlotte's latest run club. I'll pass on the running. Just give me a taco. Although, I heard you get free chips and salsa afterwards. Still not enough to make me want to run.

My latest venture here was to kickoff birthday celebrations on Saturday night. The place was packed and we had a large crew. Two birthday girls.... two groups of friends... one table. I was a little worried, but the service was great. 

It's the EpiCentre, so pull up a table on the patio and enjoy the show. The only thing that makes people watching better: chips, salsa and tacos.
