My son told us about this place and what a wonderful treat this was.  We live in Tucson but go to Phoenix quite frequently because our son lives there so we try new restaurants there as well.  This place has an unusual twist as it is certainly Mexican but with the Greek influence.  My first impression when we walked in was it seemed clean, warm and extremely friendly.  The service was super.  Three people and three bowls of chips and yummy salsa for each of us.  The chips were warm and obviously home made.  The menu is outstanding and interesting choices.  I had the carne asada which had  a hint of lemon and gave it the flavor of a gyro.  My hubby ordered Eggplant enchilladas and he loved it.  Good prices, great service, and best of all cheap Margaritas.  $1.75 all day any time. A little weak but that was OK.  I'll certainly return to try more of the offerings.
