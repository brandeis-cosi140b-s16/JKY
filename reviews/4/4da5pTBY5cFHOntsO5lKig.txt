From my guess, this place seems pretty authentic. The ordering was a little confusing at first, but you get the hang of it.   Stand in front of the type of vessel you want....taco, burrito, nachos, etc. and choose your meat.  So many types that I hadn't heard of before but don't be swayed if you aren't familiar. The people behind the counter are very helpful and friendly.  Just ask ;-)  We tried the cabeza, another beef, carnitas and carne asada.  All were yummy.  Next time we will try the corn and al pastor!  The salsa bar has pinto and black beans! Not to mention all the veggies and different salsas!  They serve cold beer as well :)
