Chips and salsa!!!!!! I'll take it. I'll have it all day long. Breakfast lunch and dinner. I'm all in. :D their chips are so fresh, hot and crunchy. Never stale!! It's just amazing. Literally! 

I got the vegetarian chimichanga with rice on the side. Inside my chimichanga has yellow squash, bell peppers and onions. I eat half of the veggie chimichanga, boom I'm full. For a large plate like that is inexpensive yet filling and satisfying. 

I'm always back!
