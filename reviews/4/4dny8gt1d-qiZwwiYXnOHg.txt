Smaller location than the one I'm used to on Chandler and Dobson... but AWESOME just like the other one. 

REALLY enjoy going there for breakfast and paying $3.95 for a chorizo burrito that keeps me full long past lunch. I don't normally go for chorizo at a lot of places because I think there's some low-quality stuff, but this is a must have.

Lunches are also good... definitely try to hit their special (...which seems to always be the three rolled tacos, rice and beans???) because you get a meal and a drink for $5. Can't beat it. Lots of other, more expensive places around (Moreno's, El Palacio, etc.), but I'll take this one just about every time.
