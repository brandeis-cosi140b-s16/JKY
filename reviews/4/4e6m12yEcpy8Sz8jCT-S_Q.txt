I was here two weeks ago. I ordered a red Chile burrito and a medium Pepsi. They gave me a large no charge and the burrito was huge with extra red sauce. I am very very picky with red chile as I believe my wife makes the best!!! I bit into it and the red chile was hot and fresh! It had a great flavor with just the right amount of meat. The meat fell apart in my mouth. I know the tortillas aren't homemade but I didn't expect that anyway. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Good job JIMS BURROS!
