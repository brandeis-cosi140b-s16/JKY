Swung in 1am for a relleno burrito.
Amazingly, it was heavy and done just right. 
Better than Super Burrito or Fiesta.
Lots of cheese inside the rellenos (yes, plural).
Lots of flavor and ingredients.
This Filberto's is the best one so far for technique - I can see the actual layers of the relleno as the relleno was done correctly before put into the burrito, UNLIKE THE MILLER AND MCKELLIPS LOCATION, which was incorrect and haphazard.

It actually had pico and guac, not stuffed with shredded lettuce like at Fiesta!

A weighty lump of deliciousness with a PERFECT tortilla and wrap job.

Offered a buck in the drive-thru for extra red sauces but sauces were given freely and buck refused.
I'll be back!

INSIDE SKINNY: Is inside.
There's a salsa bar with a variety (4 or more) of EXCELLENT salsas.
Get some of each!
