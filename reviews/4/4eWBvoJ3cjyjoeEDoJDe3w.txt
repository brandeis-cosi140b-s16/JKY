After reading some of the reviews, I decided to check this place out instead of hitting up my regular robertos.  I tried a bean and cheese burrito and three rolled with guac & cheese. One word, amazing! Got both for under $7 & it honestly was a bit better than robertos! Def will be back next time I'm in the neighborhood!
