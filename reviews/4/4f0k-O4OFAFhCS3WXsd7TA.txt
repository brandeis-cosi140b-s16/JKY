Let's stop lying to ourselves.  

You know I want you.  You know I can't stop thinking about you.  Sure, there are many more that are much better than you but whenever I see you pass by, I just gravitate towards you.  My eyes may wander to a more authentic sort but I always find myself paying and anxiously waiting to get my hands on the goodness that only your Macho Nachos can fulfill.  Pop the top off and I'm in Heaven.  You're a minx in ribbons of flowy golden cheese, adorned by rings of jalapeños. 

"Just one more chip and I'll stop..."

Foolish.  One becomes two, two becomes ten, and suddenly I'm staring down an empty paper plate feeling ashamed.  Why do I let myself be a slave to your processed cheesy goodness?  Why are those canned jalapeños so addictive?  And more importantly, why do I feel my jeans getting tighter?!

One day I'll quit you.  For now, here's the dough, get me another Aline Special...

[Yeah, I wrote a review for a chain.  Get over it.  I wanna be cool like Bretters and siSTAR Aline!  Written also in celebration that my picture of the "Aline Special" is now the main picture.  Woohoo!  On the real though, great location and gets orders right.  That's all.]
