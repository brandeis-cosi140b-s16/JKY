Oh yum. Why have I never been into El Pollo Loco before?

My whole family loves it. If we have a lot of people over, we order one of their big meals with all the sides. They are so good. I always order a large macaroni and cheese and usually eat half of it.

They have really good salsas too. If you are going through the drive thru, make sure you request some of their extra salsa- particularly their green one. It is so good. My husband also ask for Anaheim chilis to add some spice to his. He usually goes here for lunch once a week and gets the bowls.

I only wish they had a few vegetarian options and this location does not have horchata. Bring me some horhcata! It is so tasty and I wish it was there.
