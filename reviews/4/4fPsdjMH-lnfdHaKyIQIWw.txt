I'm not really a big Mexican food kind of person and I've been told that Chipotle isn't Mexican but I like coming here when I'm in Vegas. I usually get the the bowl with steak, guacamole, and the salsa stuff. 

Bottom line, it's good and it fill you up. I learned something  on this visit and that's McDonald's has it's hand in Chipotle.
