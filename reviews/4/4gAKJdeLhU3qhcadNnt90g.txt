Yeah yeah yeah....I hear you.....the food is not the best I have ever had, but you gotta admit that the guacamole they make to order at your table is downright heavenly. I am not sure why the other reviewers felt the drinks were sub-par...maybe I am just a lightweight when it comes to alcohol but I thought the margaritas were yummy. 

Bottom line: Cozymel's is getting 4 stars from me for the patience exhibited when myself and a group of girlfriends held an impromptu bachelorette "pre-party" party in their bar. Take 6 drunk, LOUD and obnoxious girls, add a naughty bachelorette cake and assorted naughty party gifts, and you could potentially have a 4 alarm fire on your hands. The bartender and waitress were good sports, and he even came out from behind the bar for a bit to wish the bride-to-be well. Awwwww......

PS - Plus they gave us some free appetizers too!!!! Ummmm, maybe that was to help soak up some of the alcohol.....?
