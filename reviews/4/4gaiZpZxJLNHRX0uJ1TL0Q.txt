The michelada is a spicy beer cocktail was amazing probably best I ever had. I mixed it with Victoria Mexican beer.  I personally had the shrimp fajitas which were just perfect. We also ordered beef tacos, horchata $ ceviche.  Everything was prepared perfectly.  Service was also great and quick.  There was a band playing which was just too loud and mariachis walking the floor. overall a positive experience minus the 2 armed guards and a pat down at the entrance.
