You're giving a Pseudo-Mexican fast food joint FOUR STARS??  Are you nuts ?  Well, I'm actually giving them 3.5 stars but there's no option for a half-star.

People always ask me that same question every time I drag them alllll the way out to Blue Diamond just for the Crisp Rolled Burritos when there's a Taco Bell just down the street from me.

The grub at this spot really is THAT good though (for deep-fried fast food)  Their 1/4lb crisp tacos are just way better than Taco Bell or Del Taco in my opinion, but my true favorites are the rolled crisp chicken burritos.   Imagine chicken in Alfredo sauce wrapped in a flour tortilla and deep fried until the tortilla is crispy and flaky, but the chicken is not all dried out (Mind you, it's not really Alfredo Sauce, I think, but it's just what the sauce reminds me of).  It's really hard to explain but it's just such good grub!

The only reason it doesn't get a full 4 stars from me if the fact that it's in a grubby travel station that reeks of smoke and travel station funk, so I could never enjoy my meal in comfort fresh out the fryer and always end up eating it on the road.
