I'm always so happy with dinner at Anita's! My parents live here in Wickenburg and I look forward to Mexican food all week long every time I visit. Anita's is a must. The service is great and I'm always happy with my huge plate of delicious tex-mex! 

I was in Thailand a couple of months ago and after a few weeks, needed a change. I made my way to a Mexican restaurant (yes, a Mexican restaurant in Thailand!) and I happened to meet someone who was a huge fan of Anita's! I guess it's world famous! :)
