I popped in mid week and had the $4 pitcher of margaritas which equals about 2 glasses becauses its filled with ice. They very good. Also had the original wings and they were pretty good for being on the small side for $5 during happy hour.  Th sauce has a tiny bite of heat and the wings are crispy just like I want them.

It seemed to me that the place could be a great hang out.  And apparrently a few people have made it to the status of regulars and are known and acknowledged upon arrival and departure. The mesquite chicken smell draws you in from outside.
