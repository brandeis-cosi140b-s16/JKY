Took my son here after school for his favorite lunch - Rubios Lobster Tacos.  : )  This location was a bit of a hike for us but was really really worth it.  Clean dining room, and larger than the average Rubios that we have been to in the past. 

One suggestion that is required:  Baby Changing Table in the bathroom.  I had our infant son with us as well this day and ended up having to change him in the car.  Very inconvenient when most businesses do have a changing table.
