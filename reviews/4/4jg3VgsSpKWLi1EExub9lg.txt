Wonderful food, fast service and a great menu at this active and busy restaurant. I've been here several times and like coming back.

I had the salad with avocado, cherry tomatoes and shrimp and my guest had the chicken ropa something. It was delicious. I would have given this place 5 stars but the garlic salad dressing tasted a little not homemade, and could have been even better.
