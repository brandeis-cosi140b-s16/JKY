Mi Amigo Ricardo is a Casa Grande staple. True, the food is not 5-star gourmet Mexican food, but it offers a tremendous value. It is great food, served fresh and fast. The prices are very reasonable. I have always found the staff to be friendly, and the owners are usually hanging around the front register to greet people and send them off after their meal. Regulars are noted and greeted as such.

The pizza-sized cheese crisp is a must! However, I'm not crazy about the salsa. It's on the tables in ketchup bottles, and is too runny for my taste. To each his own, though. The combos are the best -- a huge plate of good food for a price you can't beat unless you go to Taco Bell, whose food is inedible.
