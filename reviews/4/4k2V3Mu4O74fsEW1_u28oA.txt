AWE.......the original Caramba's, feels like home. This location does not have a bar area like some of the other locations, but I have been eating here for 8 years and it is my favorite location. The staff is always super nice and the food is always out nice and quick. In the few minutes you have to wait before your food is ready you can take advantage of the salsa bar. They give you the chips, you pick your salsa, or pico.

The beef chimi comes with sour cream and guacamole and until I have one here I don't like, I will keep ordering it. I have had there tacos several times as well and they are also very good. 

I don't like the 25 cent refills but other then that I can not say enough good stuff about Caramba's.
