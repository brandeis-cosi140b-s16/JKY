Pros: 
Looking for a new place to regular? Don't look any further. Anaya's is a great little Mexican food restaurant serving up flavors from Estado Jalisco in Mexico. I have spent time plenty of time in Mexico, and enjoyed the different flavors of Mexico. This restaurant stays true to the flavors of the south. They serve up traditional dishes of the Puerto Vallarta as well as other popular dishes found throughout Mexico. The restaurant is quaint, but as festive as you could expect from a restaurant whose roots are from a beautiful beach state. Phoenix offers many Mexican food restaurants to eat at, but many are tainted with flavors of Arizona. This place is an awesome treat for those of us who are seeking a more traditional dish meal like you would find in mexico. If you are looking for a deviation from a chain restaurant you really need to try this place.

Cons:
The only place I find this restaurant to fall short is on their wait staff. They seem to be a little impatient when you have questions or want to share how great your experience is. This can be a mood killer when the service doesn't match the great taste of the food. I mention this because on several occasions the waiters rush off to the kitchen before we can complete our inquiries. The dining area is only about 1000 sqft. It has been after lunch when we visit so it has been slow. I am writing this in hopes that it's owners or management will tell them to be a little more patient and curteous to patrons.
