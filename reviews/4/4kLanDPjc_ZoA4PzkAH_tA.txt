We pass this place all the time so, we finally checked it out. When we first walked in we were hit by either smell of incense or a very powerful cologne!! So needless to say did not smell like Mexican food and we almost walked out due to my husband not being able to handle it with his Asthma. Thats how bad it was.
Needless to say we did place an order. The person at the counter was nice and they were kinda busy. We ordered 3 rolled tacos with guac. 3 bean and cheese burritos 1 bean rice and cheese burrito and 2 drinks.
We sat down to wait. They could up date or fix up the area we sit in and they could clean up the Salsa bar. But as we waited more and more people came in.
I loved my rolled tacos chicken with guac. The guac had flavor to it and it was great. My husband loved his burritos especially the homemade flour tort. Im picky about my refried beans and me personally not sure if i like theres! But we will try it again and i will decide. I can say the green salsa is really good
