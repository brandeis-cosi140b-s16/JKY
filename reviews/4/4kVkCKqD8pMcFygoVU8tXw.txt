Great little Mexican restaurant in old town Scottsdale!  Nestled away off Scottsdale blvd so it may be hard to find and is not one of those restaurants you end up walking by as a snowbird tourist.  However, this restaurant, unlike many others in old town Scottsdale, has survived from being torn down, remodeled and renamed something else (like so many others).  

The food is what you would expect from a traditional American style restaurant.  This time I had the 3 cheese enchiladas with red sauce that comes with rice and beans. Now, you know your at an old school Mexican restaurant when they offer 10 different varieties of this dish!  Personally, this is what I like.  If you would rather have different varieties of tacos and salads and think you are at a Mexican restaurant then there are others close by.  Just don't expect those other restaurants to be around the next time you come back.
