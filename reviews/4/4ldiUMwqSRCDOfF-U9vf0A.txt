A family run restaurant where the waitresses look like the mexican tia (auntie) you wished you had and call you "honey" and "sweetie" all while delivering great food on a very busy night. Thats Raul and Theresa's in a nut shell.  
I admit it I am biased, I had them cater my wedding, but only after having great food there every time. Their green chile burro's are as good as poncho's on baseline and that is saying a lot.  To the guy complaining about the chile releno's  were nothing more than omelet's the menu actually says.... "omelet style", so yeah they are like an omelet. 
This is one of our standby places to eat at on a friday night.  This is the mexican food I grew up at at places like this, Popo's, and Ponchos.  These places are institutions of Mexican and American Food, just like their signs say.  

I am not saying this is authentic mexican food because well Mexico is a big country and the food varies from region to region but this is what I associate with sonoran th style mexican food.  Lots of red sauce, fried tacos, and great salsa. I'll be back probably within a month!!
