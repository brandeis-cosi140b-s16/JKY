I like this place.  I haven't eaten recently, but I remember their food being very good.  Never had a complaint about the drinks.  It's a fun place to hang out with a group of friends and do a little dancing while watching the band.  It's more chill than a "club" and more fun that a normal restaurant.  

Which band is playing makes a big difference.  I saw that Easton Ashe recently, they are very good and not too hard on the eyes either, which is always an added bonus!  

As for being an OPH crowd.....I mostly go here to hang with friends and I'll admit that since I'm not looking to pick anyone up I don't really pay attention.  But we're in our 20s... So.... Not sure about the cougar theory?
