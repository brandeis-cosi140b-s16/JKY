I don't like fast food but I love Taco Bell. Cheap and delish. Service is pretty good for a fast food joint. I get my random Taco Bell cravings and it's close to home so I always hit UK the drive through and get my delicious food hot and fast. I'll keep coming back to this location because I've never had any issues.
