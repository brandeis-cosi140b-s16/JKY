I've been craving Chinese for a few weeks now. I haven't found my go to spot in the area yet, but I'd been by this place a time or two and had not been turned off by anything. 

I ordered the Moo Goo Gai Pan and some fried rice. Everything was ready in maybe 5 min. The dining area was small but tidy. I chose to eat at home though. The fried rice satisfied my craving, nothing special but just what I needed to hit the spot. The MGGP even had fresh zucchini, a nice surprise. All was reasonably priced. No where near gourmet but if you're looking for typical Chinese takeout, it'll do!
