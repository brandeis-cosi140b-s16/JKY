A first time visit.  We liked the food.  I had the chimichanga machaca, my wife had the combo enchilada plate.  The server we had was very attentive and did a very good job.  Two suggestions for the owner of this restaurant.  1.  Your tortilla chips are very tasty but they are far to small to use for dipping, etc.  Keep the same recipe but have them made larger.  We noticed that too many of them are broken so that by the time you get 1/2 way through the bowl all you have is fragments.  Larger chips would eliminate this problem.  2.  Your hot water in the men's room is too hot!  You are wasting energy and paying for it, plus you could end up scalding someone.  We will be back, however, because the food is very good.
