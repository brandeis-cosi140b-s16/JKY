In town, read the reviews and decided to try it out for an early lunch before heading out for a long shopping day.  

We ordered the adobada tacos and the adobada fries 
Tacos are $2...and they are very good
Fries are $10 large/ $5 small (get the small enough for two people)
The menu reads spicy pork but it's not spicy  

This place is a great find!  If you visit Vegas, this is a must! We will definitely come back and eat here.
