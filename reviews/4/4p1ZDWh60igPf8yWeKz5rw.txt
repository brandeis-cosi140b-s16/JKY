I just tried this place the other night on a whim with my friend. We both ordered the tostada bowl, to go, with Carne Asada.  The place has a very different look to it. Funky decor. Young staff who were SUPER friendly and joking around with us. Very helpful and said hello the second we walked in the door.
The Tostada Bowl was EXCELLENT! It was so delicious. Nice cruncy shell, with all the fixings you want inside. Shell did not get soggy and stayed nice and crunchy. Highly recommend giving this place a shot. I am surpriesd by the mixed reviews, I thought this place was great!
