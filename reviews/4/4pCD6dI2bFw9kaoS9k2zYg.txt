I've been eating at Pepe's for years. The taco siberia and taco monterey are definite high points. The egg/breakfast stuff is also surprisingly good. I don't drink much anymore, but I'd head straight here if I had a hangover. 

P.S. If any of you remember doing a slow burn when Pepe's was cash-only, those days are long gone.
