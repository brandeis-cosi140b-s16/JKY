Still some issues at the front of the house. My friend and I came in with reservations at 9 pm and were seated promptly. The runner came out with water and chips, and that concluded the timely part of the service. We sat there for fifteen minutes and filled up on a whole lotta chips. We ordered the guacamole which was good, I personally prefer less lime in my sauce but I can see how somebody would like more. After discussing the menu items, evaluation of the probability of a downgrade of U.S. debt, outlining all of the eventualities of a default, and analysis of the political barriers towards a deal, the server took our drink orders. Her claim was that she had two sections to cover because somebody was out for the night. I am a little skeptical since there were several servers working and a management call to simply give one person two sections seems unreasonable. 

The food, however, was outstanding like the last time I was here. The server upsold me on the tuna tartare on chips as an appetizer; delicious, but the tuna ought to be cut into fine pieces - I had to take the tuna down in one hefty bite. My other complaint is that $14 for two loaded chips is comparable to my earlier experience at T&T, needless to say, not the best deal. I had the short ribs as an entree, it was mixed in a smoky and sweet cayenne sauce over a bed of corn polenta, I definitely didn't leave hungry nor unsatisfied. I also tried my friend's quesadilla, the blue cheese and mushrooms are a nice twist on a staple dish. The tres leches cake was decent, not too interesting, but alright if you need to finish on a sweet note.
