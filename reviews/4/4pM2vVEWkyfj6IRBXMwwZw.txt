Looking at the star rating for this place I was shocked. I love Blanco! It's one of my favorite Fox Restaurant Concepts. They have fabulous house margaritas and tons of beers to choose from. I recommend the carne asada tacos, they are consistently good. The rice there is awesome. Blanco is always a go to place for good food and good atmosphere.
