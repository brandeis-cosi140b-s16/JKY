Tried Lina's first time last night. Got order to go. Was just reopened by original owners who bought it back a couple of weeks ago. Previous owner defaulted. I got wet chicken burrito w/red sauce, really good, had a lot of chicken. Wife got cheese enchilada also very good, plain for my taste though, I like spicy. I agree with Joseph S review, but only gave 4 stars for now as we got order to go haven't tried dine in, definitely will soon.
