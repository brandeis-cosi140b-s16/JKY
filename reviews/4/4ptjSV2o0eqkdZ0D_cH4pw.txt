This is a great little place in the airport!

I ended up at the airport really early for my flight, and wanted to get something to eat that wasn't the standard pastry or fast food chain. I didn't think I would be successful, but then I walked by this place. 

They do neat tapas type dishes and tapas sandwiches. I had a ham, goat cheese, and egg sandwich that was really tasty. It came on a nice, toasted French roll and the ham was good quality, not the deli or processed stuff that a lot of people use. 

It was very nice to find this little gem, and at the airport no less!
