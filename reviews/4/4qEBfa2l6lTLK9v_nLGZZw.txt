Simple menu, great eats! Sonoran Grill is a nice lil'joint for some quick street tacos at a reasonable price. Parking is a bit cramped along with indoor seating but plenty of outdoor seating available. Staff was also very pleasant. I look forward to coming back. Came here before when it was another type of eatery and was disappointed. Today was looking for something new in the area close to work and Yelp had some high star reviews. Decided to revisit the location and happy we did.
