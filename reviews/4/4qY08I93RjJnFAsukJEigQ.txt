I love El Matate. My wife and I stumbled across this place a couple years ago and for about six months couldn't go a week without stopping by for a large Horchata and some tacos or an order of Super Nachos to share. 

My wife loves the street tacos and the beef tacos. I also like the beef but love the chicken tacos. Great service and very reasonable pricing. As I am writing this I am realizing that I have not been there in a while and am now craving it like crazy. Late night taco run anyone?
