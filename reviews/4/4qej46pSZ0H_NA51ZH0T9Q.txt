Just when you think there is nothing more than an incredible view of the Superstition Mountains with a glistening lake in the center - 2 miles down there's an old town look called the Tortilla Flat where you can see coupled shops with a small historical museum in the corner.
This is a good thing to see - stop by the restaurant - the entire wallpaper inside is made up of dollar bills - whoa!
Next thing to see - historical district of Lost Dutchman state park and even hike that trail!!
