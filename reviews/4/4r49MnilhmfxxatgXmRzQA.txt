Try the Kahuna Grande! :D Went to this place again for the second time. I found out they have $2 Pacifico's all the time- thats an awesome deal. If you're part of the service industry crowd you get %30 off your bill, that's pretty cool too. The service is friendly. This time I went late night on a Wed, I found food was served till Midnight and the place closed at 1am. I think thats a pretty good deal considering the place is in Boca park where most restaurants are closed.  They have plenty of seating- outside too! 

I think the seafood is absolutely delicious, they have their own recipe of green sauce, and I think my only complaint is that the tortillas are pretty crappy (falling apart, soggy etc). They should definitely invest in a better vender for tortillas ;b Oh and the enchiladas were so tasty! I had a green/cheese shrimp enchilada. AMAZING.
