This is a solid place to grab some quick, cheap Mexican food. The hubby and I stopped in the other day because someone had told me they have very authentic al pastor tacos.

They have two sizes for the tacos, $1.50 and $2.50. I recommend you go for the small ones, they are sufficient. The tacos al pastor were good, needed a bit more seasoning but their salsa verde more than made up for it. Hubby ordered the torta de asada which was REALLY good. The bread tasted like bread for a torta should taste like. All in all, we ordered about 6 tacos and the torta and it ended costing like 14 bucks. That is a tremendous deal in my book!
