We eat at Mi Casa probably 2-3 times a month.  While the food has always been good, the service was always terrible.  More often than not the wait time from ordering to receiving was about 45+ minutes.   

We ate there last night and was pleasantly surprised.  In the three weeks since we were last there, they've changed their menu and gotten a new chef.  The changes were instantly noticeable from the time the hostess sat us.  

Changes:
1. Hostess was friendly and had a smile on her face.  Not sure if it's the same one who has seated us before, but I never really notice the 'sour puss' people I come across.  When she sat us, she made sure we all had everything we needed - menus, silver, water glasses, etc.

2.  Salsa was amazing!  They obviously changed their medium salsa because it has never been as yummy as it was before. I didn't try the hot or the green so can't comment on it.  I ate waaayyyy too many chips this time because I couldn't get enough of the salsa.

3.  Service was perfect!  Waiter instantly at our table, water glasses filled, drink order returned promptly - granted two of us drank water and the other ordered a coke.  We placed our order:  Chicken enchiladas and Beef Fajitas for two.  Both arrived in less than 15 minutes and place was packed.

4.  I cannot attest for the Chicken enchiladas, but he downed them quickly, so I can only assume they were good.  The Fajitas were amazing!  Before they were way overcooked and came with some weird orange glaze on them.  The veggies would be so charred that they had lost all flavor.  This time, they came out a perfect medium and veggies so fresh and cooked perfectly that we ate the whole thing!  This is the first time we didn't have leftovers to take home.

I don't know who the new chef is, but he/she made this a place we will consider as a first choice for dinner as opposed to a 'can't come up with anything better and we are already here' choice.
