Look... You know what you're getting into when you pull up to a Mexican food restaurant with a yellow ,green, and red sign. For the most part it is what it is, but I think this Frederico's sets the bar pretty high for one of these.  I've eaten there many times, as I work down the street. Everything I've ever had has been good, if not very good-case in point, the Pollo Asado burrito- its killer. They even have a ground beef special burrito or tacos with a drink for cheap. It's really good for a "Monday after" lunch.
Most importantly, it's never wrecked me, it is clean inside if you want to dine in, and it doesn't smell like pine sol.    

Four Stars is Fair for Frederico's!
