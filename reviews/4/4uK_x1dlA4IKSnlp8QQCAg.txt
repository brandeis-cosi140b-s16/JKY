Filibertos is awesome as always...but I must admit this location came as such random surprise to me...there is no drive-thru to begin. When you walk in you have an arcade to your left, a dinning room to your right and you are greeted by a woman who either seats you or walks you to the counter to give your order...not complaining...just say-in...
