This place is one of our favorites for lunch. Don't be mistaken into thinking it's the cheapest place, but the food is excellent and we'll worth it! You can't go wrong with their taco plate with carne asada or pastor. Overall a great hole-in-the-wall find that exemplifies what I love about Las Vegas.
