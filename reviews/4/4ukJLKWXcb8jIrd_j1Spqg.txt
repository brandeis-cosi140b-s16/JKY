Friendly staff. Good fresh food. I had number 3 ,a flauta, taco and tostada. The chicken used was very good. The guacamole was just OK. Agree chips warm and fresh. Not a fast stop. Seemed like they took care of a couple of walk in regulars, which probably makes economic sense. Unassuming outside , nice decor inside, and clean.
