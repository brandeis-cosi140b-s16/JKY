Any restaurant that uses Calvin and Hobbes cartoons as advertisements gets my vote initially. Additionally, any restaurant that serves nachos literally (and metaphorically) flowing over the plate gets my vote as well. Growing up eating Mexican food and reading Calvin and Hobbes cartoons, I felt right at home. Well played, Taco Bros. 

Plus they have dynamite salsa! (dynamite = good)
