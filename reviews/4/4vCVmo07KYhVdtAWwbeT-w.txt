I live around the corner and thought I would check this place out. I love Mexican food and thought that this place did a decent job. I thought it was very similar to Filibertos, nearly identical although not as greasy. I thought the prices were also a bit less. The chile verde, cheese quesadilla, rice, beans & taquitos were all very good. I will be back to try some of the other menu items.
