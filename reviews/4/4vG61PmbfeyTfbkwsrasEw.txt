I've been to Komex a couple times now.  I first visited when they were brand new and gaining a following on Yelp.  While I was impressed with their pricing, I wasn't as impressed with their veg-friendly items we ordered.  There were no Korean-Mexican fusion eats for this girl.

It took a while for us to make it back, and the thing that changed was that they added tofu to their menu.  While I'm not a big tofu eater, I thought maybe this addition could help improve some of the times on their menu so I decided to finally stop back.  Guess what?  I can finally get fusion things here!  Hooray!

I'm a big, big fan of the tofu fusion tacos.  The tortillas are fresh, the marinated cabbage adds nice crunch and flavor, and it all comes with a selection of sauces to add!  The tacos are filled to the brim, so a fork and knife are pretty necessary here.

I've also had the Chow Fettuccine noodles.  They aren't bad, they aren't spectacular, but they are a decent noodle with tons of veggies for an awesome price.  It's definitely a cheap way to fill you up.

My husband has ordered the veggie burrito (not fusion) and I don't care for it too much.  They add broccoli and baby corn and some other things that I think make it a little strange.  But my husband likes it and that's all that matters.

I have a feeling meat-eaters really enjoy this place.

Good food, great prices, awesome people.  Definitely worth a trip.
