I went here last night with a good friend of mine for the first time.  We both were in search of a restaurant that was open on the later side on New Year's Day and this happened to work out for us.  The building itself is like an Aztec or Mayan pyramid and hard to miss since it kind of sticks out - but I guess you could say it adds to the character of the place.  Overall the decor is a bit dated, but clean and honestly for the type of restaurant it is, it's acceptable.

We were greeted warmly and seated right away to a booth where we both decided to indulge in their margarita special for the evening which was an upgrade from the house.  I was surprised how large they were and tasted great.  I enjoyed the fact that they didn't taste watered down at all and were a bit more on the savory side versus tasting ultra sugary.

The chips and salsa were a nice touch since many places now don't seem to offer complementary items like that anymore.  The chips were perfectly crisp, not overly salty or thick.  The salsa lacked a bit of pizazz, but tasty none the less.  He ordered the Chimichanga de Macayo and I tried the Sonoran Enchilada Sampler.  Both were delicious and well seasoned.  The chiles in the enchiladas really brought out a nice rounded flavor.  Their rice was flavorful and not overcooked which seems to be a common issue for many restaurants I have tried.  For dessert, we shared the fried ice cream with chocolate sauce; I never had it previously, but it was tasty.  The crust wasn't quite as crispy as I had anticipated, but did have a nice little crunch to it.

In general, our visit to Macayo's was a pleasant one.  The service was great - our waiter was very accommodating, helpful and attentive.  We enjoyed our meal very much and I can't wait to go back and try out a couple of other items on the menu!
