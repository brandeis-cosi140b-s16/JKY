Caf√© Rumba was one of my regular lunch spots until my office moved to Peoria, I do miss eating here.  It's tucked back in the corner of the lot which can make it difficult to find, but it appears that many of the locals have found it. 

The food is fresh and prepared right in front of you ala Chipotle, but tastier than Chipotle.  They have several types of salsa which compliment the light and crispy chips nicely. My favorites were the chicken burrito, fish tacos (darn good with the white sauce on them), and the quesadilla with green chilies.  
The staff is friendly and helpful, it is as if they enjoy working there, imagine that. 
I hope this place makes it.
