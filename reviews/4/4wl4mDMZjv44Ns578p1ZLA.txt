My family and I had dinner on the way Mesquite, NV.  We thought it was great!  I had the shredded beef tacos with rice and beans.  I think it's cool they give you the option of whole beans or refried.  The rice was good and the tacos were great!  They weren't greasy like most Mexican restaurants.  The salsa was very good - definitely made there and not from a bottle.
