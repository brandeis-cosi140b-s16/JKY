I am a "tourist" in this town and this Chipotle is a bit hard to find. It sits on the North end of the lot next to the Golden Spoon (yum) and the Starbucks. Plenty of places to park.. And one huge plus about this Chipotle is that it's right next to a Courtyard. So you can sit out on one of those warm sunny days and enjoy your food choice. 

Came in yesterday around 4pm before going to the movies with my brother and ordered a burrito bowl. Preparers were nice and not stingy and place was well kept. I rarely find a Chipotle that varies in the food quality, (ie: overcooked rice) and this Chipotle holds up to the standards. 

Wasn't busy at all. No line and about 4 people eating in the restaurant. 

No complaints from me nor my brother. We have Chipotle at least once when we're out traveling.
