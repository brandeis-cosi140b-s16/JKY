We've been coming to this Ajo Al's since 1993 when we first moved to Arizona.  We have seen staff members come and go but they have maintained very good consistency with service and quality of food.  We have been to other Ajo Al's in the valley but this one is our favorite and it's close to home. We have experienced different service and even slightly different tasting food (good or bad) from each of them so please consider where you are eating.

My family teases me because I get the very same thing every time we go.  Ground beef burrito with rice and beans added inside the burrito with two sides of shredded cheese and one side of sour cream.  I cover the burrito in the mild salsa too. They say it should be a regular on the menu..."Bill's Burrito".

You have to try the Queso dip.  Hot, cheesy and very good!  My family assures me everything else is great!  Machacha Chimi and Pappa Jack enchiladas are very good according to them.

At this location, get there a little early on Friday and Saturday nights or there will be a short wait for a table.  Weeknights are okay anytime.

We take all our visiting, out of town friends to Ajo Al's to enjoy good Mexican food!
