I appreciate the liberal use of cheese and the fact that I can get mole. The ordering system is different, but it doesn't seem like a hard and fast rule. I dig the gran tacos and the fact that I can get Coke in a medio litro. There are lots of salsas to choose from too. Solid place. I'm definitely a fan.
