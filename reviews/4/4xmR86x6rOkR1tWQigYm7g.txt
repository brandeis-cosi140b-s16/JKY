Really great Mexican food local hole in the wall. The beans and rice are fantastic, and the tortillas are homemade and amazing. I have had the chicken tacos and found the meat a little bland, but had the Carne Asada the next time and it was very good. 

Can get crowded at lunch! I always call ahead and go pick it up so I can get back to work.
