Lime sublime!  I loved my meal from Picante tonight.  I ordered the fish tacos with black beans, cheese, sour cream, and picante.  I added a bit of the "hot" salsa to the top and it was awesome! To boot the price was the 'picante' on top!  Awesome value. 

Picante is keeping it all really fresh tasting with a lime flavor.  They have added this to the chips as well, which was a nice touch!  Even though this is not as close to me as some of the other Mexican fast chains, I will drive there to experience their freshness again! I can confirm that none of the said Mexican chains offer a seafood option...and as a Pescatarian I really appreciate this menu item!
