This place is a little hole in the wall, but it's got some great food.

First off, the staff are very friendly and I enjoy that the kitchen is open and visible and that it looks like somebody's mom and grandma are cooking.

I almost always get the #1 which is a taco and enchilada with rice and beans, but it sounds like the burritos are also good. The chips and salsa are out of this world, some of the best I've had in the valley. The food in general is very good and always tastes freshly prepared and made with love.

While you're here, don't forget to checkout the bakery. They've got a ton of really good home-made stuff and it's REALLY cheap. I try to pick-up some empanadas every now and again and buy their tortillas by the bag when I want some at home.

They're closed on Sundays and Mondays.
