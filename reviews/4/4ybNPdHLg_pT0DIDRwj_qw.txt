I have used this location on several occasions to get my late night hunger fix.  This place is out of the way from the strip but not that far is one would like to take it to go.  When I stay at the Rio or Palace Station the food is still hot by the time it gets to my room.
Earlier this week I woke up a little homesick and a craving for "comida authentica" that any of the hotel restaurants or other chains would not be able to satiate.  I stopped by here and picked up at large cup of menudo.  It was awesome it came backed with bits of buche instead of tripe  which I found delightful.  I will definetely add that to my next recipe when I make it again.
Is it the best taqueria I have ever gone too, maybe not, but its open 24hours and offers so damn good food.
