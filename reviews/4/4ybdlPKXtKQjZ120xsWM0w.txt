Met a group of friends here on a Friday night. The restaurant was very empty, which never sends a good message.  We were seated immediately and our server, Carolina was prompt in taking our drink order.  20 minutes in, a slacker friend changed their mind and decided to join us.  We had a second table pushed up to  our table literally .2 seconds after asking without being treated like it was a HUGE deal to be done.   
The server checked to see if we had any questions about the menu. The food was out quickly and it was very yummy.  Between the 5 of us, we tried the Chimichanga (so good!), the pork tacos, the empanadas and an enchiladas.  We were all very full and very satisfied with our food.
Will definitely be back for the good food and excellent service that was provided.
