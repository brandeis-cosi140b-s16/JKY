Currently my favorite fajita spot. I love me some fajitas and this place knows exactly how to serve them up. While you're waiting for your food you are given chips, salsa, AND bean dip. Yum! The fajitas come out table-side, as the waiter creates a flame on them, before handing them off to you. Dinner and a mini show! The margaritas are my favorite there as well!
