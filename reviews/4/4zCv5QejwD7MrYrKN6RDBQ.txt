At first I thought this might be another 5 star - but I really save them for the very best of the best! 

The service was very good - it could have been a few minutes faster, but that's really cutting hairs. The bathrooms were the cleanest I've seen anywhere and according to the women in the party - their bathroom even had a live plant - pretty cool I guess. We assumed they didn't have one in the men's room because of the potential little boy peeing in it!

The chips and salsa were good - some liked the cooler side of the salsa - others liked the hot dip - I preferred to dip in the hot sauce and then into the cooler one - let's call it mild!

We ordered the Mini Many More, which was enough for the entire party of four. We also ordered the Tapas Pie - again enough for four. A Taco Salad with chicken and a Classic Fajita with steak and shrimp - recommended by our waitress "Elizabeth" - who was by far one of the very best!

All the food was good, but it was a bit on the bland side - not bad, but certainly not 5 star worthy. A little more salt would have kicked up the flavor, but it wouldn't have done much for the spice we were hoping for.

They did sport a large selection of beer and Elizabeth helped my wife pick out a new wine, which I guess was good because she finished it all. 

Plenty of parking, the entire place was clean and the decor was perfect for an up-scale Mexican establishment. Only drawback was the lack of spice!
