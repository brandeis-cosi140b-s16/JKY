Chino Bandido is my guilty pleasure. It is utterly unhealthy food served in an aluminum foil bowl, delivered by a casually dressed employee who shouts your name until you claim it. And, you get a soft snickerdoodle cookie, as if there were not enough calories and carbs in the meal itself.

It's a dive. Black and white checkered floors. Murals and polaroids of customers mounted on the walls behind plastic.

Ayesha is right. It's a love/hate kind of place; and, those who love it will blurt out what they order at the mere mention - it's practically involuntary. 

Me? I'm "jerk chicken add black beans." I have the number programmed into my phone so I can call in my order.

It's also addictive for those who like it. I am generally compelled to visit Chino within 72 hours of hearing someone mention it.

Here's the thing about Chino Bandido: it is NOT Chinese and it is NOT Mexican. It is Chino Bandido. It's its own animal. 

To try to label it can only lead to disappointment. So, I suggest: 
~ Know that we are not talking fast food prices -- a one item bowl with a soft drink is $9.15.
~ Enter with an open mind. 
~ Proceed immediately to the counter under the menu with all the pictures on it and tell the employee it's your first time. The employee will slip you a bunch of samples so you can taste what you're in for. 
~ Figure out what you like and accept help from the employee while you complete the unique order form (which is also demonstrated on the website: http://www.chinobandido.com/order.html).
~ Enjoy!
