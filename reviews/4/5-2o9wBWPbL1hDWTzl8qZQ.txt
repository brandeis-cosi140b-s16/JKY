I've been to Carlsbad 5 times now and had a good experience every time.  I wouldn't say the food is fabulous, but decent enough to keep me coming back.   We recently moved into the neighborhood and have found that it's a great Happy hour spot ... and we can walk there!  They don't have a huge vegetarian menu, but they make their food to order, so I found that I can pretty much modify anything on the menu to take out the meat.  The chips and salsa duo is a must have, and its only $2 during happy hour!
