I'm a hard-cord SoCal foodie, so coming to the 'junction in the A-Z isn't always a culinary delight.  Gotta say, I was really pleasantly surprised by this place.  The food is well-prepared, tex-mex style - more veggies, citrus, not as much lard/grease.  Portions are decent size (not "bistro"), and the service is spot-on. The kitchen has clearly got its act together.  Our stuff arrived relatively quickly - done to perfection - and piping hot.  They've got outside seating, which looks pretty nice, and the full bar doesn't hurt either.  Price?  Very reasonable.  Triple Z snap from me - we'll be back.
