Place is quiet and offers some great food and the prices are great. Lots if seating and the place is clean. Food is fresh and there are a lot of choices. I have been here twice now and I just used the yelp deal 10 for 20 and I ended up ordering more food just to reach the 20 dollar mark. Check them out!
