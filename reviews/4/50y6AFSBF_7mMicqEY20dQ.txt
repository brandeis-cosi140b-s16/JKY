Atmosphere was great! Staff was very nice and attentive except for the hostess without the mostess!! She had an attitude that could have ruined the meal but everyone else made up for it. 
Food was very tasty and pleasing. Came out very fast and hot and fresh. For appetizers we had the jalape√±o cheese fritters, mini chimmies,quesadillas, and the queso. Wouldn't order chimmies again, they were good but too much like an egg roll. Cheese fritters were pretty good, quesadillas were ok, and the queso was pretty tasty. Appetizers were overall were just ok I would skip except for queso. Chips and salsa was really good. 
For food I got the grande platter. It was amazing. My wife got the pork tenderloin plate that was also very very good. 
I had the platinum margarita, and my wife had the skinny which were both very good. Next time I would skip the appetizers we chose or try something different. But the food was amazing and so were the drinks!
