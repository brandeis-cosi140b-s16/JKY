Want authentic DF tacos? well this is the place! They cook the al pastor stacked up on a rotating spit and you eat your tacos standing up. The salsas are are excellent along with all the other condiments you would expect like sliced radishes, cilantro and unions. I had the al pastor the lengua (tongue). The pastor was great! juicy and crunchy at the same time. The lengua was ok as the shred their lengua and i prefer it  cubed. 4 tacos and a water was $8 which seems a bit pricey to me hence why i didn't give it 5 stars.
