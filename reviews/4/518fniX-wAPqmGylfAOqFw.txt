I like it. The ambiance and decor are awesome. The drinks are great and different, I like picking the different soda flavours and pairing with an alcohol. The food is good, I think I need to try more things to get a better impression. The tamales I had were over steamed was soggy on the end but dry everywhere else. Need to try the tacos.
