I have been coming to Zapata's for the past decade.  I am 100% addicted to their Chimichanga and go back often for them.  I don't venture out often to other menu items, but I have had many family and birthday dinner's here and everyone always expresses how good the food is.  It is always our go-to when we have out of town guest visiting.

The loss of a star is because while the food is always good, the quality of service can vary.  Sometimes it seems like there are not enough staff present so you end up with slower service or you get a different server each time someone comes to the table.
