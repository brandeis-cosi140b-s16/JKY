I've tried several gringo favorites here, and this food tastes like homeade.  

Price:  Average for the volume of food ($6-10/lunch)
Service:  I felt strange sitting in the waiting room and waiting for my name to be called.
Taste:  Everything I've tried has been AWESOME, and their red sauce is great on everything.

It seems strange that it would be hooked up next to a convenience store, but the food is definitely worth your time.
