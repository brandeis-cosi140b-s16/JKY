I've been coming to Rubio's since I was in high school. My favorite items include their famous fish tacos, Baja grill burrito, and their street tacos. I love their salsa bar (the mild and chipotle ones are my favorite, and I love the outdoor patio seating. I can honestly say I've never had a bad experience here.
