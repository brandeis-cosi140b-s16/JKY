Chuy's tacos sits right in the cut on Sahara and Chapman.  Definitely a great place to stop 'n go if you're wandering the good ole EASTCYDE. Chuy is a trip to chop it up with. Check his taco stand out yallz.

What I had so far:

$1.50 tacos: had the carne asada, pastor, and chicharron (careful with the chicharron. Don't over do it). I'LL TAKE IT!!! I Can eat about 6 of these tacos. Chuy hooks it up.

$2.50 taco grandes: I can only inhale two of these fat tacos. FOR REALLY DOE! I think there's too much going on with these grandes. I think I'll stick with the regular tacos.

$6.00 burritos: Had the carne asada burrito today. Big chunks of asada with a good combination of beans and onions. Not greazy at all. I'll pho'ks with it.

I'll wash everything down with a good ole refresca coca cola minus the original missing ingredient. Haha! Chuy's sits in a parking lot of a liquor store, so pick your poison. He's got two tables out there if you want to hang out to enjoy your eats. I recommend eating them fresh. 

Chuy's tacos has good eats at reasonable prices. 

Another point for the EASTCYDE!!!
