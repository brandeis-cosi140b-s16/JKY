Yes, the name kind of gives this place an 'also ran' or second fiddle status to Robson's other gem, Gallo Blanco.  But once you enter you get a different take on Mexican.  The Salads, Elote, Enchilada's, and Paella are all worth the drive up from Clarendon. 

My favorite is still the Naco Torta which is kind of ironic given that I'm more of a 'Fresa'.
