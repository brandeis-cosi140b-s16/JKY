MENUDO 24/7

Combination Burrito: Choice of meat, filled this baby with Al Pastor,  beans, rice, onions, cilantro and hot or mild sauce comes with a handful of tortilla  chips on the side. Did not come up for air. Ate it all with no regrets.

Menudo served daily including choice of corn or flour tortillas. Corn tortillas is the only way to eat menudo.  Filled with mucho menudo and asked for extra oregano and chili flakes. Added fresh cut onions plus cilantro. MENUDO IS SERVED SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. Don't have to wait till Saturday or Sunday. The bowl of menudo is very filling

The Pina beverage includes self service refills. More concentrated and stronger taste.

On Wednesday 7 pm there is live entertainment. Have to check it out.
