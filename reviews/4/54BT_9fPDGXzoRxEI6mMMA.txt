So Saturday morning I decide to take the trek over to Scottsdale Old Town Farmers Market.  Started the morning off with a drive across Glendale/Lincoln, first time I had taken that route in daylight.  It was a perfect morning with temps in the 70s.

I do not function well with out food/coffee early in the morning and I took this trip as an excuse to try out another restaurant.  I arrived well before opening so I wandered around and got my bearings, arriving at the door promptly at 7AM.  I was the first customer in the door, entering from Indian School, and the place was deserted so I wandered around a bit when somebody came out.  I asked if I could eat on the patio and once she figured out which patio was ready I was told to pick a seat.  This sort of sounds like poor service but it really wasn't, every body was rushing around setting stuff up and total time elapsed was like 3 minutes.  I gather Scottsdale doesn't wake up early, even as I left at almost 8 there were still very few customers. 

My server offered up drinks and handed me a menu and in the couple of minutes it took my orange juice to arrive I had made my choice.  Maybe too quick on my part, the menus only get reprinted a couple of times a year and there are items not listed which when I heard them recited to another table sounded enticing.  I had corned beef hash, scrambled eggs, sliced tomatos and and English muffin.  The eggs were nice and hot and not overcooked.  The corned beef hash may be the best I have had in Arizona.  My server checked up on me fairly often.

The restaurant is divided up with an indoor seating area/bar, two outside seating areas divided by the entrance to the parking lot and a meeting room, which I did not see inside, but you could sort of guess where it was by subtracting what you could see from the overall size of the place.  I would pick outside almost any time.

I would not hesitate to return here.  Both the food and the service were excellent.
