Very nice small dining room- great ambiance.  Pizza and salads very good. Our waiter was  friendly but not attentive (we needed to ask for water more than once). Service very rushed.  He asked to box up our pizza when we were only half way through the meal.  We were never asked if we would like dessert.  Nice selection of local craft beers.
