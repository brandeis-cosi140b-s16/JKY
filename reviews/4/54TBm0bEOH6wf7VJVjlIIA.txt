My girlfriend and I had a great experience here.  We had a coupon for this place so decided to try it out.

Good:

chips and drinks out right away. Some reviewers say the chips are nothing special but they were delicious. Just salty enough and a little thicker than the standard chips. The salsas were pretty good but the bean dip stood out the most. We also ordered a small guac which was huge and it was so good. You can get a side of jalepenos to mix in yourself. 

The horchata was super fresh tasting if you like that. I personally like the less authentic manufactured ones but this was also good. 

The service here is great. Our server actually recommended the smaller guac when we were gonna order the large. 

Bad: 

The rice and beans were not that good, which is the case at most Mexican places. I've had authentic rice and beans an leticias dry flavorless rice was pretty bad. The beans tasted no different from canned retried beans. 

While we both enjoyed our entrees, thy were nothing special. I had the fish tacos. The sauce was good but the fish did not taste good. There was too much lettuce and cheese. My girlfriend had beef tamales. Everything was good but the enchilada style sauce. 

Overall we enjoyed this place and look forward to go back to try other menu items.
