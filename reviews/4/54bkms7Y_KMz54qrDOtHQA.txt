Oh man, this was a good dinner! There were rumors about La Condesa: awesome salsa bar, tasty cheap tacos...I am glad to say that both of those rumors are TRUE!

I had a chicken mole taco which had just a couple too many red onions on it (which were easily dispatched). The mole was rubbed into the chicken rather than glooped on top, so the fragrant smokiness really soaked into the chicken. I liked this taco even better with a spoonful of the juicy strawberry salsa on top.

I also sampled the carne asada burro. Simple handmade flour tortilla (I could eat them plain for days), filled with black beans and beef. The meat had a deep flavor and was slow-cooked tender. Again, a dollop from the large assortment of salsas, this time the creamy cilantro, made good taste great.

My calabacitas were grilled just right: nice char marks, but with some body still left to the slices. 

La Condesa only loses a point because the chips could have been better (fresher) and the parking in front is rather harrowing. Otherwise, it is going in the regular rotation. I hope they have t-shirts sometime soon with some of the amazing artwork!
