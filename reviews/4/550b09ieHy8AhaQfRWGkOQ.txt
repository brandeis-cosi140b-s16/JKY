We actually had a decent meal here at baja miguel's the other day. They have a daily lunch special from 11-3 daily that includes a frozen margarita, fideo soup, and your choice of two items to make up your entree that comes with rice and beans. The chips and salsa also come with bean dip and guac. I think its actually a pretty good deal if you are close by and especially since the special is seven days a week.
