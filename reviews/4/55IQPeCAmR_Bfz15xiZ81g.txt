Got hooked on this place back in Utah. Barbacoa salad......Yum! Grilled steak burrito enchilada style ......Yum!

Just make sure you check your order before leaving. The Eastern location has a habit of wrecking family take out night by forgetting sides and incorrectly making/packing orders. 

Tip; Kids Menu:

-They offer bean and cheese burritos for kids that don't like all the privileges of adults, however, you will have to explain that it is possible to do because the cashier is most times oblivious on how to ring it up. Ask for managerial assistance. This goes for other kid items as well.
