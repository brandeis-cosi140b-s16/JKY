We met friends for dinner tonight at Willy & Jose's.  Our server was a very friendly person with a fine sense of humor.  Two of us ordered a trio of proteins--shrimp, chicken, and beef.  My friend doesn't eat shrimp, so it was put in a bowl on the side with extra sauce and I had double shrimp.  Her husband had beef tacos, and my wife had a chicken dish--the name escapes me.

We all enjoyed our entrees.  Very tasty sauces, good portions without being huge, and just the right amount of seasonings.

For dessert, each couple shared an order of chocolate tacos.  The taco shell was a bit rubbery and was filled with vanilla ice cream.  We made the mistake of not picking it up and eating it like an ice cream sandwich when it was cold and still somewhat frozen.  We were given small spoons when we needed a knife to slice through the bottom of the taco.  Still, it was tasty if a bit challenging to eat.

I'll return to Willy & Jose's.
