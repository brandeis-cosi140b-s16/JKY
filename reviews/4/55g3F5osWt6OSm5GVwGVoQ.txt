Our first visit to this Habanero's location, in a strip mall near the Scottsdale Gun Club.

We opted to go with the table service although you can also choose to order at the counter fast-food style. Our server was friendly, helpful and attentive. 

You pay $1.29 for a basket of chips and 3 salsas which is a reasonable price for the quantity you receive, but they are just room temperature chips from a bag and the salsas, although very tasty, were extremely thin in consistency. We didn't eat a whole lot of them because it was like dipping chips in bowls of soup broth.

The carnitas burrito and chicken fajita burrito that we ordered were outstanding. They were a fairly large size, piping hot, loaded with a generous portion of really flavorful, moist meat. We would not hesitate to order either one of those again. 

Overall, a really pleasant experience!
