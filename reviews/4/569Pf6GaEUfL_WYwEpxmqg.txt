(from susan) This is my favorite place when we visit - I get the cheese enchiladas - like everything but the chili (too hot for my ulcer) - the owner is a sweetie and this is a great shop to buy stuff to take home for friends. Gotta eat here at least once - preferably more! It is really eclectic ..... go casual (lol).....have fun and bring the whole family!
