My second visit there... we just sat at the bar for some drinks and desserts... I loved their sangrias... so good that I don't even want to make my own at home anymore (even though it will be cheaper)... the crepas always so good... not too sweet, not to much... just perfect... I can keep going there just for the sangrias and the crepas... this was the last stop in my mexican restaurant tour... well done...
