Lots of mixed reviews on Zaba's ... I guess your experience may depend on what and when you order. I popped in here early on a Saturday morning looking for a quick breakfast that didn't have "Mc" in the title. Zaba's was open and serving breakfast burritos. And these were the real deal - reminding me of the great breakfast burritos I would get at Anita's in the DC area. Scrambled eggs, beans, potato, cheese, and salsa, and chorizo - oh MY! It was a very ample and tasty breakfast burrito, and it was around $3.50, which was entirely reasonable for what I got. I would come back here again if I am staying at The Plaza or Downtown.
