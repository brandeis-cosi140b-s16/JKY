Coming from Southern California, I've been fairly disgruntled with the Mexican food in Vegas since moving here 14 months ago. But despite this place being down the street, we didn't try it until recently, skeptical -- but are glad we did!

The atmosphere is kind of like On the Border Meets Islands (if you're familiar with that chain) . The food seems to be a mix between the Tex-Mex I recall from living in Dallas and California-style mexican food. It's a little more on the tex-mex side, I'd say, though you can get shredded or ground beef, if beef's your thing.

The chips don't appear to be homemade, so that's a bummer for me, but they're still pretty tasty. And the salsa is a nice smoky chipotle.  Chips and salsa is a So Cal staple which we've struggled to find here, for some reason.

The fajitas I had were good, too. Were they may favorite ever? No, but I'd order them again! Their beans are delicious, too. I'm not as big of a fan of their rice as my boyfriend is -- he LOVES it -- but it's also quite tasty.  

They have a nice selection of items and we've gone back sevearl times now -- once to dine-in and we've gotten food to go from them a few times. Their service has always been really great, friendly, especially the bald-headed gentleman -- REALLY nice and personable.  

Great, now I want Que Mas for dinner...
