I really like the food here but they lose a star for their staff. I always get take out so the staff won't keep me from coming back when I need a Mexican fix. I love that I can choose all the ingredients to create my own dish. 

Management does need to do something about their unprofessional employees. They are always playing and talking back and forth instead of 100% focusing on the customer in front of them.
