This Moe's location is one of my faves...

Sometimes, I take the boyfriend lunch on my off days and this place is really helpful... I have placed numerous call in orders and the food is always hot and correctly prepared... The queso is expensive, in my opinion, but it's also really good... I guess you kind of have to suck it up at that point... I won't buy it if we're eating a home, but for lunch at my honey's workplace, I shell out for it...

On the occasion that I do a regular walk in visit, I get the classic greeting (Welcome to Moe's!) and swiftly executed service... Even if there's a long line, you really won't be waiting long...

The only gripe I have is the parking lot... It's so small and the spaces are alternately diagonal on each line... If there's a rush, it's a headache waiting to happen to get in and/or out...
