First, qdoba is delicious. Second, this particular location has free parking which is odd for a place in the city. So it gets half the stars just for that. The qdoba in Oakland has zero parking. Third, it's right next to a chipotle in case you change your mind between parking and ordering. 

Finally qdoba has quesso, it's delicious and the only reason I go. We can all agree that both chipotle and qdoba are magnificent and we don't need all this hate and vitriol in the burrito eating community. Burritos come from a place of love.
