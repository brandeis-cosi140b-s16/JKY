Food: Great family size portions, always hot, bold flavors. The chips and salsa are okay. Not the best I've had, certainly not the worst. It's nice that they offer a couple different types of salsa if you ask depending on your spice preference. 
We've had beef, chicken, seafood, pork, soup, and salads. All delicious. Especially impressed with the soups. Tortilla was our favorite. Very deep, rich flavored broth. All meats have been tender and clearly slow cooked. 

Service: Friendly, quick, consistent. They've always checked back on us to make sure we're happy with the food. 

Ambience: Colorful, tastefully done, and festive. 

As usual with Yelp, some of these reviews are laughable. Trying to order corn dogs at a Mexican food restaurant, being upset about having your drink refilled, upset that your plate was hot?!    Hopefully these guests can return to their preferred Mexican food restaurant, Taco Bell, which seems to be more in line with their level of dining maturity. 
My wife and I have been here nearly every week since opening. There were some service bugs that were worked out after the first week but this certainly is to be expected with most restaurant openings. 

Glad this family owned restaurant took a chance on Maricopa. Will be back again for sure.
