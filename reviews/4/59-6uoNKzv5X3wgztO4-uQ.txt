This is a pretty cool place to get street tacos. They cook their meats over charcoal and it adds a really nice flavor to it. I highly recommend the Carne Asada Tacos, Yummy ! They are the small type so you may want to get 3 or 4 of them. 

They have a nice little patio in the from so you can enjoy your food outside on a nice day. This place is located in Mesa, AZ and is close to Gilbert Rd. and University. 

Stop in for some Tacos, you will love them!
