Well my dad enjoyed his food very much however I didn't care for mine as much. The tacos were great but I didn't care too much for the sopes usually when I go get sopes they are bit smaller and with more meat but I felt like I was eating tortilla and beans. I did like how cute the little place was and how it was quiet inside and the nice young lady who works there. I just wished I would have enjoyed the food more.
