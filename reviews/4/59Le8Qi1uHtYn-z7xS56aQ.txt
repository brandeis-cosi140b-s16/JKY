This is a hidden gem Mexican spot in small town Urbana. The service was a bit slow but that is because it was a packed restaurant! My first time I ordered steak tacos and it was the best tacos I had by far in Urbana Champaign. If you are a student, you most likely need a car because it is not on campus and the buses do not go near the restaurant.
