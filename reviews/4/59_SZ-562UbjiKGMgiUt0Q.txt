The taco adobada was amazing. The taco asada was not: fatty chewy meat and watered down tasting guac. I only tried the 2 cause I didn't know what the others were and they weren't able to explain them to me. I will definitely go back for the adobada. I wouldn't try to eat them on the go as they are very messy.
