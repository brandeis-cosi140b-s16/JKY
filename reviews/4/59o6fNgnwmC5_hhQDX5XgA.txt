In a nutshell:  the food is delicious, the owners/servers/cooks(?) friendly, outgoing, & self deprecating; the service - slow.  Truly, the only flaw.  However, the owners/servers acknowledged their lack of speedy service and would apologize, and make fun of how slow they are.

I can't say enough about  their food - fresh, delicious & worth the wait!!  The mole chicken  enchiladas are incredible, as is their "Conquistador" burrito.  Portions are hearty & the prices are as they should be - fair.
