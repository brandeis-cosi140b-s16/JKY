3 Margaritas has a new name...  El Presidente

I cannot comment on the past food but the new food (same menu) was good. 

Thursday night heading towards Valle Luna and I made an executive decision to go to new place on Bell and 51st Ave. 

We were greeted and sat right away. There was a live band playing and plenty of people eating. 

The chips and salsa were good, the kids liked the bean dip they give with the chips. We ordered some hot sauce too. It was a little too hot for me. LOL

Kids had a bean and cheese burrito served with rice and beans. The odd thing was the melted cheese on the outside of the burrito. Both kids liked the meal. 

Angie, my sexy wife, had a Green Chile Pork Chimi. She said it was OK but missing something. I tasted it and couldn't  figure out the missing ingredient either. Served with R&B.

I had a Shredded Beef Taco and Chicken Enchilada with R&B. The taco was light and crisp with a nice flavor to the beef. The Enchilada was good, the red sauce was good too. 

They also gave us two Flans to share. I thought it was really cool. I had never had flan but thought it was OK. I am not a huge sweet type fan. 

$30 bucks before tip. Would I go back? Sure but not a place I would crave.
