Went here for a hh fundraiser over the weekend and had a good time. We were out on the patio and since it was chilly, they had the heaters on, as well as the fire pit, which was nice. I was seated for a little bit before anyone came by so I went up to the bar to start a tab, no big deal. I had the sonoran margarita which was good. Once one of my friends joined me, we shared an order of onion rings which was okay. The chili lime aioli sauce that came with it was a bit heavy on the mayo. We also ended up splitting an order of chicken tacos, which again were good but not remarkable. Sometime during our visit I switched to house margaritas which were tasty. We ended the night noshing on their chips and salsa. I really liked their salsa verde, very spicy! Our server as nice enough to close our tab and move us inside as it was starting to sprinkle and get really windy. The inside is cute, and the music wasn't too loud for us to continue our conversation inside. I'll definitely be back.
