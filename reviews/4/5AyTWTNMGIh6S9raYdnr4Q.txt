We were with a group of 10 guys here for diner tonight and everybody liked whatever they ordered. I had the Carne Seca Machaca and it was really good. Guy sitting next to me had Carne Adobada, a large pork steak, marinated and grilled, it was very good.  My friend across from ordered a combination of tamale and taco, he liked it a lot. Their salsa is hot, but oh so tasty. The margaritas were excellent. The restaurant has been there for almost 40 years and if they keep serving this kind of food, they will be around for another 40.
