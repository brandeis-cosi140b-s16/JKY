I've heard things about Taco y Taco, but I'm never quite near a location. We decided to grab a quick lunch here to seize the opportunity. 

We settled on getting tacos - 

Al Pastor -  it was on the sweeter side of marinades and a bit leaner meat. That can be a pro/con depending what you are into, but I happened to enjoy it. 

Cabeza - this was really good, they chopped it up well so that you get a even distribution of the meat and fatty bits. 

Lengua - If you aren't sure about lengua bits, this version may be easier to swallow as it was shredded up. 

The one thing I wasn't expected was it was gonna be dressed with salsa already. I mean, I suppose that's not a bad thing except I saw there were other sauces at the condiment bar that I wanted to try. Just FYI in case you are one who is spice sensitive (al pastor salsa had kick) or want to try various sauce that "everything" on it meant that. 

Prices weren't bad at $2.25, but are definitely higher than street tacos as they gotta pay rent on this large space. 

I enjoyed their horchata. It wasn't the usual Bang brand mix, but seems homemade! Lovely creaminess and just the right amount of spices...Yum! 

I did enjoy the tacos so I would be back, but only if it's not busy. I absolutely hate this style of ordering at stations when it's busy as it just gets to be a confusing and everyone getting in each others way.
