I have eaten there 3 times now and will continue to go in the future. During the week they have $2 beers before 6 or 7 PM. The chips and salsa are good not great but  the fish tacos are excellent. Enchilladas are good and portions are large. The house beans are better than the refried and the rice is outstanding.  If you show up on an afternoon during the week you can get a burrito and Corona for around $10....... Not bad.
