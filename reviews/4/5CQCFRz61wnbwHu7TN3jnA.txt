Inexpensive, no-frills Mexican cuisine.  The vibe here is like you're eating Mexican food at a Mexican restaurant in AZ from the '80s, and it's definitely possible that all the decor hasn't changed much since the '80s.  

I had a horchata and the chile relleno plate.  The horchata was nice- it was very creamy tasting and not too sweet, and they sprinkled some ground cinnamon on top for added flavor.  The chile relleno was quite good.  The breading was nice, and it was a good balance of chile to cheese.  The refried beans in the plate were also very tasty, but the rice was a little too crunchy for me.
