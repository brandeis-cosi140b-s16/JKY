I like this Los Dos Molinos because you still get the amazing food, without the wait. It's a more relaxed setting (although for me half the fun of going to Los Dos on Central is the ambiance) but that is somewhat reflected in the service which can be less than stellar. Still, I don't think there is a better place for Mexican food in the downtown area for sure. The carnitas are perfectly cooked & tender, the tortillas are some of the best I've had, and the salsa & sauces will make your mouth want to fall off. 
All in all, a great Los Dos addition as far as convenience, and the food is just as addicting, but I would head to the Central location for the full experience.
