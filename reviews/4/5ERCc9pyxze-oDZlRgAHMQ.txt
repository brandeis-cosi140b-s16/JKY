Fast and tasty tacos! The potato was super hot and more "creamy" than I expected, assuming it was just a baked potato. Tacos were delicious, although I was surprised they were only available chicken or steak. I ordered a gordita, but somehow got a burrito (that is not even on the menu?!?) I kept it, but it was a big one and I was so full after that I really regretted not sending it back. Jamaica was great. The "backyard" is so cute, I woukd have probably loved it just for that, haha. But I'll be back again!
