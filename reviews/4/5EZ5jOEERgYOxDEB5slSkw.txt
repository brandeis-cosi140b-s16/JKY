I ordered the shrimp and carnitas tacos (both delicious!)  and washed it down with an ice-cold Mexican Coke (the only soda I'll drink).  

The salsa bar is GREAT - variety. The walls are covered with local art. 

Con: There is nowhere to wait if the modest sized restaurant is full. No one wants to wait in the heat during the summer.
