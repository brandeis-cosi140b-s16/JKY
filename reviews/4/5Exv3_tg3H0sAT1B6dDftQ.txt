Airport breakfast is a tricky thing. If you have time for a proper breakfast you either A) are on an international or red eye layover or B) you do not like sleep and really like your breakfast dining in airports. 

Personally I like to maximize pillow time so my breakfast needs to be quick and efficient without sending me to the airplane bathroom and subsequent apologetic walk of shame past those poor souls forced to sit near said bathroom.

Salsarita's delivers on the food without delivering to my airplane companions. The food is quick and clean. The service is cordial and polite. The smiling faces here give me the feeling that all is well with the world - and if I have an extra ten minutes to take my Salsarita's to the rocking chairs - their analysis is certainly correct. 

When passing through CLT - consider Salsarita's. BK, Quizno's and Cinnabun may be known entities - but it's time to think outside the tortilla!
