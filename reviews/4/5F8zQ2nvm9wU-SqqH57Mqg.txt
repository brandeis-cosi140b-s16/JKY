Strolling thru the South Park are we stumbled upon Paco's.  We were greeted by a friendly smiling hostess and shown to a table right away, even though it was Sunday brunch time.  There is limited outside seating but  it was raining today.  The menu is straight Tex-Mex with a slight twist of interchanging ingredients.  
The ambiance is very casual and there is a long bar with TVs every where.
We ordered guacamole prepared table side, but it never came so I can't review.  The chips were the thin kind, lightly salted and fresh with a red salsa  that was mild in heat but had a fresh lime finish.  We ordered tacos: I had soft flour tortillas filled with slow cooked brisket and the other of fried fish.  Both were tender but lacked any pizazz!  My sweetie ordered one steak and one turkey club carnita taco.  She loved them both and thought they were seasoned well.  The tacos come with a choice of three differently prepared beans; we chose the charro style which were tender and nicely seasoned.  A citrus chipotle slaw comes with it too but it was very bland and mild.  I did like the addition of radishes though.
Our server was very knowledgable, and friendly.
I would recommend Paco's for a casual quick bite or to hang with friends.
