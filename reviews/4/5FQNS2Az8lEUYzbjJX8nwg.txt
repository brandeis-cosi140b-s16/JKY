Very yummy been there twice now and have been happy with my orders.  I got the burrito de lengua the first time and the enchilada combo plate the second.  It's not a home made version but the restaurant version. It's pretty decent I would certainly go back to try the rest of the menu as well I gave it 4 stars instead of three because I'm extremely picky on the rice. If it does not taste good I won't even bother with the rest if the menu. This rice however was very good! Good texture good quality good flavor! I'm excited to try the rest if the dishes.
