Really great service here. Everyone is very attentive and super nice. We tried the 2 tacos and side salad happy hour deal. We tried the carne Asada, shrimp and one of the pork options. The shrimp was definitely the favorite. The chips and salsa aren't our favorite, but I think we will definitely give it another chance and try something else.
