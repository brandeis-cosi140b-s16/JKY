Good, authentic food, lots of it.  Cheap, too.

Been there twice now, got to chill outside late night with the mariachi band the first time for Cinco de Mayo while chowing.  They serenaded one of the guys in our group.  Awkward.  Classic.

The second time was for dinner.  The two of us ate for around 15 bucks altogether.  Portions are slightly bigger than what you would expect for the price.  Not the best mexican food I've ever eaten...but good enough for me.

Got to love unlimited homemade nachos and salsa, gets me every time. That alone is worth a star. Sign me up.
