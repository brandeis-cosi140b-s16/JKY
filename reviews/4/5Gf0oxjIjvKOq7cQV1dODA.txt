You have to sit outside to get the best experience from this place. It quirky and cute while you sit on either side of the moat running through the exterior. I really liked their chips and salsas. The season their chips and I'm a spicy girl that LOVES mexican food so I was a big fan on this original take on the fried tortilla. Try the Lobster Croissant sandwich concoction and you will not be disappointed!
