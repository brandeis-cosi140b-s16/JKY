I can't believe that others give this place a ONE for stars. I have been here several times and It is real good. The food is always consistant. I like the Animal Burrito along with the tacos. The place is clean and the ingredients are fresh. It is your basic Mexican restaurant with what you would expect.

PS the Korean place next door, Yum Yum BBQ is a great Korean place.
