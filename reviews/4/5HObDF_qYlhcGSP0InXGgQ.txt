solid tex mex faire. nothing too fancy, just decent food at a reasonable price. 

though, i will give an little extra credit for a fantastic salsa. it has a mild grilled veggie flavor to it that compliments their food really well. 

i can't say much for the dining experience since we opted for take-out to watch a movie at home, but it seems like everyone there was pretty pleased and the staff seemed on-top of things well we waited for our order. 

next time i'm passing through town, i may just stop in for the whole experience.
