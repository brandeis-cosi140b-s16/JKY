Love, love the salsa bar! Great variety and plenty of Hot options.
The atmosphere is laid back and the menu is typical sit down Mexican restaurant style.
I had the shrimp/crab enchiladas, which were pretty good and I could taste the shrimp more than crab. The entrees were good sized, and they are not skimpy with the beans.
We had no issues with service, and though we didn't have any margs or other bar drinks, they do have Happy Hour.
A good stop for decent Mexican if you are at Sunset Station.
