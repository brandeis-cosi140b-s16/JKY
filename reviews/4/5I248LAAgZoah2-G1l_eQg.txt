Seriously some damn good food here.  The place looks like a total crapfest from the outside, especially being right there at a hotel in a dubious neighborhood, but trust me, once you go in the weird doors (the entrance always seems like it's in a transitional state of construction) you'll feel like you just discovered a hidden gem!

The not-so-good: If you're not with a large group, I recommend asking for a booth, because they tend to crowd the tables a little close.  Sometimes it feels like they're pushing you to join another party the way the tables get too close.  And then there's the waiters... I've gone here dozens of times, and at least 75% of the time I've had a weird waiter ogle me.  Even when I've gone with my father! They can be kinda shameless. Wear a turtleneck if it'll bother you that much.

And then there's the good.. which far outweighs the negatives: Their food is freakin' amazing, and plentiful!  Expect to get a big basket of warm chips & salsas as soon as you sit down.. They'll keep filling that up as soon as it empties, but save room for the meal- the food is the star here! Their shredded beef is spiced perfectly. (Most dishes come with ground beef, but they will upgrade if you ask - and it's a million times better!)  I love their flautas, and their enchiladas. (I'm a sucker for a good enchilada!)  I highly recommend their enchiladas suizas (green sauce and cheese- really really good).  There's really nothing bad on the menu, ever. And no matter what you order, their portion sizes are huge!  

Don't feel bad about being too full for dessert.. they'll still bring you a little sopapilla with strawberry sauce & whipped cream with your check! It's the perfect little ending to a fantastic meal!
