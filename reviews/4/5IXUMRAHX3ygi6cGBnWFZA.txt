In Phoenix visiting friends and catching the Springsteen show. We live in Austin and it's hard to find Mexican food there that isn't tex-mex influenced. Wanted to get some birria, so hard to find in most places and almost impossible in Texas. Did a good search, found this place. just took everyone and wow, this place is awesome.   I would absolutely go back if i lived out here, and would love to have this place in Austin.  We had the birria and the molcajete, just awesome. 

If you like authentic mexican food and are fine with kind of a hole in the way type of atmosphere, this is your place. Try it, you'll love it.
