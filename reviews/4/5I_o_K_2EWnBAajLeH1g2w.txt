I had been wanting to try this place for a while. After trying it I can't believe I have managed this long without Lempira in my life. 
I ordered the Carne Asada Lempira after much narrowing down of the many delicious looking options. The plate came out quickly (barely enough time to delve into the chips and salsa..which were great) and was so enormous that it prompted me to exclaim " HOOOOOLLLLYYYY SH**!". 
Everything on the plate was so yummy (there were a lot of things on that plate) The carne aside was flavorful and tender, and that roasted poblano creme ...yes please.
Considering all that food was only 11 bucks and I had enough left for 2 more meals (and I eat a lot) the prices here are super inexpensive.
The ONLY reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I did stand in the entry way unaddressed for an awkward amount of time with at least 4 employees standing around me before I was acknowledged and lead to a table. But once the food came out I quickly forgot all about that.
Sorry Three Amigos...I've got a new favorite
