Great neighborhood cantina. I have been three times now and tried something new every time. I just had the green chili chicken enchiladas and they were truly amazing. The tacos are filled with flavor, and the chips and salsa are fresh and top notch which is my primary indicator for Mexican food. The only place that they fall slightly short is average margaritas. There is a great patio, comfortable dining area and a very inviting bar area. All in all, I recommend a try if you're in the area.
