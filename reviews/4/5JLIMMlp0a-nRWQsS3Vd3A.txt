What a nice little gem! I had chips and guacamole which by the way tasted homemade and was really fresh. The fish taco was good. They brought out a shrimp soup which if you are a fan of shrimp you will love. A bit spicy though so be ready. The chicken tacquitos.... AMAZEBALLS! All in all great service.
