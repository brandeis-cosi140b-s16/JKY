If you like authentic mexican seafood - than this is the place. The seafood tastes fresh, I haven't had anything I did not like. The food is really good, definitely a place I recommend.

However, the area is questionable - I've never had an issue, but you do get an uneasy feeling. Also, the service is not great, this might be because the place is always so busy - it seems like your waiter/waitress is running all over the place. Definitely be  prepared to wait for a table on the weekends, sometimes for 30 minutes +
