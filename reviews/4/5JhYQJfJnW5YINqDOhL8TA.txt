I would have given another star if they hadn't run out of horchata. To say that my heart was broken is an understatement when I was told the news. The endless supply of chips and variety of salsas did occupy my thoughts. Yet, while my mouth was on fire and all my taste buds started sizzling away, I couldn't help but yearn for my horchata that was not to come. The carne asada taco and the shrimp tacos (both types) were all very good. I will definitely be back.
