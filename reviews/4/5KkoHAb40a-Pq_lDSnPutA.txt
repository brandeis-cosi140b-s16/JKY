Just got checked into the MGM and needed a meal. It was a great way to start the vacation. The decor was really fitting. Lot of sugar skulls and Dia de los Muertos paintings which I love. Ok the drinks, I would recommend the top shelf margarita. I did not have one but was able to taste the one my husband owned and had instant drink envy.  For dinner.. I started with the ahi tuna ceviche which was so good! Creamy and very fresh with great flavor. I could have had 2 more dishes. For the main course I had carnitas and mushrooms again great flavor and with a white cheese crumble and chunks of mango. At the end of the meal my sister mentioned that this was my birthday trip.... they brought out flan with a caramel sauce and what I think was some sort of roasted nuts in chocolate (and yes he got the table next to us to helps sing Happy Birthday to me). I was ready to fall over. The service was great which also added to the enjoyment of the meal. I would say that if you are in the MGM to give it a try.
