great cheap mexican grub!  a rainbow of different colored, freshly made aguas frescas!  

this is the best local taqueria i've been to in vegas.

you know you've hit upon a good taco spot when you're the only white chick in the joint and the 2 mexican guys in front of you in line are wearing cowboy hats and singing along with the awful mexican music on the jukebox.  telemundo all day long!

i love it!
