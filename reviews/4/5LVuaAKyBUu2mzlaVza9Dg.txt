Once my plane landed in sunny Arizona my friend knew without question where I wanted to go for drinks and food. 
The food is always great and I love that they bring out warm chips and salsa made two ways- mild and spicy.
We ordered appetizers as well and it was all great. In the two times I visited I would say during this visit that the service was on the slow side, but a problem with my meal was addressed by management efficiently. I would not hesitate to go again and I hope this won't be my last visit.
