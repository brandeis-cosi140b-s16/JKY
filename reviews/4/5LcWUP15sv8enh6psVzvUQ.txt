As you head south on 16th street toward Thomas Rd. it's easy to lose the Barrio Cafe amongst the nail salons, hair salons, and bail bonds (hey, it's a package deal folks!) 

Smallish restaurant with tight seating. I can see why people have complained it gets loud. Luckily my co-workers and I were just about the loudest ones there...so my apologies if you were at Barrio today!

 I ordered shrimp tacos. I order shrimp tacos everywhere now. I don't know what is going on. Is this a pregnancy craving? I could hop right across the street where they offer free pregnancy tests... just in case. 

Anyhoo, the shrimp tacos were the bomb.com. I think the gallo blanco shrimp tacos and these could probably have a Lucha libre-style fight and it would truly be neck-and-neck. 

They make their house margy with agave nectar (keepin' it the same plant family) which is a tasty twist. I like agave nectar in my coffee instead of honey...which I used to use instead of sugar. It's the neo-hippie coming out of me. 

Overall, decent food, a little pricey ($15 for 4 shrimp tacos) - good serving but at $3 a pop Gallo Blanco might still be the winner. I'd like to come back for brunch - mimosas and chile relleno sounds like a perf Sunday activity. I'd most definitely be back.
