My husband and I love this place, the staff is always friendly and you are seated quickly. Some nights they have a mariache band that comes in and goes from table to table taking requests. They also linger around at your table for a tip, which is slightly bothersome. It'd be better if they had a sectioned area to perform and people to come up and dance and leave tips. But regardless, the food is yummy and they have a HUGE drink selection.
