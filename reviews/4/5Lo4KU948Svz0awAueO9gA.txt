My wife & I have been going here since 1985. The salsa( I'm a huge salsa guy ) In my opinion is the best salsa in the valley. Their chips are always served hot and taste fresh. They are so good I could make a meal of  just their chips and salsa. 

We pretty much stick to a few of our favorite dishes. After I make a pig out of myself on salsa & chips I start my meal with a bowl of Albondiga Soup (Meatball soup with fresh vegetables).

For my entr√©e I usually get a  SIZZLING platter of beef Fajita with grilled vegetables. My wife usually gets a Chimichanga.  Both dishes come with a side of guacamole, sour cream and Spanish rice.  In addition the Fajita comes with corn or flour tortilla. As for the flavor of their food, their dishes are bursting with it. 

The food here is always cooked to perfection, tasty, fresh, delicious and served hot.  The service is usually awesome. In fact my sister who lives in Rhode Island always makes it a point to stop at Valle Luna to get her Mexican Food fix. 

WARNING: If you get there during normal dinner time you're going to have trouble parking and you're going to have to wait to get a table. 

FOOD: Drool worthy Arizona-Sonoran recipes!!! Always fresh, consistent, and served promptly.  PRICE: Very reasonable. SERVICE:  Service is usually good but they can get very busy. However I must say the wait for food is normally pretty darned fast considering how busy they can be at times.  CONCULSION: We've had our share of lousy over-priced Mexican restaurants. This place has been a go-to eating spot for outings with family and friends for years. Parking can be a challenge when they are busy but I feel their food is so good its worth trying to get a parking space.   RETURN  FACTOR: 100% We keep coming back! because we love this place.
