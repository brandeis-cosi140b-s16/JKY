The food is amazing. No wonder they have had to expand from a tiny place to twice the size. Food is fast, and the staff is friendly. I would give 5 stars but recently they have stopped offering the free chips while you wait for your order. Not that this is a big deal, but when you give me something and then take it away, I feel less happy. Had they never offered the free chips I would give them a 5 star rating.
