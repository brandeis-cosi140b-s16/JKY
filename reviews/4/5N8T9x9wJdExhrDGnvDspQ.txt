I have been coming to visit my in-laws in Sun City for several years now and every time I ask if we could go to a local Mexican joint. Needless to say they always end up ignoring me but this time I took the bull by the horns and headed over to La Perla. And I'm VERY glad I did. I can not compare this place to other Mexican restaurants in the area but it was exactly what I hoped for. I went on a Sunday afternoon and sat in the bar area. I had several margaritas while a DJ spun western and Mexican tunes and families laughed, ate and danced. I had ground beef taco, a Machaca taco, a Machaca Green taco and tamale, all of which were good except for the Machaca Green taco which was killer. Now I have a place to spend an afternoon eating and drinking when I come back to Arizona. I will be thinking about that Machaca Green taco until we meet again.
