Dang- worlds strongest margarita here! Most people don't know they even serve Margs here. I always thought they were wine margs but the guy who made mine says they are made with actual tequila. I ordered 1 and I thought I got roofied it was so strong. Anyhoo- good service, good food, good prices and good chill location- not too many people at all.
