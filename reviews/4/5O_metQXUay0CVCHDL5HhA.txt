I know it's a chain, it's only semi-authentic, but I don't care!! Let me tell you why I love Abuelo's... CHIPS and SALSA-- ask for their two hotter salsas if you like it spicy. I love the one they serve warm, I think they call is "salsa brava." The chips are so thin and crisp, yum.

I also love their hand-shaken margarita, it's made with premium tequila and lime juice, not mix!!

I also always order the Monterrey platter, it's huge so you can share or take some home. Get the papas!! I don't care so much for their rice and beans.

Uhh I don't know why so many people have been disappointed. I love it!! However, I always order the same thing.
