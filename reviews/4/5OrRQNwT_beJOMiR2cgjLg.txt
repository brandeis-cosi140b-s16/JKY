Came here one late night when we got to Vegas inside the MGM GRAND.
Nice place, the waitress was friendly and the food was gooood!
We all LOVED THE GUACAMOLE, MADE RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.
ALSO ENJOYED SOME SHRIMP, IT was made with tomatoes, and served chilled i believe, I forgot what it is actually called.
My dad got the fish, the Chilean sea bass I believe, and it was VERY GOOD.
My brother got some kind of chicken dish, very tender and melted in your mouth.
My mom, being a vegetarian got cheese enchiladas, and they didn't disappoint me, I enjoyed those as well!
