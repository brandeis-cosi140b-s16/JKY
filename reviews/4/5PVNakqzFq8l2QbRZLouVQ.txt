Sushi roll, burrito-style.

This fusion concept has made it's way from the Bay Area down to SoCal, across the desert to Vegas! 

The hardest decision: do you want a burrito, bowl (think poke-style/rice bowl) or nachos (aka Jachos)? I was on my way to McCarren so I went with a burrito as the most logical vessel for a grab-and-go situation.

You are able to either pick one of Jaburritos' own creations (named after different seaside locations) or customize your own sushi burrito.  Burritos come wrapped up in either traditional nori (seaweed), flour tortilla, or for carb conscious folks there's soy paper!

I opted for a custom burrito. Why? Because I've got old lady eyes and I could simply not be bothered with squinting to read the menu board and messing up my RBF in the process, plus you can't beat ordering your food Chipotle-style.

Need help? The friendly staff can help come up with a tasty concoction without judging you for adding all those extra proteins, extra toppings, extra sauces, etc. because beach club season is over now.

But let's be real here.... I wouldn't really call this a burrito, it's more of an oversized temaki-style sushi. All in all, I enjoyed my experience here and Jaburritos will be one of the options for food when I'm back in the area and need a quick bite to eat. The sushi burritos were pretty filling (I only added one extra protein serving this time) and the ingredients were all fresh, backed by a reasonable price.  We spent about $25.50 before tip for 2 burritos, 2 drinks and a side order of taro chips with cheese.

Pro-tip: opt for the taro chips as your side, or base for the Jachos vs boring tortilla chips.
