Been coming here for years, first as Chuy's and now as CC's and always a hit. I usually have their fish tacos but sometimes the shrimp or tri-tip. Always good choices. You can always help yourselves to chips and salsa to have with your meal and drinks. The chips used to be house made, not so sure any more, but good nevertheless. They have a full bar and plenty of TV's to watch sports. All in all a good, neighborhood joint to spend a casual Friday night or afternoon passing the time with friends, cold drinks and good food.
