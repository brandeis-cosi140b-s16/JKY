I had heard rumors about these delicious tacos.  But I didn't really fully understand it until I had them today.  Today I fully understood their deliciousness.  

It's such a simple thing.  One stands at taco stand.  One looks over delicious looking meat.  One chooses between a couple different delicious looking meat including steak and onions, sausage and pork.   One receives taco and walks over to a neat and clean looking buffet of delicious looking toppings.  These toppings include salsa, salsa verde, gauc, tomatoes and onions.  One devours tacos in an animal like fashion because... they're delicious!

So for serious, they rocked my world!  And at $2 a pop you can buy a ton without breaking the bank!  I had the steak and the pork.  I liked the pork more because it was uber flavorful.  I also loved the toppings bar because I LOVE to dump toppings on as well.  Although at two tacos I stuffed myself and was full for hours (which does not usually happen!).  

Do they beat out Reyna's tacos?  My answer would be they're on par but on different levels because they're just a different style.  That's just my observation.  The more taco stands, the merrier if you ask me.  Bring it tacos!
