I love Qdoba. Whenever I eat at another place like Moe's or Salsarita's I find myself comparing it to Qdoba and appreciating the variety but thinking it's just not Qdoba. Their burritos are about the same price as elsewhere but bigger. They have also have a great selection of other foods. My go to dish used to be their burritos but now it's the Mexican Gumbo. So good.

The location of this Qdoba is great. It gets really busy like all other eateries around Myers Park at lunch but it's worth the wait. The manager, Mike, is really nice and recognizes the regulars and calls them by name.

Don't forget to sign up for your Qdoba card so you can get free entrees!

There is also $1 beer on Fridays with the purchase of an entree... a nice warm evening, you've finished your work week. You meet some friends for delicious Mexican food and eat it outside while enjoying a $1 beer. It's a great start to a weekend.

Overall Qdoba is a great place if you want some quick Mexican.
