I usually order for pick-up. Super nice customer service. I'm a big fan of their burritos, especially the grilled mahi burrito on whole grain and beer battered fish burrito (pretty much 3 fish tacos transformed into a missile). I always request for red enchilada sauce inside (for free!!!!), it really makes this little piece of carb-loaded goodness into something you can only imagine tasting in your dreams. This location has a really clean salsa bar. I appreciate that the cooks take the time to grill stuff their burritos, gives it that textural differentiation. Fish is moist, veggies taste fresh. How I eat my fish burrito: the first bite, you have to make enough room to pour salsa picante and verde for the second bite, finally you reach flavor town on your second bite, on your third bite, the oozing white cream and dark earthy tones of that enchilada sauce transports you to a little third-world village in Mexico. My last bite, I was sad, because I wanted another.
