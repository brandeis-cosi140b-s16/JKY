I've lived over here for 5 years now and this Roberto's has always always always been good!!  Especially the Carne Asada Fries!! And there's been many days where I crave a simple Bean & Cheese burrito....and every single time it's been great!  It's been hit & miss at other Roberto's in town but this location has been good every time!!!  Ooh ya....almost forgot....the Shrimp Burrito rocks too!!!
