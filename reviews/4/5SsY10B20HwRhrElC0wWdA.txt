One of my favorite places.  I absolutely love their nachos!  I mostly frequent the restaurant to study and eat simultaneously.  The staff is friendly, the food is good, and the noise level is acceptable.  On Friday nights it's a little more festive with live Mexican music and $2 margaritas.  The ourdoor seating is wonderful, in the evenings especially and you can watch the game or the fight on the patio while enjoying food and drink.  The only drawback is that they don't have wi-fi.
