Amaaaazing margaritas... thank you YASMIN, server and bartender  extrorordinaaire! Chimichanga was fantastic.. I left feedback that the beans & rice were a hair cold& requested that they keep them warmer in the future. Margaitas were A++++. Will,definitely try this place again- has potential. . I am SUPER picky with my Mexican food - So give them a little credit. LOVE!
