Why am I writing this review? Well, one of my fellow yelp buddy was so persistent that Qdoba is better then Chipotle, that I gave Qdoba a shot again, because a year ago, their foods was kind of bleh to me, so i never went back...until now. Well, since I'm writing this review and giving it a 4 stars, you can obviously guess that I like my experience. Their foods tasted much better, and the service was much better too. Though i would love their steaks to be a bit more seasoned, other than that problemo, they're pretty good. Also the portion they give to you is much bigger than Chipotle, so that is a bonus. So I guess Qdoba is slowing regaining my love again :)
