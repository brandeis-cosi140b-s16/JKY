Good, consistent food and fast service. Highlights on chips and salsa as well as Carne Asada. Yum.  Margaritas pretty good too. Guacomole was so,so..edible.  Have to mention we sat at the bar in the center. It was not crowded but very impressed the bartender handed us the remote without us even asking and helped us find the Cubs game. Nice!  If u r in Ftn Hills and looking for good food, great prices, and a lovely margarita, remember Que Bueno.  One of the few places that has remained open as long as we've been here!  We forget about it way too much.
