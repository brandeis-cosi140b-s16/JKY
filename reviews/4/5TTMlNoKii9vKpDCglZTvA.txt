I have to give some love to this particular slightly-upscale La Salsa. It's one of the few places you can sit outside just a few feet away from the Strip sidewalk, and all the people-watching that affords.

Do this on a warm night with a couple friends and a round of margaritas, and it really doesn't matter how good the food or service are.
