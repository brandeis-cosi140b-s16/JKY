Great "fast" Mexican food,  well prepared.  Beats the heck out of the other "Mexican" restaurants in the area.  Served on paper plates and tin pans but hey it's reasonably priced and tasty!  Good quality ingredients.  Better than the sit down Mexican restaurants in the area.  They do have outside and inside seating so it's not a take out only place.   Nothing to dislike, its all good.
