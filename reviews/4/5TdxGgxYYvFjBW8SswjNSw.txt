In another life, I used to visit the Azteca on Woodlawn at lunch with some regularity, and I have to say that I did not care for it all that much.  I have to say that this location is actually much superior, and I really cannot put my finger on just why that is, though I do have some ideas.

For one, the building is so much larger.  Housed in the former McGuffey's (that should take some of you way back), it is not the cramped little space off of Woodlawn, and that alone makes a huge difference.  Add to that a better service vibe and the quick seating provided by the larger space and you are already off and running.

Recently they have added a funky little patio out back, which unfortunately means you are looking at Independence Boulevard, but still a cool space, and you have a winning combination.  Throw in some excellent food, and your standard chips and salsa - though unfortunately they currently do not offer their super-chunky-pico unless you ask for it, and you may actually be charged (apparently due to tomato shortages).

Definitely a worthwhile stop, and you are likely to be hit lightly in the wallet, and have leftovers for the next day to boot!
