Came here for lunch the other day. It was my second time here, but my first was a very long time ago... I think when they first opened. I like their menu, many things appealed to me and I had a hard time deciding what I wanted. I ended up choosing the turkey dofino wrap with sweet potato fries. Yummy! the only thing I did not like was the sauce that came with it... I am assuming that it was for the fries but either way it was way to sweet for my tastes:). I will definitely be back!
