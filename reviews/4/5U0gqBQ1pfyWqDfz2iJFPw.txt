My 300th review on Yelp was a Taco Bell on Ocean Ave. in San Francisco.  For my 400th, I'm moving a few notches up:  Garcia's Mexican Restaurant in Tempe, AZ.

My wife and I were exhausted and hungry after an evening meeting with our realtor.  After some deliberation, my wife suggested Garcia's  This is not the Garcia's with which she was familiar, but we know the area (near a Denny's that we frequent), and I have seen the place before, so it was easy to find.

According to my guide to Mexican restaurants (see my review of Valle Luna), Garcia's classifies as a type D, or chain-type sit-down restaurant.  I had a cheese enchilada plate and she had her usual chile relleno combo.  My meal was quite tasty.  The chips were thin--not as thin as those at Chevy's--but easily crunchable and dippable, with a good salsa and bean dip.  The enchiladas were delicious, and the rice was unusually spiced with something resembling a curry/cumin mix--very good though.  The black beans were fair.

My wife liked her relleno combo, but was surprised by the amount of breading.  She enjoyed her meal on the whole as well.

Service was friendly and we both left satisfied.  We also got a meal to go for our daughter at home, and were happy to see the large amount of chips and salsa that they packed into our to go bag.

Thank you Garcia's for a good type D Mexican meal.  Here's another place my wife and I need to frequent here in Tempe.  Next time we're tempted to go to the Denny's nearby, I'll suggest going here instead.
