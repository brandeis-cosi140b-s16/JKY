This small Mexican taqueria is a welcome addition Willy St. The service is considerably better than that of Cafe Costa Rica, which occupied the space formerly. The menu is simple and the ingredients are fresh. The enchiladas mole were really great; the freshness of the ingredients really shone in this dish. The tortas are also a good bet. The al pastor torta was delicious and filling. The meat was perfectly seasoned and grilled, and the tomatoes, lettuce, and avocado on the sandwich were very fresh. I believe they get their produce from the Los Abuelos Farley Farm. They have specials listed on the whiteboard in the back, which is hard to see if you are sitting up front. Be sure to ask for some of their aguas frescas!
