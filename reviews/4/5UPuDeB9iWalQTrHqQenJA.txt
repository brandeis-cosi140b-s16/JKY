I first visited Burrito King (now merged with Torticas Grill) based on a recommendation from a friend, and I was not disappointed.  The combo meals are a great value- you can get a relatively authentic meal of two tacos, rice, and beans for $7 out the door, or a bigger platter (my choice was the burrito, enchilada, and tamale) for just a little bit more.

Sure, the value and authenticity are great, but the one thing that will keep me coming back is the chorizo.  The really smoky flavor is among the best that I have had.  The chips and salsa (possibly made on-site?) are also really solid.
