Food is great, they're quick making orders and it's cheap; especially for the servings you get. I usually get the Carne Asada fries which to my liking comes with an abundance of meat. Their service is great, I've been going there for a while now and they have never gotten my order wrong (knock on wood lol). Definite 2 thumbs up!!!
