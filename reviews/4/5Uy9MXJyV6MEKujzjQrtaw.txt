Walking into this joint you might be a little overwhelmed at first (especially if you go when they're busy), but don't fret your pretty little head, you got this. The meats are ordered in different lines, so if you want to sample more than what's offered in one line it helps to have a friend to wait in another line for you. The advantage to this is that by streamlining the ordering and preparation process the lines do tend to filter through reasonably quickly so even if you go alone it shouldn't take terribly long. 

The adobada is without a doubt my personal favorite, it's hard to go wrong with grilled pineapple and smokey & sweet seasoned meat but most of their tacos are delicious, well seasoned/sauced, and interesting. The tongue tacos are also quite good. Definitely get yourself some grilled green onions and peppers, which are yet another line but usually quite short.

Sit underneath the stuffed cow head for good luck or to contemplate cows and stuff while stuffing your face with cow...or pork...

Also had a guy mention this place while out at another restaurant with my boyfriend. The man claimed to be originally from Mexico and said that these tacos were the most authentic in town. I don't know the veracity of his claim, but sounds good.
