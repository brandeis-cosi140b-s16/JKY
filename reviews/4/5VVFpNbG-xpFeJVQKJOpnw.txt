Cool Mexico atmosphere.  Greeted by the owner at lunch time who was a super cool guy!   Had the shrimp taco and the fish taco.  Shrimp taco was ok, the fish taco rocked!  Great fresh fish and the cabbage gave it that perfect taste combination.  Wife had the Chix. quesadilla.  She loved it.  A little over priced, but the food was very good!
