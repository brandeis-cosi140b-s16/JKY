Nice size outdoor patio - an outdoor patio is essential for a AZ bar. I saw some heat lamps out there too so it can be used year round.
Went there on a Saturday night and they had a DJ who played a huge mix of music from 70's and 80's to today's top 40. They have a stage in the back too so I assume they have bands too... during my visit this became a dance floor.
Had my dinner at this place to as part of a buffet (not sure they offer this all the time; we had a large group) but I enjoyed the food offered to us.
