I love this place.  

The Pupusas are made to order with your choice of cheese, beans, pork, beef, or a combination of everything.  Enjoy with the cabbage slaw and tomato salsa... so darn good! 

Siete Mares Soup - a must try.  With chunks of cod, a huge cherry stone clam, mussels, and shrimp.  Squeeze of lime and you are good to go.
