I went to 1900 Mexican last night.  I have been there several times and keep going back.  The staff are very nice.  There are lots of items on the menu and the food comes out piping hot in a very short amount of time.  I noticed last night that they had kicked up the lighting a bit which helps with the darkly printed menus.  :)  Great neighborhood place!
