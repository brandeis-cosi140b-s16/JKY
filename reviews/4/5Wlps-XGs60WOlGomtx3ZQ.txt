Not only did Santos Lucha give me a fantastic idea for my costume this past Halloween they also serve up some really good tacos. I was very indecisive about my meat selections so they welcomed me to a full sampling. They line em up from mild to hot to hotter then hottest. I liked them all but I decided on the vinegar chicken, pastor and conchinita.  They really pack the tacos full of meat and give you a variety of toppings. I was full half way through my last taco. I'll be back for more.
