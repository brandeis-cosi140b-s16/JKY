You had me at "Salsa Bar."  Oh Caramba... all you needed was a salsa bar to get me to come back again and again.  So many salsas to choose from makes this salsa freak so happy!  I love the variety and freshness of all the salsas, as well as the freshness and low prices of the food. 

When our order number was called, I had to ask the guy behind the counter if all that food was for my order because there were two trays full!  We spent less than $20 for all that food.  My hubby and I left fat and oh so happy after eating at Caramba's.
