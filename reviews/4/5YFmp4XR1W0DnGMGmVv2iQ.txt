Pretty solid Mexican fare. It was a pleasant surprise to discover this place considering Pittsburgh isn't exactly a hotspot for Mexican food.The restaurant is sort of in the middle of nowhere but it's worth the journey.

The tortilla chips to munch on were fresh and good. The enchiladas which I ordered for my entree were excellent.
