My wife and I love this place.  The food is always good and the service has been great.  We love how friendly and inviting the restaurant is.  Table side guac is a great addition to their menu.  The happy hour specials are great too.  We have had a lot of different items on their menu and our favorite is the fajitas.  They are fresh, well prepared, and the rice, beans, lettuce, cheese, and pico that comes with it are fantastic.  The sangria is amazing.  Keep up the good work!
