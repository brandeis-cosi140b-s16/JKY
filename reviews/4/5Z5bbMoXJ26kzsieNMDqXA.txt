Check your preconceptions of hotel lobby restaurants at the door.  Gallo Blanco is legit.

We were in town for a conference and stayed by the Convention Center.  While solidly impressed by the public spaces downtown, we weren't as jazzed by the culinary choices in the downtown core.

Thank goodness we had some local friends who could show us some of the outstanding local flavor.  

Gallo Blanco is Mexico City cuisine... according to our waiter.  I've not been to the big city, so cannot corroborate the authenticity.  It also didn't really matter to me because the food is hella good, wherever it originates.

Our apps... Guacamole and chips and elotes, row of tacos (fish, pork, steak), and duo of tortas (I got the one with the eggs), we're all delicious, fresh, and tasty.

Gallo Blanco also makes excellent margaritas, traditional and prickly pear style.  That's why we had 10 of them!
