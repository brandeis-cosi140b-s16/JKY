I like you Carlsbad Tavern, I really do. We are friends, right? Sooo, I can totally come back even though I was introduced to you while on a date with a guy who I'm not dating anymore because he has a little problem called a girlfriend? That wouldn't be awkward, right?  

Yeah, you should bring dates here if you're hiding something from them because they will be distracted by the waterfall. Also, the enchiladas are decent (let's face it, I'll eat anything covered in green chili) and the patio is great for relaxing with a margarita. Carlsbad isn't good enough for you to get lucky though, just in case you were wondering about that.
