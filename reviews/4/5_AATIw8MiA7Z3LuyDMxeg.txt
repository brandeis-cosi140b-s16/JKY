My first time at Chipotle I went at 12:30, very busy! I got the bowl with lime rice, chicken pinto beans and mild salsa. they were a little stingy with the chicken, didn't even get a whole scoop. i also got some guac and chips, i spent $9 for that. if i'm spending that much on just lunch i expect more chicken which was very tender and seasoned well. But all in all it was good, very fresh ingredients, tasty and i will definitely be back.
