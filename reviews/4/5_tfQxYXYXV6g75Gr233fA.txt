Very good tex-mex food.  Our service was excellent and both times I went the manager came over to check on us, and made an excellent wine suggestion!  I had no idea wine went with Mexican food, but it was amazing!  Their veggie fajitas with black beans and lime cilantro rice are an excellent vegan option!  Margaritas are good too!
