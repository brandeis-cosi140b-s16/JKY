In the former Filiberto's in this small retail strip, this Phoenix staple is now in Scottsdale. The restaurant is brightly colored, with colored cafe lights and (scary) lucha libre masks and pictures all around. 

They create your chosen dish much like Chipotle does, filling your plate, taco or burrito with beans, rice, salsas etc. Everything is super fresh. The shrimp cracked in your mouth (in a good way) and the salsas had a nice kick! 

The staff is friendly, though broken English if you don't know Spanish. 

Santos Lucha Libre is worth a try. A million times better than the taco shop it replaced. *Note: the sign is still the Filiberto's sign, so don't pass it by.
