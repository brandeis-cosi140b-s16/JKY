I thought the food was very good, the service was not bad but not outstanding either. We waited a while longer than we should after we got seated before anyone approached us and then waited a bit longer after we ordered our first round of drink but after that things were fine and the waiter was on point from there on.  

I ordered the shreded pork enchilads and they were fantastic. They were not smothered in cheese or sauce like some places, just enough sauce and cheese so as not to overpower all the other flavors going on. We ordered guacamole and some queso fundido for appetizers. The guac was very good, a nice amount of spice and pomegranate seeds made for a different and unique taste. The queso fundido was ok, I have had much better. 

All in all it was a good experience and I would definately return or recommend to a friend.
