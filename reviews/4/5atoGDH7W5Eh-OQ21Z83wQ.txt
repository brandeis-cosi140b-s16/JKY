This Cafe Rio is always packed, so be prepared to stand in a long line and try to bring a friend along to save a table if you are eating there.  I like that fact that you can order your food how you like it.  I am a fan of the chicken salad and the chicken tostada.  I like to have them go light on the rice and beans because I want to taste the salad.  The fresh tortillas are delicious as is the house salad dressing.  My son loves the burritos enchilada style, and my husband's favorite is the Monday night special of chile rellenos.  He says they are the best chile rellenos he's had which is a huge compliment since he is very picky. The dining area isn't always the cleanest, so be prepared to take a napkin to wipe off the table before you sit down.  I think that this is due to the fact that there's usually people waiting to sit down as someone leaves which doesn't leave any time for employees to wipe down the tables.  The tables are also close together which doesn't leave a lot of room to walk between them.  They also have frequent diner cards to earn free meals.  Make sure you ask for one as you will be back.
