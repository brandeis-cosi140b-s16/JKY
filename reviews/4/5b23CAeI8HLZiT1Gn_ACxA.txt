I go here for lunch every once in a while.. Its basically what you'd expect from a diner type restaurant in this part of town.  The food has always been good for what it is.. The service has always been good, and the prices are pretty good.  Its not 5 star dining by any means, but for what it is, its good.  They have improved the decor since management has changed.  Still not fancy or anything, but its not terrible.  Last few times I've gone in there they've kept it on CMT on the TV.. which I'm not a big fan of... But at least they have something on.  Anyway, I like it for the most part.. I'll have to stop in for breakfast of the fish fry sometime..
