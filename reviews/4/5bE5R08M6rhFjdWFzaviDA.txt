Great people and great food at a great price!

We recently relocated our business to this area and stop in here about 2x a week now. The girl at the counter is always super friendly. The food is always fresh and well made.

This is like Filibertos but much better IMO. Good stuff.

Try the Surf n Turf or the Adovada!
