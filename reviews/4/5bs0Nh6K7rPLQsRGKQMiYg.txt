the only two items i have sampled at eribertos have been the huevos rancheros,which i really liked. plus, they give you 3 overmedium eggs, instead of 2 scrambled..which is to my liking. the beans do no have much flavor, nor does the rice, but the pico de gallo and ranchero sauce more than make up for it.  the other dish i;ve had are the nachos with carne asada. also filling and fun to eat. other items i would choose to eat at other close by, higher end restaurants. i do check the health ratings, and while the county was doing them, they fared ok. but it's definitely a take out joint..no place you want to eat in.
