Cheap, delicious burritos in the Henderson area! One of my nursing professors suggested Faustos, since it was very good with portions and close to our nursing school. They have one of the best carne asadas I've had in a while. I have to compare them to the Mexican place back home called Adalberto's (Socal locations call it Albert's; it's the same kind of franchise). They are both really good, but since I can't have Adalberto's until I go home, I will have Fausto's!

If you're looking for a fast food Mexican place with decent prices, you have to go to Fausto's! Try their chimichanga and California burrito! Maybe the tostadas? A lot of people get this during lunch time.
