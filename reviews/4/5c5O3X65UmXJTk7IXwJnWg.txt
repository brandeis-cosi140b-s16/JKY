Tacos here are good, better than king tacos back at home in LA. I always come here when I'm in Vegas. The tacos comes with beans and everything. It's really good. My 5th time here. My favs are the Asada and lengua (tongue) and cabeza (head).... Tasty tasty and spicy spicy...just how I like it...hahaha
