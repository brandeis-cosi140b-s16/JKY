This place is good!  It's most likely not the best mexican you're going to say you've ever had, but it sure isn't going to be the worst either.  

Very clean and good service on my first visit and I'm definitely going back soon.  I tend to judge mexican restaurants by their salsa and theirs is some of the best I've had.  I ordered the carne asada tacos with cilantro and onion and they were very good.  Rice and beans are whatever, but for what it's worth, they were good too and definitely better than average. 

 If you're looking for a good mexican spot, look no further.
