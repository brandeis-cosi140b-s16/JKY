We enjoyed the food, the most disturbing part was when two men in plan cloths walked in with "OPEN AND CARRY" guns.  While this might be legal in Arizona, I personally felt uneasy and very unsafe.  The manager asked us how everything was and I said the food was great but I do not care to see guns in a restaurant unless they are on the police officers and we quickly walked out.  I will not do business with a company that allows 'OPEN AND CARRY FIREARMS" on a person while I am eating.
