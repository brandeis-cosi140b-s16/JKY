We headed out here over the holiday break since we didn't want to cook and planned to see a movie close by.  There were a fair number of people inside, which we always take as a good sign.  Our server was very helpful in making decisions on what we wanted, and gave recommendations on things we may enjoy when we asked her thoughts.  Chips and salsa were brought out within minutes of being seated - be warned, you may want to fill up on these!

I choose to go with the Arriba Pollo Con Queso - described on the menu as "An Arriba specialty. A giant golden brown chicken burrito topped with three kinds of melted cheese. Served with rice and charro beans."  It was delicious and I would order this again in a heart beat. I opted for sour cream and jalapeno cream cheese on the side, and both were excellent.  The jalapeno cream cheese normally comes in the burritos, and I'll most likely do that next time as well.

Overall: A
Good choice for Mexican in Scottsdale. Chips and Salsa are addictive.
