Visited Tony's for the first time. Nice people, clean restaurant and good food. 

Ordered one pastor and three chicken tacos. All come prepared with the usual toppings including salsa. The chicken was all shredded white meat. Very tender, but not over the top on flavor. The pastor was amazing. The texture was more of a stew then spit-grilled. Had amazing flavor and practically melted in my mouth.  

It's worth noting that there is no salsa bar. Normally this would bother me, but the salsa (pico de gallo I should say) they serve the tacos with is very tasty.

Watched tv while I ate. Also watched somebody get busted in the parking lot. Added to the ambiance for sure.  

The chicken, while good, was not amazing hence the four stars. Other than that, go for it!

Oh, before I forget, the prices are really good. The tacos are $1.50 a pop. Don't forget to hit the tip jar!
