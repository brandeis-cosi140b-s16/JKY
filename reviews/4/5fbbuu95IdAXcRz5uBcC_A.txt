Went around 1AM on a whim for a late night food run.

The place was dead and was being manned by only 1 person.  No worries though, the server/cook/cashier was quick and banged out our chimichanga in no time at all.

Chimichanga was cooked nicely and the outer layer was a nice balance of being very crispy but not oily.  Topped in guacamole and cheese, the chimichanga really hit the spot.  Additionally, the rice that was served on the rice was prolly one of the best rices I've had a Mexican joint.  Super impressed for a quick meal.

5 stars for the horchata on tap tho.  Neverending horchata???  Come on, this kid will come back simply to exploit the wonder-machine spitting out the cinnamon-milky goodness.
