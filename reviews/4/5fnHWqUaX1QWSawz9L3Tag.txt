It's a little hard to believe that this unmarked house across the street from a school is actually a restaurant, but once you get beyond the security barred door you find yourself in a dimly lit, non-temperature controlled waiting room.

It must be good though because I've never seen this room empty.  People come and go the whole time you're waiting for your food.  They stand behind the security bar and you exchange payment/receipts through the space underneath.  Then you wait and get your food under the grate next to the "order here" window.  Why all the security?  I'm hoping never to really find out..

The food!  Although it's a bit nickel-and-dimey, ultimately it's decently priced.  It seems like they typed up a nicer looking menu recently too that helps immensely (before all I had was a picture of the lego board they had up).

Anyway, the food is pretty legit authentic Mexican dripping with verde sauce and covered with cheese.  If you're looking for Mexi-comfort, look no further!
