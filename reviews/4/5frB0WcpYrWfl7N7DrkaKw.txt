I'm am very surprised by all the bad reviews.  We were here in June...for a conference...this was the only restaurant in the hotel that was opened at the late hour.  The food was fantastic & our servers were great.  There were maybe 4 other customers in the space...We both enjoyed our food...BF had the chili relleno...he said it was the best he'd ever tried.  The food portions were very large...luckily we had a fridge up in our room, but no microwave to warm it up the next day.  Our waitress, Josefina was great...we ate here 3X during our stay at the LVH...would definitely come back if ever in the area.
