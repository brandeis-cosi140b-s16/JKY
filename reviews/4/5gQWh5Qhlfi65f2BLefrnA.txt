I finally got to check this place out.  The Torta was the best.  Very good.
Huaraches good but not my thing. Sopes were very good.  Everything had good flavor and the salsas were excellent.  
I am so used to Americanized Mexican food that it is hard for me to get used to this more authentic cuisine.  So if you aren't familiar with this style of cooking you may find your meal different from what was expected.
The service could be a little bit more friendly.  I like the smallness of the eating area.  If I lived near here I would eat out here just because of it's small space.  Watch the first step inside, it's a big one.
