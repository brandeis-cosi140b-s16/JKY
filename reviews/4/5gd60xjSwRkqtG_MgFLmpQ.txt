I've ordered food to go from here several times and have never been disappointed in the least! The food is fantastic, especially the shrimp burrito, my personal fave. I've had the veggie burro too and that was pretty good. The staff is ok. Some of them are really nice but there are a few that are kinda shitty. Ignore them, just eat :)

 I love the grilled onion, lime, radishes, etc. that they add as a garnish. I can't wait to go again.
