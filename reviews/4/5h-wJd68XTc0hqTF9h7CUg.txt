I've eaten here plenty of times and always happy with the quality of the meal. My favorite are there fries with al pastor! It comes with all the fixings like nachos but instead of chips they use French fries!!! Love the salsas available too, compliments any item perfectly! 
I like to order their shrimp burrito when I want a change of taste and it is scrumptious!!! Imagine jambalaya wrapped in a tortilla and there's your shrimp burrito.

I haven't eaten here in awhile mainly because service there has been on a downward spiral, I ordered thru the drive thru and it took me roughly twenty minutes to get my food, I understand (and appreciate) thoroughly cooked food but that's a long wait for drive thru service maybe they should hire a couple more workers to speed up productivity.

I gave this place 4 stars because I truly love the food and would recommend it to anyone, just have to make sure that they aren't in a hurry for their food
