Cafe Rio is pretty good food. This particular Rio is awesome. You have to get here early or you will be waiting in line and may be forced to sit outside or get your food to go. If you're in the mood for Mexican style cuisine but want less lard and grease then Rio is the place to go. The enchilada sauce and balboa is really tasty. I would actually give this particular location 3.5 stars and not the full four. 
The con for this location;  parking is a nightmare during lunch and dinner hours. Cafe Rio is definitely overpriced. The burritos are huge and worth every penny. The tacos and enchiladas are way overpriced for the amount of portions you get. 
  My recommendation is the chicken nachos, enchilada style (red or green sauce) with lime salsa and fresca.. enough to feed two that's for sure.
