In town on business, read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I agree the food was good, hot and fresh. The staff is friendly and the restaurant was clean. I had the dinner buffet for $12.99, so I had an assortment of food on my plate. Haven't figured out how to post pic from my new IPad.
