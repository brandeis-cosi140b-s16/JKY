Service was outstanding. My waiter, Stew, was super attentive and friendly too. Whenever an employee went by me, they would check on me.

I had the chicken fajitas that were on special. Hot, fresh and tasted great. I asked for them to be extra spicy, and I received a small side dish with a fresh jalape√±o sliced for me. No stinky pickled peppers here.

I sat on their "outside patio", which overlooks the rainforest, waterfall area.

I enjoyed my experience. I'll be back.
