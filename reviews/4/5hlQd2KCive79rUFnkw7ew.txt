Actually they are back open about a mile West of where they were. Don't get the other review ratings, wonder what they consider good. Hal O Peno's has been around for quite some time and has been consistent (good ) the the entire time. Yes the new location has zero the ambiance of the old location, strip mall throw in some tables and chairs.  My #2 is as good as ever.
