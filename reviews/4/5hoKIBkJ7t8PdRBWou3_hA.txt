Located in the Home Depot complex, used to be the Popeyes. 
The food is great, especially the Nevada Burrito (so much better than the Claifornia) which is any meat of your choice, French fries, cheese and guacamole for only around $5. They have all the hot sauces and pickled carrots like Robertos. They do have everyday specials including two types of $1 chicken tacos, one with cheese and and lettuce while the other has onions and cilantro. 
The location is clean, which is different from most Robertos locations. This location does have drive thru and the wait is surprisingly not that long.
