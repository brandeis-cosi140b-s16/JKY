Glad to see some cheap food on the strip. I don't like going to buffets very much so I loved that there was a Chipotle so close. 

When I went there there were signs saying that they don't have their normal chicken due to shortages and that they didn't have any more corn salsa because of another problem. Sucked but didn't change much in terms of taste.

Prices were a bit more than I was used to paying at Chipotle but I'm totally fine paying that in Vegas.

Overall, great place to get cheap food on the strip. And if you're not in the mood for it you can always go to the panda express, pizza place, or McD's in the same building.
