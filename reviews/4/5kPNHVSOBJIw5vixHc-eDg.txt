Taquitos Jalisco is as authentic of Mexican food as you can get, and the prices are reminiscent of the penny horse at the grocery store. 

The most initial impression of Taquitos Jalisco may be misleading, nestled between a 7/11 and bordering a Little Caesar's pizza and a phone store (as well as a Mexican bakery which is also delicious). As you enter the tiny restaurant, there is seating for approximately 20, an outdated interior and an even more outdated jukebox. The counter setting resembles a Chinese takeout. 

As you begin to browse the menu, you come to realize that this is not your average quote authentic Mexican restaurant. This is the real deal. The tongue, the menudo, both extremely common in Mexico and both extremely uncommon in America. I have ordered many items from the menu and can safely say that I have not had a bad experience yet. If you are truly interested in authentic Mexican food and less interested in American influenced Mexican food, I would recommend that you give Taquitos Jalisco the ol' college try. I can promise that you will find what you have been looking for this whole time in this huge city; delicious, cheap, fresh and authentic Mexican food.

Thanks for reading.
