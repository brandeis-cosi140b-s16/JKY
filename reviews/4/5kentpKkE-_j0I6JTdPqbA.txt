I'm a little stingy on 5's or they would totally get one!  Authentic food, great salsa verde (get it on anything), great tamales and everything was solid to say the least. Margaritas were very good with homemade simple syrup and fresh lime juice for only $4.25. Sat at the bar and had great service. My girlfriend and I will be there most Wednesday nights at the bar if you want to drop in(kids eat 1/2 off Wed or we would hit a table sometimes).
