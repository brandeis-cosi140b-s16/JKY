Busy. Seems like the food is good. Just don't stand in line for 15 mins before you realize you are in the wrong line to order what you want.

This place is a lesson in patience because there is no method to the madness. Unbelievably slow for $2 tacos.  It is as slow as they are fast.

Finally got our food after like 35 minutes then there was mob as the cashier as people from five different lines tried to pay for their food.  Enjoy!
