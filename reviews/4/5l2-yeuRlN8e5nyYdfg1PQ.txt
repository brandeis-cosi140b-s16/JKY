The IN and OUT of mexican food.

Gotta love Fausto's specially their breakfast burrito. You get your money's worth. This thing is HUGE and will make you full all for $4. If ever your on a budget and your craving mexican food go to Fausto's. Their prices are pretty decent and I assure you, you will not be disappointed . I also recommend getting the taquito's and the chicken quesedillia.  And of course for your drink the Horchata. It will satisfy your thirst.

The atmosphere:  I wouldnt count on this place being a fancy sit down. Like i said its good for take outs just a quick grab and go type place.

Location: The location i went to was in henderson and really convenient.

I would highly reccomend this place for people that just want to grab quick mexican food. Don't expect anything fancy.
