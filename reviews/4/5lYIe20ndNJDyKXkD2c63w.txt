I had dinner at Isla this past weekend when I was on vacation in Vegas.  I'm from Texas so every single Mexican restaurant is really Tex-Mex, so Isla was a nice change of pace.  The margaritas were great (and strong), the nachos were different and tasty, and the shrimp quesadillas were my favorite.  I don't know if I'd go out of my way to eat here again on my next trip, but I'd certainly visit them again if I was nearby.
