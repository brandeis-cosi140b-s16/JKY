Authentic, delicious, and reasonably priced. This place is good to go. The staff is very friendly and the environment is welcoming. I have eaten there with co workers and my family and the atmosphere was appropiate for both. 

My favorite is the chimichunga with beans and rice and a jamaican horchata yummm. The serving size is fairly large and I always walk away feeling full. I have yet to see anything served that didn't appear to be appetizing. For a family or group of about 4 without any alcoholic beverages plan on spending roughly $50.
