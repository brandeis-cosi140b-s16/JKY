Tried this for a Saturday lunch and we were pleasantly surprised. Not your usual Mexican place
We ordered the Chile Verde Fajita Nachos and were blown away!  Not like any nacho we've ever had - it was great.  Crisp chips with a cheesey white sauce, tender-crisp veggies (peppers, onions, mushrooms, summer squash) and tender chicken. We split is - plenty for 2 for lunch.  Also had giant Margaritas which were very good and very reasonable.  Will definitely go back
