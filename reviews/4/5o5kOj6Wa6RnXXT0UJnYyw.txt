OK first off i love Mexican food. 
i have been here many times. the food is very good and the service is great. i usually have the burrito but this last time i had the steak quesadilla. very satisfying. the waitress was exceptional. the only thing that keeps them from 5 stars is that the bowls at the salsa bar are so god damn small...they are so small you cant get a whole chip in them. I'm a huge fan of chips and salsa so id like a bowl bigger than thimble. 
other than that id go again and again
