I am 'Vegas born & raised and have been eating here since the 60's. My parents ate here before me. My Mother in law has eaten lunch here every Saturday for as long as I can remember. She also has a margarita in her special mug. My wife and I join her once or twice a month. The chips and choice of salsa always get me ready for what ever I order. The food is not the Mexican food you would find in the spicy-hot places, you can actually taste  the food. I have never been disappointed. Occasionally I run into a local celebrity. Cops eat lunch here all the time.
