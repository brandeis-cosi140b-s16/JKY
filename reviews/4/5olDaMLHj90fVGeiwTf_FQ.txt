This restaurant closes their doors at 10pm SHARP!! My mom and I arrived at the restaurant at 10pm. The hostess planned to close the restaurant. Thank you Manager of the restaurant for letting us stay!!

We basically had 5 minutes to look at the menu. Our waitress wanted us out ASAP. I didn't look at the menu carefully so I just picked something out of the Specialty section. 

Anyway, the chips and salsa were awesome!!! Our basket of chips had three varieties: corn tortilla, blue corn tortilla, and a sweet and spicy chip. I really liked the sweet and spicy chip since it tasted like a slightly spicy churro. Yum!  The salsa had a black bean flavor and chunks of tomatoes. Also yummy.

The food came out so quickly!! It took like 10 minutes for the food to come out. Haha.

I had the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast. mMmMM.. the stuffing was so good!! I loved the herb-goat cheese mixed with the red pepper cream sauce and the cilantro pesto. The chicken was very moist! The asparagus wasn't too good, as it was chewy. However, the southwest rice pilaf was so creamy and had a smoky flavor. I also loved the extra touch of the tortilla chips on top of the dish. Lovely presentation!

My mom had the Chicken Penne Pasta with the cilantro pesto. The chicken was moist, and the pesto had a deep cilantro flavor. If you hate cilantro, stay away from this dish!! There was a tad bit too much olive oil, but the strong cilantro flavor was awesome!

It was a pleasant surprise to receive a frozen white chocolate tamale. YUMMY! I only eat white chocolate so I was so excited to eat this. Loved the nuts and the sweetness. 

Again, our waitress was not very nice to us. So I'm taking off a point for the service.

We were out the door by 10:40pm.
