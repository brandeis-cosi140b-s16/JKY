Cute, trendy atmosphere and I love the overall fusion of Asian and Mexican. We went for brunch but they were kind enough to make something for me off the dinner menu that I'd been wanting to try. Kimchee fried rice is so good! Everyone in my party enjoyed their brunch items (short rib beni, chilaquiles, steak sandwich etc) BUT they don't have a kids menu. We had to order short stacks which was still a lot of food and pricier than normal kids food. You can't go wrong with bottomless mimosas and their juice mixer options too!
