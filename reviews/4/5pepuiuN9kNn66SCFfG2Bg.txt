Loved the Carne Asada burrito so much on my last visit I had to have our again. Service was as friendly as last time so with held a star but the food is very very good. Very fresh flavors. Tables in the eating area around this restaurant could use some extra cleaning, BBQ sauce or dried yogurt seems to be on some chairs and a couple tables. All and all the restaurant is clean and the food rivals many high end Baja fresh venues. I will return again.
