Worth the drive! I'm so glad I placed my phone order before I checked the cross streets, because I probably wouldn't have ordered it since I was coming from Fort Apache and Flamingo, but it only took a few minutes on the 215 to get there! And Phat Phrank's certainly exceeded my expectations! My husband and I ordered three burritos to share with our three kids (1, 3 & 6 years old) and the five of us couldn't finish them! My favorite was the Chile Verde (with green sauce, of course) and my husband's was the Barbacoa! We also got the Carne Asada with red sauce, which was very good, but I definitely prefer the green sauce. Oh! And we got an order of chips and salsa, also delicious! The salsa is very fresh and flavorful (we tried all three: hot, mild and green) and the chips are perfect! And the staff is friendly, both on the phone and in person! We'll absolutely be back!
