This was my first visit to a Chipolte establishment and it was okay. I ordered 3 tacos on corn tortillas each with rice, beans, chicken, salsa and paid extra for guacamole. Lots of other things could be put on, such as hot sauce, sour cream, cheese and you could pay for chips and salsa. My meal Was washed down with a beer.....nothing as a draft....lots of people ordered the bowls and other popular choice is the burritos. It was fast, healthy food at what I consider a very basic dining area or place to sit outdoors. For $14, good food, no complaints.
A family of 4 children and 2 adults enjoyed a meal, and I noticed there is a kids menu. That's great!
A guy I met on line is a regular here for his take home meal for him and another....and he likes the bowls of food.
