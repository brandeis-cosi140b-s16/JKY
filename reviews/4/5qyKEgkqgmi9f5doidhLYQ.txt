Interesting contrast found here:  excellent abundant authentic (well to my American palate) Sonoran-style Mexican food but in the setting of a semi trashy beer hall!  Had a hard overworked server who kept things going in the dim, neon beer-sign lit darkness.  Looking at the website the chain (3 total) has pretty high accolades (Best of Phoenix 2009 by the New York Times), just interesting that the decor doesn't match, although perhaps I am being snooty and should just relax and have a good ole time, which is what the place seems to be trying to say.  Great food for great prices, can't beat that in the end.
