I agree with many of the criticisms listed by other reviewers (chips not great, some dishes can be bland, etc), but Fiesta is still my favorite Mexican place in CU. I am a vegetarian, and I love that they have such a good variety of dishes available without meat. I particularly love the chimichangas. I also am not a fan of refried beans, so I love that Fiesta has the option of black beans for all their dishes.  It is definitely a "comfort food" type of restaurant for me, cheap and cozy and consistent.
