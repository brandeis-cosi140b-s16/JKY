One of the better mexican places to have a burrito and eat it too. My only complaint would be the workers in the back. They seem to not wear gloves when making the food. But if you can manage to overlook that than you will be ok. The burritos are different from the competition such as baja fresh or chipotles. The flour tortilla they use also has a softer shell to it. I would give this place between 3 and 4. Unfortunately there again is no option so I will just round up.
