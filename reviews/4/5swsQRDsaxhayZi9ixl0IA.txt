This is a great place with authentic Mexican american food. Taste just like my Nana's food! 

Staff was awesome! From the host to he waitress, they were all friendly and attentive. 

Beans were awesome! 

Salsa was good. 

Tortillas were good.

Enchilada sauce was good. 

Carne Asada was ok. It was good, but a little overcooked. 

Will make this our regular Mexican resteraunt.
