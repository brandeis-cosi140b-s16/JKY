My first impression of this restaurant last year was not a memorable one.  We decided to give it another shot prior to a show at the Chop Shop last week and I've been dreaming of the Tavarua Wahoo Tacos ever since (Tuna tacos with a wasabi honey sauce - YUM!). I can't wait to go back just to have that again!  I was also very pleased with our server that evening.
