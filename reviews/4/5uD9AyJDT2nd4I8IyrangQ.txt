We were going to Naked City Pizza for my son's 18th birthday.  Since they are located in the bar we ate inside Desnudo Tacos and let me tell you when I saw the menu I had to try it.  The Fideo soup was by far the best I have ever had.  I got chicken and cheese tacos and were able to sample the beans, rice and pork.  The service was outstanding.  WE WILL BE BACK!!!
