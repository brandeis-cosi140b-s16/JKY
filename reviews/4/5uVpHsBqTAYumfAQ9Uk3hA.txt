My wife and I had lunch today here at Poppas. It was our first time here.
We were very play is with the lunch that we received. My wife had the rolled chicken tacos. All white meat. Very tasty. I had three  Asada tacos. They were fabulous.
This is very close to home so this may be our new Mexican food stop. Very authentic.
