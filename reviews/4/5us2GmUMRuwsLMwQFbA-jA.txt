This review is specifically for the breakfast. We pick up the breakfast burritos once a month or so. The staff is always very nice and they do a quick job of making your order. You can get bacon or ham, but we usually get bacon, ham, and potato, which is a great value for $5. You can barely finish them for a breakfast item. The tortillas are some of the tastiest I have had anywhere. I would highly recommend for breakfast, they are open early. I have not tried any of their lunch items.
