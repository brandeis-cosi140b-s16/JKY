While touring Market Square with some out of towners, we  stumbled upon Las Velas. I say stumbled upon because it is very easy to not even realize this place exists. We only knew about it because a guy over at Wingharts raved about the margs. The door is in between the Oyster place and the Diamond grill place and leads directly into a stairway that takes you up onto the second floor. This is fantastic, as every seat in the house has a view of the square. This would be an excellent stopping spot for a day when a lot is going on down there. 

We had a couple of dishes here, and none of them disappointed. The chips were fresh and the food was tasty. The service was pretty quick as the place doesn't ever seem to be packed.

If you have a craving for some Mexican food and feel the need to watch over the town while you sip on an ice cold beer stop in to this place.
