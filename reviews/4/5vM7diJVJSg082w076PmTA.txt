I'm no expert when it comes to Mexican food, but I do eat out often and work in the hospitality industry. I enjoy eating here but the service has been very slow. Personally I think it's because of their "Subway" style of assembly line. There's no reason to have to speak to three different people for a to-go order. 

The prices are high for fast food "Mexican". I don't think they want to be known as fast food, especially since it's somewhat slow and made to order, but there is an uneasy feeling when the warm meat portion of your entree is sitting on the vegetable line for a few minutes before the next employee is ready to ask you what you're having even though you already ordered. Seems monotonous. 

Once my "fire grilled steak" sat for a couple of minutes, the next assembly line employee asked what I was having (even though I already ordered).  I realized the quickest option was to tell her, "however it comes". Still didn't matter as they were behind on orders. 

I came to a third employee who asked what my order was. Apparently they work on the honor system. This gentleman seemed to be the only employee with a sense of urgency. He attempted to get caught up on multiple orders that were well behind the ticket time. No one else seemed to care or understand. I hope he gets promoted to management. They need it there. 

3 stars for the average food. Would love to have it made to order as advertised. 

4th star for the one person who understood urgency and hospitality.
