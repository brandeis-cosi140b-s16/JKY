Tako was delicious! My bf and I went on a Monday evening since we figured it would be a slower night. Thank goodness we made a reservation! It was still pretty busy. I bet the weekends are packed. I loved the decor of the restaurant! Very cool vibe. I ordered the Sookie Stackhouse cocktail to start and loved it! My bf got a beer and said they had a nice selection with very reasonable prices. For appetizers, we ordered the chips and salsa and then picked one of the chef's selection guacamole. I enjoyed every type of salsa and the guacamole was very unique. I ordered the Carnitas taco and my bf ordered the Tako (octopus) taco. Loved both although I favored the Carnitas surprisingly. The reason I didnt give a perfect score is because the tables in the front are way too close together. I could barely hear my bf over the conversations of our neighbors. I also think I booty bumped the one table when I was trying to leave. But overall we loved Tako and will be back again!
