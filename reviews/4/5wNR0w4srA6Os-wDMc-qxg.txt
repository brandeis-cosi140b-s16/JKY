Recently stayed at the Luxor with my Partner in Crime and Dining. 

We ended up going to this presentation for GrandView Resorts (it's waaaaaay long, say no), and got $75 dining voucher at the hotel.

First I had to make sure the vouchers were legit (yes, they're legit). We sat at the bar which has TVs if you're hoping to catch a game. The bartenders are awesome, and make sure to check on you frequently.

T&T is located on the second floor by all the exhibits. If you're really thirty I recommend getting the Chonga. It's a giant goblet of daiquiri topped with two beers that you can release at the time of your choosing.

With our vouchers we got two entrees and 4 drinks. 2 of the drinks were to go.Oh the perks of Vegas!

We had the #1 Alambre and Barbacoa tacos (3). They come with rice and beans. I was not impressed by the rice...it was very dry and definitely did not meet my expectations. What can I say? Cali does it better (and so do my Mexican friends--authentic). But, the tacos were very delicious. T&T also has piping hot chips with flavorful and spicy salsa. yum!

Thanks for the wonderful food and service!
Until next time, 1 tequila 2 tequila 3 tequila... FLOOR!
