First time I stopped there was after 6 pm on a Friday. I didn't realize they closed at 6 pm on Friday. Went back the next week for lunch and had a chicken burrito. Nothing terribly adventurous but good quality food at the right price. Service was exceptional. They do most of their business for breakfast so I must return
