Dude, I fucking LOVE this place.  I used to go to the one on Decatur/Lake Mead yearsss ago.  They finally put one on my side of town (Summerlin) only for it to close like 6 months later.  I single handedly tried to keep this place open, dammit.  Their stuffed Mexi Fries and Crisp Meat Burritos are the shit and awesome for hangovers.  I almost cried when they closed.  Sad day in Kato Land.  :(
