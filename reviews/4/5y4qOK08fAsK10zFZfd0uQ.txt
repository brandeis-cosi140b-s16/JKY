One of the better Filiberto's in terms of quality. Can't beat them for Mexican fast food. This location has a salsa bar, to boot.

Recommendation: BRC - the Beans / Rice / Cheese burrito - it's not on the menu but it's a solid option. Get it with a side of guac and sour cream.

Downsides to this location: no drive thru, and limited hours during the week.  24 hours Friday / Saturday.
