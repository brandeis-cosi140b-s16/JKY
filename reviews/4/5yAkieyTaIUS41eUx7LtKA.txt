When I venture out to eat trying new places is always a gamble to me. Luckly I've had the luck on my side

I was in search of a place near me for some corned beef hash other then my norm. I stumbled across this place and I am glad I did. I of cource ordered their corned beef and it was most definitely a treat!

Unlike most places, they serve theirs in big meat chunks. It was completly unexpected to me. Typically you think of corned beef hash of a mush kinda like what you'd get at US Egg or something. The meat had so much flavor and was extremely tender. After finishing what was on my plate I wanted more!

The portion wasn't too big for the kind of appitate that I have. I'd still have to say that orange table wins the corn beef challenge in my opinion.
