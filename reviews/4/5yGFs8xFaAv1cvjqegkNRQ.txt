Ask for Adrian! She is feisty and fun!

I did my favorite test of a Restaraunt.

The blind order! 

Adrian selected my meal fearlessly.
She was not allowed to ask me any questions, just put in her choice.
Only a well trained server with great management and terrific chef can deliver on this challenge!

Better to show you than tell you what was delivered. See the attached picture.

Great outdoor/indoor mex venue.  Young vibe. 

Food is unique and worth trying!

Service is paced and fun.  Juice beverages are on trend and fuzzy!

A perfect Arizona evening dinner.
