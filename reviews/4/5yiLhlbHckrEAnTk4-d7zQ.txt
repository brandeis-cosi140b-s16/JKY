I like this place a lot and it's a really nice location. My favorite things I've gotten on the menu, which also happen to be healthy options are the bbq chicken salad and the green chili pork bowl. Both really yummy and highly recommended. My boyfriend wasn't as big of a fan of the salad as I was though. The salsa is okay...I wish it was better because i'm a huge salsa person...but I liked the chips! I'd recommend this place for sure.
