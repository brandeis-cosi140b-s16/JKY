This is my second trip. The first was with the family and this is a solo trip. The place is clean and the waitress is very friendly. I've tried an assortment of the tacos. All were very good. Saxby had the Korean style tater tot casserole. He loved it! The bulgogi bowl is great. Its basically bipmbap which i love. Today I'm having the bulgogi flautas. It's spicy Korean beef in fried rolled tacos. Delicious! Make sure you request the homemade salsas.
