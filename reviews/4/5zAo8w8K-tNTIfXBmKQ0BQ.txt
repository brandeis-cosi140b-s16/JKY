This place is very conveniently located for lunch breaks during the week and I must admit, if it weren't for the flavolcano hot sauce they have readily available, I wouldn't eat here. I love hot, hot, spicy, make my nose run food and they don't have it here, but the hot sauce helps. The only meat that I think is worth trying is the carnitas. Not a fan of the "tender" steak or chicken. Veggies are good, it's a shame they cost extra if you want them included. I think in order to make this food taste good, you have to go heavy on the toppings and make it messy. 

I consider cilantro a food group all on it's own. It blows my mind that they do not have cilantro here for me to yell "MORE!" at them when making my burrito.
