Stopped at this place for some authentic Mexican food while visiting family from Boston and was very happy with the experience. the building is old but clean. the staff was good and the food was great. we sampled a variety of dishes and I liked everything. wish we had something like this back home but there's nothing close. we will be back next time we are in town
