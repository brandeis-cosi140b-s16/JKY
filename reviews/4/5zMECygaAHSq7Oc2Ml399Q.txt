Love Chipotle.  My only criticism is that some of the people making the burritos and tacos and such don't know what they're doing.  Sometimes, they aren't listening to what I am saying or they're very conservative on the portions, or they're just too slow.  I come here quite often and know who does a good job and who just gets in the way.  No matter what, whoever is at the register is always very nice....The place is always clean....Sometimes there's a line, but if the right people are making the food, then it doesn't take that long.  Love the burritos.
