Pretty fun modern Mexican place with specials. 

Parking:  The location is near Postino, Federal Pizza, and Windsor, and parking can be a pain. There are plenty of lots, but these places can get busy. There's a lot across the street near Windsor if the lots near Joyride are full. 

Location: Just north of Central and Camelback - a quick walk from the light rail station at this location.

Specials: There are happy hour specials from 2-6pm with pretty good deals and $5 margaritas. 

Food:  The food options are good. The guac is always delicious. The happy hour tacos are only $2 but are made with a pre-made mix. I asked for no peppers, but the server said the mix is already made.  The chips/salsa are just OK.  The salad options look pretty interesting but haven't had one before.   I ordered the Mexican corn for something new - pretty tasty!

Service:  Usually good, though I've only been here twice. 

The crowd is similar to the other Upward Projects restaurant crowd.
