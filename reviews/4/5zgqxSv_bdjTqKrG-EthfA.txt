I had the carne asada and carnitas tacos. They were both very good. Typical street tacos. The salsa bar is great with 3 or 4 salsas, guacamole, pico, grilled peppers, limes, radishes, etc. It was quick and easy to order a couple tacos to go. The breakfast menu also looked really good. My only complaint would be the price. Tacos were $2.75 each and pretty small. If they were $2.00, 5 stars for sure. I probably will still go back.
