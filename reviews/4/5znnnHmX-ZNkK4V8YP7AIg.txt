Tempe strikes again!  Our little city is home to another excellent hole in the wall restaurant.  Many thanks to the staff at Sombrero's for making some extremely flavorful Mexican food complete with friendly service.  

This was my first time at Sombrero's and I had a shrimp burrito and really enjoyed it.  The rice, chopped onions, cilantro, chipotle sauce, roasted corn and hot salsa made it a highly enjoyable lunch outing.  I also had the super nachos with carne asada.  Delicioso!!!

Sombrero's is a casual spot with 2 large TVs, to satisfy a sports fan's cravings on a weekend.  The high quality ingredients, variety of different meats and salsa bar make it an extremely worthy Mexican spot that can become a regular hangout for anyone that wants to try a variety of offerings.  I know I will be back and I will bring family and friends too.

**Tip 1**

Load up with not only salsa, but those pickled jalapenos and carrots at the salsa bar

**Tip 2**

They don't serve beer, so if you need to wash down your tasty Mexican comida with some beer, order the food to go....or have a few beers next door at Boulders on Broadway and then head over to Sombrero's!
