Surprisingly good chile relleno and chicken fajitas.  The chili relleno is not too eggy or greasy, the chile is not over cooked to mush.  The chips and salsa are also good as are the rice and beans.  They were nice about making one of their specialty drinks with rum instead of tequila for my wife since tequila is not her friend.
