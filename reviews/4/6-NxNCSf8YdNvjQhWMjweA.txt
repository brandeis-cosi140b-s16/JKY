Good local place for Mexican food. My family has visited at least 10 times since we moved to Surprise and the staff is good and the food portion size is excellent. Only reason not a 5 star is I am picky about my beverage and while they have a full bar, they don't carry Guinness. My wife does enjoy their Margaritas and this is an excellent place to stop if going to the movies or bowling alley.
