I asked friends and work mates for their suggestions of a good Mexican restaurant away for the typical strip restaurant. Over whelming support for this place and their sister restaurant in Mi Lindo Michoacan in Henderson.

Found good service, and food at a low price. You can definitely do a lot worse and get charged double the price in Las Vegas if you are not careful.

I found the menu selections to be not only representations of the Mexican state of Michoacan cuisine. Found many selections of Baja California.

We ordered the parillada that supposedly feeds two people, but in reality feeds more like 4. The Mexican beer was chilled to perfection. The only negative was the margarita my girlfriend ordered. I tasted it, and thought they must serve it out of a can. 

Neither of us ever do desserts. 

 I will be returning, and will definite keep this restaurant in mind when I entertain large groups.
