After spending time with notable human being, artisan and author Nick Portillo there was no better way to end the afternoon than a stop at Elvira's. Doubly since Nick suggested it.

The salsa was mild enough for Sault St. Marie infants, chips crispy and salt to taste. The ice tea cool as a Yooper in January. Kim provided excellent service.

I enjoyed a tostada crispy as fall sycamore leaves along the banks of Upper Queen Creek. The beans were good enough to make me appreciate the centuries of genetic selection and farming that put them in a bag, and the skills and knowledge of generations of cooks. The iceburg lettuce was fresh as a Denali glacier, the yellow cheese better than any commodity subsidized by tax payers.

Bill got the complete relleno dinner. It was large enough to feed all the UFO pilots of the Phoenix Lights objects. I tried some and it was good enough for me to recommend to you and write in these brief words an Arnold Schwarzenegger quote short enough for remembering, "I'll be back."
