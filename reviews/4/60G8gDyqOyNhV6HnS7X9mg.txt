We ordered 4 adobada (pork marinated in red chili sauce with vinegar and various spices) street tacos and a soda.  Each taco included a generous quantity of lean meat, crema and cilantro. This time we tried our tacos with and without the spicy salsa and ended up enjoying both.  We took a pass on the grilled scallions and peppers that were offered.  We found the staff to be uniformly friendly and helpful. The restaurant seems to be struggling for business, but the tacos compare favorably to the city's best.
