OMG the service here is so slow, but that aside, I had the low-carb combo fajitas ... I love that they didn't bring me tortillas and instead, brought me lettuce leafs to enjoy the fajita meat on ... first time I've ever seen that and it was fantastic.

They have a full bar ... I had 2 bloody mary's and they were good.  Prices are on the high-end, as to be expected in Vegas.
