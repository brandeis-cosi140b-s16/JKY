This is the normal Valle Luna that I go to. Excellent chips and hot sauce. 

They seem to have specials every night, so waits are common. 15-20 minutes are the average, if you come after 6pm. I find the males servers to be below average. The older lady servers do an excellent job, even in the chaotic evening rush. 

I love the chimichanga here. Pinto beans are spicy but pretty good. Rice is average. 

Parking can be tough here, too. They used to have good half price coupons, but not so much, lately.
