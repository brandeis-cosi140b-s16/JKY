Got a surprisingly good salad here while laid over, and the prices were only a little bit airport-jacked -- it wasn't nearly as expensive as I feared it would be.  Service was a little slow for us; but I heard the couple at the next table mention that their flight was in 40 minutes, and they got their meal pretty quickly, so don't hesitate to speak up if you've got a quick connection.  It's in the middle of the B concourse.  Seating is a little tight, and the music is too loud (to fit in with the Sammy Hagar Cabo-Wabo theme, I suppose.)  Still, one of the better choices if you're going to be hanging out at the airport for a while.
