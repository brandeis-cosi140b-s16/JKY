Love this place! They changed staff and they are a little worse which is sad. They skimp more on the portions then the original team did. I'm sure they are being told to cut back, but half a scoop of meat is not enough for a burrito. 
I've never had a bad meal from here though. Its a weekly favorite in our household. The girls remember me and my order so that is great not having to really order my food when I come in.
