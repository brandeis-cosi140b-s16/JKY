Hubby and I come here a lot. Our usuals are chicken custom burrito with rice, lettuce, fajita mix and pico for hubby and I get the vegetarian custom burrito with rice, lettuce, guacamole, fajita mix and pico or sometimes the vegetarian taco salad without the beans. Both custom burritos and taco salad are HUGE!
We started going to this place because their food aren't cooked with lard *eek hopefully they don't change that.
Sauce bar is well maintained.
Staffs are cool but Amanda is our favorite :)

Almost a five start but sometimes things aren't as consistent like, mild sauce tastes like its a 12 over 10 and the taco salad sometimes is only half the amount I normally get considering I ask them no beans. You get my point.
