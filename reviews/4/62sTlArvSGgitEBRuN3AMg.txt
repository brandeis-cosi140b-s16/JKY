Yes, Chipotle is everything it is cracked up to be and then some. I always feel like I'm eating a little bit healthier when I am here. Perhaps it is their commitment to reducing waste and recycling or their hormone free cheeses and meats.

As to their selection, yes it does seem a bit more limited than other "build-it-in-front-of-you" places which have different types of burritos and more salsas and toppings and nachos and that one where they shout at you as you enter that has a salsa bar.

Great staff. The girl who put the toppings on my burrito was super happy and really excited. I know that some of her enthusiasm rubbed off on me and improved what was already a good mood.

This is a small location with very few tables inside. If you're here during a busier time, expect to get friendly with someone as you share the table.
