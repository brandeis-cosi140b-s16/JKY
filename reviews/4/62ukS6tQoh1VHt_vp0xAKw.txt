First time I've been here, in any On the Border, and I must say I've walked out impressed. The food is above average from any typical Mexican restaurant. Pretty affordable. I had a 10 dollar combo with 4 items and it included rice AND beans with bottomless chips and salsa. I definitely will be returning.
