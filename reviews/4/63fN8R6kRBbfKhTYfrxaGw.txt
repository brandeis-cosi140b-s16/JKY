Taco Night- Tuesdays all you can eat 6.00$ / 6:00-9:00 Pm Chicken or Beef. This gets you an extra star. Tex-Mex spot in the area. I stopped after a day of working in the area. I'll be back. It's got that Subway sammich style you request what goes in. They have a unique spin with some of the options. i.e. you can add Rice, beans, or Potatoes (cooked W/ chorizo) to your burrito. It seems to be a family run operation and they are all very nice & friendly. The order was super quick. The interior is crisp and clean. I Would've stayed. Especially since you can refill your Horchata.
