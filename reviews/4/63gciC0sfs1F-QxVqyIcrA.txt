Good place to come eat a low key meal at the Luxor.  The service was good with a dj playing (@8pm) but the open air atmosphere is not for everyone.  The food was very good, although the portions were a bit small.  Only bottled beer and the tequilla is very overpriced.  Don't make this a destination, make it a place to eat before you go out!
