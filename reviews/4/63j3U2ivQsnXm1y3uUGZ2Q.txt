I went here for the first time last night with my family and friends and it was fantastic! The atmosphere was great for young kids that are loud and drop things. Our waiter was super friendly and patient with us. The menu was a bit overwhelming so I just told the waiter what I wanted and he pointed to where it was at on the menu. When I got my food the sauce was spicier than I thought and he was kind enough to replace the dish with a milder sauce. I want to come back and try another dish!
