Oh Chipotle, I love you so much.

My husband and I came here Sunday to grab a quick lunch. We usually get the salad bowls, however, we decided to split the burrito.

Steak, rice, blackbeans, cheese, salsa, corn, and guac (yes, it is extra but so worth it!). The burrito was HUGE. I was completely full after eating half of it. So glad we split. 

Love coming here because of the fresh ingredients and options. Anyone that is doing the Whole 30 diet (God bless you), this place is heaven. The carnitas meat is Whole 30 approved and so is the lettuce, pico, corn, and guac!
