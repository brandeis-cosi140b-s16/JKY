First of all, the guacamole made table-side is ridiculous good. I don't even like guac and I LOVED it. The margaritas are also delicious. The service was friendly and fast and the menu has a pretty good selection. I had a really good steak and shrimp and my girlfriend had some tasty fish tacos. I can't wait till we go back and enjoy the nice outside patio!
