We love mexican food and this place has redeemed itself (from the old "pinatas" restaurant that used to be in this location).  The decor and menu are completely different and really good - well priced and the food is tasty. The service was really good, too.  Patio looks small - we sat inside.  There is a small bar with tv's, if you are looking for that.  I would definitely go back - looking forward to it!
