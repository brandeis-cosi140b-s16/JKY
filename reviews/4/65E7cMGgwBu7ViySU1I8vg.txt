We hit Loco Patron after soccer skills camp at Desert Foothills Park. Just a short walk up from the park, across the street and through the parking lot, so we we were thirsty and hungry.

We got our usual table in the middle of the bar area.  Kelly took care of us for a second time. She remembered us and treated us wonderfully!  She is an awesome server, great with our kids!  Kelly gave us a hard time and really made our night out fun.

We were able to use a check-in for drink special, but unable to use the 1/2 off appetizer (we wanted wings and wings were already their daily special). We enjoyed the atmosphere, food and plethora of TVs for the sports fans we are!

Our food was served warm and delicious. We shared fajitas, fish tacos, an enchilada plate and of course, (if you've read any of our other reviews) French Fries!  Our son loves French Fries, thinks he's a connoisseur!  He rates the fries from each place, just as our daughter rates California rolls! 

We had a good time, I'm sure we'll be back.
