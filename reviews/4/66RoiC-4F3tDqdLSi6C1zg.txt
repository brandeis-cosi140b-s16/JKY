I love this place.  My boyfriend & I went in on a whim and really enjoyed it.  I think we go at off times, because it's usually pretty empty (Sunday early afternoon).  I don't know what it is about their sauces, but they absolutely rock!  Try ordering the Penaso Burito (not sure if that's really the name).  It has machaca and this great spicy, creamy sauce... LOVE it.  Last weekend we tried another new one also from their specialties.  WOW!  I love this place & look forward to trying their Wednesday taco bars.
