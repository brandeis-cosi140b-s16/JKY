Mexican food right on State St! Well, close enough, it's right off State on Gilman. I can't thank my co-worker enough for his recommendation. They have daily specials, selected mexican items that comes in a 'combo', which means, in mexican terms, beans and rice =) 

Complimentary chips and salsa if you choose the dine-in option. But for me mostly Los Gemelos is a grab and go place since it's very close to where I work, we would call to order ahead, saves us more time that way ~~

Their sopes and gorditas are my favorite. For sopes I love the combination of beans, steak or pastor, cheese, avocado and lettuce put together on a thick flour tortilla. It's a very refreshing feeling (and taste) to bite into one of those. The gorditas are a slight different version, your choice of fillings wrapped in a Mexican styled pita pocket, as I like to call it. 

Do note that even though vegetarian options are being offered, I have found the potatoes option just didn't go well with their sopes. The gorditas are fine with potato fillings, but it's still not my top choice. 

Service has always been prompt and friendly. No problems with food hygiene or quality in the 8 or so times I've been there.
