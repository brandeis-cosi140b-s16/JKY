Decent food at pretty good prices.  I would return.  Had their chicken taco salad which comes in a tortilla bowl.  Salad did not come with any dressing, but the hot sauce was good enough.  Didn't like their salsa since it tasted more like Italian marinara.  Lot of people were ordering a chicken dish,  think it was Pollo Fundido (?) which the waiter said was their most popular dish.  

Will return to try other things, but if you count on their chips and salsa as a clue, then you'll probably be disappointed.
