Macayo's has great food but a poor happy hour. I was expecting kind of mediocre food based on the fact that it's a chain, but I was quite impressed with how fresh and flavorful the food was. I got the taco salad which was a lot bigger and healthier than most other place's taco salad. My boyfriend got the enchilada sampler which was amazing! The sour cream like enchilada sauce is really unique and delicious. 

The only negative thing were the happy hour margaritas. After 4 margaritas in about an hour (which normally would produce quite a nice buzz) all I had was a very full belly of liquid. I would recommend ordering regular drinks instead of the HH margaritas as a far more cost effective method of getting your tipsy on.
