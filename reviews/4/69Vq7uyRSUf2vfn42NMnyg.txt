This place is fun, authentic, and pretty darn tasty.

We got the Chicken Tacos (hard shell is the way to go) and the Carnitas Plate.  Chicken taco was better than the carnitas, but both were yummy.  

Dessert was a seasonal Apple Empanada - AMAZE!

As a native Arizonan, I am SUPER picky about my mexican food, but Los Dos won me over.
