My coworker Rick has been telling me how great this place is for a very long time, I finally decide to try it the week I leave .. WTF was I thinking ... Why didn't I listen to him earlier ... OMG I love their hole in wall style mexican food ... Being from LA it brought back to east LA, it was very authentic ... They had tortas which I wanted to get but I decided to go with the burrito .. It was delish!!!  They grill it, and their salsa is La Bamba ....
