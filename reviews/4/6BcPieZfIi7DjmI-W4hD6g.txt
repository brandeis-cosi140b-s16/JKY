Took 2 friends with me for dinner here tonight (Sunday 4-6-2014). Everything was as good as it was when I was there last Tuesday. They finally got their credit card machine! Yay! No more having to carry cash!

Dinner was unexpectedly inexpensive tonight! All tacos were $1. The chicken tacos were juicy and well seasoned. Coupled with the free salsas, guacamole, and cheese dip, an unbeatable value!  All 3 of us left full and happy for well under $20 plus tip.
