I've been coming here for years. It is the neighborhood spot, and the food is terrific. I love just about everything they make.

The Enchantment Platter is a go to staple for me. It offers a little bit of everything. And when the chili's are in season they add the most amazing heat to an incredibly flavorful dish. This is not for out-of-towners with little experience with real chili's.

I love the atmosphere and the staff.  I have no qualms about bringing my kids when it isn't busy.
