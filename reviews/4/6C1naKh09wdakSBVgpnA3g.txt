I don't go to a lot of fast food places, but this is one I have been to way too many times :)

I really like the food here. I almost always go with the "Naked Burrito", or a bowl that you can pick and choose what to add to. It comes with white or brown rice. Black or pinto beans. A selection of types of meat (chicken, beef, pork (or veggie)), and a choice of salsas, sour cream and lettuce. You can also add quesa (cheese) sauce. It's good, but not very healthy, I believe :) You can also add grilled peppers and red onion. To be honest I think all of it is good! After having tried all the meats I would definitely pick the chicken, but that could just be me loving chicken a bit too much.

They do of course have a lot of other things to chose from, but the bowl is the best option!
