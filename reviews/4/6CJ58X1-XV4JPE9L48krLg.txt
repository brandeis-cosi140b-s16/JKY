I've always said, if I had to pick one type of food to eat for the rest of my life, it would be Mexican! I base it primarily off the guacamole and the meat. Mi Casa's guac was on point, and they had, unlike EVERY OTHER Mexican restaurant in this town, ground beef. I don't care if it's considered "authentic" or not, I grew up in the South where this is common and I love having it as an option. Also, the steak I had on my nachos was quality, clean of a lot of excess fat and yummy! I don't know why people are complaining about the prices, the menu is very reasonable. I once split a $9.00 plate of nachos with 2 other adults and we were all full. The beer prices are average too. I also love the restaurant for the fun ambiance, something people tend to go numb to out here in Vegas since everything is so flashy. They also have a lot of big screen TVs in the bar area, perfect now that football season is here!!
