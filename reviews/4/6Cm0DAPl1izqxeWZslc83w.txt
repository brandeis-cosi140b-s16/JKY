I've been wanting to try this place and had it bookmarked for a while.  I'm certainly glad I finally made it happen.
I came here with a coworker for lunch & both of us really liked this place.
The decor is pretty cool with a whole upcycled, reclaimed aesthetic & a very good looking bar area.  There is a huge outdoor seating area with misty fans blowing.  
We were seated right away and the customer service was really great.  Our server was the right mix of competent, attentive, funny, gregarious, and professional.  
My coworker and I both had the steak salad & it was total noms.  Plenty of steak cooked exactly as requested, lots of fresh fixings, and a dressing that was really well balanced in flavors, both on its own and with the salad.
They have a lovely wine list.  They make lots of fancy bar drinks.  
I would absolutely come back for lunch again or to try dinner.
