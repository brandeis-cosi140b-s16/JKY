Difficult to find! It's hidden away in the back of the plaza and could use a little more signage. I was happy I found it though! I ordered the CC sizzle nachos which was too much food for me! Very generous portion size, and came with a small side of rice and retried beans. The seasoning used on the meat is very flavorful and gives it a little kick (after eating a bit it builds and starts to get spicey). For the price point the portions are very generous, I will definitely be returning here!
