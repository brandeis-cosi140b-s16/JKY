I had lunch with Jacob L. in this rather charming little gem in Sunnyslope. The restaurant is bright, clean, and cheerfully decorated. The food was tasty and inexpensive. The rice and beans that came with my order were good. Of the 3 tacos I tried, I liked the pastor the best - it was really tasty; the carne asada was good, and the tongue was not as flavorful as I had expected but still OK (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/wQ4qreKh5KMxoo2WjsZumw/l). Good quality food, so  I'm definitely coming back here - probably on a weekend, to try the other dishes - especially the menudo. And of course I HAVE to get the flan.
