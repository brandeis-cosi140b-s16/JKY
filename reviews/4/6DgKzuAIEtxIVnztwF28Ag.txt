The chips might be the best I've ever had!  The mild salsa is also very good.  Not as chunky aa I like but not runny, which is good

The tacos have a great taste to them although there was too much cilantro for my liking.  I liked the chicken more than the carne asade.

The beef quesadilla was very good.  The tortilla was crisp and the inside was filled with goodness!

Location is kinda tough.  Luckily someone told me about this place.  I hope it survives!
