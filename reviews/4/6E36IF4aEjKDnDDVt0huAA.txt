I've been here on several occasions when Cantina was on East Blvd. They ruined my birthday in 12/2013 and I swore it off. Nevertheless, I decided to give the new location a chance. Surely that awful server was fired by now. Everyone deserves a second chance and I'm glad that I did. Went on a Saturday and it was packed, so we sat at the bar, that had plenty of empty seats. The bar tender was very attentive, making the guacamole by hand in our presence. Throughout the meal, she check on us consistently and even offered advice about the menu. I had the salmon, which came with potatoes and spinach. The salmon was smaller than what I expected, but was really tasty and ended up being filling. So I guess the proportions were adequate after all. My friend, who is a vegetarian had the wild mushroom quesadillas and she liked them a lot. The guac that came with them was small compared to the amount of quesadilla. So I would ask for heavy guac if you order a quesadilla. Additionally, I had the house margarita. Tasty and I had a little buzz. Be careful with the margarita on the rocks as it's stronger than frozen. Overall, a great experience. Highly recommended.
