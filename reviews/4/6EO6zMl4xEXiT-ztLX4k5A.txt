On the way back from a vacation to Antelope Canyon and the Grand Canyon with my roommate, we were determined to have one really good meal! We were originally going to get BBQ, but then she mentioned wanting to try this Chinese/Mexican fusion place next time she was in Phoenix, since we were 5 miles north of town, I said lets do it now! I'm glad we followed her suggestion!

This place looks kinda like a hole in the wall joint (my favorite) but the food does not disappoint. The staff was so friendly and took the time to explain the options and flavors AND gave us samples! Since their food is so unique, the samples were great because its going blind otherwise!  The servings were big (I had leftovers), the prices very reasonable, and the spices were not overwhelming. The Jerk Fried Rice has too many green onions for me, but most people like green onions. The BBQ pork quesadilla had a good amount of cheese and the sauce didn't make the tortilla soggy. And the red chicken something or other had a really good kick! AND YOU GET A COOKIE! 

The dinning room was old looking, like the rest of the building, but everything was clean! Even the bathrooms... 

AND YOU GET A COOKIE! 

The leftovers re-heated fairly well, I recommend re-heating in the stove, as opposed to the microwave, IF you happen to end up with leftovers.. 

Did I mention you get a cookie? :)
