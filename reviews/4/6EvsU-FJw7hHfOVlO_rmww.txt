Super Taco Yah Yah Yah, Tico Taco Yah Yah Yah (from the animated movie Rio, performed by Blu)

That's the first thing that popped into my head when I saw the sign just because it's such a catchy little tune.  

So, it's a small joint just like any other taco place.  It's clean, cheap, and friendly.  The condiment bar is like any bar you would find at a Roberto's tacos, except there red sauce is better at this place.

Food ordered:
Bean and cheese burritos at 2.50 a piece and they were HUGE.
Fish burrito at 4 something.  Mmn, so good and the best fried style fish I've had yet at a taco chain.
Pork Torta good.
Carne Asade burrito (huge), I guess it was good since my hubby devoured it before I could finish half of my torta.
Churros with ice cream.  The kids loved it.

Everything was good.  If we're down that way again I'm certain we'll pop in.
