I had a good experience tonight at TQLA. I would come back for sure. The restaurant itself is really nice. I like to contemporary vibe and the relaxed feel of the candle light. Our waiter, Ryan was outstanding and from the other reviews it seems like service can be hit or miss but Ryan has really got it together. First we were served chips and two types of salsa. The chips were just okay but the salsa's were quite good. We had a green avocado and cilantro based salsa and a fire roasted tomato based salsa which is served warm which I found unique and I'm not sure if I like it or not, I haven't decided yet. Our waiter Ryan suggested a few things, the queso being one, the fajita's another. We decided we would try the queso on another visit but went for the fajita's. We got a combo of chicken and steak. They were amazing! Great flavor. If I were to get them again I would probably only get chicken only because the steak had kind of a teriyaki flavor to it which I didn't really think complemented the Mexican flair. 

Our waiter also brought out a sample of the habanero salsa since we wanted to try something a little spicier. It is usually $2.50 for the side but he let us try a sample for free because we were on the fence about it. It was great and really added to the fajitas, it was a little sweet and a little spicy I would definitely recommend it if you like sweet heat! I also had a margarita flight, with a blood orange, chamboard and house margarita for $10. It was a little pricey but I like to try out the variety at a new restaurant. I would get the blood orange again but I would come back for happy hour which is 3-7pm Mon-Fri and they also serve half price apps. 

Overall good experience. I would definitely come back. It seems as though the consistency can be iffy here so I will write an update on my next visit.
