Came here to meet my daughter for dinner and wow was the food good.  I have been here before and never has it made an impression like it did yesterday.  I noticed that the tortillas & tamales are homemade which is a HUGE deal in my opinion.  I ordered the guacamole appetizer which they make right in front of you and it is very flavorful and fresh.  I then ordered the farm fresh enchiladas which is a vegetarian enchilada with mushrooms and artichokes filled with cheese and covered in jalapeno cream sauce that was unbelievable good.  I loved this dish and the beans were also fantastic.  I have to say that I will be back for this dish alone.  The atmosphere is casual but clean and decorated in the theme.  Service was great and the margaritas were $3 each so I splurged as well.
