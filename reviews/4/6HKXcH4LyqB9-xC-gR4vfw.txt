I frequent Zabas about once a week, and it's been going on a year. Staff is really nice and I'm in love with their fish tacos, salad and guacamole. Items are made fresh and the fish is made to order, so I know it's piping hot. Fresh, light and healthy Mexican fare. I look for the freshness and consistency when I'm spending money for lunch everyday and Zabas has it. Pricing consistent with Baja and Chipotle, could be a tad less. Local business owner, which I believe in supporting. Great job Zabas!
