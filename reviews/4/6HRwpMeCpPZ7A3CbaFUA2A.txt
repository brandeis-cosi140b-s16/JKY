This place is affectionately called the "soupy burro" around the office. On my way there, my fellow lunchies warned about three things:

1)Be cautious of the aluminum plate they serve the burro in, its 2 degrees hotter than the deepest realm of hell and will singe your arm hair if you get too close. 

2)The enchilada style burro with a side of beans is two parts molten lava, one part devils breath and two parts awesome. Be warned.

3)If you happen to get the burro traditional (without enchilada sauce) try it Gary style.(He's a guy a work) Get a side of rice with your burro and eat directly over the rice bowl because the burro WILL explode  at some point and it is better to catch the molten lava goodness with your rice than on your pants. Unless you want to melt your legs off.

All in all, it is good stuff. Small menu, outside seating, cash only, No sign on the building. Sometimes you have to arm-wrestle a junk-yard dog for a place to sit but its worth it.
