#350! 

This place is delicious. I'm a huge mexican food snob and I lived in mexico for a about a year, so I know everything about mexican food. EVERYTHING!!!! 

You have to try this place out at least once while you are in Las Vegas, if you don't you'll regret it for the rest of your mediocre life. Don't have a mediocre life eat at El Gordo damn it!
