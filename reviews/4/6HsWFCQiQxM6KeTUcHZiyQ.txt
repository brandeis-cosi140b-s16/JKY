I come to this location when I'm able to get enough co-workers together for a group order.  

No matter what time of the day it seems like the place is ALWAYS busy so if you need to be in and out make sure you fax in your order or submit it online that way your food is ready when you get there.  

I love the freshness of the food and the idea that I'm able to watch them make my food there in front of me.  Might I add that the margarita isn't so bad either.  Twist of lime pleeeaaaase!  But let me make it clear that I don't order or consume alcoholic beverages while I'm on the clock.  That's just unethical; however, I will order a grapefruit flavored Izzy!
