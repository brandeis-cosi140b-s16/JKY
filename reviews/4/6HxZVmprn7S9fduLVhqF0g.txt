This is a wonderful 24 hour taqueria. It's a fabulous dingy dive with absolutely incredible Mexican 'fast food' that's delightfully inexpensive. Right by the strip and hotels, too!

We loved everything we had, especially the carne asada and al pastor tacos (99 cents!) which were deeply flavored and exceptionally tender. The "Papas con Carne" (fries with cheese & meat) were outstanding. For $6.99 you'll get more than two people can eat, that's for sure! 

I was very impressed with their salsas, too... never had such a unique, delicious variety available in a salsa bar.

Excellent late night food at very low prices, served quickly & piping hot. Now THIS is what I call "fast food".
