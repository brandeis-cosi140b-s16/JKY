Very cute Place, I love that they have a walk up window to order your  food and to pick up to go orders.  You can also order inside at the counter.  I got the Vegetarian burrito and added mahi mahi to it.  It was a nice size burrito and I have to say it was pretty good, you can tell the freshness of the ingredients, the burrito had grilled red and green bell peppers, yellow squash, zucchini, onions, corn, rice and pico de gallo.  I also got the raspberry lemonade, it was very tart had to water it down a little, it also had a spice added to it not sure what type of spice, but it was also good.  My Friend got the  carne asada burrito and she also enjoyed it, she said the meet was flavored  just right.  
We enjoyed our visit at Revo Burrito!
