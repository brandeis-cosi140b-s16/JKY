Wait a minute I can get some good quick Mexican food from inside a gas station while I'm getting my car washed and it's not one of those big microwaved burritos!? Yes sir. 

Inside of the Sinclair Choice gas station you'll find Chile Verde Express a small restaurant serving up some quick Mexican food similar to those from Roberto's, Fausto's, Don Tortaco, etc. If you take a look at their pictures the items that stands out were the nachos and fries so of course I had to have one of them.  The carne asada fries was what I went with. Definitely one of the better I've had. I pretty much killed the entire container on my own in one sitting. I know I shouldn't have done it but it was one of those moments where I kept eating and eating and before I knew it they were all gone. I don't know what inside made it so good cause it looked like you typical carne asada fries.  It had a lot of fries, a lot of meat, a lot of quac, cheese, it was full loaded to hit me in the mouth. Maybe it was magic, they did take longer than expected. I haven't tried any of the other items yet but why would I want to. This is all I need why would I mess up a good thing. 

A few things about the place you want to remember when coming 1) It's cash only. Yea I don't know why businesses always do it. 2) It's not super fast but not super slow. Being that it's located at a gas station that also does full service car washes customers waiting might want to eat therefore a little waiting list. 3) Not really a place to dine unless you dont mind dining on a counter with a few stools in the middle of a gas.station. 

Other than that clean small place with a tv showing soccer. I'd be back for sure.
