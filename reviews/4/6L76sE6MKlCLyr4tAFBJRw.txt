OK, as an avid Yelp user I have to admit, I made a mistake when I picked this place out.  Why?  Well we were looking for a Mexican meat market (Carniceria) to get some specific cuts we like.  Our typical place had closed and we were not near home (we were in south Glendale) - so I did a yelp search while parked at a stop light.  this place came up with 5 stars, i clicked on the address and followed my GPS.  later I realized the 5 stars were based on one review, had I realized that i would not have bothered. 

The good news is, I still went and found a better than average Carniceria.  It was obvious from the display cases that the butcher took pride in his work.  Items were displayed nicely, with plastic covered items where appropriate. 

He had what we sought, carne adobado and carne arrachera, we bough 2 lb and 3 lb respectively.  We cooked it up on the grill that evening and found them to soft and tasty.  The butcher even prepared the meats as requested.  They were both hand cut and appropriately thin for nice grilling.

Note - this is not a very large store, more of a little neighborhood shop.  Also, the cashier was in a bullet proof cage, indicative that later in the evening  it may not be the best place in the world to be getting your Mexican butchered fare.  We felt safe when we were there at 4 PM on a Friday.
