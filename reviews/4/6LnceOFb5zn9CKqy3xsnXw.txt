This was our second dining experience at Distrito and I have to say that last time was a bit better. The service is incredibly attentive and the ambience is lovely. Our server, Matteo, was efficient and gracious - thanks for making a prediction with us for 2014! The food is truly delicious - we started with chips and guacamole (yum) and ventured into the small plate realm with ahi tuna (meh), fish tacos (dynamite), carnitas tacos (very good), lamb tacos (good), corn chowder (to die for) and the octopus (didn't try it!) The margaritas here are superb as well, or try the tequila flight that'll knock your socks off. Our shared desserts were the chocolate espresso cake and the citrus cr√®me. I think the citrus dessert was a bit better and I adore chocolate. We'll be back for sure - hope you'll try it too.
