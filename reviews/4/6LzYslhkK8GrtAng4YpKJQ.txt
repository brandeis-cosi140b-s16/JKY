Papa Chevo's is a "fast food" style Mexican food restaurant. They have an extensive menu. 
I like their bean and cheese burritos. They also have some really good nachos. 
The cheese enchiladas are tasty, but never seem to be hot (temperature) enough. 
They are open late. If you're looking for a quick Mexican food other than the usual, give them a try.
