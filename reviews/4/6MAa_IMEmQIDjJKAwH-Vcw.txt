What a cool find in old town Gilbert,AZ
Good priced taco combos with a great laid back patio in the back. This isn't a sports bar, but there are TVs.

Only suggestion is, add more Mexican beer options. 
Remember,  tacos is Mexican, you must have Negra Modelo, Modelo Especial and Tecate.

But overall. .. nice spot
