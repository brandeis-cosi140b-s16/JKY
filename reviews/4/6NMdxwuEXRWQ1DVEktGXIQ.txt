Place was super cool. Great food. Sat in the patio... Could've used some umbrellas for shade. Would've liked to see some drafts but nonetheless, the bottled beer selection was great. The wait staff seemed a tad unprofessional. But I'm sure with time and good promotion this spot can be a hit. My husband and I will definitely be back for the great fish and shrimp tacos :)
