Great homemade Mexican food and pastries. Prices are very reasonable as are the portions. Don't expect a flashy place, this is an authentic taco shop (yes, they have tripa, cabeza, buche, and lengua).

Basically everything is priced from $3.99 for carne asada, carnitas, or pollo to $5.99 for shrimp. They can also make veggie burritos, however my guess is the beans and tortillas have lard in them. They sell rotisserie chickens for $4.99 and you can add rice, beans, and tortillas for $4 more. Salsa bar available and they take credit cards too. As for desserts, they have lots to chose from, ranging anywhere for .25 cents for a pastry to $1.99 for a slice of tres leches cake.
