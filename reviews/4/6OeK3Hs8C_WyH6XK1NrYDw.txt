Beginning in Mexico originally as a Roadside Chicken Stand, El Pollo Loco has come a long way since opening it's first American El Pollo Loco on Alvarado Street in Los Angeles (I think sometime in 1980)  In any event I love when I get to visit in Southern California & Arizona. That's when I get a chance to grab me some Pollo Loco !!   Such a different chicken place from the others !!   Their Fire Grilled Marinated process just makes the difference !!  So Many Sides to choose from, it's getting me hungry just writing this review.......

I have visited this location a few times during my visits and have always had good service.  They have Horchata here too !!!   Would be nice if they expanded the market to Washington State !!  (Hint, Hint.......)   I would definitely visit here again.
