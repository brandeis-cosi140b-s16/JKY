I had the supergooeycheesy chimichanga. It was delicious! Best ever. The service was fast and friendly. We will definitely be coming back. We sat out on the patio. Lots of people and a nice atmosphere. If you prefer peace and quiet you probably wouldn't like it. It's a typical bar atmosphere. Nice to unwind with a drink though.
