I was kind of dubious about this place, being a "-berto's" joint and all, but it's pretty terrific grub. The service is great and they keep the dining area squeaky clean with a widescreen TV tuned into a Mexican news station. They also have free wi-fi, which I haven't yet tried. I swung by there today and had the carne asada torte. This is a huge sandwich (about 9"x6") with a swatch of thinly sliced beef, lettuce, tomato and guacamole, served on a yummy homemade roll. It's served with french fries, a heckuva deal for $3.99. I've also had their burrito plate, easily big enough for two meals. Delicious, affordable, filling, what more can one ask for. At the very least, you can sit in this repurposed Burger King and dig the circa 1991 decor.
