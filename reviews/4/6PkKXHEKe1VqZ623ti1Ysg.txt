The Fat Burrito is great.  
I went there for lunch and had a carne asada burrito.  They have two sizes; 'Beto Burrito' and the 'Fat Burrito'.  I had the smaller Beto, but thing was no wimpy burrito.  Besides being bigger than expected, it tasted great!  

The service was quick and friendly.  They have a full menu and I will be back to try others.
