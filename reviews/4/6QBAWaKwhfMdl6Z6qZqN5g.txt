Really great Mexican food. Some of the best in Charlotte along with Las Margaritas. The prices are great and the service is too. One of the benefits of coming here is the ability to host groups and get them fed in a good amount of time. Splitting a check is never difficult as it can be at some restaurants. The food is pretty good, but the last visit here left me with a very very greasy quesadilla. But, for the price, you can hardly argue with it.
