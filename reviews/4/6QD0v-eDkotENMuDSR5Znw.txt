moe's is the only mexican food i will eat.  they assemble your food right in front of you and make it however you like.  i love how they have several vegetarian choices that taste so nice and fresh.

sometimes it is hit or miss with the staff, but most of the time they are very friendly and quick. the food is so yummy, if i do encounter a sour face, it is totally forgotten by the time i start eating!! :)

the portions are mucho generous and they give you lots of free chips i would pay for anyway!  yummy!

my serious weakness at moe's is the queso.  i love it.  it hates me, but i love it.  mmmm! cheeeeeessseee!

if you are looking for a quick fresh mexican meal, give them a try.  and don't forget the queso!
