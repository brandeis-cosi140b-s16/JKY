Everything is wiped down very nice.  Staff behaves very well in the back kitchen, by keeping their back kitchen conversations to a low level without any inappropriate words/conversations that one might pick up in every other.  Plenty of selections. Everything was well made. the produce looked fresh, and everything actually looked like the freggin picture. lol
