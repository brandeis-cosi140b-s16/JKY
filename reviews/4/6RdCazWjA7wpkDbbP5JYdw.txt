Excellent cheap, authentic Mexican. 

I have been coming here since 2003.  As a vegetarian I usually get the vegetarian burrito.  A great deal ($4-$5)! I also enjoy the potato and cheese burrito ordered off menu ($3). The chips, quacumole and cheese are made with quality ingredients and I never skip the amazing salsa bar. I decided to be adventurous recently and get the cheese enchilidas with rice and beans. The sauce was tasty but the rest fell short. I'll stick to the burrito.

It helps if you or your dining buddy speak basic spanish. The staff always enjoys my friend's spanglish when attempting to ensure "no carne" is in our food.

As a 24 hour joint, I usually stop by in the wee hours.  However, I had lunch the other day with the same great quality! A relief to know my intoxication was not the sole reason for my love of the place.
