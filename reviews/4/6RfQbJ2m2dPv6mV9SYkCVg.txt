In an unassuming and rundown plaza, a new pupuseria popped up this summer. I put off visiting but once I finally did? Mindblown.

In addition to pupusas, they have a menu of Mexican meals with seafood and grilled meats. Pupusas are the star though, and they're great: got the queso camarones (shrimp) and queso frijoles to try (beans), and both were ample sized, well-priced, and stuffed with toppings. Salsa and slaw on the side, salsa is practically a puree but flavor is awesome- not too acidic, not to spicy, perfectly balanced. These are pupusas I'd get again, and it's rare for me to say that.

Also opted to try some stuff on the appetizer menu: there's a yucca frita dish with pork (can't remember the exact name), served with a chopped salad and more salsa. The yucca and meat were crispy, could have used a tiny bit of seasoning but I was pleased that they weren't greasy. Cut of meat (small chunks) was very fatty, but I think that is specific to the dish not an error on the part of the kitchen.

Lastly, I tried the tamale elote con crema- basically a corncake wrapped in a corn husk, made with masa flour like a tamale. This was not my kind of dish, as it had a sweetness to it and I don't like sweet corn. Not a bad dish though, and texture was good.

Pupusas are $1.50-3/ea based on toppings, and again, are of good size and are amply stuffed. Yucca app was about $8 and portion made that fair- plus it's a bit rare to find yucca in town. Tamal was maybe $2? Food easily could have been a lunch or two, total price was about $15 with tax. Interior of restaurant appears to include a small dance floor.
