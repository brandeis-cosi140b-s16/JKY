Walking around I found this small Mexican spot. I came in and saw they had a wide variety of tortas and taco.. As well as mariscos..  So I'm in the mood for breakfast and ordered the machaca plate..
First they bring a salsa and chips, which chips are good, salsa was good you get two. The dark red salsa has a very good taste as well a small kick to it. The other salsa is lite pico de gallo.. No kick to it..
The plate of machaca comes with rice, beans and a salad.. Not too shabby, it's not a bad deal for seven bucks!! Including a drink... I'll come back again.. Service is second to none..
