This place is a total dive - in all the right ways.

1) It's in the back room of a gift shop.
2) You have to walk through the kitchen to get to the dining room.
3) The food is incredible - as authentic as it gets.

I highly recommend ANYTHING with their Chorizo. And obviously - their Indian Frye bread is some of the best I've ever had.

The owner / guy running the register - Bart - is worth a visit even if you don't try the food. But he'll probably talk you into it if you were thinking of not eating.
