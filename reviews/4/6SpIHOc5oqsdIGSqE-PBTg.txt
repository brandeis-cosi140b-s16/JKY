I found the waitstaff a bit pushy, but the food was great.  Really a good deal for the amount and quality of food you get.  Love how you are able to choose from a selection of very unique tacos.  The three plate taco deal is the best.  I especially love the backyard BBQ taco.  I keep coming back to this place, although the margaritas could be a bit stronger!
