Classic Tex-Mex style for This part of the country. Well maintained and clean restaurant. Home made style Enchilada and Chile Rellen√≥ combo was not over done with cheese. Didn't get any tortillas as part of my meal but I could have easily asked for some. The bar is small but they do a variety of margarita's that satisfy!
