I really like Chipotle's food. It tastes very fresh, by any standards(which is more than some "quick service" restaurants can say). I also appreciate the fact that they have higher standards in their ingredients, using meats and dairy products that aren't laden with hormones and other not-so-tasty extras. 

Just a tip: DON'T go to this location over the lunch rush. pretty much from 12:00 to 1:30 it is a MADHOUSE. Open parking spots are sparse, and sometimes non-existent. The last time I braved a lunch hour, every seat in the house was packed. I ended up at the window counter, elbow to elbow with a teenager who didn't realize that she was right next to her companion, not across the street from him. My burrito was good, but the screaming sort of drowned out any possible food bliss.
