*Before any of you complain about the Horchata (as someone complained below), realize that it is EL SALVADORIAN horchata. COMPLETELY different.*
     I hadn't had El Salvadorian food in such a long time and we had accidentally ended up at this place. The prices were fantastic, the Pupusas, Yucca frita and the plantains were all phenomenal. Everything that we ordered that was El Salvadorian was great. The waitress was kind and the place was nice. The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because the Mexican food there was pretty good, but not their specialty. If you are in the neighborhood for some fantastic Central American fare, stop by this place for enough food to feed a family of five for about 40 bucks... as long as you choose wisely, of course ;-)
