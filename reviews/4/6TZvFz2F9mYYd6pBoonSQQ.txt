It's the first time I've seen pambazo on the menu. I saw on tv once and wanted to give it a try. My husband got a fish taco and shrimp tacos and the taco salad to share. My mom in law got the chile relleno. The pambazo was really good! I couldn't eat it like a regular sandwich so I had to use a knife and a fork. The bread was drenched in the sauce but still wasn't overly soggy. The tacos were ok. The chile relleno was super cheesy and great. I'm not sure if the taco salad was supposed to have dressing but I was too embarrassed to ask lol I just threw some salsa and sour cream on it and it was good. The service was good, the lady at the counter answered all our questions. Great Mexican food for a fair price :D
