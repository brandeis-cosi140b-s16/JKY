The one and only downside of Fuzzy's, to me, is that the price is a TEENY bit high. But I say that as a college student with very little disposable income who wouldn't mind if everything in life were one or two dollars cheaper. So.

Besides that, I immediately fell in love with Fuzzy's the first time I went. I got one soft crawfish taco and one crispy ground beef (love that you can order tacos a la carte), and both were delicious. I wasn't expecting the feta to be good, but that + garlic sauce = amazing. My date and I also ordered the chips & guacamole, which were great. Chips were well-seasoned, not just plain old Tostitos, and the guac looked and tasted homemade.

The atmosphere is fun (paper towel holders on each table!), the food is tasty and fresh...love it.
