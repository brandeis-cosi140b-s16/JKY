Huge portions, well-made burritos, solid salsa, and good chips.

I came here wanting something with vegetables, and I knew immediately that I wasn't getting that. That said, I had a delicious carnitas burrito that I probably could have used as a weight for exercise. This thing was hefty! The carnitas meat was very tender and tasty. I like that there is an option for a whole wheat tortilla for the burrito (small paper notice taped to the counter beneath the cash register). The chips are solid, thick chips. I'm a fan of this kind of chip; I don't like the super thin chips that barely hold any salsa. You can put a lot on these chips!

The hot red salsa, though not really that hot, has a great taste to it. The pickled veggies and peppers were also quite delicious.

This makes for a good, relatively quick and cheap option when you are pretty hungry. Good stuff!
