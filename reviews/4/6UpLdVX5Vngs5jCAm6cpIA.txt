Portion size was great.. a little to much for me but most people would find that as a huge plus. 

I got the carne asada burrito!! YUMM YUMM. i tried all the salsas too. they were very good. 
the service was friendly and the food was good what else could you ask for! 

final.. Price was nice, food was great! service with a smile! I will be back for seconds :)
