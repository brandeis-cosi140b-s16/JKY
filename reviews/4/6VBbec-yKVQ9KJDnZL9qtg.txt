Stumbled across this place on a Saturday morning, looking for breakfast.  It was outstanding!  I've spent a lot of time in S. Cal and Baja and love Mexican food.  This place may be my new favorite in Las Vegas.  I'd give five stars, but have only had breakfast, so I expect I'll upgrade to five stars when I've been for lunch or dinner (which will be soon).
