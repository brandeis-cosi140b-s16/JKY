The outdoor area was great to sit in during a warm summer evening.  The service was attentive, even though we were the only ones sitting outside.  The complimenatry chips are terrific -- they are a mix of a bunch of different types, not just stale tortilla chips that you may get elsewhere.  The entrees were solid (not earth-shattering), but in light of the other positive aspects, the four stars are well deserved.
