Really nice service, great food, but pretty comparable to every other Chipotle you go to. I'm pretty sure uniformity is their middle name. 

I do love how really great their food is and it's so filling. The guacamole and lime chips are heavenly! I love everything they offer, the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it seems a little pricey. 

When I go in I usually don't get rice, I get lettuce, which would seem to be cheaper, but I always pay the same price no matter what. I always get the steak which, had I not gone vegetarian, I would eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert. YUM. 

The location is super clean, lots of seating and the staff is super friendly and really engages you. They're also really young so that tells me that Chipotle must train their staff pretty thoroughly. Whatever they're doing, it works for me!

Love this place!
