if you haven't been here then it is your loss. Chimichanga style it all. haha no, but really all the food here is delicious. I love their in-house, hand made tortillas. Definitely a plus for me. 

You can't really argue with that, but just incase you can. Go try the food on your own. I normally get the same thing every time (a combo chimichanga) and i never walk away dissappointed...unless i was super hungry. 

This place will most likely satisfy the regular eater, but you super eaters/college kids, sumo's in training, or have eaten a buffet out of business in one night...this probably wont satisfy you.
