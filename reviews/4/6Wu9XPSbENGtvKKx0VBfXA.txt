Found this place by accident. Was going to buy some wine at Lee's and my friend pointed to Hanshiktaco...it was dark, no lights and I didn't want her to walk there alone...so cut to the chase...Ron the owner is a very cool guy, food very good for the price and kudo's to the Lee family for letting him be there...its places like this that give Vegas its cool vibe....shame on you people giving him one or two stars....
