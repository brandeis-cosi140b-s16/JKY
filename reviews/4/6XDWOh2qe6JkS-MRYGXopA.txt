We stopped in tonight for dinner after having such a great experience at the Delta & the Larder a few weeks ago.  We purchased a Restaurant.com certificate and decided to give it a try.  We ordered the albondigas tapas and a veggie roll to start and had the curry noodles with shrimp and a beef bento box for our entrees.  The food took about 10 minutes and tasted very fresh and flavorful.  My favorite item was the curry noodles - just the right amount of spice and I love the thin noodles...so yummy!  The staff was very welcoming and even brought our food out to us in the dining room.
