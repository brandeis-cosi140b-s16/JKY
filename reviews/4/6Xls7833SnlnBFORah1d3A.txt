A second visit at 8:30 on a Monday night yielded good service, generous portions, and a great plate of chicken enchiladas rojas topped with a tasty cheese. The beans and rice were just as good as on my first visit and the little salad of iceberg lettuce, a slice of tomato, and sliced onion was fresh, crisp, and cold.

I'll definitely be back.
