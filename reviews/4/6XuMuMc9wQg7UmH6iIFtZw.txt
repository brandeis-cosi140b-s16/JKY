I haven't tried the food, yet. But I'm so excited about the Prickly Pear Margarita ($12.99) I had to come & shout from the rooftops how happy I am to have a taste of San Antonio right here at home. I couldn't get enough of these on the Riverwalk. I've missed them terribly and these at La Gloria are the real deal.
