I've been looking for a decent mexican restaurant in Tempe. I drove by this place many times on my way to school. I really like mexican food and grew up around many mexican folks who were great cooks. So it's safe to say that I can be pretty picky. 

The decor here is just kind of odd in a funny way. It's not necessarily bad it just strikes me as kind of funny. The food is great. I love the salsa here and find it spicy enough. I like to get their special called tres amigos. It's very filling and tasty.  The service has always been good and the food fresh. Overall a good find and pretty good food.
