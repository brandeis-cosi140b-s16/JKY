We came here by accident last night when we couldn't find tacos el gordo. I have never heard of this place nor do I live around this area but damn those were good quesadillas! And the staff was super friendly and chill at 4am! They do charge a dollar for credit card transaction which I didn't realize until today but oh wells can't beat friendly customer service!
