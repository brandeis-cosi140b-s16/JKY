I truly enjoyed Mi Pueblo!  It was a nice change from my norm--Azteka.  It was authentic mexican with a modern flare.  The good thing is the prices remained pretty reasonable.  My glass of wine was $4..score!

The chips were fresh and crunchy, the salsa was semi- fresh but extremely hot.  

I had the california chicken burrito which was stuffed with mexican rice, GRILLED chicken (as opposed to the creepy shredded chicken) and black beans--it was very good.  It was smothered with queso and topped of with a cilantro- filled pico de gallo.  Excellent.

I didn't get to try their guacamole but will for sure try that next time.

The atmosphere was nice, large covered patio, great service, in and out....really, can't go wrong.  They have a lot of items that a traditional mexican restaurant would not have so it was a refreshing change.  

Muy bueno, me gusta, gracias, adios.
