Last night I was craving something to eat and since it was 9pm on a Monday not too many options to choose from, but I was excited to see that Tacos Jalisco was open so I headed down for some late night grub.  

I ordered the Chile Rellano plate which is two Chile Rellano's and rice and beans.  The food was great but very tough to eat with plastic silverware.  Next time i get these I'll just order to go.  

They have Coca Cola in the bottle which to me is always a plus cause it is so much better than American Coca Cola.  So ya check this place out if you are in the area
