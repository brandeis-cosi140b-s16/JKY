No breakfast all day, sadly!  They stop at noon, so chorizo also becomes unavailable.  The employees were very nice about it though, especially the goateed gentleman who seemed like the supervisor/manager.

The lovely Mexican pastries that greet you are very affordable, though the flan is a touch expensive at $4/$3 (depending on the type).

My fish quesadilla was somewhat small, about the size of a Taco Bell one.  It was beautifully crispy with good flavors and actual texture, but was also $7.50.  It came with a small scoop of guacamole on the side.  My large slice of cheesecake from the pastry case was 99 cents, and had a very light texture.  The yellow cake like top layer gave it a good chew, and it was very creamy too.  I ate the entire thing, and I feel it balanced out the slightly small quesadilla in terms of overall value.

Atmosphere is okay, with wood and brick.  I can see why people are comparing it to Chipotle.  I definitely appreciate that they're trying.  The restroom was very nice and clean!

There was a strange chemical or burning rubber smell in the air when they were grilling something though.  Very unpleasant.

It was interesting to note they had a pretty strong Caucasian clientele coming in while I ate, so hopefully they will stay part of the neighborhood.

One of the employees started cleaning the glass right behind me just now and the Windex smell is really awful.

I'm going to be slightly generous with my stars and boost them up to 4, since they're a solid 3.5 and I really appreciate a slightly more upscale (clean, new) "fast casual" restaurant choice in the neighborhood.  Their dessert choices (pastry, cut fruit, ice cream, popsicles) really help set them apart from the competition.
