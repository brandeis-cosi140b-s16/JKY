Along with Chipotle (which hadn't yet moved further out to the ring road, but was still located by the movie theaters and Cold Stone), this place was one of the few places I could get a solid meal from while working at the mall.  It's a welcome, indulgently cheesy break from Subway and Paradise Bakery.  Yes, there's often a wait during busy times, but the line is usually nowhere near as bad as what can form at Paradise, Chipotle, or Panda Express.

The enchiladas (which kept disappearing from and reappearing back on the menu) are very good for being fast food, especially when you get a side of chips that you can dip in the leftover red sauce.  Their quesadillas are a very generous size and have a nice crisp on them.  The shrimp and (limited time) langostino lobster items are very good too.  Add your choice of protein (shrimp!) to a quesadilla to bulk it up for another long shift of retail work!
