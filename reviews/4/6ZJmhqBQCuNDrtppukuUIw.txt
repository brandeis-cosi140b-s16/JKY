I was in town for a meeting and had about an hour to grab lunch.  I like places like this because there's usually a bar where you can eat and watch TV and not be the creepy dude alone at a table.  With the decision to sit at the bar, sometime comes less than exceptional service since the bartender is making drinks for the entire restaurant and keeping up with everyone else at the bar as well.  But I had really great service and a fine meal at Matta's.  It wasn't packed, so maybe that helped but Ana, the young lady behind the bar, was friendly, checked in on me a few times and was quick to get me a second drink when she noticed I was running low.  The food was above average as well.  Not sure when I'll be back in Mesa, but this place will certainly be on my short list.
