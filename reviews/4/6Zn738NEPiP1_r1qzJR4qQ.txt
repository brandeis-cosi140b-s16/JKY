As far as Mexican food goes, this is my favorite spot. I can't get enough of their shredded beef tacos and, if you're feeling indulgent, the seafood enchiladas are amazing! I have never had a bad meal here and try to eat here at least twice a month. 

The only thing keeping them from being 5 star is their wait staff. Some nights, you will literally not see your waitress for 20 minutes at a time. But if you're not in a hurry, DEFINITELY try this place. 

TIP: If you're not into the "bar scene", avoid it on Friday and Saturday nights (after 8pm I believe). They have a DJ outside and the party gets kinda loud.
