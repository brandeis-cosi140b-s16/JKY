Went here for lunch around 1130am on a Saturday. There were 4 adults and 3 kids 3years - 6 years old. 
We had never been here before saw it as we were driving by and decided to give it a shot. Its not in the best strip, but the inside is nice and clean. 
We order:
2 burrito's plates one w/ Green Chicken one w/ Green Pork
2 #3's one with cheese one with Grilled Chicken
2 kids cheese quesadillas 
1 kids bean burrito

All the food was GREAT! the green pork (pork with green chillies) and the Green chicken was amazing. The kids ate all their food with no complaints. The prices were pretty good for all the food we had. 

They have refried, pinto and Black beans all were very good. the Gauc was good and only 75 cents extra not a dollar something. 

Will definitely be back to try the tacos, and the rest of the menu. Very good Mexican food!
