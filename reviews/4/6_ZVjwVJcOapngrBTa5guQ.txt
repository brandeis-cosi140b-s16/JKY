This is around the corner from my house so I should come here more often, but for some reason it wasn't until recently that I checked it out.
I like that it is part of the dining rewards program so I get Delta miles for my purchases.
They have a decent selection of Mexican and Texas beers.  My friends were enjoying the build your own margaritas.
I had the ground beef tacos and they were good.  

I will be back.
