I don't typically eat here during the day, but late nights?  Hells yeah!

Because it's so so close to Green St., it's generally fairly busy come 2am on Thursday/Friday/Saturday nights, but the line to order food somehow is never long (finding somewhere to sit can be a little tricky at times).  They advertise as having "burritos the size of your head" and have some better than decent Americanized Mexican food.

It is a little bit more expensive than I'd ideally like to pay (well, ideally I'd like to pay nothing...), but all in all a great place to get some late night drunk food.  I personally always go for their super nachos (my mouth's watering just thinking about them) and their staff has always been very nice, quick with my order, and funny - they love teasing me for the fact I know no Spanish (took 4 years of Latin in high school instead) by telling me I owe them treinta (30) when it only comes out to $6.01!  Haha, but they're just messing around, so don't worry, they're not trying to take advantage of poor drunk college kids.

Oh, and $.99 tacos on Tuesdays for lunch!  Niiice.
