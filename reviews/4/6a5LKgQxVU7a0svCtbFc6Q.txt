We went here for lunch today.  First interaction was with the hostess.  Smiled, grabbed menus, said follow me,  then literally dropped the menus on a table and kept walking.  Never said another word to us.  Actually didn't even look at us,  literally dropped the menus and just kept walking.  Seemed a bit rude. 

Other than that the rest of the experience was nice.  Our server was attentive and the food was very good and filling.  The cheese crisp with guacamole yummy.  The chicken short stack extremely good.  

We are looking forward to taking the in-laws here when they come into town.
