For fast food, this place hits it out of the park. First off, the counter space, drink station and salsa bar are always clean. Service is prompt and courteous. As you might guess, (el POLLO loco) their specialty is chicken - "flame grilled," though I've never looked for the flames, personally. They offer all kinds of applications from whole chickens (wings, thighs, legs, etc.) to sandwiches, to tacos, burritos and salads. 

Heads up: the street tacos are TINY. The burritos are dense (loaded with beans, rice and cheese). Today, I tried the new jalapeno chicken sandwich. It was good but lots of condiments: jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, southwest sauce, lettuce and pico de gallo that distracted from the chicken. Interesting bread - like a hybrid between cibatta and a Wonder bun. 

They boast a citrus-marinade which they also use on their beef. I don't know that I've ever tried their beef though... the chicken is moist and flavorful. Maybe, one day, I'll mix it up a bit!

Another cool thing about this place is: there are numerous options for combo "sides" including beans and rice but als fries, corn on the cob and mac and cheese and more!
