My date and I enjoyed our meals very much.  I had the chicken chimichaunga which was loaded with big chinks of chicken.  My date had the chili rolleno and was raving about his.  Very generous portions and everything was fresh especially being we came in right before they were closing (yes we were THOSE people, lol).  The chips with the bean dip, guacamole, and salsa at the beginning sealed the deal for me.  House margarita with Grand Marnier on top was good sized and packed a punch too.  Sure, it's more Americanized Mexican but I'm a fan and will be back.
