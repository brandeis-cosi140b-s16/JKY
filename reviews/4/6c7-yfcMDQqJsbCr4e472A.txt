They moved off the strip and their tacos are now each 2.00 so one star off for that. Now located 15-20 mins north of Vegas but they offer a free shuttle going and coming from the Wynn Hotel, except the driver dropped it off at some 7/11 instead.... Lines are still long as ever. Still the best tacos though! Ask for pineapple on the side, soo yum!
