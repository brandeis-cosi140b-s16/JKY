Thank you God for this place.  I was starving from a very long drive from the Grand Canyon to Phoenix and was craving an enchilada.  I googled mexi-whatever cuisine somewhat near the airport and came up with Arriba.  This is a chain restaurant, so the decor/service are all acceptable.  The hostess sat us immediately and our server took our orders.  I love the unlimited chips & salsa that come with every meal.  The salsa was surprisngly good!  I ordered the rio grande enchilada with pulled pork (they call it something else, i forget).  I was delicious!  I'm actually surprised it was a bit spicey.  Normal tex-mex food here in Boston is not spicy at all, so I guess I wasn't prepared.  I ate the whole thing, but passed on the rice and beans.  That's just not my thing.  Overall, 4 stars!  Ole!
