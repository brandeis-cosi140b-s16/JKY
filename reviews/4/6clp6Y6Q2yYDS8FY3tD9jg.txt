Stopped by before starting on my usual pilgrimage up I94. Place is pretty hard to find because it is hidden behind a McDonald, but I was happy I put in the effort.

I had 3 tacos: pastor, barbaco and carnitas. All were good and came with perfect sauces, but what I liked most where the tortillas. They were the more rustic kind and looked like they might have been homemade with stone ground flour. It is a small thing, but I thing it is this sort of things that makes a taco joint stand out.

I also liked the vibe of the place. Laid back, mostly South American patrons and a prompt, no frill kind of service. Oh And the World Cup on TV.

Will probably stop by again for a quick bite on my way from or to I94 and maybe get something more portable to eat while on the road.
