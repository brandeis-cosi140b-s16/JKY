Love me some Barrio.  The Barrio is one of those restaurants that you bring your visiting friends and relatives to. The place is tiny for sure and you most likely will have to wait, but have a cocktail and enjoy the atmosphere. The food is more from Southern Mexico and completely different from the other options in town. I have loved everything I have ever tried here. The guac that they make at your table is a nice show for visitors and natives alike. The service is always good and the crowd is always lively. Give it a try sometimes, you will be glad you did.
