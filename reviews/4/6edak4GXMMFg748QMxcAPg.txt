One day, a few years back, I stopped talking to a friend. I was upset, but dealing well with it, because I was on my way to console myself with a bag of Don Jose's chips and sauce. Then, I saw the For Sale sign on the lot and burst into tears. 
This restaurant has been around since before I was born. My dad told me he used to eat here when he moved to the Valley in 1966. So, you can imagine my excitement when it reopened. Especially when the restaurant and food were the same.
If you're looking for high quality pretentious style Mexican food, this isn't the place. If you're looking for inexpensive, plain old simple Mexican food, a nice staff, and a good price, pop on over. 
I can never decide between the chimi and the Mexican pizza. Pick your own favorite.
