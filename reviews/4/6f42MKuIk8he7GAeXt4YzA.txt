I was really excited to visit a Chipotle outside of California... It was basically the same as any other Chipotle. The food was delicious, and the restaurant and restroom was clean and well kept.

I went in during the lunch rush, but the staff was very efficient and the wait wasn't too long.

I usually get the steak or chicken burritos, and I contemplated branching outside of my comfort zone. I wanted to try the barbacoa, and they were more than happy to provide me with a sample. I ended up not liking it (my favorite is the barbacoa from Cafe Rio), and stuck to my steak burrito.

My only complaint is that they didn't put enough steak in my burrito ;)
