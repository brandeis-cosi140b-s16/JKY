I have been a Chipotle fan since the good ol' days when there were only two Chipotles and they were both in Denver. Amen. I smuggled their bulging burritos in my carry-on on long flights between DIA and Logan in between semesters... But I digress. And I'm dating myself. Alas, I am thankful that the chained-up version of Chipotle is strikingly similar to the original. Truly. And while it could have gone el-cheapo and sourced questionable ingredients from more questionable sources, their business model is founded on securing the freshest ingredients possible - and getting meats raised humanely without antibiotics and hormones. Word. That being said, I still order vegetarian, but this is the one fast-food place I will take my kiddos. 

Chipotle is very kid friendly, perfect for a quick snack, or a big dinner. It is great as an eat-in meal or takeout in a large brown paper bag. If you are pressed for time, order online. This spot has five prime parking spots right by the front door for online or fax orders. This location is busy, but I never seem to stand in line for too long and my meal(s) are prepared super quick. 

My personal favorite ... vegetarian burrito bowl made with brown cilantro lime rice, black beans and fajita veggies, mild salsa, medium corn salsa, and a little bit of spicy hot salsa, shredded cheese, lettuce, and, of course, guacamole. Delicious. It takes me two meals to finish it. Portions are huge! Bonus for me ... easy to order gluten-free for me and my girls. The boys and hubs can get a burrito as big as their heads and we all are happy campers. Well fed, happy campers.
