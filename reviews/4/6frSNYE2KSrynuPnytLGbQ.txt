Don Ruben's is the first acceptable Mexican food restaurant we found since locating to the Valley. Particularly good is the Green chili burrito served red enchilada style. Great Margareta's and Green chili tostadas. 

I have a difficult time understanding the poor service, unorganized, unfriendly reviews I've read; our findings were totally the opposite. Always friendly and great service.

I suggest/recommend you give it a try and write your own review.
