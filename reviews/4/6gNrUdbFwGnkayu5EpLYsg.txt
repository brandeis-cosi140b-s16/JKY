Spicy or not spicy, Salsarita's is a great and quick place for lunch. Typical of this food style (like Moe's and Qdoba), it's an assembly line of meat, veggies and then salsa in a burrito or a salad. It's nice to be able to see your food prepared right in front of you so you can see exactly what's going on and ask for more (or less) of any particular item.

I'm a big fan of the grilled chicken burrito, which has an excellent spicy taste, especially when you go with the medium or spicy salsa and add some of the made-in-the-store guacamole. Rolled up, it's always just barely big enough to fit inside the soft tortilla shell. My wife prefers the fresh grilled chicken quesadilla with the corn salsa and a zesty cheese.

The soda fountain has Coke products (including Coke Zero) but I usually end up with the 5 calorie Lemonade which I refill to go.

Unfortunately, they are not open on Sundays (possibly because they're surrounded by mostly office parks?).

Very friendly staff and the place is always clean and tidy. A couple of TV's are usually tuned into CNN or Fox News. There is more than enough seating and I think there's some outdoor seating in the back overlooking the Tyvola and Yorkmont intersection. Sadly, the angle isn't very good for seeing anything flying into or out of CLT.
