I was starving and wanted something quick and cheap. Based on reviews, I was dubious about coming here but a chicken taco sounded really good. I decided to live wild and try it out. 

A happy surprise was that it's taco Tuesday so I was able to get two soft tacos for $.99 each! I expected them to be measly but there was enough meat in it that one would've been plenty. Better yet - they tasted good enough that I ate both. (Or maybe that's worse because I'm quite full now). 
The iced tea was fresh, restaurant was clean and cheerfully decorated. They had a bar with four salsas, traditional veggies etc. 

I could've taken pix to show how much meat was into tacos but instead, I ate them.
