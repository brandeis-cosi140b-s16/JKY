This is only 1 of a few Mexican restaurants I've gone to in the Las Vegas area, but I'm sure I can accurately say this is one of the best Mexican places I've eaten at. Also, being from New York my Mexican options are limited so that may not be in my favor. Still, it is extremely good. The restaurant can seem a bit shady because the menu is in Spanish and all the employees don't speak English, but it was worth the effort. And It doesn't take a Spanish vocabulary to order the food. 

The food was served on plastic ware, nothing fancy, but for the price I didn't expect gold-plated dishes. The food was still really good; hot, fresh, authentic. The variety of food options was also impressive, but I would recommend the 3 taco special for around $6. Beware of the $1 charge for credit but totally worth it if you don't have the cash.
