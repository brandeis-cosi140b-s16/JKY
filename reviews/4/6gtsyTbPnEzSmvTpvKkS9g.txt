Went to Raul and Theresa's last night on our search for the best mexican in Phoenix and we were not disappointed. We ordered a pitcher of strawberry margaritas for 15 bucks and both mom and I each had 3. That means there's 6 servings in the pitcher. I love that!

The food came quickly and the waitress and hostess were both very friendly. We would return without a doubt. The servings were huge! You get a bit plate of food so bring your appetite!

The only downfall I would say would be that the chips don't seem to be fresh with the chips and salsa before dinner. They weren't the best but I don't expect much when it comes to that stuff. The salsa was wonderful though!

Will return and also bring company when they are in town.
