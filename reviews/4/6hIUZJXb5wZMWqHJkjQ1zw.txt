If you are stuck in Henderson, and are craving Mexican food, then I suggest you try this place (thanks other Yelpers for the suggestion).  Coming from San Diego where we have great Mexican food, this place passes with flying colors/flavors.  The outside decor was a little strange with a large circular photo of the owner embedded in the sign, but don't let that throw you off.  It is a nice family owned restaurant with good atmosphere.

Besides the normal chips and salsa, they serve you salsa plus bean dip and they keep your chip bowl refilled.  They also serve each of you a mexican soup before the meal which was unexpected, but a great appetizer.  Margaritas are a must and they have reasonably priced Patron versions.  The flour tortillas are super thin and very fresh tasting.... so you won't go wrong getting something with fresh tortillas.  I had fajitas and they were quite tasty.  You can't go wrong with this place.
