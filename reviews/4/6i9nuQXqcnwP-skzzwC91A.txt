When my wife friends come visiting from minneapolis, they decided they wanted to try auththentic mexican cuisine or their last day. So I bring them here having never been here myself. 

Definetely exceeded my expectation. Great shrimp with garlic combo and I try their carne asada which were marinated perfectly. All and all a perfect combination of mexican food without getting their item burned or undercook meat or overcook meat. I really enjoyed my meal here. Definetely a fan.
