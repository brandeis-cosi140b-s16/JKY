Great establishment and especially for it being a chain.

The place is clean and has a transparent kitchen allowing us patrons to know that the ingredients are in good standing. The prices are within good range and the seating makes it very convenient for groups.

I like their menu it's simple yet offers enough options to make it an agreeable spot.
