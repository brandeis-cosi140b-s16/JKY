Enjoy watching fresh guacamole made in front with mortar and pestle. Guacamole is creamy and goes nicely with the nacho chips.

Been to several Mexican restaurants and so far find that Don Pedro is my favorite. Friendly staff and the food is good too.

My usually is the Steak Fajita with the house Margarita. Heaping portions of food coming to the table. Nice soft flour tortilla. What a meal.
