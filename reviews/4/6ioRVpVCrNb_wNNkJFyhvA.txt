Trying New Mexican food restaurant with wife. This one is not one I would have normally come too looking at the outside. The previous reviews on yelp are what brought me into the door.

Long story short
Customer service was great
Food was better then I thought it would be. 
Only gave 4 stars due to parking and cleanliness.
