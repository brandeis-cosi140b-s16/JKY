This is probably my preferred option for the cluster of Happy Hours in this small section of Fashion Square. 

For one reason: the margaritas. Specifically, the Chambord margaritas. They pump them out of a machine that looks like a soft serve and top them with warm chambord. They don't taste all that strong and then BAM! you find yourself with a big cheesesteak a mile away. 

Dangerous is what those things are. And delicious. Deliciously dangerous. Yeah.
