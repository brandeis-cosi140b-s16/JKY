Canteen isn't a glowing review type of place. One doesn't gush about Canteen, but one is always grateful for its existence: good food, good happy hour, nice staff. It's no-fuss and easy ... easily found, easy to get to (walkable from Light Rail) straightforward menu. It's all sort of under-the-radar, in a good way. 

By way of Mill Ave. offerings, it's my happy hour of choice for food, drinks and atmosphere (I like La Bocca too but this is a bit more lively and bar-like). And kudos for surviving in what should be a prime location when several others could not (which is odd ... how hard is it to follow Duck Soup??)

In any case, here's my pat on the back and "Nice work" for Canteen.
