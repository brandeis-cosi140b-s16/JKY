Always great food when I come in, haven't had any problems besides a recent time with a line worker being completely snobby towards my sister, when all my sister did was ask a question.  There was an amazing young girl named Chandelier who had great customer service skills and was completely generous and sweet.  She even made an effort to jump on the line to help out while they were a little behind.  Besides the snobby line worker, great place to enjoy lunch or dinner!
