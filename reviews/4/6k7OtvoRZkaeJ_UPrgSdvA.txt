This place was recommended by a friend so I decided to try it out. I ordered the horchata and some carne asada tacos, the steak was cooked perfectly. I've had better horchata but the meal was still great together. The waitresses didn't speak English, but it was okay, the service was still great! Will definitely recommend this place to a friend. The best thing was prices were really affordable.
