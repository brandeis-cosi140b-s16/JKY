Friends wanted to go out to dinner, and one of them picked the place, he has wanted to try mexican food places in the valley and Nandos was the place picked to try.

Now I have been to their other location so I was kind of excited to see this new place, I like the set up, We sat at the tables behind the bar, but it didn't feel like we were in the bar area, there was a huge tree/branch like divider separating the two area, and I thought the tree was cool. We arrived around 6:30isna and there was no wait, we were seated right away.

We ate our chips & the hot sauce disappeared, so I asked our server if we could get some more of the hot, and she asked if we like spicy things, and I said heck yea, and she then brought us out this habanero hot sauce, omg that stuff was amazing, it was spicy, smoky, and flavorful, now that I know they have that I will be requesting it all the time!

I ordered the Pollo Rico, it was cooked perfectly and tasted delish! And topped with that habanero hot sauce ooohhhh weeeee baby that was good!

I did go with the intentions of ordering some deep fried ice cream, it seems to be my latest craving that I can't get enough of, and well my dinner filled me up and I wasn't hungry anymore, so I never got it, but that just means I have to order it the next time I am there and believe me I will be back! Service was great and food was delish!
