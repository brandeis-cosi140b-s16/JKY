I'd like to dedicate my very first Yelp review to what I think is an underrated Mexican wonderland in Champaign. Maize tends to steal the spotlight, but if you're looking for a great restaurant that actually fits more then 5 people within its premises, I recommend El Toro.

I went with two friends, and experienced friendly and quick service, superb cuisine, and fantastic sangria. The atmosphere is what you would expect from a family owned Mexican restaurant. It's my new go-to sit-down Mexican place. 

The only problems - I do not recommend ordering for pickup. The quality was compromised, but this is nothing new for any restaurant. Also, the other location of El Toro is not even half as impressive as this one. Perhaps the quality gap was due to the fact that I went to the other location with a party of 8, and the restaurant was very crowded, but I would rather order taco bell than go back to the other location. 

PS - if you can find yourself a DD, I highly recommend getting one of the Grande margaritas - they're literally as big as your head.
