I have been going to Arriba for years and it's always been a great meal. They have a great happy hour with free chips and salsa. A lot of people can't handle the heat from the hatch so they tend to diss like the food. If you can handle the heat I highly recommend these dishes.  Carlsbad Stuffed Chicken Breast - Chicken breast stuffed with vegetables, cream cheese, and topped with queso fundido Served with rice and choice of beans. This dish is really hot at times Hatch Chicken Especial - Chicken guisado with diced green Hatch chiles, jalape√±o cream cheese, and green sauce covered with shredded cheese. Served in a boat with fresh tortillas, rice, and beans. Another great pick would be the White Sands Chimichanga - A chimichanga filled with spicy pork green chile and covered with our tasty queso fundido. Served with Mexican rice and your choice of beans. If you enjoy spicy food cooked with hatch chiles you will enjoy Arrib Mexican grill.
