The best enchiladas I've had in a really long time! 
Me and my friends went here on a friends referral and very much enjoyed the food and ambiance. It's located in a square setting in downtown Scottsdale, so we sat outside enjoying the evening scene. 

I ordered the carne asada enchiladas and I'm not kidding when I say they were the best enchiladas I've had. I was a little worried with the red sauce, as I'm usually not a fan of red sauce. Totally blew me away. I need to find a way to get these in Vegas. My friends ordered the carne asada burrito and a variety of tacos; needless to say we all walked away completely stuffed. 

My only complaint was the lack of service. Our waitress was completely overwhelmed and not able to service us properly. I never got a second beer and it took a couple asks to get chips and salsa. I hope this isn't common there. 

Will definitely come back in the future!
