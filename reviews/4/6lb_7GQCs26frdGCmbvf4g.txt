Met a friend here for lunch at her suggestion.  She'd never been but heard it was good.  I had a mild cheese enchilada and she had a pork tostada salad of some sort.

My enchilada was nothing short of amazing.  It was flat out the best enchilada I've ever had, and I've eaten a lot of mexican food.  I'll eat non-authentic "mexican" food and enjoy it, but it is what it is, and I always enjoy the "real" thing much, much more.  This, however, was excellent.

We also ordered the chips and guacamole, which was about par for the course.  

This restaurant is a step below Chipotle and a couple of steps above Baja Fresh in taste, speed, atmosphere, cleanliness, etc.

I will definitely eat here again.
