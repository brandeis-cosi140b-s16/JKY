WOW.  I (along with 3 toddlers) went to this spot last night. I will start off by saying AMAZING. yummy authentic deliciousness. So good, that the husband decided that we will go again tonight for dinner lol.  The only reason why I didn't give five stars because I ordered a shrimp taco without cheese and it came out with cheese. Nonetheless.. I ate it. And, is was pretty darn fantastic. Yummy Yummy and the prices are beyond affordable.  The server was SOO friendly, food was hot and, The tacos were so good that we ordered more later lol. 

Try the Ceviche. 
Marlin Tacos
Fish Tacos
Shrimp Tacos
Guacamole
Decent Margaritas

I did get two refils of the salsa and chips. And, next time I would love to try the Oysters.
