Wanted tacos for dinner, so we checked out this place. Didn't want a chain bot something more authentic. Americas tacos does have several locations, but I would say the food is very authentic. Chips and salsa are good also

Tacos were very tasty! Originally ordered 3 steak tacos and ended ordering 3 more because they were so good. Wife also liked her steak quesadilla. 

Ordered a small and large margarita, those were a little pricey but they were decent.

They have a small inside eating area but a large patio.

One drawback was the restaurant has posted hours of closing at 9 pm but closed at 8.

Great taco place in Old Town Scottsdale!
