OK, being Salvadorian and coming from Los Angeles,  i went to this place in search of some delicious, authentic Salvi (Salvadorian) food. This place has delicious food, that actually tastes like Salvadorian food. I didn't, however, like the service much. They took for ever to help me, take my order and bring the food. The server, .a female that's always there, wasn't very attentive either. If you're looking for some good authentic food, and are patient then you will like the place. Their food was delicious. I ate "machaca con huevo" breaklefast style. I highly recommend this place.
