I've been to La Perla several times, and have been happy with the experience every time.  The food is nothing to scream from the rooftops about, but it's reliably good.  I've never had a bad meal here.  You get your standard Mexican fare here, and a pretty extensive selection at that.  The service is always good.  They offer mariachi music on Friday nights (and other nights too, I assume).  Later on, they have a live band that plays a Mexican, country and rock music.
