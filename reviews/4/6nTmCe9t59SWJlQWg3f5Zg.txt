Just a few blocks from home, I had been a little intimidated by the location. I don't know why, but I am glad I finally stopped in for lunch. 

The interior is cool and clean. You seat yourself and they bring out the best green salsa and a red salsa that is full of flavor (a little too much oregano for my flavor). Both with the perfect balance of flavor and heat that builds to that point of being addictive. [I like my chile hot, but not to the point that it ruins my food or my taste buds.] 
They have an extensive and well priced menu which includes a list of lunch specials and combinations. 

I choose the #18 lunch special which came with a Crunchy Taco with Shredded beef and a beef flauta covered in homemade guacamole, served with rice and beans. 
The rice was perfectly toasty, simply seasoned and well cooked. The beans were re-fried to perfection, and not overly covered with cheese. The taco and flauta were perfectly crisp. The shredded beef used was wonderfully simple, none of this cumin infused, tex-mex chili flavored shredded beef, thank goodness. 
There is nothing fancy about the food, this is simple classic homemade Mexican food, served with sincerity. I will be back!
