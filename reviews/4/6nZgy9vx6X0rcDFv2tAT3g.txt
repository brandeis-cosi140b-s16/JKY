Her royal highness invited me for lunch today and we gave this place a go.

I liked the interior decor and what a friendly staff!

Her highness had a salad with salmon that was truly a work of art and I had a Ceasar salad that was awesome.   I probably should have added anchovies but that's my bad.

Two  great salads for a total of $23 plus another  $48 for adult bevies for a grand total of $82 which included a tip.

Gi ve them a go ..... I think you'll  like it!
