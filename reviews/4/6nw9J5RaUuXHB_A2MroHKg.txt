It's not really super-convenient for me to go to the strip unless I have a plan and a few things I want.  Coming from Shadyside means I need to get in my car and drive, and I don't really like parking in the strip, and then it's always super-crowded on the weekends, etc. etc. etc.

But for a chorizo burrito from that taco stand? I would travel to the ends of the earth for one of those! 

Reyna Foods is one of those places that makes me really wish that Pittsburgh would have a street food revolution.  Every popular part of town should have food carts.  They're quick, convenient, and delicious.  Reyna is hopefully a trend setter, and definitely a hard act to follow.  

The folks who run it are always smiling, and are pretty dedicated to making sure you get your food exactly the way you wanted it.  I personally like my burrito "con todo," except for sour cream.  The hot sauce they put on it? Fantastic.  A burrito from this place is a solid, high-density mass of stomach-filling bliss.

Another upshot is it's not like any other burrito you're going to get in town.  It's a great combo of fresh and rich flavors.  

There are only two complaints I have, and there's only one REAL complaint I have.  The real complaint is that the line sometimes gets really long, and it takes a while to get served.  The fake complaint is that it weirds me out a little that they toss the burrito in the microwave for a bit at the end (seems like a Sheetz move to me,) but it really don't affect the quality of the food, so who cares?

As for the store itself? I don't really have enough experience with it to say much.  But try the taco cart ASAP!
