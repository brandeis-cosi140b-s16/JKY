Dos Gringos was a pretty cool place to grab a beer with and chill with some friends. It wasn't packed or anything but there was still a lot of people inside - which was okay because the place was big enough to where you weren't bumping against people while trying to get around.

Lots of TV's inside and plenty of tables and places to sit. I liked that the music was loud, but not blasting so you were able to carry on a conversation on the outside patio if you wanted. I didn't get to eat here, so this review is based solely on the establishment and atmosphere!
