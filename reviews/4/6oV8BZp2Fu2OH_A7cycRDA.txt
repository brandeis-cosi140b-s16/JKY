I had not been to this spot for years so I needed to give it another try... Entered the restaurant and was greeted by a really friendly and helpful staff... I looked the menu over and went with the fish taco and a beef taco... I rate the food as followed.

Fish Taco - A
Beef Taco - A

I was really impressed with the tacos they were really good... Plus really good salsa and chips I will be back for sure.
