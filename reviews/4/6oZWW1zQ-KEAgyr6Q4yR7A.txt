I dropped in last night craving tacos. I ordered half of the taco menu times 2, cabeza, tripas, El pastor and carne asada. I was very impressed. the place was clean the customers there were laughing and talking and the young lady at the cash register answered my question with confidence. I will be returning tonight to order the other half of the taco menu.
