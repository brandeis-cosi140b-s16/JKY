Found this place on Yelp. I came by to pick up some Sonoran Hot Dogs to take to work. Fail! They don't serve hot dogs until after 12pm. It was 1130am and I didn't have time to wait. 

I saw Caramelos (meat and cheese sandwiched between 2 tortillas and crisp up on both sides) on the menu and decided to stay and order a couple of asada ones hoping they were as good as the ones from  BK in Tucson. Very tasty and almost the same but I still like BK better. Maybe because I got it to go and by the time I got to work it wasn't very crispy anymore. The asada was flavorful and not at all fatty. It definitely hit the spot. 

The restaurant decor, signs, menu, and logo reminds me a lot of BK, too. Hell, even their condiment station offered very similar stuff. 

I will go back after 12pm one day to try their hot dogs. Even if those suck, I'd still go back for their Caramelos. Quick fix without having to go all the way to Tucson.
