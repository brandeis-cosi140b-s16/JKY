We just finished up at Pure - it was great! Loved the outdoor seating, so excited to have a fun place to go in Matthews. It has an extensive tequila menu, and the drinks are really good - I especially enjoyed the peach mojito. We started with the guacamole, which is almost as good as Cantina 1511's. Portions are very generous, so we split a chipotle chicken burrito (for $1 extra) and it was plenty of food after the appetizer. We will definitely be back!
