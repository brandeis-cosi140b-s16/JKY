Bad cover, Good book!
  From the outside it looked like an abandoned building, and the inside...well, it kinda was!. When we pulled into the parking lot we weren't so sure anymore if we wanted to go inside. But I already drove here so we decided to take the chance. When we walked inside there was no one there besides the waitress (and hopefully a cook). she told us to sit anywhere we wanted so we sat in the middle so the room wouldn't look so empty. It was kind of  early we must have been the first customers of the day. I heard it gets real packed on weekends. The place is a little outdated many  layers of paint over the years and cottage cheese ceiling this place has seen its better days, someone from the rat pack must have eaten here at some point. But I'm not a building inspector I'm sure everything is up to code, I'm here for the food and rumor has it, it's Pretty good here!
  We started with a dozen of raw oysters which tasted pretty fresh! Then I ordered the campechana which is a cocktail of shrimp octopus and oysters on a tomato sauce with onions cilantro avocado and bunch of other stuff. All I can say is that it was delicious! My friend ordered the camarones rancheros which consists of shrimp saut√©ed in garlic butter with onions tomatoes and peppers topped with red sauce and served with beans and rice. It was also very good.  yes I tried it, I took a bite, I'm the yelper, Somehow it gives me clearance to try other peoples food!  : )
 Service was great! We had the waitress's unconditional attention. she told us that on weekends there's live music and dancing and that they're always busy and I can see why, it's all about the food and the fun. So next time you drive by this place, don't let the facade fool you, go in and enjoy the food. We sure did!...and I'm glad this story had a happy ending!
