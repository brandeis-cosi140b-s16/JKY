Absolutely delicious breakfast burritos! I've had both the chorizo and the potato, egg, and cheese. They are pretty large, so one is more than enough for me. 

I will say that the inside of this shop looks a bit on the cheaper side. I would take your food to-go because there isn't really a great ambiance here for sitting to enjoy your food. They are pretty quick too with the burritos so there was not a long wait!
