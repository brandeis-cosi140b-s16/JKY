Mmm...La Canasta.  This is probably between a 3.5 and a 4.  What La Canasta really is is a great lunch/after work place where you can get a reasonably priced, full plate of food.  I always get the cheese enchiladas, and they are very yummy.  They also have a great chips and salsa bar, which comes with any meal.
