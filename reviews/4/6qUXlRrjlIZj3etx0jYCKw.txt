Cafe Posada is what good, home-grown Mexican food should taste like. The restaurant  nothing fancy, but is bright and clean. Try the 
mesquite salsa, the chile rellanos and the Pollo la Parillo. And don't forget the tortilla soup -- tasty and satisfying enough to make a meal of it!

There is also a lounge area with a pool table.
