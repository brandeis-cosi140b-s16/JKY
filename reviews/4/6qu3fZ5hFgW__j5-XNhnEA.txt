Quick, friendly service, and decent prices.  TONS of food, which was awesome.  I didn't care for the cilantro-heavy salsa, but that's mostly me.  It was very loud, on account of a few highly intoxicated guys at the bar.  

Good place to grab a bite in the shopping center that gets away from the chain joints.
