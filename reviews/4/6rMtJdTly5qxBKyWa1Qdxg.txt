Small pupusas for $1.50 good huh? BUT GREAZAY! The toppings were real good. BUT alas.... The place is small real weird looking blue colors and the kareokey was uhhhh yea lol. I just so did not dig the little joint. They seriously need a fashion ambush. I love/hate the cheese melting in your mouth don't get me wrong that is great, but again it's greasy so that's bad. It gets you full and it's cheap. But yeah I will come back don't worry I won't let you go out of business.
