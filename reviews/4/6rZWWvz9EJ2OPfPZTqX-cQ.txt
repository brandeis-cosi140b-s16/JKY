I really do like Del Taco on occasion.  The tacos are pretty freakin' good AND cheap!  Disgustingly enough, I totally love that, unlike Taco Bell, Del Taco offers fries on their menu.  

This location seems to have updated their decor a bit and are more modern to fit with the times now.  

Service is good and quick, food is always hot and satisfying.  Oh fast food tacos, how I love thee!
