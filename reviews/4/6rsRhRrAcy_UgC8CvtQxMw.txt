Stopped in for lunch today and ordered the Cabo plate with an original fish taco, grilled shrimp burrito, pinto beans, and chips.  When I walked in I noticed how bright, clean, and open the restaurant was and I liked that the d√©cor had a beachy theme.  I've never eaten at a Rubio's and was not sure what to order because there are so many choices.  A big picture of the original fish taco looked pretty good and then I saw that I could get this combo plate and try a couple of different items.

The fish taco was so damn good I ate that in about 20 seconds.  Nice light fish, not greasy at all, and the tortilla was nice and soft.  The cabbage and sauce were nice accompaniments.  Did I see that on Tuesdays after 2:30 those are $1.50?  That is a great deal and I could just eat a couple of those and have a beer and be happy.

The grilled shrimp burrito was stuffed full and very flavorful.  I try to avoid spicy food and I didn't see anywhere on the menu board that it mentioned this was spicy, but it was sneaky.  I would have a few bites that were fine and then one that would taste like a jalapeno and burn my mouth.  Overall it was tolerable, but I was a little thrown off by the inconsistency in heat.  It wasn't a bad burrito at all, and I would get it again.  I just wish I could have had a Corona to wash it down, but I had more work to do this afternoon.

The pinto beans were kind of mashed up and had some melted cheese on top which was fine with me.  It was like a tasty side of bean dip.  I liked the chips as well, which were light, warm, and fresh.  

I tried their mango iced tea based on the recommendation of the cashier, and it was ok, but not a lot of flavor for me.  I ended up switching to a Coke when I went back for a refill.  The staff was very friendly and overall I had a really good lunch.  Now I'll know what to expect and look forward to trying some of their other items.  AND I'll pay attention to when those fish tacos are on sale because they are great!
