uhm super burrito whatever you put in your Arizona Quesadilla minus the pico makes that quesadilla so freakin' greasy and good that i used to be enamored by Los Betos Carnitas and Carne Asada quesadillas. I'm sorry Los Betos I still heart you but Super Burrito just got my "I love your quesadillas" vote! So yum, cheap, and good!
