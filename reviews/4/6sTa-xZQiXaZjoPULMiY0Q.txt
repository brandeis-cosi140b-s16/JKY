There are lots of Mexican restaurants here in Vegas, this is one of the best. Their Asada tacos are the perfect blend of ingredients. Small, so I usually order 3 but absolutely delicious. 

The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because I think they close a little too early on Sunday's. We were there two Sunday's in a row. Last night the waitress was super friendly, accommodating and everything she said was with a smile. Mind you, we got there at 825 and she was still very accommodating. The week prior we ended up going at the same time. The waitress told us we had to sit by the register because she had already cleaned the other tables, which isn't that big of a deal but throughout our dinner, she seemed more concerned and distracted about leaving at 9pm then anything else. She was definitely not too happy about being there and it showed. Room for improvement? Yes.. But the food is fresh and it's one of my fav taco places.
