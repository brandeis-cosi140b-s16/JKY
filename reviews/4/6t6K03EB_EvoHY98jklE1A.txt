Del taco is a solid fast food restaurant for sure. They have a great value menu. The restaurant was very clean and the staff was quite friendly. The chicken soft tacos are incredible as are their chicken quesadillas. I wasn't a fan of their chilli cheese fries. They are located all over Vegas and out west. It's def a must try when you get the craving for quick tacos. I'm still addicted to Taco Bell tho but del taco can be a healthy alternative. Enjoy
