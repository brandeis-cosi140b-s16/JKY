Extremely solid contender in the Mexican food market place! Lived here for 12 years, passed this place many times, and just tried it out yesterday. Cheese dip was really great, as well as both of our entrees. Service was nearly perfect as well. Place is really colorful and well kept on the inside. It's slightly overpriced, but maybe that's why reviews are consistent over the years... You get what you pay for in life. Will be going back.
