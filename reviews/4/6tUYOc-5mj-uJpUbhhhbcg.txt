I used to get the Burrito Bowl with chicken, black beans, brown rice, corn, pico de gallo, and guacamole.  Now that I'm trying to eat less meat, I LOVE LOVE LOVE their sofritas option.  It is tasty and pairs perfectly with the way I prepare my burrito bowl.  I could eat this daily.  The usual nighttime cashier at this location is a really fantastic hospitable host and we look forward to seeing her each night almost as much as we look forward to chowing down on the delicious food.

I love how clean their open kitchen is and how thoroughly they scrub everything down at the end of each evening.
