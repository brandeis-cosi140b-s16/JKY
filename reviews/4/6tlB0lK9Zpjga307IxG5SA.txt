When I worked on the west side, I would pass by a small Mexican import store every day on my way to work. I knew it was there from the random Mexican furniture displayed on the sidewalk. I never thought in a million years, I would ever actually step foot into that place, but then one day my boss at the time took me to lunch and yes, we ended up at Pepe's. The Mexican furniture lined the sidewalk as I approached the restaurant, and I'm not sure if it's attached to Pepe's or just conveniently located next door, but it definitely adds to the authenticity of the restaurant. 

This is truly a restaurant where you can't judge it by its cover and questionable location on the outside. Once you step foot inside, it's a fun and divey little Mexican food shop. Prices are extremely low and the food is good. The salsa has a nice kick to it and the food is pretty high in calories but also high in taste. 

I like Pepe's for a decent west-side option for lunchtime. It's a quick, tasty and cheap option for a sit-down restaurant. The Mexican decor on the walls adds to the experience and I could just as easily be in a little restaurant in Cabo instead of being in a restaurant on Camelback and 21st Ave. 

This is definitely a spot worthy of checking out if you're in the area during lunchtime and looking for a tasty lunch time treat.
