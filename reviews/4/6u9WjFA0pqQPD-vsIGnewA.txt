Service:
Jacob our server was amazing. He defiantly made this place special! He brought Horchata to go with the coffee in addition to cream without asking to give us something different to try. He also was super creative with the menu substitutions we could make. We stayed two weeks at the Claredon and got free breakfast daily, by the end of the week we started getting bored.

Drinks:
I had a few cocktails at the bar and poolside. One cool thing is they let you double any drink for 1/2 more. i.e. $15 gets you 2x $10 drinks combined!
Cocktails I liked were the Mezcal one, and the margarita with St. George Spirits Raspberry Liquor.

I think the bar is this places best asset. They do drinks really well, and it is a chic atmosphere.

Food:
Well I'm super picky. That's what living in the bay area does to you. We had breakfast every day here for two weeks and I tried almost all of the menu. The pancakes are really awesome, so was the scramble, but only because I asked for them to custom make me something. I would ask for bell peppers, onion, cheese, chorizo, and it would taste amazing. The secret: they add taco seasoning to the eggs! Highly recommend you do that. 

The chilaquiles and huevos rancheros were both disappointing. The chilaquiles for some odd reason had carrots in it! Didn't exactly go with eggs. Their scramble off the menu - spinach and mushroom was also pretty boring. These guys could be a 4 star on food if they gave the chef some creative freedom and added more stuff to the breakfast menu. They have 8 items; not a lot of selection..... it would be super easy to add omelets for example. 

The saving grace: good coffee. The coffee both warm and cold brew iced was awesome!
