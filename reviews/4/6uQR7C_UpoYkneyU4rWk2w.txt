La Salsa is the type of Mexican food that I can't get since I moved to the east coast, there's too much of a Cuban influence there, which isn't bad but isn't Mexican.  Junky being in Las Vegas for a week, I made sure to eat here once a day & relive memories of my youth in California eating true Mexican food in little dives. You won't be disappointed unless you think Taco Bell is actually Mexican food.
