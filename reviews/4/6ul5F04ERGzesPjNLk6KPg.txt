Well, I'm not sure what happened, but Don Tortaco used to be Roberto's . The menu and food are exactly the same, so it was only a name change. Another Roberto's opened up across the street by Home Depot shortly after the switch, so go figure. Nonetheless, Don Tortaco (btw.. I'm still trying to figure out what a Tortaco is and how can I order one!) is still pumping out really good cheap Mexican food. It puts me in the mindset of Taco De Mexico in Oxnard which is truly a great So Cal Mexican spot.
        I can't honestly say I have had one bad thing on the menu. This is one of my faves for sure. The asada burrito is a must just ask for rice and beans inside because unlike California Mexican joints it doesn't come standard. They kinda give you a funny look when you ask for rice, beans, and pico de gallo inside the burrito ( almost like they are saying... "You sure about this?")
         Some other faves of mine are the enchilada plate, California burrito, & asada fries. Tortaco's enchiladas are awesome! The red sauce makes it happen. Whether you go chicken, cheese, beef or whatever ... you will not be disappointed. The California burrito is a more recent discovery of mine that I kept overlooking on the menu for a few years until my curiosity finally got the best of me. This burrito includes asada, a good amount of pico de gallo, and fries .... Yes..... I said fries! It's really good, however I'm  still not sure why they call it a California burrito. Lastly, the asada fries are a complete juggernaut! The fries are drowned in tasty asada meat, pico de gallo, and cheddar cheese. The portion size is generous, definitely something you may want to share with someone. Parking, customer service, and prices are all good at Don Tortaco. Btw... they are open 24 hrs-so go get your Tortaco on!
