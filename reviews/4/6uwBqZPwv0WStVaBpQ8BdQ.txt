After reading the reviews from Faith and Thomas, I decided to stop by at this place because it's really close by to my pad. 
I was greeted by a guy when I walked in and he showed some of their display of meals. He was very helpful as to answer my questions for descriptions of their food. 
I decided to order the Family Meal of 20 taquitos that came with beans, rice, chips and salsa. Also orders carne asada burrito and horchata. The horchata was just okay, it wasn't bad, just not the best that I've had. The taquitos were alright, but if you add on the lime and hot sauce...it's delicious! The beans were a bit salty, but good. The rice was just wonderful. The burrito was great and they put a good amount of carne asada in the filling. 
I really wanted to try their panderia section, but I came here for dinner and decided that I should just visit next time in the morning when it's more fresh, but I must admit, when someone passed by with their tray of pastries...oh man...was I tempted! It smelled so GOOD!!!
Overall, a great experience and would definitely come by again!
