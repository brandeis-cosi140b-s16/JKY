Arrived about an hour and half before closing on a Saturday night.  They had already put chairs up and mopping the floors.  Another group had come in about the same time as we did.  Seems like they were going to close early, however they decided to seat us.  

The food was good no complaints as was the service.  Salsa and chips awesome.

If you area in the area it is worth the stop.
