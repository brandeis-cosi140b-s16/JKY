Just about any ---bertos around town is going to be a good bet. It just happens that the Filibertos in my neighborhood semi-recently changed to Juliobertos, but I haven't really noticed much change in the food.

Anyway, Juliobertos is my go-to for a good, hearty, cheap burrito on the go. Their tortillas are really good, and what's inside is even better. I usually go for a bean-cheese-rice-guacamole burrito with tons of hot sauce which is awesome in every way possible, but if you're feeling like something so heavy you won't want to eat for the next 12 hours but it irresistably delicious I'd go for the Arizona burrito, which has Carne Asada, potatoes, pico de gallo and cheese. Although, I remember that one being way better when it was Filiberto's...
