I have just moved to the area, and was looking for a place to grab a bite to eat.  I was strolling around old town and came across Cien Agaves, and I'm glad I did.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was great, quick service and friendly.  I grabbed the menu and began to peruse the menu.  I saw that they offered many types of tacos and you could do a mix and match of the many different types.  I thought that this was awesome.  I selected Island Shrimp Taco, the Carnitas and the Carne Asada.  I really enjoyed all of them especially the shrimp and carne.  The Carnitas was a little dry, but oh well.  I'll definitely be back and with the many different choice, I look forward to making my way through the taco stand.
