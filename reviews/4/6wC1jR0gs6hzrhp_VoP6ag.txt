Excellent! This is now our go-to Mexican food restaurant. Every meal includes awesome chips and salsa. Edit: Dinner comes with chips, salsa and beans (which are excellent). Portions are plentiful, prices are right, the place is clean, the service is great, and the food is great as well! Not generic Mexican food, there's always an added special touch that makes the dish more than your typical fare.
