The food was very good. I was rather impressed by the large portions and fast service for food.  Our waiter was not very attentive but I think this was partially based on the fact that we were dining in the bar area. 

However, we went here for the margaritas and I was not that impressed.  Not terrible but not amazing. 

Great venue for a large party!
