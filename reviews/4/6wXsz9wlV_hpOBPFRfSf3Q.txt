This was the best food, by far, that I had my most recent trip to Vegas. The chips and salsa at the beginning were super yummy. I ended up asking for more of the green salsa. The tacos did not disappoint at all. Our waitress was a total doll and was super sweet. I didn't like my margarita and she quickly got me a beer. The only bummer was that we asked to change the television to the Dallas/Miami game and it took them our entire meal to do so. Besides that, it was a really pleasant and delicious experience, and I look forward to going back for their yummy tacos.
