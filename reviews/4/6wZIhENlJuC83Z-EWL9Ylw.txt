I used to come here all the time when I lived in the area. I usually order asada tacos, tortas, or their shrimp Coctel. All are really good, cheap and much better tasting than food I have tried at Roberto's. I crave their green sauce. It tastes good on everything! Oh yeah their agua de pi√±a is pretty good too. My only complaint is that the meat could be a bit more tender.
