Love this place and at times forget about it when thinking of what to eat.  I always order their 2 item dish:  jade red chicken, emerald chicken with fried rice and refried beans.  Their bean and cheese burrito is also pretty amazing even though it's small - but it's so good.  The place on Greenway is a hole in the wall and you almost have to know how and what to order when you approach otherwise you may get the stink eye.
