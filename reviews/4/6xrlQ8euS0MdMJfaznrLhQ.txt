The food is always delicious. Basic Mexican fare- baked burritos and enchiladas. The bean dip is amaze balls. We come back for the food but the service is always sub par.  We eat here every 2 weeks and we either get the super slow non existent server or mr no personality that brings me an empty Tapatio bottle and insists they don't have Chalula even though I've had it there every other time.
