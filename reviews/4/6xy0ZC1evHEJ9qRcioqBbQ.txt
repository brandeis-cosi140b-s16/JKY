Tried several different things and really liked it all!  I thought the flavors were really great and overall was impressed and will definitely go back!  The vampiros were tasty and the bean and cheese burrito was delish as well!  I thought the customer service was fantastic too.  Overall, I would recommend it to others and will be going back.  I knock down one star just for the slightly pricey menu items and the taco kind of fell apart as I was eating it.
