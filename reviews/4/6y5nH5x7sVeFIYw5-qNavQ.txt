In search for outdoor seating with a mexican food on our mind, we ended up going to Blue Adobe for a birthday lunch.  The patio is nice and once seated the manager stopped by to see if there was anything he could for us.   The server promptly brought out menus and brought us their special 'ritas which hit the spot.  

Customer service was the best I have seen in sometime and the food was awesome.  Loved the salsa that came with the chips and the veggie enchiladas were first class.
