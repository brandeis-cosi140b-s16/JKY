Something has changed for the better....

Up until a few weeks ago I was still feeling three stars about Jalapeno Inferno.  We've been here or picked up take out on and off since my last review and it was always ok.  Last month we decided to go one night for dinner - they do have a nice atmosphere and good service. We ordered the skillet cheese (no chorizo this time), appetizer sampler platter and the tamales...everything I tried was really delicious.  The tamales are out of this world and the skillet cheese was nice and spicy.  

Since that night, I've been back a few times including two lunches and it has been equally good.  I don't know what's changed but Jalapeno Inferno has moved ahead of a couple of my regular Mexican restaurant go-to spots.
