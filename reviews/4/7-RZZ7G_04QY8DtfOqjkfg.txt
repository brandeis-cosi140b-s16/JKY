Blue Burrito - Quality Mexican food for a not-so-bad price.  My girlfriend and I both chose to have a choose 2 dinner, to get a good variety.  While the Taquitos and Street tacos were good, the Flautas and Steak taco shined!  The steak was perfectly cooked with a bit of char, and the Flautas, drenched in sour cream and guac were on point.  Throw in the $10 for $20 Yelp deal and this is a must visit. 

** Reason for 4 stars instead of 5:  the side rice could've been better.  It was rather dry and flavorless.
