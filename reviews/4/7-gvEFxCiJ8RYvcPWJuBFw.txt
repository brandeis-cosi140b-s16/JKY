The burritos here are the best in the area. I used to drive to Burrito Shack, but now I just get the Gordos or California Burrito here. They are filling and taste great. In fact even my teenager was full. The salsa I think is just okay, not great. They also give you free hot coffee too.  The prices are average for a burrito, but it's definitely a great value. I haven't tried anything else on the menu, but if you want a good burrito, give them a try!
