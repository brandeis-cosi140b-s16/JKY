--- Review from www.JerseyGirlinVegas.com ---

Yesterday I went to find my "local" post office to pick up a package during my lunch break. In doing so I discovered a great little Mexican joint called Pepe's on Decanter. 

They have great big signs that caught my eye. I figured, I'm hungry, tacos sound good, let's try it out! When I opened the door I read they were voted the best in Las Vegas 2015 so I was getting pretty optimistic on this find. I ordered the 2 hard shell pulled beef taco and soda lunch special for $5.10. I also picked up some chips and salsa since their salsa bar looked so yummy (see below). My order was to go since I was short on time. 

When I arrived back to work I broke into the tacos almost immediately. The one shell was cracked but the flavor was exceptional so it was the least of my concerns. I trickled some of the smokey, spicy, homemade salsa I had for my chips on the tacos. It made my taste buds do the happy dance! They were SO good! If anyone is looking for some quick, authentic Mexican cuisine, stop by Pepe's. They have 4 locations around town.

And they are OPEN 24 HOURS!
