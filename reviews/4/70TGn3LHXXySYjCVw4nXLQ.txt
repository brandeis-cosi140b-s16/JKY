So after doing an internship in Downtown Phoenix, I was introduced to Carolina's. I was a little apprehensive at first, but I had heard many rants and raves about this hole and had to try for myself. After my first bite of Carolina's burrito, I was in love. It was awesome, and I continued to sample many of the items on Carolina's menu for the remainder of my internship, never once disappointed. I even brought home some of their famed tortillas - just those warmed with a little butter - simply melts in your mouth goodness. Awesome and cheap too!
