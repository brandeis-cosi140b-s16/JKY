Similar to a chipotle, but with more options. 
Only negative was the staff at this location. There seemed to be two new people on the line doing almost nothing. I don't blame them if they don't know what to do...anyhow, manager sorted it and service began moving.

The enchilada didn't come with red sauce standard and the Taco salad was a lightly grilled tortilla. I prefer the crunchy shells myself, so I saved the carbs this time and just ate the innards.

Best part?: TRES LECHES!! This was so delicious! I ordered it expecting it to be a disappointment, dry and chalky like other fast restaurants. Nope, this was amazing! 
Also, kids under 6 get "Ni√±o quesadillas" free. How awesome is that?! 
I would definitely return here. Hope the staff is better trained next time.
