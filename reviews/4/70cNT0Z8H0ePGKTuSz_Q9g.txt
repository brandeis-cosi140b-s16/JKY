I had an urge for barbocoa and was only .2 miles from This location.
The tortillas are home made/ hand made fresh that's why I gave it the 4 stars. 
I had the consum√©, it was okay nothing to rave about.  The barbocoa was ok too; it was kinda bland.   I had to add a lot of condiments like salsa, onion, cilantro etc 
The decor is Mexican style of course nothing fancy or anything that appeals to ones eyes.
