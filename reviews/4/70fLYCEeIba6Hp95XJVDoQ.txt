Border Grill was a nice find in Mandalay Bay.   It's a bit tucked away from things but it's still a nice spot to sit and enjoy a leisurely meal.   I ordered off the specials menu which was a cowboy steak with beans and a quesadilla.   Wow!  Was it good.   That meal was both generous and tasty!   That cost about $35.   One of my friends ordered a mushroom and chicken quesadilla that was pretty good for about $28.   Of course I gave him grief that for a mere $7 more, he could have had a real meal.   

The service staff was quite pleasant and helpful.   I really enjoyed the dining experience there.   

Will I be back?   Yes, I would go there again if I am in the area.
