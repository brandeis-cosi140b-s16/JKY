This place by name is the Mexican Grocery but the Taco shack right out front is what I am writing about.  I tried both their tongue and pork tacos and they were both solid (I've had my fair share of tacos in Texas and Oklahoma).  The thing that really makes this place though is their fresh watermelon juice!
