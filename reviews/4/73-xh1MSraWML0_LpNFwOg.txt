My wife and I were staying at the W Hotel next door and this little place was by far the cheapest place to eat and the best all in one!  The first thing was the excellent beer selection right when you walk in!   We stayed in Scottsdale for 3 days and ate there 3 days!  We just flew in from Texas to see a KISS concert, so we know Mexican food. 

We weren't expecting much, so the first day we just got a beer and a coke and they gave us free chips and salsa! We were amazed by the huge menu so the next day we got dinners and the food was pretty spectacular for under $20!  I had the pork chili and my wife had spinach enchiladas.  On our third day I had the chili relleno lunch and my wife had the taco salad.  We shared a margarita and still got 2 drinks for under $20!  Awesome. 

And then there's the service.  The guys at the counter noticed I was wearing a bacon shirt and we discussed bacon for a minute.  The second day we showed up, I was in a different bacon shirt and we talked bacon some more!   On the third day they were still amazed I had yet another bacon shirt (I have a LOT of bacon shirts).  They were great to have lunch and dinner with! 

I really liked the salsa too.  In Texas your salsa is always tomato, jalapeno, onion, and cilantro, but here they got the heat up with some other chiles and seasoning that made it special and good, though what they call hot was still pretty mild for us.
