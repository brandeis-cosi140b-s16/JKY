Alright, so we all know about Macayo's but I wonder how many of you grew up with Macayo's?? That's right, yours truly did. Most everyone knows it is not the incredible food  they have but it's really about the chips and Macayo salsa I can't tell you how many times I have downed bowls and bowls of their chips and salsa. There have many Macayo's restaurants that have come and gone from the old, old one on Paradise Road (think when this street went two ways) to the most recent closing of the one on W. Charleston Blvd a couple of years ago (sniffle, sniffle). This leaves only three locations.

My friend and I enjoy popping in at one of the oldest locations on E. Charleston. Yeah, it is not in the greatest part of town, but it is definitely a locals place. We have a history with coming to this restaurant after partying as they were always open in the wee hours for us to get our fix. We stopped in yesterday to grab lunch and enjoyed one of the lunch specials. We didn't have anything fancy except your typical Mexican fare (tacos, burrito, frijoles, rice and tortillas). We had nothing to complain about. The food was good and the service was exceptional! Oh, and of course the chips and salsa were warm and tasty. 

Whenever I have a need to taste old Las Vegas, I know I can always go to Macayo's and I am filled with warm memories of days gone by!
