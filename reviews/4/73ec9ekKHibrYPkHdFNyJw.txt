While walking down Mill and hungry for lunch, I stopped in Hippies Cove. Nice name...The decor was very nice - I felt right at home. Of course, I am from a small town in Ohio called Yellow Springs that was known for hippies and while living in Atlanta I frequently visited Little Five Points. This restaurant would fit in either location.

The place was of good size, but was mostly empty during lunch. I walked up to the counter and looked over the options, unsure how it worked. Then I noticed the menu on the left-hand wall. I went with the three tacos, carne asada. I added cheese, pico, sour cream and onions. It came with a side of chips with a very good salsa. Very quick service and good quality food. Add to that the nice decor - what's not to love?
