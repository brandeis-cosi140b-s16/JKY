A great little mom & pop type Mexican restaurant right in the midst of all the bars on Carson St. in the South Side.  It is a bit of a dive, and it feels like you are eating in someone's home, which I tend to like myself.  The food was far more tasty and authentic than most of the better Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh, and is reasonably priced.  I got 2 different types of samplers - more than enough to feed 2 people, and everything on there was great.  If you like spicy food, be sure to ask for their house made hot sauce - very nice flavor.  Service was great - we had a young gentleman who was the owner's son - he was very polite, friendly and professional.  We will definitely be back.  It is also BYOB, and they have horchata.
