Hole in the wall, kinda shady on the outside.... But go right in!! There is a genuine effort to got their good as close to authentic as possible. And they people working there were very nice.

We ordered birria estilo Jalisco, and a torta ahogada. The birria was tender, delicious, and the broth was extremely flavorful. Paired with some corn torillas, lemon and onion... Dish from Mexican heaven. 

The torta ahogada (which I didn't have high expectations) was a solid B. The bread is the hard part for me, since I am from Guadalajara, there is a particular bread called birote, that can only be properly made in the state of Jalisco. Don't ask why, that is just that, it's a bread specific to the region and it makes the whole torta special. 
They do bake a pretty similar bread here, and it gets you close to the real thing, totally worth trying if you miss home and a good torta ahogada!
