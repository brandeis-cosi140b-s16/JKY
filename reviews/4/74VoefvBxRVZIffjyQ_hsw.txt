Beer selection is very good. The tacos tasted fabulously, and most around $2.95, which I thought was very reasonable. But....sorry to say, the service was horrible.  I sat at the bar. I was there with only three/four other people. The bartender was talentless; no passion, no charm, slow, and just didn't want to be there. It was so obvious she hated being there. She ruined my experience.  I even wrote it on the check:  food - excellent, service - poor. 

I will be back with my family, but I'll get a table. 

If you are front line, and you don't like your job or are not a "people person," get a new job!  But shame on the management for not being proactive.
