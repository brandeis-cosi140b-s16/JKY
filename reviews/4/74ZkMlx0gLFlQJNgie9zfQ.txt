I would probably give this more of a 3.5, but since there are no halves, I'll round up.  If you want some inexpensive mexican grub, this is definitely a place to come to.  My good friend told me that this is one of her fav mexican places back when she was in san diego and i can see why...their carne asada fries were quite tasty...my only gripe is that there weren't enough fries! the amount of carne asada totally overpowered the fries.  most people will prob think i'm crazy in wanting more fries over more carne asada but when the carne asada is considered a topping for fries, i better get a generous portion of fries.  In addition to the carne asada fries, i shared a fish burrito with my sister and that was yummy! no over flowing juice action that always happens whenever i eat burritos, where you feel sauce dripping down your hands and arms like waterfalls.  it had the right amt of liquid sauce as well as veggies and generous portions of fried fish.  As for my friend's fiance's chicken burrito, that was all chicken...so much so to the point that he said he couldn't think about eating chicken for a whole week! haha....so definitely come here to try the carne asada fries and definitely come here if you LOVE meat., otherwise, the amt of meat they give you may be a bit overwhelming.
