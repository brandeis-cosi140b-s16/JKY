Ok short and sweet this is very good take out. We have been here to pick up dinner several times and have tried a number of menu items: the chicken burro, the mex pizza, the enchiladas, and the chimi. Even the bean burros were some of the better ones I've had. And price is pretty reasonable, go hit this joint!
