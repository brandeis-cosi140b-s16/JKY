For above fast food mexican food, cant be beat. cheap prices. good quality of food. great taste. I really like the 3-cheese burrito or 3-cheese nachos. Having the choice between black and brown beans is also very good in my opinion. Location is very convenient for me being near my house. And I would absolutely put Qdoba up there with Chipotle quality of food.
