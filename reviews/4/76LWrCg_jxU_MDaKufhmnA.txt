Simply awesome. Don't be afraid to come in. When we pulled up to the restaurant, my wife and I were debating whether or not to go in. I am glad we did.

We were greeted by the owner who was very pleasant. He explained the items on the menu we were interested in, and when the food came out, it was beyond good. I'm wondering what this guy was thinking when moving in to this location... This food deserves a better spot!  Their beef broth was so delicious (which is created by the juices from the beef they cook) that we went back and ordered one to go.

The rice seemed pre-packaged, but was pretty good, and I'm not too sure about the beans. They were possibly pre-packaged, but good enough that you have difficulty telling.  Very creamy and smooth, and not over-seasoned.

I had one of their beef burros, and my wife had their Carne Asada Tacos, which seemed almost like beef fajitas.  I seriously can't find one thing to complain about, and am instead raving about how delicious these items are. The onions and bell peppers are fresh, and there is a hint of cilantro to give it a wonderful freshness.
