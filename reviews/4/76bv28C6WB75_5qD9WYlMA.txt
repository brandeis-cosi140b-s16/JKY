I've only been to Chino a couple of times but I tell everyone I know about it! The food is SOOOOOOO good!!! I fell in love. My favorites thus far are the chicken with ginger (I forget what it's called) in a quesadilla and the red jade chicken. I tried a few different types of rice and they were delicious. oh and the cookies... YUM! Almost as perfect as Paradise Bakery's ;)

The only cons for me have been the service. First time I went there, it was great, the second time I brought my husband and the girl helping us had a serious amount of attitude which was very unpleasant. And she messed up our order, but we let that one slide. Not a huge deal.

So yeah the reason i'm not giving five stars is the inconsistency in the service, as well as the hard to find location/awkward parking lot, as well as the weird decor/vibe with picnic chairs and crappy silverware. The food is worth getting past those cons though - deeeelish!
