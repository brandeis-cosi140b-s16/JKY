Is this the best Mexican food in town?  Definitely not, but it's super cheap and pretty tasty.  

This is the only halfway decent restaurant close to my office, so I am a regular here.  Service is also friendly and fast.  The chips and salsa are pretty solid and the lunch specials will fill you up and not break the bank.  I highly recommend the #5 Chile Verde Burrito plate which comes with refried beans and rice.  I've also tried the adobada taco and it's pretty good, although not as good as Tacos El Gordo.  This is truly weird, but I really love the water at this place.  Yeah, I said water.  None of that funky aftertaste like some places.
