Breakfast is wonderful.  I totally love love love the Enchilote (no doubt not spelled right ) a cheese omelet covered with enchilada sauce. Comes with refried beans but you want to upgrade to the Mexican Pappas oh my they are incredible. Lunch and Dinner are pretty ordinary but good.  Prices are good.
