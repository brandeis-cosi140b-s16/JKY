I've been coming here for about 6 years and have had good and bad experiences. The food is good but does not consistently taste the same every time for some reason.  

When you get there you are greeted with chips and a generous serving of three different salsas. I was raised in a home where we make fresh salsa for almost every meal so I am very particular about it having the right taste and consistency.  70% of the time the salsas taste great but they do have their "off" days when it's either too watery, salty, not enough salt, or not the right balance of chili and tomatillo.  

For my appetizer I order the melted cheese or "queso fundido" and it comes with flour or hand made corn tortillas. For my entr√©e I usually order the #14 (red sauce, cheese filled enchiladas with 2 carne asana tacos, rice and beans) it's a pretty good amount of food for about $12.  

All in all the place is clean, has a great atmosphere and most of the time friendly staff. Just expect to be amazed or disappointed with the salsas once in a while.
