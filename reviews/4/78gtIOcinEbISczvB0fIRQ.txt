This is one of my favorite Mexican style fast food joints. The burrito bowls here are great and service is always fast even when there's a long line. When you order, you tell them what you want from start to finish and they'll make your order right in front of you. I would recommend chicken or carnitas (roast pork) for your meats since that's what I typically get. The only downside to this particular location is the parking...it's located in a busy shopping area with a bunch of restaurants in close proximity so you would be better off parking further back and walking, rather than try to fight for a spot upfront.
