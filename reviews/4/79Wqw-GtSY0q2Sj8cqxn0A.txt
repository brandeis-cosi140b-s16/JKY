I think Fuzzy's is intended to be Tex Mex fast food.  If that is its intent, it scores!  The food is very fresh and tasty. It is not bland at all.  i guess yo can order it bland, if you like.  They may not have what some would think is a huge menu, but it is quite varied and includes a few breakfast entrees served all day.  I am not a quesadilla lover.  But Fuzzy's has got me rethinking that. We were there last week and my son wanted a chicken quesadilla. He could not finish it so I had a piece.  It was very good.  Loads of well seasoned shredded chicken and cheese.  Really good.   My brother always gets one of their entree salads--tempura fish--I think. It is huge and comes in a big stainless steel bowl and is very reasonably priced.  My wife is a huge fan of their black bean soup.  Also, the service and people are always nice and the restaurant is clean. We go there often with our kids and they are made to feel right at home.  They serve beer and margaritas and I find those prices extremely reasonable.  I understand they have a Wednesday margarita night with special pricing that is quite a deal.  If you want Tex Mex quick but hate the TB (like me), Fuzzy's is where to go! The only downside is that they don't have tamales (yet) on the menu. But there's plenty of other items to keep me coming back for more.
