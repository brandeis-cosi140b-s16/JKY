Hey look in the strip mall, it's a bird, it's a plane! No, it Roberto's Taco Shop.  These places are everywhere and I believe they are all open 24 hours.  So yes when you are having that Mexican food craving in the middle of night after some binge drinking you can always count on your friend Roberto to serve it up.  I'm not saying that's how I partake in this fine Mexican food establishment.  I actually frequent Roberto's quite often in a state of sobriety.  I only have four words for you, are you ready? yes four words that should be famously synonymous with Roberto's Taco Shop!  Wait for it.................! CARNE ASADA FRENCH FRIES!  Senor Roberto took two food items that I enjoy.  French fries and carne asada!  So next time you go to Roberto's Taco Shop at 12:00PM or 12:00AM, sober or inebriated just get the fries!  Cheers!
