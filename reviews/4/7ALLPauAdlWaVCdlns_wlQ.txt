I grew up in Texas and lived in California....Mexican food is my favorite food in the world. This place is very near my house and I've been there twice already. Went home stuffed and with doggie bag, Not the best I've ever had, but plenty good enough. I enjoyed the mole and chile verde, and their ceviche is not bad (and a HUGE plate of it...I wish more places would offer a smaller appetizer size of ceviche). Very friendly and helpful staff, too.
