Very nice decorations and ambiance including a fresh tortillas making station.  My husband and I  were there around noon on a Sunday and were seated right away In a nice booth.   Menu was full of wonderful options including lunch options that were available on weekends.  Fresh guacamole was just ok. It was prepared in the usual manner but they had aluminum foil lined in the pestle. That was a nice way to wrap up the leftovers to take home but not sure it allowed all the mixing needed. I had the chicken enchilada from the lunch menu. The chicken was white meat and tasty. The side of rice was typical but the refried beans were very tasty. My husband had the chicken chimichanga and enjoyed it about the same as some other places.   The chips didn't seem to have any salt on them. The queso was very good. Overall it was a good experience with tasty food.
