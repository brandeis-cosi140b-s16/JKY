This is probably my family's favorite local restaurant and it arguably has the best traditional Mexican food and margaritas in the Valley, which is saying something.

I've tried most things on the menu, but definitely recommend anything with shredded beef (esp. the shredded beef taco), the green corn tamale, house margaritas on the rocks and pretty much any style of enchilada - I'd stay away from the steak dishes and fish tacos though; they are good but I've had better elsewhere.

I'd like to close by saying, overall, this place is amazing because of the quality and taste of the food and the affordable prices.

Don't trust anyone who has given this place less than three stars - they are most likely morons.
