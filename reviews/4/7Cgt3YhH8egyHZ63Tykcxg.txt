Having eaten (late night) at Los Gemelos on Gilman more times than I'd care to admit, I was really looking forward to coming out here.

This location - not the easiest place to find - is tucked away in a strip mall off Odana Road, in the back of a little grocery store.  I didn't have much time to look around, but they had a meat counter with fresh and prepared goods as well as a decent selection of some other essentials.

Anyway, on to the food. On my first visit, I was pretty sure that I had the best steak taco in Madison.  Since I was only pretty sure, I went back.  It was definitely the best steak taco in Madison and the pastor taco ranks a close second.  The prices are super reasonable, as any taqueria should be.  I noticed that they have some Sunday specials and I'm super pumped to go back and try those.
