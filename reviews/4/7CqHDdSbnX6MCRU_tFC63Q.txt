Love their Watermelon Margarita! It was their special Margarita-for the day? week? I dunno but it was yummy and refreshing! Must try! The home-made guacamole was good and they kept refilling chips so that's a plus! I tried their special zucchini Sweet Corn Quesadilla- the server said it was spicy but I like spicy so I went with that. Although they were not super busy or crowded it did take a little bit for us to get our food. I tried the quesadilla and it was not spicy BUT scorching(spicy) HOTTTT.. I told our server and she had them make me another one (which was nice) without the peppers.( and without giving any dirty looks)  She failed to tell me the were "fresno red chili peppers" which are among the spiciest they serve in the restaurant -___- Okay well lesson learned. I think it would've been nice if she mentioned that prior but she took care of it and I cant complain. Overall good food and drinks!
