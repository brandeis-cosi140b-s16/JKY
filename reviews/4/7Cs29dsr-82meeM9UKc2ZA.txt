I can't comment on the restaurant because it was closed during my entire five day stay, but on Friday and Saturday nights they turn the restaurant into a nightclub. It was a lot of fun. Mostly Latin music is played, but they do mix in some Pop and Hip-Hop. The drinks were pricey, but it's Vegas so that's to be expected. 

We found a few dance partners and had a great time.
