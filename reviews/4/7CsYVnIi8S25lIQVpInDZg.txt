It's cheap, quick and convenient if you're having the late night munchies after hours of binge drinking. Went here a few times and thought this place was the bomb, but went back once when I was sober and noticed that the food was actually pretty plain and greasy, not to mention the meat is mostly fat and everything has an onion flavor to it. 
But four stars to this place for curing my midnight food rages and for having some sick ass churros.
