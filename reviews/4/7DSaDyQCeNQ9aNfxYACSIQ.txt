Aunt Chilada's, you are like an old best friend.. I may lose touch with you from time to time, but when we meet again, things are the same and you are there to make me happy.

Not a flour chip kinda girl...I dig for the old school chips. 
Your patio is cozy and where I want to be on a beautiful AZ day.
Don't ever change your fun Sunday brunch. 

see you soon!
