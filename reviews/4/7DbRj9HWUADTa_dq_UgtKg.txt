First time today... finally -- i've been wanted to check out, but just have never ventured over. 

Met my friend Jack, of Social Latte, today for our take on "America's Taco Shop". 

I didn't consult the yelp reviews first of what to order, but decided that I may as well try a few tacos since that's the name of the place. I had the Carne Asada taco and the El Pastor taco. Of the two, the El Pastor was (IMO) wow!! I loved the sweet flavor of the pork. The carne asada was definitely alright but not as tasty as the El Pastor - - get that if you like/eat pork. 

Chips and salsa - - $1.50. We did get one friendly refill. 

But... today was one of those perfect weather days in Phoenix, where it's basically required to eat outside. So Jack and I enjoyed some rays out on their patio - - it was awesome! I felt as though I was back in Southern California somewhere. 

Yeah... a bit on the pricey side for a Mexican taco joint. $1.50 for a can of soda.... my total for soda, chips & salsa, and 2 tacos was $8.50. Oh well... I enjoyed it!
