Really good food and fresh Fresco drinks they have a variety of good flavors like watermelon and strawberry. I would suggest eating one of the Quesadillas very fresh great meat and great guacamole. The only downside is the dinning room not the nicest place to eat. Overall great food not coming here for the ambiance but highly suggested.
