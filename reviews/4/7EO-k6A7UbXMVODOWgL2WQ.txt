Chimichanga!
It's fun to say, it's even better to eat and Macayo's has some of the best.

We were out and about and dropped in here on a whim for lunch. The decor is a bit too "touristy-Mexican" for my taste but the place is clean and well maintained. 
 
The service is excellent and everyone is very friendly and the refills kept coming.

I had the chimi sampler plate.  You get a total of six two-bite chimis (2 each - chicken, pulled pork and beef) smothered with cheese, some sour cream on the side and guacamole.  I also had a side of rice. Damn! Those are some tasty chimis - crisp on the outside and oh so good on the inside!  My wife had a chicken chimichanga that came with rice or beans and she said it was also very good.
