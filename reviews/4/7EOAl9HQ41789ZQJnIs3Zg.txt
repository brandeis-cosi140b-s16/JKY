I know this place only has a few reviews but after eating here, I hope that more people will be willing to take a gamble and try it out.  I know I was a bit hesitant seeing as how there aren't many reviews and yet so high but I see why now.  Came here after getting a tire changed at costco after work so by the time they were done, there weren't too man choices.  But this is one that is a gem to try.

Considering the name of the place, I probably should have gone for the tortas.  But I was intrigued by the huaraches and I was so glad I was.  It was yummy!  It looks somewhat like a more oval version of a flatbread but is much better.  The thickness of the corn huarache is b/t a corn tortilla and a sope which I really liked.  They add into the masa (?) what seems like green onions.  It's then layered with beans, the meat, and cheese.  I got the chicharron which is not the fried pork skins you think.  It's shredded pork meat.  Their spicy salsa is good too!
Good fresa (strawberry) agua fresca.

Will certainly be back to try more.  Take a gamble and try this place out! It may not have a lot of reviews but please don't let that one stop you from trying it out.  It's not your typical torta place.
