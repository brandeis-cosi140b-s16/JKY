I had 3 tacos de Carne Asada, rice and beans. I went ham on the tacos, best tacos in Pittsburgh. Reminds me of the tacos back home in Chicago, where I would move back just because of the food. The rice I have to say however, was not so good. Not good at all. I don't even know what to say about the beans, as they taste weird. I don't what to compare them to. From a can? Too watery? Who knows. The restaurant itself is nothing more than a Mexican joint. Which is cool because that is what it is. Though poor rice and beans, I gave this review 4 stars because the tacos were just way too good for you not to try. It's a must. Definitely will be back.
