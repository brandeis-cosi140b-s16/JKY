I've been a fan of Pasqual's burritos for years, and I always hit this place up when I'm back in town.  The chicken half commuter (half a burrito=perfect lunch size!) is my staple, and they're always very good about not putting the beans in it like I ask for.  They recently moved to a new location on Monroe which is smaller than the original, but the space is very well-decorated.  Don't waste your time with the yuppified Hilldale version--the Monroe St location is where it's at!
