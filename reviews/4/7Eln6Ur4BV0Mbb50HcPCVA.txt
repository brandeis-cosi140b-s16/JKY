I'm from Texas, so I'm used to Tex-Mex, and this was a little different, mostly in a good way.

I had a combo to try some different things.
1) Beef taco - fantastic, the taco shell was fresh and the beef was delicious
2) Red beef tamale - the biggest tamale I have ever seen.  Maybe too big, as the beef flavor was lost
3) Bean burrito - fairly plain, beans and some cheese in a tortilla, no sauce or anything.

The rice and beans were good, and the side of guac I got tasted just like I make at home, so I was happy with it.  The margarita was also decent, nothing fancy but tasty and with a salted cup - not frozen junk out of a machine, but freshly made.

Unfortunately the salsa didn't impress me, but I think that is because I'm used to a thicker salsa.  It was runny with some chili seeds that gave a little kick, but not a lot of flavor.

I'd go back though, I think I'd try a chimi or more tacos next time.
