I was wandering around downtown Madison today and ended up here for lunch.  Typical Mexican food outside of LA .... sorry I have been come biased since I have moved to LA years ago.  It gets a star for a lunch menu with most items $6.99.  The food was better than expected for that price.  I was disappointed with the sangria, but I think that might be I am a wine snob and don't like drinks made out of wine - so no deduction for that.
