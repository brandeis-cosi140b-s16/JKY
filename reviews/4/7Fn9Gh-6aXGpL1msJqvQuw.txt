I went there for drinks (from Salt) and I did not eat there, so the 4 stars are only for the drinks. 

We had some cocktails at the bar. They were really good. the copa de fuego was spicy and original (the cardamon is a really nice idea). Good and pleasant crowd drinking there too. Bartenders were friendly. 

I will probably be back for drinks if I am around.
