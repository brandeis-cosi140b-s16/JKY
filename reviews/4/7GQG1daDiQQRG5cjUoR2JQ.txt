My BF loves this place. They are open 24hrs. Always the same quality. Generous portions and friendly service. If you desire to have something prepared different they are happy to do it and it's just as quick. I only gave them 4 stars due to health issues. I've witnessed peeping with nail polish on and pouring cucumbers into a bucket with bracketed dangling in. Cell phones being used in the kitchen too.  Hand washing not following a text. Enough hot sauce and you're probably fine. Lol.
