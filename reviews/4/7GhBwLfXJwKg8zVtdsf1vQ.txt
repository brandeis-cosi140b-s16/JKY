Moreno's certainly deserves its props in Oaktown for being a pretty damn good Mexican restaurant in Tempe. It's great to know that in a city flooded in the market of "berto's" style fast Mexi-food, there are some places that want to show it's customers a little bit more! 

Here are a few tips when eating here:

1. GET THE CHIPS! Seriously, they are fantastic - and they are probable the best chips I've had at a Mexican restaurant.

2. The salsa bar is great, but do yourself a favor and order salsa from the back. It is the best salsa in the whole restaurant guaranteed.

3. Their torta plates are tasty (especially the adovada), filling and cheap! 

4. Make sure you relate yourself with the daily specials, they have some great deals!

If you're by ASU and want some Mexican food, Moreno's is a sure thing.
