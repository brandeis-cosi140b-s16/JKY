Verde = good, quick, close-by & cheap = YAY!!!!
So...We went for breakfast last week and here is the result: green chili pork: Delish!!! Tortillas: Delish!! Eggs: Yuck!! Guacamole: Good!!
The breakfast eggs are the 'fake eggs' - you know the ones that come in a pourable carton...honestly a little disappointing, because 2 sunny-side up eggs wouldve been muy bueno!!
but everything else was on-point so i just wont order eggs again! :)
we also ordered take-out this week: the whole lime-oregano rotisserie chicken it was MUY DELISH!!! This is not your grocery store rotisserie - the flavor was amazing!! the whole fam luved it and devoured it -
Verde will be my new go to when i dont want to cook dinner or when i need a quick lunch!
