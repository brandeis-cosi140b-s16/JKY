This is not the place that got busted for drugs.  That was another location.

However you might think they're putting something not entirely legal in the guacamole.  It's that good.

This is typical Americanized mexican fair but I think better food then the competition nearby.

Ultimately while good the food is forgetable so that's why I docked it one star.

I remember our server being new and really amusing.  Nice kid.
