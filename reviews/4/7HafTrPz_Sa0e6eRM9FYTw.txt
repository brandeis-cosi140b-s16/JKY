So the amazing Jeff from Outsell is with us and KB the largest leprechaun went to this joint cause it's in the triple D tour and I'll tell you what.   Yes Jeff does eventually stop talking about sales.   And the tacos were da bomb.  That's it.  Great atmosphere nice folk and did I mention good tacos.     Here's a pic.  Just go.
