Ah, Pasqual's.  This is THE place where my best girlies and I go for our weeknight, post-school decompression sessions.  Why?  Well, the food is pretty good (fresher ingredients and less greasy than most of the Mexican restaurants in Madison), and the margaritas are dangerously strong and yummy.  The service is fast, and if you order a basket of chips and queso, they'll perfectly tide you over while you wait for your entree to arrive.

The Monroe Street location of Pasqual's also has a great atmosphere (that, in my opinion, is not replicated in the Hilldale location).  Noisy and social, with a nice combination of small, two- or four-person tables and bigger communal tables.  It just feels like a friendly, neighborhood place.  And the din in the main dining room has always been great enough to drown out any loud shrieks of laughter or shock that emanate from my own table as we relive the pleasures and horrors of scholarship at UW.
