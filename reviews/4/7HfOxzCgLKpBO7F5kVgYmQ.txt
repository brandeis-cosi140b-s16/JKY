I've been coming to Los Favoritos for years now.  While there's definitely better Mexican restaurants around the valley, Los Favoritos is my favorite place for Mexican in the east valley.

With Los Favoritos being so close to Chandler High, it's always loud and crazy inside.  The atmosphere is nothing to marvel over but service is always great and the food is decent and nicely portioned.  

I always get the California carne asada burrito combo with a horchata as my beverage of choice.  The beans and the rice is pretty standard fare but the burrito is money:  That warm tortilla, the nicely seasoned carne asada, the melty cheese, and those potatoes... heaven!  It's especially heavenly after a night of guzzling booze [I still come here sober mind you].  While they offer the basic red and green salsa, it's not exactly spicy enough for my taste but I don't mind too much.  Fair warning for those much-caliente-lovers!
