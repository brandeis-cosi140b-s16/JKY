Today 5-5-15 Taco Bell offered a free breakfast biscuit taco for Cinco de Mayo! 
I went this morning and scored one of these bad boys (a $2.59 value!).  Not bad, actually much better than it sounds.  Imagine a warm, flaky, buttery biscuit with fake powdered eggs, sausage, and cheese.  The biscuit is flat and then they put the ingredients in a fold it like a taco.
Restaurants that that have special promotions like this but don't tell you something is free is a pet peeve of mine...I expected to drive up to the drive-thru and hear "Good morning, would you like to try a biscuit taco for free?" but nope...they wanted to keep it a secret I guess. 
Thanks Taco Bell! It was yummy.
