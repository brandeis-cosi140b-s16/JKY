Great food, spot on service and a pleasant atmosphere made this my new favorite Mexican restaurant. Normally my wife and I order Mexican food by the numbers, but decided to branch out this time. My wife ordered the Arroz con Pollo and fell in love. Large portions served hot and fast. I ordered the pork Chili Verde and wil be ordering it again on our next visit. Skillfully prepared and great presentation made Don Pedro's a hit with us. The only reason there aren't 5 stars on this review is that the lights were a tad bright. Trivial I know, but if the lighting had been just a bit softer, this would have been a perfect 5.
