Please would have received a 5 stars if the services was better but the waitress had a little too much attitude and did not correct and error on our meal. Anyways the food is awesome we had the oyster special half a dozen and a medium size shrimp cocktail both Delish my husband had the Asada plate which he said was pretty good beans were awesome but the meat was a little chewy 
We also tried their shrimp tostada and it was good, just have to eat it as soon as it comes in because the tostada gets soggy. Michelada was good overall I think one of the best MARISCOS places I have been too.
