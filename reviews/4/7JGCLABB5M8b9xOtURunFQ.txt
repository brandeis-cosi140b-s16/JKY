For being a 24 hour Mexican restaurant, this place is as good as it gets. There's nothing like a 3 am burrito or huevos rancheros after a long bike ride down mill. The night time crowd will probably consist of late night weirdos (I myself could be included) and the obnoxious children let out of yucca tap room. It also helps that it's basically across the street from where I often reside.I usually get a burrito with random veggie ingredients or a breakfast burrito and a horchata. There's HUGE portions, cheap prices, and their salsa is tasty too. I believe it's usually cooked to order and they are happy to deal with my picky, custom order. This definitely is gluttonous though so don't expect to feel sexy after eating.
