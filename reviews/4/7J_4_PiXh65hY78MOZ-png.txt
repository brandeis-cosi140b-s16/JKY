I was actually pleasantly surprised... moving here from AZ, I was leary about trying out a Mexican restaurant but it did meet my needs. The guac made at the tableside I highly recommend. I went with the fajitas and they did not disappoint. Large amount of food as well so I had plenty to take home for leftovers. Food went nicely with an ice cold Dos Equis amber on tap!
