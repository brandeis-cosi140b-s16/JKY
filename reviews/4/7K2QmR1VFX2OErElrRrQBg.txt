I've been here a couple of times with the most recent time being a month ago. The food is good and the lunch specials are great and economical. Complimentary chips and salsa while you wait for your order is also a plus. 

Some folks don't like the fact that the building is an old temple themed building, but personally I like it. I like the fact that it's the original Macayo's building from the 60's, but maybe I'm more of a purist. Would I prefer for it to be torn down and have a modern establishment with touch screen ordering and wi-fi and all that other technology? No. But that's just me. 

The staff is friendly and courteous, this is also a plus. It's preferable over rude or neutral tempered staff right? The waiter held a conversation with us concerning Obama's visit to Macayo's.

For the "Mex & Match" lunch special I ordered a cheese enchilada and chile relleno with a side of beans. The enchilada was very good and even the beans were very good, as simple as beans are. My only issue was the chile relleno. It didn't have much of a chile flavor to it, kinda bland. It tasted more like the sauce it was topped with. But don't hold this against Macayo's. These type of chile's spiciness and flavor are very random. I know this from my experience with eating them. One can be very flavorful and spicy and the next one can be bland. So, I'm not gonna hold that bland chile against Macayo's. 

If your wondering about price, I spent about $11.00 for this meal including the drink. My only issue with the service was the same waiter who conversed with us about Obama's visit, asked for a tip at the begging when he introduced himself. It sounded rehearsed and something to the effect of: "Hi my name is so-and-so, I am your waiter today, a small tip would be appreciated...etc." I don't like that. I was planning to leave a tip, and I'm sure most people leave one, so asking for a tip to me almost sounds like begging. Other than that, no problems. 

I plan future trips.
