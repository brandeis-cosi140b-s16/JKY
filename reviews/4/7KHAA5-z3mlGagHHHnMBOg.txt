It's a late dinner for us, not really heading to any place in particular, came across Wahoo's and  decided to try it.  When we walked in, the place was deserted, thought there must be something going on, but it certainly wasn't here.

At first it was a little confusing, trying to figure out the menu, but my husband and I finally ordred and went and sat down. You can choose your own meat, style of taco and sides.  There is a kids menu and there is a bar located around the back of the dinning area, that we discovered after hitting the head.  (found out that's where all the people are).   I was busy reading all of the graffiti and stickers plastered all over the place.  

I got the Kahuna Grande, that's a taco, and three taquito's, black beans and seasoned rice.  (you can choose differently if you don't want what I got).  The food was fresh, the rice was seasoned very well.  I got guacamole and sour cream on the side, and that made the taquito's.
