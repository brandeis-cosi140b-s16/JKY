Garcia's has been part of the Valley for decades.  It always brings back good family memories.  The food doesn't disappoint.  I am so glad the moved in this area.  This was their first week, they had a few opening glitches but they overcame.  Good basic Mexican cuisine.  This location is small, so check the wait time.
