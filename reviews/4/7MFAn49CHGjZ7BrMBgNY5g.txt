I really liked the atmosphere in this place, plus they had a great football game while we ate, but the overall burger experience was ok. It was like a mexican version of smash burger. Long wait time, GREAT smell. I would have liked more smokey flavor in the actual burger, but all in all it was really good. Oh, and I recommend a crap load of napkins because it's ridiculously messy.
