Walking along the strip of Vegas, hot as hell..we came around to Diablo's..somewhat of a long line, but I needed a drink badly..I ordered a Pina Colada Margarita in the souvenier cups..16 bucks.. it was pretty strong.. but good...they had other flavors such as strawberry, coconut, and I believe Mango.. maybe I'll try one of those the next time I'm there..
