I'm deeming this an oldie but goodie. If you've been a frequenter of Phoenix for over 15+ years, you've most likely paid at least one of Macayo's locations a visit. The food is run of the mill yet decent Mexican food. The portions are hearty and the food is cheap. The margaritas are above average and if you invest of one of their margarita glasses, you can get margarita refills moving forward for just $3. Not a bad deal as long as you remember the glass! 

Macayo's is a solid choice if you're hungry and want to get in and out in a relatively decent amount of time, if you have children who are a little loud and yet you want to take them out to dinner, or if you just feel like a good margarita after a long day at work. 

That's it!
