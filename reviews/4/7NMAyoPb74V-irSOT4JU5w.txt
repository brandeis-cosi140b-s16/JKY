Not many bad things to say- chips weren't hot and needed a little salt but main dish was amazing.You have the choice of whole wheat or white flour, crunchy, or low carb tortillas. I got one pacos taco (beef brisket, queso fresco, cabbage, caramelized onions & cilantro) and a turkey club carnitas taco (shredded turkey, avocado, lettuce, jalapeno bacon, tomato, avocado ranch )both on whole wheat tortillas- the turkey was UNbelievable. Came with choice of charro beans (pintos cooked with brisket and bacon), black, or refried and a side of rice and slaw. Pretty big crowd for a Tuesday night, would recommend getting there before 6 on a weekday, and earlier on a weekend.
