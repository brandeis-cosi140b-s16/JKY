I was super excited to try this place over the weekend and was not disappointed!

For those who say this place is overpriced, I say Vegas, in general, is overpriced.  I didn't come here looking for a cheap taco since I can get that at any food truck on any corner at home; I came here to experience a Jose Andres creation and I'm glad I did!

The bf and I shared a few things:

Barbacoa de Res taco - bbq beef with chili and cactus - YUM!
Pancita al Pastor taco - slow cooked pork belly with pineapple - My Fave!!!
Refried Bean taco - black beans with chipotle salsa and queso fresco (probably the BEST refried beans I have ever had - totally unexpected!)
Queso Fundido with chorizo - served with tortillas and really good.  It's not as greasy as some of the queso i've had before (Tres Agaves), so that's a huge plus!
Dan Dan Mian - wheat noodles with a spicy ground pork sauce - super good, a little sweet.

It sounds like a lot, but the tacos are pretty small and we didn't eat all the queso, though it was so good, I feel like I could have.

A highlight to the experience was Chef Andres, himself, in the restaurant.  I was tempted to ask for a picture with him, but refrained as he looked pretty busy with his staff.

All in all a good experience - I will definitely be back!
