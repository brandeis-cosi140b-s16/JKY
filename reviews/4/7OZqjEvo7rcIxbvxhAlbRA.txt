This place is definitely solid and I make it a point to eat here whenever I'm in town. If you are looking for more traditional Mexican dishes, I would go somewhere else because Monterrey serves up the standard Tex-Mex favorites. Their margaritas are pretty tasty and you can get a super extra large one if you're really thirsty! Aside from that, the food is good and, more importantly, cheap...I always go for a quesadilla of some sort and I'd strongly recommend getting some queso for pre-dinner chip snacking!
