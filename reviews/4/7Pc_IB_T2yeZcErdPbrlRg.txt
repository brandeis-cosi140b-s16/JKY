I've never been super impressed with the random Mexican food I have had in Vegas overall (which seems odd to me), but I rather enjoyed Javier's. It is located at Aria at the City Center (Centre?) complex on the Strip. The Dia de los Muertos theme and tequila tree are pretty fun. Start with a delicious cocktail at the bar before heading into dinner. There's a great array of unexpected dishes as well as the usual suspects. Everything was incredibly fresh and was well seasoned and spiced. I certainly felt like it was a really great value.
