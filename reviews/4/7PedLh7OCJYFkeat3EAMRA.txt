I was craving Tacos El Gordo's fried intestine tacos but, since I was in "butt F Egypt" aka HELLA FAR...my friend took me to his fave Mexican spot.

They didn't have the fried intestine tacos but, they did have beef tongue tacos. Which are a disgusting BUT-OH-SO-DELICIOUS 2nd best choice! Meat was pretty juicy.

And I'm not big on guacamole but, they surely make it a show but making it at your table. Fresh guac/anything over boring salsa!
