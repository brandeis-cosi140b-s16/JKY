A regular burger that tasted not like cafeteria food but Great.
It had the usual suspects on it, nothing fancy to trick you into thinking it was special. No special sauces. 
My friend and I both got the 1/2lb (double patty) and added cheese and bacon. The burger meat was damn flavorful on its own and the bacon was thick and crispy. The onion rings were super flavorful too. I'll hit this place up again when passing through. I have to imagine the catfish is great too.
