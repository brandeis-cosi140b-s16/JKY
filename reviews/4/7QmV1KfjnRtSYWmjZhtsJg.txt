Since I don't live in Vegas we really didn't know where to eat cause there are just 1 too many options for when 1 is hungry and dying so we decided to stop in here. The service was good, the food was yummy, they're house salsa was delicious! I had the Gaucho steak salad which was really good! My only complaint would have to be that I liked the salad after I doctored it up with guacamole vs just the slices of avocado on top. If I'm ever in Vegas again I wouldn't mind dropping in for a bite.
