Not sure how they do it, but somehow I always get swept into drinking margaritas at their happy hour here.  I should add, this place has an awesome happy hour!  Don't make the mistake of ordering a bunch of appetizers thinking they will be small because they are so cheap during happy hour, as all of the appetizers are huge!  I went here with a gal pal of mine for the first time during happy hour and we ended up with a whole table of food because we ordered 3 appetizers...We were eating Mexican for the next 3 days!  
I have never been on the restaurant side, but the bar is great and the service is generally outstanding (had bad service only once).  There are a lot of regulars that go to this place making it always fairly packed.  If you want a quiet Mexican restaurant this is not it.  Parking can be a pain in the booty because the lot is generally full.  There are some lots near it and to my knowledge I have not seen anyone towed.
