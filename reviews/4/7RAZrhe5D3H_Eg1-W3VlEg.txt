After having to move a block south last year due to the Light rail expansion, Big Burrito is now in the shopping center at 19th Ave & Northern, on the northwest corner next to Sprouts. 

This is our go-to breakfast burrito place on the weekends. I can get my Starbucks across the street while Nick runs over to pick up our burritos that we've already called in. 

We get the same thing everytime..I know how boring...but the egg, potato, bacon, and cheese burrito is just so damn tasty. Their green and red sauces are standard, but good. One burrito could easily be shared between two people, or maybe 2 women. I can never finish mine, but that's what I have Nico for. 

I stopped by last night and picked up a bean and cheese burrito and a cheese crisp. I love that fact that they grill the burrito for a minute after the wrap it up. The cheese crisp was not very crispy and was almost a little soggy by the time I got home. 

All in all, this is a great little neighborhood shop with friendly service and reasonable prices. 
If you live in this area, you should give them a try!
