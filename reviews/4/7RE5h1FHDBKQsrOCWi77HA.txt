The hole-in-the-wall restaurants that I frequent would think this place is small and dirty. That being said, their enchilada sauce has a nuttiness that takes work. And it must have been a labor of love cause the green burro enchilada style is definitely made with love. 

They aren't set up for a lot of people so if your party is more than 4 people, you don't like weird smells, or don't enjoy Mexican television then plan on taking it to go.
