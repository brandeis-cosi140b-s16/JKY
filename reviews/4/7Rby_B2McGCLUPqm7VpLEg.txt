This place was delicious! We have been looking for an awesome taco place near Centennial Hills, but all we could find was Roberto's. Thanks to yelp, we found El Regio.  We ordered the taco plate, carne asada fries, and the abodaba plate. Everything was yummy. We ate there and the place was clean. I asked for a water cup but they gave me bottled water instead. We will definitely come back.
