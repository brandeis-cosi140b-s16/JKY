Chipotle is chipotle, right? This is pretty much the closest "fast food" that I'm willing to eat near home...which means we frequent this establishment.  It gets busy on occasion, but the employees are nice and friendly.  If anything, I'd say that they are generous with their portions, when compared to other Chipotles.  Even with a line, you are usually in and out the door within 5 minutes.  If you need coffee/sweats, you can pop in the Starbucks next door or the Chompies across the parking lot!
