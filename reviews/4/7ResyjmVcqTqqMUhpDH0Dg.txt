Very good spot for being so far back in Ahwatukee.  It's very casual but has a good beer selection and although the Mexican food is hit and miss, their wings are really good and Taco Tuesday is a big hit.  It's a good place to socialize with locals or go alone and read a book.  The longtime staff is also very friendly.  I recommend.
