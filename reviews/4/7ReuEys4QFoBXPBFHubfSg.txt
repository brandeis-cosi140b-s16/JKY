This used to be a Chuy's that I frequented all the time. When the giant immigration bust came down I was terrified that I would lose my fried fish taco source. luckily, the long time bartender and her daughter purchased it and took it over. The menu pretty much remains the same and I would say the food quality is slightly better than before. What are the positives of the new ownership is they did away with those disgusting dirty stuffed animals they would give you to mark your order. In fact, the restaurant is a lot cleaner now than it used to be. This is nothing fancy--it's just a little local place. Everyone is very friendly and it gets kinda crowded on the weekends and during happy hour. Great place to sit outside on the patio with your dog as it is dog friendly. The free chips and salsa are definitely a draw and they always have decent food specials going on. That being said, I still don't understand why it's cheaper during happy hour to buy two small pitchers than it is a large pitcher (free tip). Otherwise if you're looking for a cool place to hang out, casual good food, good place to meet friends for drinks this is it. If you're just feeling the love / need for some great fish tacos on a Friday night call in an order to go. They do great to go boxes and even give you containers to take chips and salsa with you.
