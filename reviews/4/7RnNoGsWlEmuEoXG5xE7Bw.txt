We ate here mostly because we were staying in the hotel and it was convenient and our breakfast was free. The first day I ordered the huevos rancheros which was AMAZING. They delivered me this warm, bubbling skillet, coated in melty cheese with fluffy eggs over corn tortillas. I gobbled up every bite and later, ordered a burrito poolside which they DELIVERED. During our stay we also had the guacamole, pancakes and vegetable tacos. The tacos were a little flavorless on their own, but they have this incredible salsa verde they serve on the side. I seriously wanted to bottle that and bring it home.
