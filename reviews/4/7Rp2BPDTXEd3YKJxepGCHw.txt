Last night's quick dinner at Mexico City was a nice surprise.  I live nearby and was concerned that it is never really busy during normal dinner hours.   I was raining so I went in.  There is a lot to choosee from and all seems fairly authentic.   I opted for the vegetable soup and some tacquitos dorados.   Both were excellent.  Thesoup was rich and homey.   The fried tacquitos were stuffed with lamb and deliscious.   I was still thinking about them today!  I will definately return without hesitation.   Oh yeah and our waitress was excellent!
