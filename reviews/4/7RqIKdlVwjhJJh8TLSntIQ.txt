Their food is delicious!!  We have never had Korean/Mexican fusion before.  We are so happy we tried this place out.  We ordered bulgogi fries, bulgogi nachos, bulgogi sliders, and fusion burrito.  The portions are HUGE.  Next time, we will just share an entree.  The prices are very good for what you get.  The staff is super friendly.  We will definitely be back for more.
