I normally wouldn't take the time to rate a Taco Bell, but I was so impressed with the kid in the drive-thru that I'm making an exception.

After hours upon hours of Xmas shopping until I literally dropped, I was tiRED, agitated and hungry. After shopping at Anthem Outlet mall, we ran by here for a quickie bite.  The kid (teenager) at the pick-up window had such a cheerful, friendly disposition that it turned my frown upside down!  Happy, smiling, friendly, jubilant... (cue REM's Shiny, Happy People Holding Hands...) So rare to see in many of the kids working in the service industry these days. Wish I'd gotten his name, because I'd certainly drop it.  Thanks joyous Taco Bell teen! Oh, and they got my order right too (black bean burrito, no cheese).
