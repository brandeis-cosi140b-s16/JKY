I have been to two Americas taco shops and both were good but this location was a little better. They also have the yelp check I. For free chips which is awesome. I love the chips they remind me if the chips from Taco del Mar. The bean burrito is good. The tacos seem to vary depending on how long the meat is cooked. Defiantly a place to check out if you like Mexican food in the style of chipotle or taco del mar.
