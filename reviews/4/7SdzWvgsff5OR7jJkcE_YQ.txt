Perfect place to replenish your sun-weary body after a day by the pool. We were provided immediately with chips and a trio of delicious salsas. The house margaritas were not too weak, nor too sweet, and one pitcher ($45) refilled four of us at least once before we ordered another round. Everything that arrived at our table was positively scrumptious- as evidenced by a table-full of plates scraped clean by the meal's end. Before our respective dinners were heartily demolished, they were: fish tacos, shrimp tacos, and veggie burritos adorned with perfectly soft avocado slices. 

I would comment on the added delight of the world's best people-watching, especially as more and more patrons cycled in from Rehab throughout the evening, but this is not an honor exclusively reserved for Pink Taco. Acting surprised that any Vegas establishment contains unusual and noteworthy strangers is about as redundant as commenting on the number of Red Sox hats on Yawkey Way. 

We also went here for breakfast and sat at the poolside patio to avoid the aggressively chilly AC. The service was a bit slow the second time, but we were still provided with a way to treat our bodies to generous helpings of tasty food before starting to drink in the daytime. Also, the parfait was completely on point.
