Was searching for breakfast burritos late one morning - just driving around and stumbled into this place - whoever was working (the owner?) made me feel right at home and fixed me up some of the BEST breakfast burritos I've ever had. Things were as big as my forearm! Friendly, delicious and some great creamy habanero sauce... I'll be back every time I'm in Vegas...
