Poblano is a great place to eat.  There plating is beautiful and the food is great.  We have gone back many times and really have enjoyed it every time.  They have fresh lemonade with cucumbers, it is so refreshing.  My husband loves it so much that he keeps going back. 
The restaurant is very clean and has great atmosphere.  I'm going again today.  See you soon!
