Super Authentic and Delicious food along with a chill and friendly staff. The Mojarra with Garlic had thicks chunks of pure white fish that  was perfect for making fish tacos. They even provided me with extra tortillas which appear to be handmade in the restauraunt. They were awesome. Got a free triple scoop of strawberry ice cream with toppings for checking in!
