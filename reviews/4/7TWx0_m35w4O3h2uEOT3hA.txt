Usually busy since it's inside the Mandalay Bay and there are conventions going on, but you can probably swing a seat at the bar during lunchtime without reservations.  The food is good! Try the huevos rancheros.  The waiter and chef were also very accommodating, when what I ordered wasn't available they specially made me the huevos rancheros for dinner! I'd had them the day before at lunch and wanted them again.  :)
