Stopped in for a bite to eat. 
New to the area, thought this place was a newer spot, but after reading a few reviews -Seems like this is a struggling strip mall with lots of vacant shops, etc. However, my experience was a little better than others I guess?
Ordered a chicken tostada $3.99. Offer a few different options of meat. I got the Chicken. Tostada was a good size for the price, topped with refried  beans, meat, shredded lettuce & cheese. 
Salsa bar has 3 different types. Smoked chili mole' ( dark salsa) is the best one with a touch of heat. Also have a mild red (watery/bland) & a green salsa. Hot carrots: way to many small red chilies in it , guess they use those in the marinating process, but should leave those out when presenting/ serving at the station. Fresh sliced chilled cumbers as well.
Store was clean, service was good (considering it wasn't busy), but I don't think I would go through the drive thru based on my fellow Yelpers  advise!
Generally, ALL Filiberto's have coupon specials-if you didn't bring one with you; ask if you don't receive one "after" your initial purchase. You can take advantage of the coupon(s) on your next visit. *Blue small flier you can post on your frig offering weekly deals. Don't forget to go to ANY of these location for those offers & on TACO TUESDAY $1.19 for any meat styled taco!
SOME SITES propose .50 off when you check in with Yelp!
