I've been eating at this same Filiberto's for over 10 years. It's always fast, always delicious, and always cheap. It's the perfect late night drunk food or something quick and high quality than Taco Bell in the middle of the day. 
I always get three rolled tacos with cheese and sour creme with a side 1/2 pint of "Mexican-style" rice. Since last time I've been here - a few years - their oil changed and it tastes a little different but was still awesome.
