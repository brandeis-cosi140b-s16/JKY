Great food + Great Atmosphere = Great Experience

My business colleague (who grew up in Scottsdale and went to college nearby at ASU) took me to this place when I visited Scottsdale for the first time.  I asked him to take me to a place unique to Scottsdale, and he brought me here.

We sat outside on a beautiful evening.  Temperature was perfect and the restaurant had a great overall "vibe."

The food was really, really good.  I had the crab stuffed chiles (i forgot the name, but you can figure it out), which were the best I've ever had.  The chiles were deep fried and had this wonderful sauce on it.  A great dish.

they also have a unique prickly pear margarita (i'm not sure if it's unique to the restaurant or unique to the area) which tastes kind of like guava.

I'll definitely be coming back to this place!
