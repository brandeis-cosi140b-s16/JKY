Ok, don't know where to start...the place is nice. Paintings, decorations, comfortable chairs, high ceilings, huge building hard to miss...big sign advertising happy hour! So I had to stop. We asked for chips and salsa because even though is complimentary is only served to those who ask.
We also asked about the happy hour specials and were told that it's only happy hour at the bars, not the main dining room. Ok, I'm already feeling stupid paying full price when the person 3 feet away is in a different price zone. But I'm already seating here eating the chips. Didn't seem right to move and start a new bowl of chips somewhere else. I'm not going to upset the waiter, I'll just be upset myself!
Ok back to the main dish! This is not. let me repeat...this is not, your regular Mexican food. everything is made with a different twist. Even though we wanted Mexican food we ended up eating Nouvelle Mexique Cuisin al France. Nonetheless the food was good and so were the margaritas. Service? Was very good even tough they should have warned me I was sitting in the "you'r going to pay more than anyone else, while happy people look at you." area.
Check please! Or should I say... L'addition S'il vous plait? Little too pricey for Mexican food....unless, YOU'R SITTING IN A HAPPY AREA!
