$50 Aria resort credit well spent on 3 mean margaritas! 

We randomly stumbled in to this place because my girlfriend and her sister were attracted to the restaurant's ambiance and decor. The wide, dark-lit restaurant with the large rounded bar area overlooks the casino area. Even though this place looks all classy and flashy, I don't think I would come here for the food because I've been spoiled with all the great hole-in-the-wall spots in LA and San Diego. Plus, it's also about 4-5 times more expensive than the tacos/burritos I get at Alberto's. We did try the quesadilla though just to snack on, which was very good.

I would definitely come back for the margaritas! I don't drink a lot of margaritas but the ones they serve here are probably the best I've ever had. I like the concoction of the Pepito Cucumber margarita. Top shelf tequila with bits of cucumber mixed in, delish! I also like the Jalapeno margarita.. not spicy but has that kick and flare brought by the jalapeno. Just the drinks with chips and salsa was definitely a good recipe for a start of a good night!
