I've driven by this place countless times and finally went in for dinner and was not disappointed at all.  The salsa was super tasty and the food was delicious.  We were eating late around 9:30pm and the rice was still super fresh (a good indicator they're not scraping the bottom of the pan and still keeping the kitchen at full throttle) as well as the rest of our meal. 

It looks like a little house from the outside but is pretty big on the inside.  The service was excellent and this will probably be our neighborhood go-to mexican restaurant from now on.
