I love La Parilla Suiza. It's a Mexican City type thrown down!!!

I haven't been to their other locations in Phoenix only this one but I continue to be blown away by their level of hospitality and the taste and diversity of their food. This was a favorite lunch spot of mine when I live in Phoenix and I make it a point to visit each time I swing by town. 

Some of my favorites:

Queso Suizo---plainly put...Melted gooey cheese with torillas. A great start! It does take some time to make so be patient...It's sooooo worth it!

Chicken Enchiladas Suiza with their green sauce-YUM. I have attempted to order this at other joints only to be sorely disappointed that it it didn't have the tangy-ness of this plate. It's seriously heavenly good!

Bistek Tacos-The meat is flavorful and perfectly cooked. Its the type of beef that's marinated and cooked to perfection that you don't need any sauces or condiments to hide the taste. It's melt in your mouth bomb diggity.  Simplicity on a plate. 

Chips and a variety of salsas are always on the table...sip on a margarita and you're in the good. 

And order the flan....WOW!

I'm sure anything else your order there is good and I would put my stamp of approval on it any day. But, sometimes I can be a creature of habit and order my go-to dishes.

The service is always top notch. They have always been hospitable and efficient, even if your running off a lunch hour. 

Go! Go! Go!
