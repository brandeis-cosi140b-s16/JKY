The service was excellent here, very attentive staff that was very courteous. This made the dining experience good however the food is why this place failed to get a 5th star from me. Aside from the technical flaws of placing lettuce there burritos which just ends up limp and soggy there was bean dip that had no flavor, just blended up beans and the chips were cold and had no salt. Also they have no happy hour which makes no sense in the area its in. Overall this place is good and should do well but it needs to work out the flaws, I  will eat here again in a few months and see if they have earned there 5th star
