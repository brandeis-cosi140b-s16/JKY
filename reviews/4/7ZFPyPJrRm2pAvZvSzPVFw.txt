Decent food and decent service. Although the manager who brought our cheese dip out failed to realize we didn't have drinks nor chips. He said "here's your cheese dip, enjoy". I had to say, as he was walking off, could we get some chips please. They have a robust menu with a large selection of grilled items. The outdoor patio with waterfall wall is really relaxing. I would eat here again. Still searching for my hole-in-the-wall Mexican place in Matthews though.
