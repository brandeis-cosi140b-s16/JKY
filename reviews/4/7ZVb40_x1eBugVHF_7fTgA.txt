Tried Mikey's II for the first time while driving through old town Buckeye. I got their Mikey's Burrito that had carne asada, avocado, potatoes, grilled onions, Jalepenos, tomatoes, sour cream and it was the best I've ever eaten... For real! Lol. Plus, I'm not a green chili salsa type of gal, but after trying their green chili salsa I can officially say that it will be my go to hot sauce when going there. It's sooo good! The red chili salsa was Delish too. 

The staff is very polite and the prices are reasonable for the portion size... Our burritos were huge and it was about $5.75. I actually had to save some of it for later! I live in Goodyear, so I will definitely make the drive for my burrito fix. 

One negative is that the place is very small. It was lunch when we went but we actually did have plenty of room to sit, however, not sure how the crowd is later in the day since its a small town. They do have a drive thru as well. I highly recommend.
