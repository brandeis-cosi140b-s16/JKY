Very festive feel and great food. I normally get the chimis with their poblano sauce; so good. This was recommended to us our first time there, and we never seem to order anything else! The margaritas are a hit and the ambiance at night in the outdoor patio feels authentic; great place if you love Mexican food. We go back frequently and have never had a bad experience.
