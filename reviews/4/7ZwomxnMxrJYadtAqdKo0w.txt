This place is getting a lot of crappy reviews, but I've never had a bad experience here. Yes, I've occasionally had some interesting waitstaff experiences (nothing drastic), but the food is good, the drinks are good, and the decor is really cool. Per some of the other reviews, they might need to get more organized there (if you're not getting waited on, ask someone to help you!), but in my expericence, it's not bad. Not the absolute best Mexican food I've ever had, but I've had some really good meals here.
