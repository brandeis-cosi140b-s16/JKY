Four stars for the win, El Toro.  At last, a place where I can watch the Pumas, eat some decent food, joke in Spanish, and even have fried ice cream if I'm playing gringo tourist.  I like it.  And I don't mind taking midwestern friends here.  It makes me look 'edgy' cuando yo hablo en espanol con la gente. ;)

Also, the alambres were fantastic.
