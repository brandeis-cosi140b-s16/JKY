Came with a friend who LOVES Mexican food and we had a Restaurant.com code so it was an extra bonus. We shared an appetizer and a dessert and each got an entree. My friend was very happy with her happy hour margaritas. The portions were pretty big too so we both had leftovers. Our server was fast, friendly, and pretty funny too. The prices weren't too ridiculous and considering the amount of food we had coupled with the awesome discount we got from the coupon, we were pretty happy with what we got. The food was pretty good... Not fantastic but still better than a bunch of places I've been to recently. I'd come back.
