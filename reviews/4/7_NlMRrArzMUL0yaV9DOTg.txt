We ate here for a taste of some good Mexican food and we werent disappointed. The restaurant is located in the MGM hotel and it was a bit difficult to find.  The decor is cool, especially the bathrooms. The salsa chips we munched on before our meal were fresh and tasty with the sides of guacamole, salsa and something else. We all ordered the soft tacos that came on a huge plate with your choice of meat, vegetables, beans and rice for $20. There were three of us and we all had to share a pot of the bread wraps, however it was more than enough because we were all satisfyingly fulfilled.  I was surprised they didnt have a big cocktail selection considering there was a huge bar in the front. I would return.
