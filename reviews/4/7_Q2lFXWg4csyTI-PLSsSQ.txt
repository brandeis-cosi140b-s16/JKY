Pleasantly surprised by the sports bar atmosphere and the Enchilada Chicken Nachos-it's hard to pick which to try given the extensive menu, but you probably can't go wrong. Would advise against ordering them for takeout though.

Weird communication issues when picking up my order, combined with an odd choice of takeout packaging- chips, cheese, and protein are boxed in cardboard similar to pizza carryout. Additional toppings are packed separately in Styrofoam and plastic cups. Initially I was put off by this but it grew on me- could add the sour cream, guac, and beans to my preferred level. Portion did not seem adversely affected by the box used.

Flavors though? Tasty. Chicken and encihlada sauce was well seasoned but not spicy, large rings of jalapenos made it easy to eat around them if you want, portion was large enough to share- maybe add on some tacos and this is easily dinner for two. 

Bonus star for having queso on the menu- one of the few places in town to do so, and one of the major things I miss from home! .
