I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it right now. I'm going to review Chipotle. Are you wondering why I'm reviewing a spot that is practically common knowledge to most people out there? Well, I figured that there's got to be just one person who looks on Yelp and who doesn't know about Chipotle. So for that one person, here is my review. 

Once you've seen one Chipotle, you've seen them all. Similar to most chains out there, each Chipotle mirrors the next. It's the same food, the same service and the same experience. In Chipotle's case, this is a good thing because I know what I'm getting when I step through those doors. Chipotle kept me fed in college and it continues to feed me when I'm on the go and need some food quickly. It's a couple steps above drive-through and the ingredients are always fresh. You can even go healthy (kind of ) if you scratch the tortillas, avoid the sour cream and chips and focus on the proteins and veggies. 

Now for the one person out there who has never had Chipotle, the system is "cafeteria-style" where you first choose the type of meal (burrito, bowl or tacos), then you go down the line and pick your meat and toppings. It's pretty basic. I'm kind of the Chipotle weirdo of the bunch because I'm not a fan of their burritos. They are the size of a mini van and just too much for me. I'm also not a fan of the beans and rice at Chipotle. Like I said, I'm a weirdo. I typically opt for either the soft tacos or the bowl and choose chicken, add peppers/onions, add the pico and medium salsa, corn, lettuce and I can't keep myself from adding guacamole. 

I suggest Chipotle when you're feeling lazy, you're hungry and you want some solid and decent. You won't get mind blowing, but you'll leave full and satisfied. *** You'll also be need of a mint or gum stat.
