When visiting Chipotle, I get always get the salad.  With beans, rice, and the other fixins' that go on a burrito, it is the better choice.  Service is very fast, the ingredients are fresh and look tasty.  This restaurant is a definitely plus especially when I am beyond hungry because I can get a good meal, fast!  When I order in, there is no problem.  I don't recommend the online ordering process as I had a bad experience with another locations.
