I eat here quite often.  It isn't great Mexican food, but it is pretty good and the best in the neighborhood.

One plate I would like to recommend is El combo.  It comes with a LOT of food.  I usually only eat half and save the other half for lunch the next day.  It all comes with beef but you can sub chicken for any item at a cost of $0.25.  The hard taco and the Chalupa are best eaten that night.  The chili rellano could have more pepper in it.  

The margaritas are hit or miss.  Sometimes they will be strong and sometimes they will be a little weak.  On Mondays medium margaritas are $5.50 and they are pretty good sized.  I think on Thursdays they have beer on special.  

If it is your birthday, they let you wear a sombrero and give you a fried flour tortilla with a whip cream smiley face on it.  It may come with some syrup and a cherry too.  You do not get to keep the hat like I thought, they will chase you down and ask for it back.
