Been almost a year now and have had great experiences and have a few friends that stop by regularly. Appetizers have been consistent the entire time. Prime Rib has been consistently good. Drinks have always been cold. 

Service for us is always great, we almost always sit at the bar n the ENTIRE staff are great.

1st Time here i would suggest.
Happy Hour 
Margaritas or Kiltlifter LARGE
Alambre Camarones
Pork Carnitas
Mexican Shrimp Cocktail (The Acapulco is also very good)

Enjoy and say hi if u see me n the wife there. !!
