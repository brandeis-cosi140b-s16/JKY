Stumbled into this place for a impromptu girls night out and was very pleased!!!

Total VIP treatment, since we were the only customers. The staff was very helpful and hilarious! This place is very similar up Salsarita's, Moe's and of course my personal favorite Chipotle. 

It either bowl, burrito, tacos or salad with your choice of meat and toppings. Tons of meat options here: beef, chicken, steak, veggie ad even fish! 

I got the special which was the Philly Cheesesteak...WHAT?!? Yes please! It came loaded with queso and steak over rice (white or brown) and I added lettuce, cheese, corn salsa, and sour cream (no extra charge for sour cream here!) And bonus alert....on Thursdays you get a drink for free! Whoo Hooo! 

The bowl was absolutely delicious! Very tender steak...loved the queso and just the creative combination of flavors. It was all very fresh and tasty! Add chips for $1 and you have a great meal. It's definitely worth a visit!
