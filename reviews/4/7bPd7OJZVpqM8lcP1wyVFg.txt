I ate here for dinner last night, and again for lunch today. I'd go back for dinner tonight, but it's 4:30pm, and I'm STILL FULL FROM LUNCH.

For dinner, I had a combination with black beans, jerk fried rice, jade red chicken, and machaca. One of the best $8 dinners I've ever had. The machaca was tender and flavorful. The jade red chicken was not overly sweet, but had a tangy flavor that I really liked. The cashier who gave me samples said that it was like a sweet-and-sour, but I think it was a little closer to an orange or General Tso's chicken. I've never had jerk fried rice before, but I definitely approve.

For lunch today, I had another combo. This time it was a jerk chicken quesadilla, emerald chicken, plain fried rice, and black beans. Jerk. Chicken. Quesadilla. You heard me. Jerk. Chicken. Quesadilla.

The jerk chicken has a subtle heat that slowly builds as you eat it. It won't scorch your lips, but it'll make you feel loved on the inside.

Bonuses: 
- free cookies. Who doesn't like a cookie?
- free wifi. Nuff said.
- incredibly friendly staff who don't mind explaining their menu to n00bs like me.
- samples!

My only regret is that I have to leave town tomorrow, and I don't think I could eat another bite tonight. It's truly one of the most unique restaurant concepts I've ever tried, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm hoping I'll get another job assignment in the area so that I can try a machaca/black bean/jerk fried rice burrito.

My advice: go eat here before the southern conservatives shut it down because they hate "mixing".
