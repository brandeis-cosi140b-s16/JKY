I only had drinks in the bar, Mateo's I believe it's called. The bartender, "Captain" Ron was very friendly and made a great margarita....Like I'm sure most bartenders in Phoenix. Chatted with a couple cool ladies sitting at the bar who lived in the area, they said they are regulars and love the place. I will be back to try the food very soon.
