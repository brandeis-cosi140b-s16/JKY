Man I love this chicken. Their menu is not huge but man is the chicken good. They marinate the chicken and then grill it. I comes out and is red but that is due to the marinade. It is very tasty and juice. I order the 2 piece chicken plate which comes with beans, salsa, 2 tortillas, chicken and marinated onion. Mmmm so good. I have had the carne asada too before but it was a little dry for me but also had great flavor
This is a CASH only place, so stop before going.
