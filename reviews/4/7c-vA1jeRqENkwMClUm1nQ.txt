A lot like Tijuana Flats, but much better. Very fresh and fast. The meats are all well seasoned and tender, the Pico comes in regular, medium and spicy- mix them for a great flavor on your burrito bowl or taco salad.
They do a good take out business, but there's adequate seating.
Now, when we came before they had beer, but this trip none, and there's still an issue getting their margarita bar going.
