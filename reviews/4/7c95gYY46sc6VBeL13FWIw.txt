I Cant believe i had not written a review. Been here plenty of times. Always consistent flavor and service.   Don't expect anything fancy. This is a diner like what you would find in Mexico; home cooked style food. I usually like to get their guisados and burros. They are $2.50 by the way(meaning you could try 2) and they are not your filibertos size, so be warned. My favorite is the Chile Pasado(such a savory flavor) and trust me its not spicy. Also i like to go for the Barbacoa and Asado. I have had their breakfast as well and doesn't disappoint.  Prices are very fair and wont break the bank. They are no longer limited to the small dining area, they have now opened more seating so no more waiting around waiting for a table! Yay!
