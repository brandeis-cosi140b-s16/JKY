This place is right down the road from me, and is always on point.   Service is fast and always consistent.  I usually get tacos con todo, which have been on point every time i get them, good size for the price and always nice and warm and ready to go, plenty of flavor. Salsa bar has your standard green, pico, and red hot. Ive gotten to go orders as well and have nothing bad to say, great work keep it up!!!
