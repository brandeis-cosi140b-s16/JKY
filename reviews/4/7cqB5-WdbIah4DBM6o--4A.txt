I've read several reviews about the slow service and have experienced the same but it seems they've corrected this problem when we were there recently.  The place had a good dinner crowd and we sat in the bar area.  We got served quickly for as crowded as it was.  I got the fish tacos and the wife got the fajita quesadillas .  both were very good.  The only disappointment was the stuffed jalape√±o in a light temporary.  The batter was heavy, hard and tough to cut through....you had to chip away at it and it basically fell apart...it appears that it was overcooked ...the filling itself was good but you had to work for it.
