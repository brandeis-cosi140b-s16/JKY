This colorful restaurant in the Cosmo is not for those who think Chinese = General Tsos and Mexican = Enchiladas. This is adventurous food in a casual setting where it's all about ingredients and technique. 
It is NOT a fusion restaurant as there are two kitchens serving both cuisines side by side.

This place is exploding with unique flavors. I tried two things I'd never had in my life here: beef tendon and duck tongue (both in taco form). The tendon was just a bit too greasy for my taste and came with a raw oyster on it. The combination just wasn't my favorite.  The duck tounge taco was surprisingly yummy and served with lychee fruit.

Definitely you MUST have the quail egg and pork shumai. My friend ensured me it would change my life and it did not disappoint as it exploded in my mouth, like a tiny contained eggs bennidict. 
The pork belly is wonderful as well and a bit safer as a taco option. 

I would have given this place 3 stars for the items that fell flat, but the Salt Air Margaritas make it impossible to give this place less than 4.
