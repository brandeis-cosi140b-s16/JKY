Color me impressed. I wasn't sure what to think going into this restaurant. But hey, we had a Groupon.

It's located in the same spot as the original Firefly on Paradise. So it's small-ish. And parking can be challenged when this little strip mall is packed. But that said, we had zero issues at 7pm on a Friday night.

We were seated immediately. Though, there was no hostess at the hostess stand. So we did stand around for a few minutes trying to catch someone's eye.

They're repainted it and whatnot, but it's still a similar layout to how Firefly was. Nice decor. Good ambiance.

The waitstaff were attentive and pleasant. Particularly quick to refill drinks and clear plates.

The guacamole was good. Nothing particularly noteworthy. Next time, I'd probably opt for one of their queso options (they have 2!).

The tacos were delicious. It's all a la carte. The tacos range from $2.50 to $3.75 for one taco. And you can mix and match to your heart's content. The Groupon included 6 tacos, so we tried 6 different ones. They even have vegetarian options, which were quite tasty. In fact, my 2 favs were a veggie one and the pork al pastor (good flavor and topped with pineapple). The beef ones were also good choices.

You can then pick various sides. We went for the chorizo and bacon beans and the cilantro rice. Both were full of flavor.

The drink list is actually pretty good. There's some cocktails and wines, but beer (duh!) is the star here. The beer list was pretty lengthy and had some good finds.

All in all, we had a pleasant and tasty dining experience here.
