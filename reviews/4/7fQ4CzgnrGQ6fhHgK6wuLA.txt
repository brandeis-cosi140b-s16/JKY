Uh oh. I've stumbled upon what will now be one of my favorite spots for lunch in downtown Pittsburgh....

I just recently started working in downtown and have been trying out a lot of new lunch places. A lot of my friends are Chipotle fans, but I had only been several times throughout the country and never quite understood their love for it.

Except that changed yesterday. I'm not sure what lured me into Chipotle, but something did. 

The environment is very attractive and trendy with lots of seats lining the windows overlooking Forbes and Market Square. It makes for a great zone-out, people-watching lunch that is often needed mid-day when you work in an office with no windows.

The prices are inexpensive, and the quality of food is exceptional. Why have I been going to Qdoba and Moe's all these years? I just wanted to kick myself for somehow overlooking how great Chipotle is all this time.

I highly recommend the Burrito Bowl, the featured item when I went yesterday. Very tasty and filled with fresh ingredients. Plus, I didn't feel like it was very bad for me with its mix of chicken, rice, and toppings. OK, now I might just be deceiving myself, but just go with it for me!!

If you didn't guess already based on my review... I'll be back!
