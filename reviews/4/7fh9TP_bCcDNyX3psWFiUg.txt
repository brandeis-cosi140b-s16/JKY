I stopped off here on my way off to the more prestigious places of Mill Ave after someone announced that there was $1 beer inside. 

Why not pre-game before getting raped at another bar? So my brother and I graciously chugged a beer and headed off.

While in there I thought it was pretty cool. I am pretty sure that right before I was leaving the bar tender announced that he was getting cups out for some beer pong. How cool is that!? With that said, the place struck me as a down-to-earth place to come and have a drink or two or three and socialize. No expectations, maybe you could say.

I'm going to try to come back here - maybe for lunch sometime. :)
