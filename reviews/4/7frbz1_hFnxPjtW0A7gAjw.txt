I've been going here with my family ever since we moved to Arizona when I was a kid. It's always had a really laid back atmosphere.

We always get the pork tacos and quesadillas (which we load up with salad/slaw stuff from the free salad bar). I LOVE the pork tacos. They're street taco style so they're small, but I have never tasted another taco like the pork tacos at Guedo's. Maybe they just seem magical to me because of my childhood memories of them, but seriously. They're good.
