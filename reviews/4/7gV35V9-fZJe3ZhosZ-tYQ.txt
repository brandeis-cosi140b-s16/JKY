Ok I know there are probably upwards a thousand 'bertos restaurants in the Valley, but Hilbertos is one of the best I've been to. 

It's really close to where I work so I go there almost every morning as my morning ritual for breakfast. The ham, egg, and cheese breakfast burrito is simple, but amazing all at the same time. It blows McDonald's and Burger King's burritos out of the water! I usually get the green sauce to go with it. The red sauce is good too, but I like green better. 

The service there is quick and to the point so you can get in and get out really quick. 

The building used to be a Taco Bell so there is plenty of seating. I'm usually on the go so I don't eat there. 

Very good restaurant!
