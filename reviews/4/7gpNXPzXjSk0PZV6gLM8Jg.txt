I work near here so o come here often. I got to give it to them, I love the open 24 hours! I have tried a lot of their things and I like most of them. My favorite has probably got to be the breakfast burritos. Yummy! The salsas are also very good. The spice level in them is a bit high but really tasty. Only thing I am not a fan of is the amount of anions that they put, but ask them no onions and they do that for you no problem. So yeah it pretty good. I will be back soon for breakfast :)
