We ate here for brunch and it was wonderful!  We had 2 different kinds of tacos and a delicious beef sandwich.  Everything looked good which made ordering take a while.  We also had a very strong but very good margarita.  We wanted to have a large party there for our wedding (21 people) but there was simply no room so we had to make other plans.
