I went here tonight without reading any reviews.  I was driving to another place for dinner and drove by La Canasta and there were a lot of cars in the lot, and mentally noted where it was.  Got to the other place and it was CLOSED, back to La Canasta.

The salsa in my opinion was a home run. A little chunkier than what you would traditionally think of as salsa but very good none the less.

Had iced tea to drink and the 2 chicken enchilada combination.  The food came very hot, yes food is suppose to be hot!!!!!  The entire meal was very good, and the service was right on par.  My tea was never empty.  The best part is the bill was $11.13 before tax and I was very full, almost too full.

My one constructive criticism is that the food and salsa were a little on the salty side, but not over the top.

Overall a good experience and it felt a lot like my favorite place at home that I have been going to now 24 years!!!!!!!
