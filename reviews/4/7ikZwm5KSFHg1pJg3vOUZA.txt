The food is just awesome.  6 stars for the al pastor tacos.  But, c'mon..you can't find a bigger restaurant or find a way to speed up the lines?  You guys closed the restaurant on the strip, which just made this one busier?  Makes no sense.  But, you definitely know how to make the best tacos in town..I'll give you that.
