I love to eat here because it's as much or as little Mexican as I want it to be. I always get the grilled chicken meals. The chicken is seasoned deliciously and usually not dry- and if you like dark meat, the leg and thigh are juicy and delicious. For sides- if I'm feeling adventurous, I get the BBQ black beans and rice. If I'm wanting comfort food, I get the side salad and macaroni and cheese. No matter what, I tend to down the chicken in their green salsa- it's the best! You can eat the chicken on its own, or pull it off the bones and put it in the supplied tortillas with salsa and pico. 

While sitting in the drive through, I noticed you can see them pull your chicken off the grill, check the temperature then cut it up. That alone deserves a star, food safety at its best. 

-1 star because of this location's flaw- they always seem to get one thing wrong with my order. I should probably start checking more closely but usually if I'm picking up dinner to-go I'm in a hurry. It's not usually anything major- among my experiences (from most to least frequent): No salad dressing, no silverware, no salsa, missing chicken drumstick, missing side, extra quesadilla. I guess I came out ahead once! 

All in all, this is a good, fast, hearty option for lunch or dinner. You can get away with a pretty healthy meal if you pay attention, and won't be disappointed with the taste and quality.
