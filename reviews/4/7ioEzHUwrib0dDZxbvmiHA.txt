Have been a regular since they opened.  This is a family owned and run restaurant and they are friendly, the food is always good.  I stick to my usual order but have had many friends and family try other dishes with no complaints. Service is good; I never had to wait for a table on a weeknight.

I can get a full meal for two with fountain drinks and chips, etc for about $17.  i can order a couple of margaritas and leave for under $30.
