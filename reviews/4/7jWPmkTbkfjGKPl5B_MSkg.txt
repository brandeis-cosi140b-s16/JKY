Okay, finally, mission accomplished. I have finally found Sonoran hot dogs in the Phoenix area (that are not sold off of a cart that comes and goes). While not as good as El Guero Canelo or BK in Tucson, these were pretty good. Plus, I don't have to drive 100 miles to get them. 

I also had the carne asada torta. It was pretty good, though the buns were a little overdone, giving the whole thing a slightly burned taste. This seems to be a common problem with tortas though. My wife had a chile relleno and the menudo. She thought the chili relleno was the best she's had locally, while the menudo was decent. She though Filiberto's was better, so that gives you an idea. 

This is a nice looking little place in a rougher area of Mesa, and it was clean and pleasant. Service was pretty good, not super-friendly but efficient and not hostile in any way. All of the food above, along with drinks and the side dishes that came with the main courses, came up to about $28. Not bad. 

This is more of a three star place, but the fact that they have Sonoran hot dogs, plus the fact that the chili relleno is, according to my wife, top notch, convinced me to give it the extra star.
