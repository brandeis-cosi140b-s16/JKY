We found this place with yelp! Just driving through and wanted some good mexican food and decided to give this a shot. Didn't realize it was a drive up type of place, but we went for it anyways and it was a great decision. The food portions for the price were big for the cheap costs and the taste was delicious. We had nachos, tacos and enchiladas and it was all delicious
