I have been to Roberto's a few times over the years, but came to this location for the first time a few days ago. I haven't been in over 3 years so I will base it off this trip. 

I had a bunch of family in town so we ordered a buttload of food. The total for 8 adult persons was about $70 (plus we tipped on top of that price). The food took about 10 minutes and not one thing was messed up. Bravo! While we waited we got green and red salsa, radishes, cucumbers, and the spicy carrot mix (all fresh and good, not scary germ cesspool-looking).

I personally got the carne asada fries (I requested no onions, but not sure if they come on it), a shredded beef taco, and ordered chips with guacamole and cheese for the table. The carne asada fries were more than I could eat! They were huge and could easily be shared as a full meal for 2. They had carne, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and beans on them. They were so delicious. I had them the next day and they weren't that bad. Reheated fries are never the same. I also had to eat the taco the next day (I made a good dent in the fries and was too full to eat it) and it was still pretty good. The chips were average. Nothing special honestly. I should have just ordered guacamole and put it on my On The Border chips with cheese I have at home.

They had an A grade showing, which if you watch "dirty dining" on the news you will know that Mexican and Chinese food restaurants tend to frequent the C, D, or F grade list. I love Mexican food and was happy to see a drive-thru AND that they are open 24 hrs a day. I do not like Taco Bell all that much, so I will drive an extra 1/4 of a mile around the corner to avoid their diarrhea burritos.
