Went here with my girlfriend last night and had a good experience. Hostess was friendly and we were seated promptly. The number one thing that stood out to me was the ambiance in the place. Really cool looking decorative design in this restaurant. The vaulted ceilings above the bar really pop.  Our drink orders were taken in only a few minutes and our food orders were taken shortly after. We ordered a combination of different tacos. The fish, veggies, and shrimp tacos are delicious. Overall, this place does a good job! 

Pros: 

-Great food
-Good service
-Reasonable prices 
-Awesome ambiance

Cons
-I believe I left my card there and still waiting to hear back
