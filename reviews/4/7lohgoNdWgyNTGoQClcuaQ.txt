I'm here and I was excited to eat a sandwich from man vs food the Del Rey the moment I bit into it was nice and juicy I decided to smother it with the green and red hot sauce along with some valentina hot sauce it was now nice n spicy. And a river of flavor busted in my mouth I was able to polish off the full sandwich and then you also and eat a burrito enchilada this time I was very full and I call to check it was cheap as hell if  you're on a budget and you want to eat lots of food come here its fun to take a picture at the front of the store to show that you been to a Man vs food stop
