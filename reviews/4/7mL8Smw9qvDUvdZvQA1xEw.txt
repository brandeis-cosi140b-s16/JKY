I don't come here very often, but I have to admit the couple times I have, I'm impressed. 

I like their new langostine(mini-lobster) tacos and their grilled fish taco. I've tried their fried fish taco but it's oily and grossly battered. 

Service is so-so as one time the counter folk are very customer service oriented but the other time, the guy was oblivious.
