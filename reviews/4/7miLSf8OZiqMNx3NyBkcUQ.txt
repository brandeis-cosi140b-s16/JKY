This is what food is about. A perfect confluence of cultures and flavors. Fresh, fast and varied. The menu hits all the sweet spots while still being inventive. Definitely order an item from each category: taco, dim sum and noodles. Our favorites on this visits: Chilorio de Res (taco: short rib, Padilla negro, cumin, cilantro) and Dan Dan Mian ( wheat noodles, spicy pork sauce/peanuts). 

The aesthetic of place: surreal mixture of Hispanic meets Asian. Funky and fun like a street art house. 

Come and enjoy...as we have, did and will
Do.
