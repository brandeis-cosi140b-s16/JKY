It was always good when I came here to eat in the years earlier, but when I came here with my husband, he just thought it was ok. The atmosphere is really nice- don't let the strip mall locale or the funny name fool you. There is a To-Go entrance and a regular dine-in entrance. There is bar seating, tables, and booths. The service was really good. It was a busy restaurant with quite a few patrons every time I came here.

I always got the carne asada plate- it was deliciously seasoned and pretty big- never disappointed me, ever. I should add that I am not a meat & potatoes person, so for me to order, red meat, is saying something. I did take home leftovers (no complaints here). I should also mention that this place was introduced to me by my then BF, who was Mexican. 

Since it was just ok for my husband, I don't believe that I will be coming here anytime soon unless I meet one of my girlfriends here for dinner. Where my girls at?
