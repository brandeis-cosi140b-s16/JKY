I love this place!! There food is always excellent and there use to be a dish that I got all the time when I was here but then they took it off the menu. Well then last time I went it wasn't on the menu anymore and I was so disappointed and I told my waitress and she said they could still make it for me even though it wasn't on the menu anymore! I thought that was awesome!
I usually come every Friday with some coworkers for happy hour and the bar staff is always so friendly!!they have great service here
