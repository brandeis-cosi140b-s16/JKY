This place is probably my new favorite taco shop in Vegas. Everything I've had was tasty. Even the vegetarian options are full of flavor. Everything is prepared fresh in front of your face!! The staff is super helpful and go out of their way to make sure you're getting good food. The al pastor tacos I had were overstuffed!!! If you like funky cuts of meat, this place is for you. They have brains, tripe, beef head, and a few others I forget. But not your usual taco fillings for sure. I'm not adventurous enough to try a brain taco, but maybe you are. :)
