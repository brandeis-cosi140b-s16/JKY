I enjoyed the food and atmosphere was nice enough. Tex-mex and everything tasted fresh. Host was friendly and our server went out of her way and was quite sweet and bubbly.

We had guacamole, can't deny it's fresh when it's made in front of you! Chips had a house made red and verde. Chips were made in house also. We were looking for a snack and it was happy hour, $2 soft corn tacos. I'm a vegetarian (vegas hates us). So I got mine with minus the chicken... when our server brought them out she said the cook sent me a bowl of grilled peppers and onions since I was a veg, they were delicious and I was truly grateful for them doing that. Something I would ordered wether it be happy hour or not. My friend got the shredded chicken tacos and they were loaded with marinated chicken. She said they were great.

Refreshing to have a personal touch and fresh food! Would have gone back if we had time.
