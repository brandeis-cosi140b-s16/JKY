I would have given 5 stars except, I felt the service was rushed. Before we could enjoy the chips, salsa and guacamole, the appetizers came. Before we could finish the appetizers the entree came. Then the desert. 
There was no breathing room in between courses, and that is too bad, as the food was amazing. 
That said, the guacamole was the best I have ever had. The chips divine, not oily not stale, just perfect. 
Two of ordered the 42.00 per person deal, which includes one app, one entree and the dessert. 
The appetizer was a trio of appetizers. One fried plantain, one beef taquito and one tamale. The fried plantain was great crispy on the outside, warm sweetness's on the inside. The beef taquito crunchy and delicious. I never got to the tamale, the entree came before I could try it. I did not want my entree to get cold so I bypassed the tamale. 
I had the boneless beef short ribs or corn polenta. Fabulous, the beef so tender the polenta had a little kick but not so overwhelming. My friend had the special rib eye gaucho steak. I had a taste, it was great, had I know I would have ordered it. My other friend had another special she did comment it was spicy. It was stuffed peppers I am not sure the name. 
The portions were huge. We took half home. 
Now the dessert was fantastic, it was the special for the day. Banana cream pie. Not your ordinary banana cream pie. This had 3 layers of banana bread each separated by luscious layers of banana cream with fresh bananas, whipped cream on top and swirls of chocolate sauce. 
Honestly one of the best tasting meals I have ever had in Las Vegas. If I do get to go back I hope the service will be slower, so this wonderful food can be savored and enjyed as it was meant to be.
