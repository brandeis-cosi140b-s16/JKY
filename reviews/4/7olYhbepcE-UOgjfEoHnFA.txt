We had our wedding reception here on 4/12/14.  It was a nice place.  They accommodated the seating arrangement nicely.  They worked with me over the phone with menu arrangements and pricing.  They even helped me find a bakery in the same shopping center.  The margaritas are delicious! They had a Mariachi come by surprise so we made sure we tipped them well.  The staff was nice so we also left them a good tip. The food was good but I had to ask them to refill the empty enchilada tray.  I felt they should have been on top of that.  I didn't think they had A/C on just fans so it was a little warm for a summer vegas day.  It was bearable but could have been fresher.  They didn't rush us out and let us dance.  Overall my guests had a great time.
