Driven past this place hundreds of times from the way home and finally cracked one night craving one of the new Cool Ranch Doritos tacos.  I took advantage of the 24 hour drive thru and the employee was very friendly (although he kept calling me "boss").

Food came out quickly and we were on our way in under a couple on minutes.  Once home the tacos were AMAZING (seriously whoever thought about making a Doritos into a shell is a game-changer!).  On the minus side I ordered a triangle cookie like dessert with frosting in the middle.  It's prepackaged and wasn't that good, hopefully they still have cinnomin twists, because thats what I'll get next time!
