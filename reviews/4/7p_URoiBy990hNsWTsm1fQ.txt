I have eaten here on three occasions within the last month. Two have been with Groupon deals. The food has been better than average, I have had the fish tacos, chicken chimichanga and the poblano peppers.  My wife is a fan of the cheese enchiladas and my son really enjoys the chicken quesadillas.. Over all the place is pretty good. In the south hills there is a serious lack of mexican food, this restaurant is a nice addition that everyone in the family enjoys.
