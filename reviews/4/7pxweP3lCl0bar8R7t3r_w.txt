Sunday nights after 9 are half price food and margaritas. Saturdays between 6-8 are also half price food and margaritas.

The margaritas are loaded with booze but taste so good. Lets just say, if you're a lightweight, you'll be tapping after 1. You can either get the regular margarita or one of the flavored one. Or, you can mix two flavors together which is also really good. After 2 of the big ones, you get a very healthy buzz going on. 3 ... well, you'll have a more than healthy buzz and a ridiculous sugar rush. 4.... haven't seen it yet. The sugar usually gets to you first.

As for the food, this is great Mexican food. I usually get a burrito and piggy size it so they put double the meat in. I really don't need to get double meat because the serving sizes are enormous but after doing it the first time, I can't possibly go back. Mad Mex is one of the reasons why a lot of people get the freshman 15 and the sophomore 30. The food and drinks are soo good that you can't just say no. 

There usually is quite a bit of a wait if you go for half price food but it's still worth the wait. You can hang out at the bar and grab some free nachos and salso to go with a margarita while you wait for your food.

Definitely worth hitting up.
