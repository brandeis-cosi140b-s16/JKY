I can see why people that rated it low did so. You've never ate at another Rigos tacos before and it's understandable. Heck you've probably not know what authentic street tacos are either, or you haven't even ate REAL Mexican food outside of Las Vegas. Las Vegas Mexican food sucks so I understand.

  Anyway to my review. These tacos taste are comparable to tacos in Los Angeles. The only think i felt was missing was that I wasn't eating them in L.A. The thing that taste the same are the beans. Real good! To compare the taste... It taste like a blend of Tacos Mexico and Tacos el gordo, BUT in between. Without the tortilla they use in El Gordo, or the Avacado. Remember it's street style tacos.

  I didn't like the parking situation, or spot. If that damn liquor store in the corner was gone it would be nicer. The bathroom sucks ass. Feels like a low class night club ahaha. Anyway the counter lady was somewhat snotty Pissed me off. But the food was so so good! Remember STREET TACOS! Don't expect these tacos to have over the top flavor, but its just a regular taco you get out and about.

  The chile was dead on to the ones I've tastes also. Definitely coming back because the place made me forget about being here in Las Vegas,
