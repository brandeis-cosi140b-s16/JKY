Why am I writing a review of a fast food restaurant? One simple reason: I have been to this particular restaurant countless times over the last 15 years, and they have gotten my order wrong only once. ONCE! In 15 years! And every time I go there, the employees are quick, friendly, and on the ball.

Yes, I know, Del Taco is not the greatest food in the world. But you can't go wrong for the price, and they actually have a pretty broad menu. (French fries and burgers at a Mexican restaurant? Who knew?)

Tonight I had chili cheese fries. Why? I don't know. I usually get tacos and bean burritos. (And I will say I was not a big fan of tonight's order.) But, as I said, it doesn't matter what I order; it's almost always delivered quickly and correctly, and the employees are always friendly and attentive.

I'm not sure who to thank--if it's the franchise owner for this location, or if the employees at this place just take pride in their work--but I must say that I've never seen one particular fast food restaurant have such a long run of great service.

If you want cheap eats and great service, take the Jones exit off 95 and give Del Taco a chance. My advice: Stick with the Mexican food; go to Wienerschnitzel if you want chili cheese fries.
