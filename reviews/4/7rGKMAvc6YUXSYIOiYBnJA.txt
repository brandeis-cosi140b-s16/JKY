So they apparently just opened a restaurant and are usually a Mexican grocery store. First of all, LOVED the set-up of the restaurant. Long, family style beautifully crafted tables. Nice ambiance, spacious and yet still cozy. Secondly, huge margaritas for very reasonable prices. And last, but not least, the food is bomb. Super authentic. Price range is pretty size-able, so there is something for most peoples budget's. I do wish that they didn't make you pay for chips and salsa (I feel like those should come free with purchase of meal(s)!!) and the service could have been a little faster, but those are my only minor complaints.  It was nice to have a relaxing dinner out with friends while on vacation - and it was awesome to see the (normally picky) kids eating foods they might not usually try!
