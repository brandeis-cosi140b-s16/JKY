I don't usually review joints like these, but I had to. You would think that when you walk into this place it would be similar to Roberto's or other small Mexican joints, but it's different in it's own ways. I usually go with the rolled tacos or the hard tacos. One thing I noticed is that the shredded chicken has more flavor to it compared to other places. Also, it's never dry and never drenched in oil. Their sauces are all very flavorful. There is a hot side and mild side on the sauce cart. I always go with the hot green sauce. It's my favorite. I can also appreciate that this place has a drive thru because I definitely have my days where I'm lazy, hungry and don't want to get out of my car. It's located right next to cj's frozen custard which is also awesome lol.
