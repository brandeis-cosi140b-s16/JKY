I think Chipotle pretty much has it figured out as far as fast food is concerned.  A limited number of options, which is a good thing to me, but many different ways to add to them.  You can either eat an extremely healthy meal or just a healthy meal.  There are different types of salsa, I'm a big fan of the corn salsa, as well as different beans to choose from.  The lime salt on the chips is delicious!  I could eat here at least once a week.  I'd never noticed until recently that they have tacos, but indeed, they do!
