Love Filiberto's - I gotta come here at least once every time I'm in Phoenix.  This is the place I compare all authentic taco stands to, and the one that introduced me to what good authentic Mexican fast food should be!  To me, most of the Filiberto's locations are pretty consistent so this review is really for any of the locations, but I'll have to agree with others and say that this location is arguably the best and I'm fairly certain this one was my first, and you know what they say about that!  

Fresh hot tortillas, huge burritos, great salsa bar, cheap prices, open 24/7 what's not to like?  Love the packets of hot sauce they make fresh at every location and give away free and I've yet to find a sauce like it anywhere else, it's that unique.  I always asked for about twice as many as they give ya with every order.  I've tried the other copy-cats of the Filly-B name and they weren't quite the same.  Filiberto's is one of my gotta haves that I miss most about Phoenix and since it's open 24/7 I'll always hit it late night after everything else is closed to get my fill.
