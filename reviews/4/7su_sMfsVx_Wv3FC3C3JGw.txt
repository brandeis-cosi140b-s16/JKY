Oh Los Compadres, the memories we have.  I have been going here for about 15 years now and I stopped by again today for my faithful number 7.  It is the mini-chimi, cheese enchilada, & beans and of course it was great.  The salsa brings back memories of enjoying this restaurant and the atmosphere is business casual.  I love coming here on the weekend around 11am to get the brunch specials, I would get the Mexican omelet with beans, potatoes, & tortillas and man is that dish good.  The service is usually great, I think I can only recall a few times it was average but never terrible.  The prices are very good and usually spend about $10 a person with a drink.  The owner is almost always there and very nice.  It has become a staple for me my family and even my friends.
