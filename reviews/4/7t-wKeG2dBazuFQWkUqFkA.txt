We eagerly anticipated the opening of Barrio Queen. Barrio Cafe in downtown Phoenix has been a favorite for year, with the only downside being the 35 minute drive to Phoenix. Barrio Queen opening in Gilbert is only a short 10 minute drive from my Chandler residence. 

Compared to Barrio Cafe:
Queso Fundido: Too much mushroom, not enough chorizo. Definitely not as thick and creamy as the Barrio Cafe Queso Fundido. Barrio Cafe wins.

Margaritas: So on par. Compared to the Barrio Bomba, the Queens cooler is very equal. HOWEVER steer clear if you do not like coconut. The taste of coconut is very overwhelming. The Casa  (house margarita) was standard. Just a good margarita no complaints. The options for fruitier margaritas were non existent. So 
Barrio wins.

Entr√©e: I had the The Queen Enchilada with chicken and my friend had the Carne Asada Torta. The Torta was really good. Had a lot of meat, it had cheese, avocado, peppers, onions - it was really good. For $12 it was a really good portion for the amount of food. The enchiladas were really good - except for the spinach. I hate spinach and this did not make me a fan of spinach. I have to say the food at Barrio is equal to Barrio cafe.

Other stuff: Waitress, Norma, was decent. Decorations were great. Artwork was fabulous. It was a very chill and comfy atmosphere. 

Overall, Barrio Cafe is better, however I am excited to come here again.
