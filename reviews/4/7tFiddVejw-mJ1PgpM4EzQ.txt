Honestly the night we were here I don't remember a lot about being there :-) but I know that it was my BFF's 2nd or 3rd time and he wanted me to try the Nachos which were out of this world. I personally think they don't stay open late enough in the evenings given it is located at the Luxor. But maybe being up top there from the concierge and check in stashed away with the Bodies exhibit makes it less likely to draw in those late night munchie crowds that I always seem to be a part of.
Chips and Salsa and Nachos are my recommendations as they were awesome and I vow to go back and try something else to have a better variety to report on.
