Had dinner with the wife last Thursday and wanted to try the new vegan spot in town. Very exciting that we now have 3 vegan restaurants within 10 miles of our house in Phoenix. Tediberto's seems like its still getting its feet at this point. We enjoyed ourselves and will return. Hopefully they refine things a bit more.

Food: 5 Stars. Very tasty stuff for sure. Perhaps a bit over dependent on Soyrizo which makes things super spicy. The table next to us was melting under the heat of their dish and that was just a regular order. So we asked things to be as mild as possible and it could have stood to be even a bit more mild. We had the nachos, the quesadilla and La Borrachita tacos and ate everything on our plates. We finished with the tiramisu. Like I said we ate everything off our plates but the spice was a bit overwhelming.

Setting: 3 stars. Very cool spot with fun lights and art. However the nightclub lighting does not help make the food look good. With the table light coming from under your plates the food its pretty much dark the whole time. I highly suggest getting more regular lighting over the tables to show off the wonderful, but spicy, food.

Service: 5 stars. We had the new server help us and he was a delight. It was his second day but his enthusiasm out shined and made the dining experience that much better.
