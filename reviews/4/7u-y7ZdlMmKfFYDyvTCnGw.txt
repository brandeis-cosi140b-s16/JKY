What an amazing experience, getting in and out was easy just valet to avoid any problems.  The quality and taste of the food was very good.  I really recommend this restaurant, but remember to make a reservation or you might have to wait.  We sat at the bar while our table was ready and enjoyed the drinks before dinner.
