Seriously Wish Yelp had 1/2 markings because I give this place a 4.5 only reason is the price.

The food is amazing there. The Migo burrito is probably the best thing on the menu. Lots of great stuff in there. The Migo Taco is awesome to very tasty. The dessert they have are great for a fast food place. They have fried ice cream! The shakes they make are made FROM the fried ice cream which gives it an amazing taste not like a normal shake. The salsa choices are great the avacado and roasted salsa are the best.

I have been here a few times now and the staff are SUPER helpful and so very polite and friendly. The place is always clean and very inviting. 

My only bad critic is the prices. The food tastes great but the portions are a bit on the small side. I'm not talking really small but when I am low on cash I would rather buy a 5.00 burrrito from one of the fili, poli, or whatever berto's 24/7 taco places. I guess it goes to show that you get what you pay for. 

Though it is a bit pricey for the food you get, the taste and overall expeirence in the resturant you get keep me coming back.
