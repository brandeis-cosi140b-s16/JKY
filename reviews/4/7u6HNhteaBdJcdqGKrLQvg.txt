First time here: we ordered  the cheese fries with pico and carne asada on it - the fries are awesome and I wish there were more - it had quite a bit of cheese on it and I would probably ask for 1/2 cheese next time - the beef was outstanding! We also had carne and chicken tacos which were very good - a bit on the salty side but very good. The steak & bleu quesadilla was a hit - massive and tons of meat and cheese! The chips and salsa that came with it were excellent and the salsa was excellent! Oh I had the unsweetened jasmine tea which came in a huge glass mason jar with a lid! Great place and definitely going back.
