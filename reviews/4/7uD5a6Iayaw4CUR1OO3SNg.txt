The beauty of Roberto's is that if you are driving home from the strip at 3am, it is virtually impossible NOT to find one at that hour. They are everywhere: old Taco Bells, strip malls, gas stations, etc. In every direction of the compass. There must be like twenty five in Vegas. 

Roberto's is like a Bail Bondsman-- he keeps you out of jail for DUI!
