Salsa's is a great little Mexican spot in the town of Ayrsley.  We used to go there almost weekly when we lived in Steele Creek.  The veggie quesadilla is excellent.  Carna Asada also delicious.  Portions are large.  Drinks are fantastic, great beer selection and yummy margaritas.  Salsa is soooo good.  Really nice outdoor seating area but comfortable indoor restaurant as well.  We miss going there now that we've moved to the other side of Charlotte but we try going back when we're around there.
