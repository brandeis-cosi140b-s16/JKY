These guys were tucked in the Latin area at the March of Dimes, where as the American hot dogs were in the central area. Well, their meat with red and green chili tostadas were sublime. The meager hot dog does not stand a chance when you have a choice. Although the apple empanadas were more popular I am going to have to urge for adventure. The pineapple empanadas knocked it out of the park and were a nice doughy light contrast to many of the heavy greasy versions I have tried elsewhere.  If they can do this well catering, I can only imagine how wonderful they will be on site. The boyfriend and I can't wait!
