I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, but if anyone I know ever tells me they're in the mood for Mexican, this would probably be where we'd end up.

I ordered a bowl with the lime rice, pinto beans, chicken, sour cream, etc.  It was absolutely delicious!  I have a fairly common gene that makes cilantro taste something like awful soap, so I was disappointed to find that they did not offer rice without cilantro.  I picked out the larger pieces of cilantro and the bitter flavor of the smaller pieces were overpowered by the immense flavor of the other ingredients.

Overall, I loved my lunch at Chipotle and WILL be returning for seconds!
