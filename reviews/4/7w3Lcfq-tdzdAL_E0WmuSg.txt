We went in for lunch today after reading Yelp reviews and a fellow foodie buddy assured us this is THE place to go for authentic flavors.  If you are looking for the real thing and want something totally different from the 'Mexican food' chains, this is the place for you. Both carne asada plate and carne asada burrito were delicious. The condiment station loaded with fresh lime, salsa, pickled onions, cabbage and pico de gallo really added to our already flavorful meals. Even though I don't speak hardly any Spanish at all, friendly and attentive staff patiently answered all my questions. Food came out fast while my corn tortillas were still steaming hot and in big portions. I would probably try the tacos a la cart next time so I can try a few other things.  Grilled onion that came with the Plate was so sweet and balanced out the spiciness of the roasted pepper. What a treat it was! I can't wait to go back!
