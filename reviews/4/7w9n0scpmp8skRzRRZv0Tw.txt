Well, I took my friend out for her birthday yesterday.  She is Mexican, although she really hates Mexicans.  One of her friends had mentioned that Federico's in the Fry's parking lot at Cotton Lane and Greenway had really good food, so when I asked her where she wanted to go, she thought we'd try it.  (On my birthday we go Asian, on her birthday, we do Mexican.)  All over town there are Frederico's, Pederico's, and all kinds of little drive thru Mexican places (good food, ambience not so good).  Last time I went to Frederico's they were out of refried beans... (?!).  I said, why are you open??  Anyway, so I didn't know what to expect.  But we pulled up and they had a lot of tables inside, as well as a drive thru on the side.   I ordered chili rellenos and she ordered a special with 5 tacos/carnitas (pork?).  We both wanted flour tortillas (like the Amercians do) instead of the corn tortillas.  That food was soooo good!!   I asked her if it was authentic and she said Ci, Ci, Ci.  I finished it and wanted more, even though I'm still full.  I will go back for more.  It was $15.00 for 2 people.  My friend missed the availability of cocktails, of course, but I don't drink and drive (usually).  I can afford to take my kids there for a guaranteed good meal.    We were there for 3  hours in spite of no ambience! :)
