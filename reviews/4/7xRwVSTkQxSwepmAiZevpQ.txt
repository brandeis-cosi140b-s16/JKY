After our disaster at Chase's Diner (see review) we stopped in here to get breakfast.  Looks like they have not been open long but it was clean and adequately staffed, no line so are orders got in quickly.  The manager was running the cash register and was very polite and attentive.  Had the Chorizo breakfast burrito, it was large as burritos go,  hot, fresh and yummy!  Definitely come back to this place.
