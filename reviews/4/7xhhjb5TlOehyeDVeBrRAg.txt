Typical Chipotle, which I love.  However, I noticed a few quirks of this place.  First of all, they were super fast here.  Maybe even a little too fast since there were two people in line, but then within 15 minutes, I found out why.

The line for lunch here is extreme!  So it pays to get here early.  Nonetheless, from what I observed it does move relatively fast, so don't be deterred.
