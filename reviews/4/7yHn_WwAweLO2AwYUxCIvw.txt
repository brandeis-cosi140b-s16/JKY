fausto's is my choice of mexican taco shop! carne asada fries are crispy and the toppings don't have beans! the guac is fresher! and no tomatoes. fries, carne, guac, cheese, sour cream and i think thats about it. but its not overly topped with other ingrediants like other taco shops. their cali burrito is just as good but with rice and wrapped in a tortilla. be prepared to share due to big portions! they keep the restaurant as clean as they can, the staff is super friendly and patient with any questions you have about their menu. i ususally take orders for takeout and enjoy my mexifood where its not so busy.
