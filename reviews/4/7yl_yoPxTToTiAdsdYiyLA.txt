Last time I was in Scottsdale was December and I really didn't have a chance to try a good local spot. This time I made sure to do just that. 

Based solely on Yelp reviewers we decided to try this place. Even though its a mexican eatery, something about it seemed different. It was. 

I had the Lunch Pollo Magnifico that was recommended by the nice lady taking orders. I was hesitant because of the jalape√±o sour cream they put on it. I was wrong and that ended up being the piece that brought everything together. This fried burrito was amazing! I'm normally not a fan of chicken in burritos because it always seems dry to me. Not here. The chicken was seasoned and very tender. 

If you are in the area and you are able to find a parking spot in their tiny lot, I would recommend stopping here. 

One star removed due to the mild salsa tasting like it came from a jar (not from new york city...)
