TBG is worth a stop for lunch. We had the Mahi Fish Tacos and the Short Rib Tacos today, both were excellent. Each had 3 tacos for $8.00. You can also get 2 tacos and a side of beans or rice for $5.00 and a la carte tacos for $3-4 each. Although I stuck to diet coke which they serve in a 20 oz bottle I did see several customers having a very health pour of wine.

The butcher shop sells quality US Prime beef, but you have to pay for quality. If you are comfortable with US Choice beef sold by the chain stores than the price of US Prime beef will be a shock. T-bone and ribeye Prime beef steaks are $19.99/lb. They also have a selection of chicken, lamb and fish.

TBG is definitely worth a stop.
