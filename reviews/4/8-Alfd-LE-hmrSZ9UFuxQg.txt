Tapacubo (located at the bottom of the Graduate Tempe hotel) has a nice vibe to it. There is an expansive bar indoors with plenty of seating, and booths surrounding the bar for additional seating for larger groups. From the inside you have a view of the small outdoor pool and the outdoor patio. It is light, bright and airy. 

The menu was simple: apps, salad, tortas or tacos, I was a little disappointed with the limited options but again, it is in a hotel. I will say the salad I had was delicious, it was almost their version of a chopped salad (lettuce, tomato, picked onion, quinoa, corn, blueberries and delicious smoked chicken). 

The drinks were reasonably priced and although the food took a while the server more than made up for it.
