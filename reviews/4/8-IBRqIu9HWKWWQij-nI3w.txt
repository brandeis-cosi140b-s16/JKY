We really enjoy this place. It's located upstairs in the El Pedregal complex, south of The Boulders. It is not your typical Mexican restaurant, but worth a try. Be prepared to pay for chips as they are not included. We selected the fajitas and the carne asada. Both were outstanding. Overall a fun place
