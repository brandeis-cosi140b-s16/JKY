Stopped in for dinner as part of a mid-week date night with the Mrs. We were seated almost immediately, as there were plenty of open tables and not much activity. We apparently had just beaten the dinner rush. The "El Jefe" margarita came highly recommended and with good reason. Made with Patron Silver Tequila, the El Jefe was big and strong, as a good margarita should be. The complimentary chips were hot and fresh and our waitress, Lenore, was on top of her game. I opted for the Tex Mex Cobb Salad. Loaded with fresh ingredients and plenty of chicken, it was a nice break from my typically carb heavy mexican choices. I went without salad dressing and topped it with salsa. It was outstanding. The Mrs. got the Enchilada Suizas. Of course, I had to steal a few bites for Yelp review purposes. The Suizas were delicious and were complimented nicely with refried beans on the side, loaded with cheese. Dinner for two, with the El Jefe's, ran us just under $50.00 including tax. The food was great, the service was fast and friendly and they had baseball on TV. A solid four star performance from OTB.
