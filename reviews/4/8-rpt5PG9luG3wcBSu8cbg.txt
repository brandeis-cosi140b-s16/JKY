Love this place! Their fish tacos are delicious. 

Plus they do a great happy hour later in the day (I think it goes from about 4-7) Shrimp and fish is always fresh and when you add avocado it's perfection. 

Their shrimp tacos are fantastic! I go here all the time and have never been disappointed.

I just wish they were open a little later!
