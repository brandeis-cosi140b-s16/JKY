I stopped here for lunch while visiting friends over the weekend.  I've been here many times years ago when I lived in Goodyear Az and always had a good experience but this time was only mediocre.

The art and food festival was going on down old litchfield road which brought out a ton of people.  Surprisingly, there was an open table on the patio though and we didn't have to wait at all.  The place was very crowded though and it took almost an hour and a half to get our food after we ordered.  I got the enchiladas suizas which are usually very good but this time mine were only luke warm at best.  No one else at the table complained.  The chips and salsa were good as well, they bring out two types (a spicy one and a milder chunky one).

Overall, this is a decent mexican restaurant (probably the best one in Goodyear).  They have good food and it is in a nice scenic part of town tucked away in old litchfield park.  They also have a full bar but I think their margaritas are a little too sweet.
