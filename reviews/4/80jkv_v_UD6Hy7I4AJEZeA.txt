Another great find off the beaten path.  I ordered two cabeza, two carne asada, two al pastor and one fish taco.  Off all of them the al pastor were the best.  The cabeza was great and the carne asada, according to my dining partners was "pretty good."

The fish taco turn out to be grilled tilapia.  My partner was expecting the baja style deep fried.  I brought it back to the counter and asked if they indeed offered that variety of fish taco.  The owner/cook explained that they only have one deep fryer, primarily for french fries and that frying fish in it would taint the oil.  Perfectly understandable.

But here's where it gets good.  He offered to make another taco, any version I wanted and to go ahead and keep the fish offering.  He understood that my partner didn't like it but insisted that I enjoy it myself.  I have to admit, it wasn't my style either.

HA!  Minutes later not only did he bring back a replacement taco, but two of them!  Outstanding customer service.

They have a self serve salsa bar that has a better than average selection of salsas, a highlight being a very unusual white based sauce that was very spicy.  Cheers for offering a Oaxacan based, very very rare salsa.   Limes and carrots are also offered.

May be considered by many to be a Yelp 3 star, but the customer service absolutely bumps this place to a 4 star.  Buche, birria and other varieties of tacos are offered.

Location may seem somewhat undesirable, but it is what it is.  I will be back and would recommend the place to anyone jonesing for tj style tacos.  About 1.5 miles from the strip.
