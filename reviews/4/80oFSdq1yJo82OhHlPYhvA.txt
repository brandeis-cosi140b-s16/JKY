This place is a hole in the wall in every way.  If you blink while driving you might miss it, but I drive by four Filiberto's to get here and get out of the car because the Breakfast burritos are some of the best I've had. Someone on here recommended the Machaca and they were right. Tacos are really good- street style like the DF. Pastor which can be fatty is leaner and a larger chop than a lot of places, but wish it has pineapple. Minus star is for issues you find at a lot of hole in the walls- mediocre service, sign says they have a special but then they say they don't have it today, no salt packets because supposedly they weren't delivered, salsa bar not restocked, ripped booth covers- of course most of that can be avoided if you just order take out. The food is worth it. Plus Giant burger is just a few doors down and you can pick up a slice of pie :).
