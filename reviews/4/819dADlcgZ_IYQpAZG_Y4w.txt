I've never been disappointed coming here. In fact, I like it much better than its sister property Lindo Michoacan. 

We're always seated by a friendly hostess and the chips, salsa and bean dip are always a few seconds behind us. I love their bean dip & chips....they must be sprinkled with crack because I can't stop eating them!!!

They have a huge menu which you can sometimes get lost in so I stick to my favorites. Generally the beef chimi or the flautas. Every entree comes with a cup of fideo soup (tomato based with noodles) which I love. Their Spanish rice and refried beans are tasty and their main dishes never disappoint. The servers are friendly, efficient and speak enough English that I can understand them. Every night we have been they have a mariachi band that plays. My daughter gets a kick out of them and loves to run up and throw dollars in their sombreros :)

To me, this is one of the best places in the valley for Mexican food. It's tough moving here from Cali and trying to find a place that lives up to our restaurants back home. This will do just fine....
