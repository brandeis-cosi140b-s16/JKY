Went there a while back for dinner. I was soooooo impressed with their red hot sauce. It was definately the best I've had at a mexican restaurant. Food was very authentic and traditional. Just the way I like it. I have absolutely no complaints, and have recommended them several times already. And you gotta love their lunch special with a beer for only a penny more! Totally awesome. Quite a find here in the east valley, where it's kind of difficult to locate a great mexican sit down restaurant.
