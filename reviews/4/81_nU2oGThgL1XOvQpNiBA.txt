Another excellent choice for Mexican. I've said it before and I'll say it again, but I think I could eat Mexican every day without getting tired of it... and I actually have had weeks that came pretty close to that being a reality. Oops.

I will admit that I am a newbie when it comes to the North Side. I am rarely there, with exception to a few visits to 21+ events at the Children's Museum, and visits to the Mattress Factory and the Aviary. I know very little about the food scene. My friend recommended that we try this place before going to look at cats at the Humane Society. Burritos AND cats all in one afternoon--this was a great day!

I had the chorizo burrito which included rice and pico, and I added sour cream. I also had the spicy salsa on the side. The burrito was huge! I was starving and did manage to finish it, but on a normal day I would definitely have had leftovers. The chorizo was spicy and packed with flavor. Everything tasted very fresh, even down to the sour cream. The salsa was very spicy (which I love), so I would recommend pico or the medium salsa if you're not a huge fan of spice.

The space is small but bright and clean. I'm excited to make a return trip to try some tacos!
