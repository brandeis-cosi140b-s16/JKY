Another great spot on the McDowell Mexican Food Expressway.  The other reviewers were dead-on and I appreciate the Yelp community for getting me prepped for waiting times.  I will agree and state that it is totally worth the wait - I had two enchiladas in red suace - one machaca and one pollo.  They were both excellent and I would highly recommend them to anyone.  It is slightly annoying that the chips have a cost, but seriously it's just a buck!  The salsa totally makes it worth it as well - I think the red salsa there is some of the best I've had in recent times.

The atmosphere was great.  There was a little cantina towards the back and the place was a lot bigger and nicer than I was expecting.

That pesky service is the only thing that keeps Rosita's from making the leap to great from good.  As I said, if you head in assuming things may take a while, not so bad; but I could see that becoming a problem in time-sensitive situations like lunch.

One last quick tip - they don't split the bill, so make sure people in your party have cash or owe money to the person who ends up paying with the card.
