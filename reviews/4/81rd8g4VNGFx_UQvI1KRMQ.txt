I ordered the 3 taco special  with two carne asada tacos and one california taco. They were all excellent, especially the california one! it is a bit pricey but you get bang for your buck: the tacos are pretty big, you get beans, rice and a large drink. 

My recommendation is too add a little more decor and ambiance to the inside. Its location is great and has potential to be more appealing to the pubic!
