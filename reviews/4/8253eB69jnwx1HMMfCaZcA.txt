My server was adorable! He was so informative and had so much patience with me. He even told me his favorite in each category and why! I loved it. My chicken nortena torta was pretty good, but the carne asada quesadilla was awesome and even better as leftovers. It was too big too eat all at once. I also like how they served small, inexpensive ceviche tostadas, just to take the edge off while you wait for your entree! Very clean, sweet place! 
Also, I have to say, go here before you go next door to spokes. That place is a joke  when it comes to their food.
