This was the first time I have ever ate at Arriba Mexican Grill. We made sure we had a reservation before we arrived. They saved our table until we got there. Our waitress was very sweet and if we needed anything like silverware, a refill, or extra napkins she returned to the table pretty quick! The menu has a lot  to choose from, even a combination area if you like mixing your meal up. The food was really good too. I will go there again!
