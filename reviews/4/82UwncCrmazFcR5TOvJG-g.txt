I grew up in a very hispanic part of California. I thought I knew burritos. At all of the quick serve places in my home town, burritos are 12" tortillas filled with mostly beans and maybe some other stuff. I always got the delicious little tacos.

The first carne asada burrito I got in Arizona was at this little shack in a parking lot, and it was game changing. A large tortilla so soft they had to have made it themselves, filled with sliced steak (at least 8oz, probably more, I don't know what Lisa L was talking about) with a little guac and pico. The steak was good enough that's all it needed. And the best part of the burrito was the last few messy bites, the juice from the steak pools up in the bottom.

I've had other things here. The rolled tacos, enchiladas, and quesedillas are all decent, but when you go to this place you want a burrito.
