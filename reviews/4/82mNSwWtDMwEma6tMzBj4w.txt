Some friends and I were in the area for sushi and decided we wanted to happy hour it up so we made our way over to Sandbar.  Once we were seated with our menus we were wishing we had started there rather than finishing because it was Taco Tuesday and they had $2 tacos!!!  That would have been way better than the average-at-best sushi we had eaten just before....so in order to drown our sorrows we got straight to the business of discounted drinks!  I can't recall all the drink specials but I know wells were $4 and I think drafts were $3?  Our waitress was awesome too, she stopped by pretty frequently to see how we were doing and get us whatever we needed, plus she was super friendly and was joking around with us.  I wish I would have gotten her name!  Definitely a happy hour I will be frequenting again in the future!
