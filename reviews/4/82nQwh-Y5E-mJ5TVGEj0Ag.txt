One of the girls in my group had stayed in the hotel room most of the day. She'd been sick during the days leading up to the fight weekend. When she finally woke up, she called up my friend and asked her to get some tacos. I told her I'd been to T&T the last time I was in Vegas, and their food was pretty good. She ordered the carne asada tacos for the roomie to go while I got the beef quesadilla. We figured we ought to start off the night early. So while waiting, we sat at the bar and had a few margaritas. Hers was the pomegranate acai and mine was mango ginger. Both were really good. Once our orders were up, we transferred our drinks to plastic cups and were on our way up to the room. I straight grubbed on the quesadilla and had the remainder of it later after coming back from LAX. This is another reason why I wouldn't mind staying at Luxor the next time I come over to Sin City.
