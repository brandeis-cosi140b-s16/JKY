good location near Red Rock if you need a snack after/before a show.

clean store.

quick friendly service. 

When I mentioned that it was very cold in the store (the thermostat was set at 65'), the cashier asked another employee to turn up the heat a bit which I was so grateful for.

Food was cooked to order.
