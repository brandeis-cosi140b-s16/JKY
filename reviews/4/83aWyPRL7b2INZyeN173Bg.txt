This four stars is a combination of food, service, and location.  

Great spot right on the strip....seating with open walls and great people watching. We got there right at 11am on a Sunday, and our waitress was pretty much alone but fantastic. Solid food...torta, quesadilla, and tacos were all really tasty.

Diablo's does it right on the strip...not fancy but that's not what they try to be...Solid food, good service, and a great location at standard strip prices.
