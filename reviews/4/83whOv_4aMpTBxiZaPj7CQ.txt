I LOVE this place.  It is usually the first place we stop when we get to Scottsdale and the last place we eat at before heading back home.  I spent too much time and money there while a college student, but the food was cheap back then and it is delicious.   I can't find the equivalent out here in the San Francisco Bay Area.  The carne ascada tacos without beans are what always keeps me coming back.  The super nachos are really tasty too!  

Well, shoot!  Now I want that for dinner!
