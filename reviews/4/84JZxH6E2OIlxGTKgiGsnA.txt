I was looking for some decent authentic Mexican off the strip while in Vegas on business. This place had good reviews on YELP so I gave it a try.  I had the chorizo tacos and a carne asada taco with a side of beans. The chorizo tacos were fantastic, fresh and nice spice. The carne asada were good as well, but the chorizo were my favorite. The beans were very tasty as were the fresh chips. I would highly recommend this spot and the staff were very friendly!
