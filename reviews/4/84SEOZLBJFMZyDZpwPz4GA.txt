I went in on the Saturday after the Tanger outlets opened up with my Mother In Law.  The food was really good.  I had a carnita's burrito and it was seasoned very well.  The service was a tad slow, but nothing to be frustrated with.  The price was decent for the portions.  I'd happily return with a few friends for some drinks and to watch a game or just hang out.  My favorite part of the restaurant is the ambiance.  It's very chill and comfortable.
