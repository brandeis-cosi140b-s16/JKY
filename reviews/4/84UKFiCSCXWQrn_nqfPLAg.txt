Don't get me wrong, we love this place for sure.  The Mac and Cheese is great and the Southwest dumpling things are A-mazing.  My husband is a fan of one of their pork dishes - we get the same thing every time.  The service is spotty for sure.  I suggest going and sitting at the bar whenever possible and DO NOT go with a large party and expect to get taken care of properly.  I was embarrassed a couple times when we have taken friends and out of town guests there after I raved up and down about it.  We just go by ourselves now but hey - at least the food makes up for the service :)
