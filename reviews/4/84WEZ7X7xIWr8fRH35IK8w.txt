I have gone to this El Pollo Loco off and on for 8 years.  I at one point had gotten so fed up with the awful service that i stopped going, even though I really love the chicken.  Recently, we started going back, and we are glad we did.  The service has dramatically improved.  Also, there have been some positive changes to the menu that have made it even better, such as adding broccoli as one of the sides.  The only problem that I run into now is that they often dont keep up with demand in their cooking of the chicken, and will not have leg and thigh meal available.  Your choice is to either wait 15 minutes or pay more for the breast and wings.  This, however is a corporate policy, so I cant fault the individual restaurant for that.  It does warrant dropping a star though.
