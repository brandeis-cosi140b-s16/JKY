Tried something different for my second go around at Rubio's and was much happier with this order than the Coastal.  The Coastal Trio is NOT a bad way to go, so don't get me wrong - if you like seafood and tacos, it's a great option. This time I was feeling more filling and less toppings and wrap so I opted for a burrito instead.

I had the Burrito Especiala with the grilled chicken and black beans, and it was delicious. There was more than enough filling to be a full and satisfying meal, while not being so much that it broke open the burrito and was a complete mess.  He had the two taco plate and ordered one steak and one chicken.  Both came out as chicken, which wasn't a huge deal since it was good! 

We sat on the porch to enjoy the wonderful weather outside and it was nice for people watching, too, so bonus! Desert Ridge has plenty of shops and restaurants to try out, making it a great night out for just about anyone.

Overall: A-
We'll be back for sure.
