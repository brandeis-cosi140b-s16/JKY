Yes, I'll be honest - you'd really have to screw the pooch for me to mark down a Del Taco.  And while my chicken quesadilla lacked chicken, the matter was promptly corrected, and the cheese-only offered up to keep (for the kid, use as a frisbee, whatever).

Restaurant was tidy for a hair past the lunch hour and across from a UNLV campus, restrooms were clean (singles, but not a big deal), and with full tummies and a topped off soda, we were off to take the Dependent to M&M World.
