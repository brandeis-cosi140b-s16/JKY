My favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. I love sitting on the patio, enjoying chips and salsa and their drink with vodka and limes. I usually get the ensalada de la casa, just be careful because the dressing is SPICY! I also enjoy the enchiladas a la crema if I'm really hungry. Great neighborhood restaurant.
