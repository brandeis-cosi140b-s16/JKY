So I started this review over a month ago, and I still can't get the Duck Breast Tacos out of my mind.

I don't remember much else at this point, except I got the Lazy Enchiladas and they were great too. But M got the aforementioned tacos, and their tender smoky goodness haunts me.

I need to go back as soon as M gets home.
