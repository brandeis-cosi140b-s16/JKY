Formerly El Cancun, Maria's Mexican Restaurant is worth the trip to the corner of South & Tyvola.  

The chips came out nice and warm and I don't know anywhere else you can get two ground beef tacos with a side of beans and rice for $7 that tastes like homemade Mexican cooking.  The sopapilla dessert for a little over $1, a quick little bite, is a perfect ending.

This place also seems popular with "boys" if you know what I mean.  They always find the cool places first!
