The only reason I don't give this place a 5 stars is because I love fries, and I didn't think no one or any place will change that. Well...I was wrong!!! I don't care for the fries seasoning they use, it didn't complement the taste of the burgers. That's why is a 4 for me. The burger,  though... To die for. I ordered a Beach House and it didn't disappointed me at all. I will recommend this place to my friends. And next time I will order the fries with no seasoning and my visit will be a 5 stars.
