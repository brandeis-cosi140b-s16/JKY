I don't care about putting mileage on my car to visit this place at least once a month. The food is that good. 

Now, one would think that since I'm from Tucson, there should be good mexican food right? There are, but not as good as Ochoa's! 

For me, It's all about the Tacos. Ground beef tacos (crunchy shell) with a side of rice, and cherry RC to drink. It's bliss. 

The ground beef is well seasoned and I have yet to come across a place that offers well seasoned meat that can be found at Ochoa's. The rice is perfectly cooked and has the right amount of salt. (Not hard and no flavor like many places offer) 

I give four stars as sometimes the servers being helpful or attentive is spotty.
