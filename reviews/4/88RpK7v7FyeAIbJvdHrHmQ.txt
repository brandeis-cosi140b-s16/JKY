Dona Maria's came highly recommended from Frommer's Las Vegas guide so my friends and I decided to head there for dinner before going to Talk of the Town which is within walking distance.

The restaurant itself is great.  Hearing the tamales were awesome I ordered a basket of 6 for myself (the price was very reasonable), while my friends picked dishes off the menu.  I quickly realized that ordering 6 tamales was a mistake as I was full and satisfied after 2.  Tamales I've had in the past have almost always been short on filling and disappointing- not these.  They are almost entirely filling and are excellent.  My friends were both satisfied with their menu dishes saying they were quite good.  The service kept us happy by refilling our chips and salsa very quickly throughout.

Typically Mexican food will destroy my intestines, and as I was going to a strip club right after I was somewhat nervous about eating here first.  Luckily I had no stomach problems- a true Vegas miracle and testament to how fresh and well prepared Dona Maria's food really is.

Dona Maria's is located north of the Stratosphere on Las Vegas Blvd.  I'd suggest taking a cab there and back since the area is kind of shady and the walk from here to the Stratosphere is deceptively long.
