Came with a groupon that I paid 16.00 for( with a promo code).  The groupon was for 6 tacos, 1 quacamole, and 2 sides.  

The guac was great, though I wasnt a fan of the chips.  They tasted store-bought, nothing fantastic.  Its a shame since they're making homemade tortillas for the tacos.  

My wife had 3 carne asada tacos.  She enjoyed them.  I had a shrimp, a baja fish and a chicken tinga.  I loved the baja fish, probably my favorite.  The chicken tinga was good too.  I wasnt a fan of the shrimp.  The shrimp were chopped up into tiny pieces and they were served on a huge flour tortilla.  The tortilla totally overwhelmed the small amount of shrimp.  The rice and whole black beans were good, very small portions of the sides.  

We left full so all in all a good value.  Not sure if I'd pay 4.00 for the fish taco, or 3.00 for a chicken taco.
