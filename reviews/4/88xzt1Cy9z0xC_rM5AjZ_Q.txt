Having lived in chandler for 13 years, I finally went to Serrano's in downtown Chandler.  I was so impressed by their story and how their family has been doing business in Chandler for years and how much they are involved in the community.  Their bean dip and salsa is to dye for!  The food was great and so was the manager and my server.  Going back for sure!
