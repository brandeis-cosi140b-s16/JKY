i've lived in vegas for almost a year and a half and i'm always feenin for some food from back home. so i was surprised when i found out there's a molcasalsa here. i was thinking "nah...it can't be the same molcasalsa in fullerton with superfries". so i made the long trek from henderson to almost-north las vegas. and they had superfries (a.k.a. carne asada fries)...i didn't order anything else...but they had plenty other items i didn't see on the menu in fullerton.
