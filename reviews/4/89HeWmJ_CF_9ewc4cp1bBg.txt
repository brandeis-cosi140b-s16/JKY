Chipotle!  What could be bad????  We went for Teacher Appreciation Night and what an awesome thing they do for educators!  BOGO!  We tried the sofritos which were amazingly good!  (Especially for meat eaters like us!!).  This location was BUSY for this special night but the line moved efficiently and everyone was really friendly and greeted us with a smile despite the crowds.  We'll definitely be back!  Only wish they were bigger!!
