$14 for 2 tacos :O
VERY GOOD FOOD, LOVE IT!!
EXPENSIVE! 
VERY DIRTY GLASS DOOR (all the time, I come here often)(stupid people pushing the glass instead of the metal bar to open door)
Flour tortillas are always a bit salty. Always. Sometimes way to salty. Whoever is monitoring the quality and taste of the food is *cough* not doing his job*cough*. 

With this prices they should DEFIANTLY hire someone to exclusively clean the floors, glass doors, wipe tables and empty those trash bins...I haven't been in the restroom but I'm almost sure is a disaster as well. 

Everything costs "extra" here geez!!

Overall:
-good food
-needs to improve in clearness (a lot).
-kitchen guys could drop the "I'm cool at my school" attitude and be more professional in customer service and handling the food, which leads me to think if they even passed their pro handling food test by the City.
