Went here with some coworkers on a business trip for lunch.  We picked it for the name.  The chips and salsa were good.  I got the quesadilla with chicken, it was good and was not too soggy.  The others in my party got tacos and said the guacamole sauce was a great compliment to the tacos.  The waitress seemed a little stressed, it was busy.  We got sufficient refills of chips, salsa, and beverage and it appeared other tables did too.
