Stopped at this place on a ride from Minnesota to Chicago, on my way back to california--the beacon of good mexican food in the US...so I was excited to see what this place had to offer! Very friendly staff and reasonable prices on  generous portions. We were started off with the customary chips and salsa, which was quite tasty, and then a fun treat--warm fluffy tortillas which we could put butter or sugar on. These were amazing...I liked this change. I was getting full by this point and the entree hadn't even been served. We also got some guac which was made in a cool manner with some great ingredients table side. Delicious. When my vegetarian tamales finally came, I was already pretty full and managed to eat half of one and a yummy corn cake. The tamale was a little spicy for my taste, but not bad. The margarita wasn't the most amazing, but also not bad. A good little experience passing thru Madison.
