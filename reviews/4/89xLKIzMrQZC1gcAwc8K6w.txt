Love to check out the local owned/opperated places.  We had heard wonderful things about the Gilbert location, and decided to try the one in Mesa.  We ordered food for my daughter basically right when we sat down, so that she would be eatting fast.  Was shocked at how fast her food came out.  Our food took a bit longer, as they were rather busy.  For the most part, everyone liked their selections.  My only comment is to be sure and read the beans that come with dinner.  I'm not a fan or refriend, and when I realized that...requested to change them.  Before they could switch, the food runner brought out our food.
