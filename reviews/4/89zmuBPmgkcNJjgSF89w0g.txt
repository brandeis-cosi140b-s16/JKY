Was in the area and needed a place to eat before dropping off my rental and decided to stop off at Tacos La Hacienda. 

Not much can be said about Tacos La Hacienda except that it's a converted lunch truck made into a "restaurant" with some patio furniture, a tarp to provide shade, and an old TV playing Univision. 

Tacos La Hacienda has all the items you would expect from a lunch truck - tacos, burritos, toratas, etc. Most items here are $5 and under and it seems like a popular spot as many people where parked here having a late lunch/early dinner. 

Looking over the menu - decided to get the chicken torta. The food took about 10 minutes but when I got it - was worth the wait. The torta was stacked with freshly grilled chicken and lettuce with a nice sauce to eat. They also grilled the bun and must have put butter on it as it gave a nice crispy buttery taste to the sandwich. The also had some house made sauce on the table that had a nice little bit to it and added a good amount of flavor. It was an excellent torta. 

As to ratings - it's a good cheap eats spot. Nothing worth driving to - but something worth considering if you're in the area. More like a 3.5 rating but wouldn't object to eating here again - so rounding up to a 5 star rating for Tacos La Hacienda.
