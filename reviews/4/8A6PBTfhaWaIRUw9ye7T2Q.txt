Have been here once.  Tastefully decorated.  Service was excellent; our water glass was never empty and server was friendly and helpful.  Salsa was good with a little heat.  Enchiladas were topped with a fried egg, and tasty.  Sopaipillas were served with the meal and very good.

My only complaint was that food was not served very hot, but somewhat lukewarm.  

We will return.  I would like to try the fried ice cream!
