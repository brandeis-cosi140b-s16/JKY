I've tried pretty much all of their burrito varieties. For the most part, they are the standard burritos you'd find anywhere. Pollo, carne asada, chorizo etc. They're DAMN GOOD though! As expected of a place named "The Burritos"! The Green and Orange are AWESOME. Be sure to try it since they add some great kick!

My favorite burrito is the CHILE RELLENO BURRITO. Even though I love meat, this thing blows the other burritos away! You could say it is a vegetarian burrito. HOWEVER IT HAS A GIANT CHILE PEPPER INSIDE IT!!! It basically goes from one end of the burrito to the other.

Chuck Norris himself can't beat that -  even with his Roundhouse Kick.

You must try it once!
