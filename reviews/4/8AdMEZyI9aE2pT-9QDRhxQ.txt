Pinatas is one of the few mexican restaurants with a 'modern' design. It's very refreshing to have zero = pinatas, blankets or sombreros on display.  Pinatas has more of a clean, minimal, slightly industrial look.
Pinatas menu offers slightly 'fancy mexican' entrees. Better quality items with alot less grease. My favorite dish is the spinach enchiladas! There are some awesome Happy hour specials, BUT, at the bar and on the patio beware of the blaring sun. Pinatas bar faces West. (Sunglasses Needed after 3pm).
FYI- possible melting and blindness may occur while chugging yummy margaritas.
