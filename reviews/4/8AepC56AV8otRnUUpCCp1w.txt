Crispy fish tacos! Hot salsa that is actually pretty hot. Nice clean salsa bar, nice clean restaurant. Service was a tad slower than on past visits, but everything was fresh, clean and crisp. 

I highly recommend the new avocado corn tacos! Ultra tasty.  Also glad they went back to battering their own Original tacos! Sad to see the Mahi Mahi go away, but it got replaced by Ono, so next visit I'll try those, grilled AND blackened - cuz that's how I used to enjoy the Mahi. 

Things I can complain about on this visit are: 
People need to learn to ROLL limes before slicing them...otherwise, getting the juice outta them is pretty unlikely without using the death grip that always ends with the juice right in yer eye!
Prices have gone up a bit...I understand fuel costs and all that but three bucks a taco is getting pricey. However, I'd rather the prices stay as high as they are rather than have freshness and quality suffer.
