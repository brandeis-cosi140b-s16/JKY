Came here based on other yelp reviews. We came in, the server was extremely nice and sat us instantly.


I ordered 6 various tacos. While getting our food took a little bit, it was well worth the wait.

Very flavorful. Unlike the other negative reviews, the meats were juicy and tender. Well worth it, and it seemed like good value for the money.

Chips and salsa was decent. I enjoyed the salsa as it was different from most places and still spicy and delicious.
