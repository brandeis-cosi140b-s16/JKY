Nothing like sitting at home in your pajamas, waiting for your Mexican food to arrive :) I couldn't decide between the carne asada burrito and the bean burrito, so I ordered them both, with a side of guacamole. I split them each in half and saved the rest for tomorrow. The bean burrito was REALLY good. As for the carne asada burrito, it was good but not as delicious as I was hoping. Maybe it's the quality of meat, but I really can't complain, it was very reasonably priced. The BEST part of the burritos are the tortillas. They are delicious! I will definitely order from them again, how can I not; they are fast, inexpensive and THEY DELIVER!!!
