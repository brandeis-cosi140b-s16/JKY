This place is really nice.  It's small, homey (not sure if that is a word), and tasty.  Got a chille rellano and a fish taco.  Both were really good.  Portions are huge so order carefully.  Also got a couple of New Mexico beers, their IPA is great, not bitter, virtually no after taste.  Spent 12 bucks if I remember right.  How do you beat that?  Great staff also, keep it up.
