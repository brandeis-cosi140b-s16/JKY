Onyoung Money knows what he's doing!!!

I finally made the trip across town to check out HanshikTaco and wonder why I didn't try it sooner

Today I had the "Nate" dog and the Chicken taco.  Both were spot on delicious.  

The chicken taco -  Has really nice heat, maybe too hot for some, but nothing out of control.  The crunch from the kimchi adds excellent texture.  For those who aren't familiar with korean flavors, gochujang (red pepper paste) is used in many dishes, and has nice notes of salt, heat, and almost a garlic taste.  The kimchi (cabbage) used at Hanshik is  a mild and balanced approach to what can sometimes be quite sour.  

The "Nate" dog - The best hot dog I've had in Vegas!  No, this is not the Chicago dog some of you may know.  This delectable treat features many of the same flavors found in the tacos.  It was cooked perfectly, and featured that crisp snap that all the best hot dogs have.  

The owner, whose name I forget, but am dubbing Onyoung Money, is a solid guy.  We spoke for a while, and it became obvious that this is someone who takes a lot of pride in his product.  Onyoung Money is a 5 star guy, running a seriously spectacular joint on wheels.

Even though I live across town, I will certainly be back.  Komsahamnida for the great lunch!
