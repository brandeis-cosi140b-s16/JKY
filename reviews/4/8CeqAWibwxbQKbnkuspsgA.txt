This place is the bomb. Their carnitas tacos are wonderful. I've tried many items on the menu and the only disappointment was the huevos rancheros. The chiliquilles are so good and you cannot beat the lunch special. Love it here. Families, friendly staff and great food. Prices so reasonable.
You'll love it. Not high on ambience but the food makes up for it.
