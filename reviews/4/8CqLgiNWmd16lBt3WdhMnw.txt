A week ago I came here on a date. I've always heard of this place yet never seemed to know where the heck it was. So we arrived, it was a tuesday night so it was pretty slow. 
The interior is small, cozy. Sorta dive bar-ish. Which is pretty cool. The prices aren't so dive bar-ish but the food was INCREDIBLE. Sooooo I guess you really do get what you pay for. 

All in all this is a great place for dinner, and I even hear that breakfast here is amazing. Although I do hope breakfast is cheaper. Dinner for 2 adults, one beer and one glass of wine with run you close to $50.
