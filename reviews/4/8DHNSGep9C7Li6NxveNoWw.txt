Looking for authentic Mexican food? Then this is the place... that you should not order from.  But! I still love Burrito Drive because it is fast and easy.  Usually I just create my own burrito, but if you're feeling sleezy, you can always try the White Trash Burrito, which features American delicacies such as Spam and Velveeta.
