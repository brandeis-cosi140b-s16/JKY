Nice people. Nice bakery section. Good food. 

Ordered tacos pastor. Good portion for the price. On the sweet side tho - I like mine with more of a spicier bite. Garnished with cilantro and onions. 

Ordered Huaraches with asada. Masa is tasty - good balance of that savory and sweet. I wished it was pan fried a bit to give it that crispy surface with a chewy center. Plus it would bring out some nice color too. 
Asada is seasoned well - more on the peppery side than others. 

Shoulda checked if they got elotes. Damn.
