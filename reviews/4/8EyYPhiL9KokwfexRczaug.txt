First discovered Cafe Rio when it was served as a catered lunch at a work training seminar. After I built and and ate my steak taco, I asked where this delicious food was from...it was from the location on Eastern, I later told my wife, "we must go to there!".

So glad they opened the location on Stephanie, now I only need to travel down the street to get my fix. Cafe Rio is kinda like In n' Out, there is always a line and it's always busy. Simple menu, fresh ingredients, and hand made tortillas from scratch...that alone should make you wanna go there, for me it's all about the tortillas. And they make them right in front of you...

My favorite is definitely the Pork Barbacoa burrito...sweet porky goodness, rice , black beans, queso fresco and pico wrapped in a fresh, warm tortilla. Muy Bueno! Get it enchilada style, you won't regret it (you might not finish it, but you won't regret it). My second choice would have to be the Fire-grilled Steak, very tender and juicy...get some chips, guac and the mint Limeade, and you're set (unless you decide to go to Yogurt-land next door after all that...,yum).

So, Cafe Rio is fabuloso! The food is delicioso!...okay, I'll stop . Try it, Chipotle's not the only game in town.
