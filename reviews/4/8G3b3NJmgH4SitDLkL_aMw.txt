I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE their adovado ribs! My husband and I have been going here for years. Love their new location. Much nicer patio area. I read on one of the reviews here that they use pre-made margarita mix, which is funny; I happen to love their margaritas.  Why not a 5-star rating, you ask, if I love so much about this restaurant. Their service is sometimes great, sometimes good, and sometimes a bit below average. Service isn't their strongest suit but since I go for the hot, spicy food, I consistently forgive their occasional inattentiveness:-)
