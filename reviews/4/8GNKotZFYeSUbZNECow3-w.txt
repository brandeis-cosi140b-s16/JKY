FOOD:  Delicious and uses traditional ingredients in a tasty, unique way.  The layered chicken enchilada and filet mignon tacos are my recommendation! The $34 Carne Asada seems a bit pricey -- the filet mignon tacos at $15 seem a better value.

AMBIANCE:  Beautiful! Can't wait to come back with friends and sit on the patio with libations & food.

SERVICE:  Need training - our waiter who took our order said rice was an additional charge then the server who brought out the food said it was included (we had ordered at side of rice and then both our plates already had rice!  However, to their credit, they waived the addtional charge for the side of rice - so, we'll be back).
