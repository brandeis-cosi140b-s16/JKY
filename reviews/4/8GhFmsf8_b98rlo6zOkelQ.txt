Stopped for a quick be to eat as the parking lot was full, and for good reason, the food and service were very good. 

We asked for a suggestion and ended up with the carna asada and chicken mix with flour tortias. The server checked in with us and left us alone otherwise. Food was hot and had just the right spices.

My favorite part was the chips and salsa. Probably some of the best I ever had.  We will be back.
