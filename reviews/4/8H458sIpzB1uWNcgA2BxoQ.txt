Loved this little Mexican bakery and resturant! The blackened fish taco was delicious and the staff were all very friendly and eager to help. Even though I was so full I could burst it was still fun to check out the little bakery and of course I had to take a few treats home for later. I live on the east side and El poblano will be my go to Mexican resturant now.
