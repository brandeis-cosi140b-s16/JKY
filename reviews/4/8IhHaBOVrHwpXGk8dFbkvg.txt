This is one of my favorite restaurants!  It is funky and fun with a great casual decor, and a friendly staff that does not turn over. They even remembered me when I was not able to go for six months!  They knew my drink, my usual seat, and what I usually ordered. 

Tuesdays offers Tappas and $5 Patron margaritas!  Breakfast is amazing, and dinner is as well.  But, come anytime.  You will LOVE this place!

Can I say anything more amazing about this place?   I had a grilled salmon with buffalo sauce the other evening.  It was deelish!  I had wondered if it would be too weird,  but it sounded sooo good, and it was!  The salmon and buffalo flavors blended perfectly.  Yummy!  The owner even bought me a drink, because I try to get everyone I know to this fabulous place.  I LOVE it!
