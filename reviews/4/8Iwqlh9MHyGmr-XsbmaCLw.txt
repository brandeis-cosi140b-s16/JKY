It's one of my favorite Mexican spots to eat at!

$3.99 foot long burrito is awesome. The taco platters are good too!

They have authentic Mexican food, at a very good price!

I've dined in, used the drive through, and ordered ahead. Each time my food is fresh and delicious!

I recommend this place to any Mexican Food lover!
