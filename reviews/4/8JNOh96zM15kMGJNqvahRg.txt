I ate at Black Chile Mexican Grill for the second time last night and it was again an outstanding meal!  The house made guacamole is terrific. You can absolutely tell it's made fresh in-house.  I had tacos, one fish and the other carne asada with the flour tortillas since those are also made fresh in-house throughout the day.  Both were amazing, you couldn't go wrong with either one and the beans and rice that come with the entree are fantastic.  And to top it off, the Strawberry Jalapeno Margarita is to die for!  The service was great both times and the manager Kevin also stopped by during the meal to check on how everything was.  Being in the industry myself, I like to see when the management stays in touch with their guests.  I will definitely keep recommending Black Chile to all my friends.
