I happened to eat here twice in two days.

The lunch menu is 5 stars!  For an app, we ordered guacamole, which they make in front of you at your table (I always love that).  It was one of the best guacamoles I've ever had!  
I got huevros rancheros and it was so good.  I cleared my plate!!  

The dinner menu wasn't as good  IMO, but it still offered a good selection of items I would order.  I wound up getting the veggie burrito.  It was ok - there wasn't any beans in it which I was kind of surpised about.  Usually veggie burritos = black bean burritos in my experience.  My margarita wasn't the best by any means.  I think I'll have the fajitas if I come back for dinner.
