I love chino's 7Q and 6 No beans and extra Pork Fried Rice. Thats my dish, its my love. I think everytime im back in phoenix i make a stop at chino's because it is that good. I love how you can get (almost) anything on the menu either in a burrito or quesadilla. That makes everything glorious..

So i guess you can be a skeptic at first, chinese and mexican food? yah i thought it sounded weird but EVERYONE i've taken there have always liked it!  This place is one of the best places to eat in phoenix. Very casual and its my favorite way of eating.. Pay first then after you can leave! no need to wait for someone to bring you your check.

If it is your first time going go to the side counter and let them know and they will let you sample the types of food they offer.

Don't expect people to wait on you hand and foot, this just isnt the place for that, if you want that kind of service go to Maggiano's (which is not the same cuisine fyi)
