We really enjoyed the new cactus margaritas!  So good. The Monterey chicken ranch fajitas were well worth the visit.  Grilled chicken breast with carmelized onions and smothered in Monterey Jack cheese and bacon.  The server was perfect!  The only complaint that I had is that the cheese dip is not free anymore. You still get free chips and salsa, though!
