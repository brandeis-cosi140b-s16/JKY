My husband and I were surprised to see the restaurant open up in this location and only recently checked it out for the first time.  We were pleasantly suprised.  

Great prices, super friendly staff, cheesy (but fun) atmosphere.  This has become a favorite lunchtime food grab for my husband as he also works in the area.  I'm happy to have found this little neighborhood gem!

FAVORITE FOODS SO FAR:  

Fish taco
Hot dog with feta cheese, tomato and pesto mayo (yummy)

Husband loves the Fat-Ass Burger


OtTHER PEOPLE'S POSTED CONS:

Yes it's small -- big deal
Yes it's cash only -- Slightly inconveniencing but I can live with this (as a small business owner myself who is getting eaten alive by credit card transaction fees). And geesh... they've even supplied an ATM inside the restaurant for the first timers who don't know any better.
