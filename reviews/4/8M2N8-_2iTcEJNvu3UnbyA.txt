I really like their fish tacos. I always order the fish tacos but this past week I ordered a burrito, OMGosh it was huge!! My son always gets the burrito so I had to try it! It was big enough for two people! I really loved it and the prices are affordable.  For the 3 of us the cost was $24.  Two big huge burrito's one fish taco, 2 bags of chips!
