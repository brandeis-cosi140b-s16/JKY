I was torn between a 3 and a 4 star but I thought I would be generous. 

This place or should I say the Sonora Hot Dogs came highly recommended. It is a little hole in the wall Mexican joint that looks like an old Taco Bell. The counter girl was friendly and cheerful. I had 2 hot dogs, an asada taco, and a bottle of coke. What the hell it's a new and a new budget for calories, right!!!!! The dogs where really good and different, nice twist, really love the bun. This thing is filled with bacon, beans, mild peppers, cheese, mustard, mayo, oh and a hot dog. Oh, I should not forget the say the the dog is on special Thursdays.
