Excellent. Basically Chipotle but with a larger menu and its a local chain, not a national one. The cheese dip has some kind of lime in it and my friend didn't like it, I loved it. To each his own. The burrito was fat packed and dripping with goodness. Absolutely going to become my go to for mexican, as I enjoyed this restaurant better than Chipotle and Roberto's by a large margin.
