Good guac at this place... spicy salsas too. Taqueria Canonita is one of my favorite mexican spots in vegas. I love the location- inside the venetian shops and open air to the gondolas. You can sit right at the edge and see the gondolas go by and sing. All of the food that I've had here was good quality, good size portions (I'm usually STUFFED when I leave here), and tasty margs.

Definitely will come back again and again when I am in vegas.
