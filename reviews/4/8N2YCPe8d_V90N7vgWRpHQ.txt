We decided to stop here after checking out the Grand Ave festival. We ordered the Carne asada taco plate long with the Loco elote.  The meat was tender and flaoverful, only.lacking some salt. Beans and rice were just okay. The corn was tasty and to the point.  All in all this place is worth trying if you're in the area.  I wouldn't  take a special trip out here just for the food.  Friendly staff is why I opted to give 4 stars instead of 3!
