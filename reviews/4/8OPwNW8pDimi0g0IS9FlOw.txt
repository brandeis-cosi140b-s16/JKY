This place is quickly becoming one of my favorites. North Scottsdale definitely needed a place like this and this is closer to my house than Filiberto's in the Pavillions.

I judge a Mexican restaurant by its carne asada burrito and was not disappointed here.  My son gets the carne asada fries and they always look tasty but I haven't tried them yet.

Excellent consistent food, great specials such $1.99 burritos on Monday and 99 cent tacos on Wed's. they have buy one get one free burrito coupons on their website. Always clean and no complaints about the people behind the register.
