Mi Pueblo is very flavorful.  The ambience is horrible.  It's located in a strip mall on the outskirts of Metro Center.  Spinach enchilada's are some of the best I've had.  I'm a professional Cheese Enchilada eater :)  When I find a place that meets my standards I GO BACK!!!  I will go out of my way to eat a Mi Pueblo.  Just don't take a date there because she will think your a cheapskate.  You can keep this place as your secret.
