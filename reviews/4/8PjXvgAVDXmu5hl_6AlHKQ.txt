This place is a hidden gem, although I think it's going to get popular real soon.  Note to all people trying to find this place, it's a permanent FOOD TRUCK where you sit under a tent.  Don't go looking for a brick and mortar restaurant because you'll never find it.  

Delish:  Nogales Dog with everything, asada burrito, and nachos.  

Order from the guy that's usually there, grab your drinks out of the ice chest, wander over to the white cooler filled with toppings then have a seat and wait for them to bring your food.  You pay after you are done.  Love this place!
