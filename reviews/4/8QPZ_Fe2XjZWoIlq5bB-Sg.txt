I gotta give them props and bump them up a star. El Pollo Loco is still my healthy lunch of choice in this armpit of the city. It's kinda like a shaved armpit now instead of a musky, hippy armpit. At least in regards to EPL that is. 

They have booted the homeless crew who use to reside here AND remodeled the interior of the restaurant which created a brighter and more spacious environment for grubbin'.

*Salsa bar is clean and full (until I get a hold of it)
*Staff is on point even if they still say," Hi-Me your order is ready". I'm cool with that. Makes me feel all Bon Qui Qui inside. 
*Food here is consistantly delicious and fresh. 
*They have a loyalty card that seems to equal a free $5 salad for me once a month. Boo ya!!!!

Yeah, they are on their game right now and I'm likin' it. Only thing I don't get is this. They started selling smoothies and slushy coffee drinks. Why don't they have a Horchata flavor ice-blended drink? Wouldn't that make more sense? I know this Ranchero would be all up on it on Cheat Day.
