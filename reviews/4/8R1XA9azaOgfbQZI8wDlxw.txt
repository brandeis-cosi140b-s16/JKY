The food is excellent! Carne Asada  smells and tastes delicious, tacos are big, the pastor meat was very good too, place was busy but worth the wait! Only thing is not they don't have  servers, you order and pay they give you a plastic number and someone brings you the food, i say is a great place and meal for the price, elote (corn on the cob) are great!
