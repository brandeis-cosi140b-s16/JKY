We grabbed lunch to go last week and it was great.  Lots of vegetarian options on their menu.  I had the Vegetarian Burro with a cilantro tomatillo sauce on it that was amazing.  My husband ordered the chicken burro with traditional enchilada sauce and said it was great.  My son who ate free because he's under 5 had a really great quasadilla kids meal with rice, beans and a drink.  Our entire meal came to about $12!  

We'll be back for sure, it's a better and less expensive option then Rubios or Baja Fresh which it's the most similar too.  If you're looking for quick, tasty, and inexpensive this is your best bet in the area.
