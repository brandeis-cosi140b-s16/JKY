I'll admit... when a friend picked this as a place for dinner, I was dubious given the 3 star-ness awarded by Yelp.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  

We arrived early and opted to sit at the bar for a bit.  Margaritas were quite good!  Certainly not the best I've ever had but definitely acceptable.  I suspect they may add a wee bit of crack to their tortilla chips because they were ridiculously addictive.  The hot sauce was quite good as well.  

I ordered a rice and beans burro, enchilada style.  While it could have used a bit more sauce, all components were good and melded quite well together.  

Service was a little slow but as we sat in the bar, I find that to be an acceptable compromise.  It's cute inside and has a great patio.  It's extremely affordable as well - margs were $3 during happy hour.  

I'm not in this neighborhood very often, but I wouldn't hesitate to eat here again.
