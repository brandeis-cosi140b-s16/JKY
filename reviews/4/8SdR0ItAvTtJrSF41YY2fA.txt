We  both liked this place, but I definitely like it more than my wife. Fun outdoor patio, really nice but we sat indoors. We split the grilled Romain salad which was delicious ...Yum...  especially the black beans. Whatever you do, try the Grilled Street Corn, it was the best corn we've ever eaten! The Roast Corn Gordita were delicious too and the Marinated Jidori Chicken good. My wife's Mahi mahi fish tacos were really the only thing that were just okay. But the presentation of everything was beautiful and the service was excellent even though the place was really really busy on a Sunday night. The seating is kind of crammed and jammed in... it was a little like we were sharing conversation with both of the couples on either side of us so that's the only not perfect part of the atmosphere. But it's a lively place an we think it's worth a try if you like latin flavors.
