This cute little food cart appeared in front of my office yesterday (corner of Whitney Way and University Avenue) so a few of us wandered down to check it out!  The unassuming trailer had a hand written menu on a whiteboard and one guy inside taking orders AND making the food (fresh with each order I might add).  So the cart was slow, but well worth the wait!  I went for the $9 chicken enchiladas with rice and beans and they were OUTSTANDING!  An appropriately hot verde sauce topped the fantastic puled chicken wrapped in a authentic corn tortillas.  Lots of toppings included Mexican cheese, lettuce, tomato, and a spicy sour cream drizzle.  There was so much food in there that it's my lunch again today!  If you see this little cart, don't let the simple exterior fool you....they saved all the energy for making the fantastic food!!!!!
