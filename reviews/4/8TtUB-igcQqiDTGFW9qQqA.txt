This place looks like a whole lot of nothing from the outside.  You might be expecting a Filberto's level experience.  Instead, I got a little bit of a wow.  (Note: wow was not capitalized or followed by exclamation point. This is the wow of, "wow, this place isn't too bad".  Not the wow of "WOW! I get the whole lobster dinner for $1!")

You're going to have your basic tacos and burritos for sure, but this place also had seafood.  I already have a mini-list of stuff to try for next time.  Oysters(6 for 6.99), ceviche tostadas(2.79), 7 Mares soup (7 kinds of fish/seafood) (10.99), Empanizados (10.99) and even a whole fish (11.99).  Someone got this massive plate of shrimp and beef fajitas that looked at least 2 times bigger than anything I'd seen come out of a standard sit down restaurant - and it smelled awesome.  They even do breakfast - with Huevos Rancheros w/ Rice and Beans coming in at a cool $3.99.    

They tell you on the menu that food is prepared fresh every day, and one bite of a tortilla will tell you that for sure.  WOW.  (Yes, it's that kind of wow good.) This is so good you KNOW it's bad for you.  And by the way, they have 18 different kind of burritos, none of them over $4.29 - including Chile Relleno, Al Pastor, Lengua and Fish - and any of them can be done "Wet" or Chimi style.  

As for a setting, walk up counter - where you also pick up your food.  Cloth covered tables (covered in glass for easy cleaning) on saltillo tile with carved and brightly painted wooden chairs.  They have a juke box and a mini salsa bar that includes lemons, jalapenos and de-skinned cucumber slices.

My last 2 thoughts on the place?  Mexican coke in the bottle.  Full bar.  

Wow.
