I'm giving the restaurant a 4 for service, location and food. We had a work event at this restaurant during the day time (it was a lot more open since it was a weekday) with about 30 people. 

We were able to choose from a four course menu and, as we were choosing, we had chips and salsa that were very tasty.

For the first portion of the course, you had the option of either the Caesar salad or the cilantro cream soup.  I had the Caesar salad. It was an interesting take on the salad because it was a wedge with what looked like a fried chip (it was a sheet of fried cheese). There was also an anchovy on the side (that wasn't my cup of tea). Overall, it was pretty good. 

For the second portion, I got the carnitas. It was good, especially with the lime. It was a little messy to eat though. 

For the third, I ordered the chicken enchiladas. Not my favorite of the four I received... It needed some spice to it. 

The flan was amazing! I am pretty picky with flan since my dad makes the best kind in my opinion but this flan was not too sweet and not too thick! Definitely perfect ending to a very large meal. 

At the end of our course, the chef came out to introduce himself and thank us for coming. The waiters throughout the stay continued to fill our waters and they were very good at making sure we were okay. I definitely appreciated the service here!

The location was awesome! We were upstairs and there's a balcony overlooking the Linq area and the High Roller. Mind you, this was in the morning so I'm sure it is a beautiful spot at night. It's definitely a great restaurant and I disagree with the reviews given so far. 

As far as price, I'm not very sure.
Since it was a work event I'm not sure how much our management paid. However I'm assuming it was affordable. The plates were small but after eating that four course meal I was definitely super full!! So it's worth it. 

I believe this place deserves more than just 2-3 stars!
