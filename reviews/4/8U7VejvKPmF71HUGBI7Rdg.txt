My first stop in Vegas, fresh off the plane. After checking into our hotel, we were starving and didn't want to stray too far. We ran into this place!

No wait. We were seated immediately and greeted by our server within a minute or two. The atmosphere is pretty cool - it screams "Mexican restaurant" honestly. It's a cantina so it makes sense - what else would you expect?

My meal was actually pretty good. Three steak tacos with beans and rice. Everything was hot. The steak seemed to be real steak cooked on a grill - not some bs that had been sitting around. 

We ordered a pitcher of margaritas. For $36 I thought it was a bit overpriced but honestly, what do you expect? You're eating at a restaurant that sits less than 20 feet from the Strip. Of course the booze is going to be pricey. Other than that my steak tacos ran for $17 and my fianc√© ordered the special which was $10-$15. With those, our pitcher of margarita and tip, the bill came to around $80 for two people. Again, for a meal right in the heart of the Strip, it seemed pretty decent. Had we not gotten the pitcher of booze our bill would have barely been $40. 

I will give them credit though - they make a good margarita. This was no cheap drink. It wasn't made with margarita mix out of a bottle from s grocery store. It had top shelf tequila (I forget the brand) and the right mixture of sour and all of that. We left after one pitcher feeling full and a bit buzzed. 

I'm also reading a lot of other reviews mentioning poor service. I have to be honest, prices and food aside, our service was good. Our waiter was quick and checked on us a few times to see if we needed anything. Honestly, no issues in that department - maybe we were just lucky!
