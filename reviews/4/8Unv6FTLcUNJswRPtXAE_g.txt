So after driving by several time I have finally decided to stop into the Loco Lime. My roommate and I were on the hunt for some early morning food and drink and this place was close. It's pretty interesting that you have to go around back to get to the entrance and also the building is shared with the Kickstand pub.

The have a pretty awesome vegetarian menu. I ordered the veggie enchiladas minus the queso and they were fantastic! Their salsa is also tasty, however contains no heat and I would say the same thing about the jalape√±o margaritas.

The seating was nice. The wait staff polite. The bathrooms clean. All this and the prices were a little better than many of the other "Mexican" places I have been in Charlotte.
