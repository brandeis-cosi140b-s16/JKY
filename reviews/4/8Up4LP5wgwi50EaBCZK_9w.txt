When the craving hits for a hearty burger, terrific fries, and a rich and thick milk shake, this is where I go. The place has the comfortable look and feel of an old-fashioned mom 'n pop burger stand, with friendly service to complement the tasty fare. A big plus for me: gluten-free buns are available!
