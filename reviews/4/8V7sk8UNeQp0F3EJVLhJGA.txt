Wow, for the price and quality, I am hooked.  

In town visiting my mom-in-law and was out running some errands.  So I treated her for lunch.  We both had tostada a la carte.  I had the beef and bean and she had the bean.  It came loaded with lettuce and tomato...

My lunch was really flavorful.  The beef is nicely marinated.  I also had the chicken taco and it was just perfect.  Both were served and it was nice and hot when it came out to us.  I love that!  My pet peeve is hot food coming out warm or room temp!  Thank you Nino's!   Have told my husband, so...we will stop by one more time before heading back to the OC.
