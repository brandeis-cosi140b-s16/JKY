Tried out this food truck last night. We have driven by so many times and finally decided to stop. We tried the chicken quesadilla, three street tacos (chorizo, pollo asado & pastor) and the Burrito Loco w/ adobada.  Our favorite was the pastor taco with pineapple. So good! We will definitely be back to try some more. Everything was fresh and flavorful. Watch out. The guacamole is a bit spicy.
