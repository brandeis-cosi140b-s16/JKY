I recently moved away from my favorite grungy Mexican food source, Filipitos.  So I'm on the prowl for a new place.  Enter Amigos.  The place is tucked inside a strip mall, an inconspicuous looking place, typical for the valley.  The decor is what one would expect from a Mexican place catering to Americans.  Couple this with the claim of being the "best Mexican food in the valley", who doesn't make that claim?  My expectations where low.  

I ordered the Green Chili Chicken Enchilada plate, to-go.  Sounds good, a bit safe (it is easier to gauge a place by trying something you are familiar with).  When I got home & opened the box, I was confronted with a familiar sight and sound.  Nothing about the food is standing out.  And that's a good thing.  They aren't trying to be some hoity toity place.  This is cheap Mexican food.  Perfect!  

First up the re-fried beans. Ick!  Talk about a bland experience.  I'll pass on these from here on out.  Next the rice....Now that's some good rice.  Great texture, not a dry grain in the bunch.  It wasn't soggy either and had a great flavor.  Now on to the enchilada.  First this looked more like a wet burrito than an enchilada.  The green chili sauce was sparingly ladled on.  Not a minus, just a note.  The chicken though.  Oh, mostly white meat & cooked just right.  The flavor of the chicken was great. It was not drowned out by sauce. (Now you know why having less sauce was a good thing.)  It was clearly the center of this meal.  

The restaurant offers 3 salsas. (A green and red at the self serve bar, a Habanero you have get from the cashier)  The two from the bar are typical.  But a must.  The habanero though.  SPICY HOT.  I love hot, hot and more hot!  So this was right up my alley.  But for those with a less than iron stomach.  Use sparingly or not at all.

All in all, I'm impressed with my new Mexican food source.  I will be coming back.
