Pros-

Good location, not in a congested part of Old Town
Good service
Had the Chilean Salmon which was unbelievable
Table side Guac which is awesome
Tasty Margaritas

Cons-

A bit pricey 
Gets a little claustrophobic inside
Very noisy on a Saturday night

Will definitely go back and try the tacos and get some more ritas.
