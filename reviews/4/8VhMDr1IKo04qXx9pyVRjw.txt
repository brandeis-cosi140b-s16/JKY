I can't believe this is the first time I've written a review for Barrio Cafe' it's on our rotation of favorites and a must when we have out of town visitors.  It was announced this week that Chef Silvana is a 2010 James Beard Award semifinalist. There's good reason for this accolade, Barrio is quite simply the best fine cuisine Mexican restaurant I have ever enjoyed.  The Compound in Santa Fe comes close, but where they score slightly upwards on high-concept, she beats them on complex flavor profiles.  Ingredients literally party like its 1999 in your mouth.  Tried the pomegranate margarita for the first time and though tequila is not generally my friend, I was impressed with the flavor, and of course, the resulting high-spirits. A warning,  A busy night might stress you out and the parking is crap but every time we've gone, we've loved it.
