This was our second time here.  We've enjoyed the food and Happy Hour, but HATE their so-called reservation system.  Don't make a reservation through their "Reserve a Table" link on their website or OpenTable and expect to actually have a reservation.  When we arrived at our reservation time we were advised that they don't really take reservations and that our table would be ready in 30-40 minutes.  Perhaps they should let their customers know this when accepting reservations.
