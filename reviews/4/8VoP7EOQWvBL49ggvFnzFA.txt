I stop in for lunch here a lot.  They are very good about getting you through the line quick and have a great quality meal.  I enjoy the steak tacos and burrito bowls.  
The entire restaurant was very clean.  There is plenty of space for seating and the high top seating is nice for single eaters.  Very consistent with different items and always enjoyed my meals.
