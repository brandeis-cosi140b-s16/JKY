My mom asked me where I wanted to go for dinner this evening. And El Tlacoyo popped in my head. I haven't been here since I was like 12 years old and everything I had today reminded me why this place has stuck in my mind.  

This place is in a little strip mall and there is a nicest girl attending all the tables. She paid great attention to every guest. 

So now to the food, this place is authentic food of the state of Hidalgo, Mexico so it's pretty spicy. Since my mom is vegetarian We had huaraches with cactus (nopalitos) which was perfect, just like my Nana cooked them. The nopalitos were tangy and cooked perfectly. We also got a quesadilla with huitlachoche and a quesadilla with pumpkin flower, I would highly recommend the pumpkin flower. The taste was subtle and a nice contrast to the salsa. In addition to that I had the BBQ lamb taco, this did make me disappointed because the lamb was very dry and under seasoned. 

All in all if you aren't afraid of spice and want epic Mexican food this is the place. Beware they are closed on Wednesdays.
