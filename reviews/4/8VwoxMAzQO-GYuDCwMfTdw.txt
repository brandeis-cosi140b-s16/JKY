The absolute best chile rellano I have ever eaten.  This had cheese, pine nuts, and a great sauce.  I had to ask for a spoon so as to get all the great sauce. Food is a 5+ star rating.    Wife had a mango, chicken, and avocado salad.  Ambiance, waitstaff, and prices are 4 star.  Our booth was in the center courtyard, which is actually inside but looks like a charming outdoor plaza in Mexico.  A great place to enjoy a leisurely meal.

We love Tia Rosa and go here every time we visit the Phoenix area.  It is a must place

UPDATE: October 2013  We tried the little takeout place in front of the parking lot.  It was probably the best takeout Mexican I have ever had.  The takeout it probably 5 star by itself.  My only complaint is that they do not feature the chile rellano here.  Darn!
