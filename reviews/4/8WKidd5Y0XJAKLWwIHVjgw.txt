Just ate dinner here. It was pretty good. 
Chips and Salsa were good with two choices of salsa.
I ordered the Enchilada sampler. It was good and was extra, extra cheesy. Which is a huge plus because I love shredded cheese!
Service was fast and prompt. They were right there for refills on all of our drinks.
Prices were very reasonable.
Could not drink due to work. But seems like they have a good drink 
menu.
