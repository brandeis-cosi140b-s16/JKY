I'd been in Charlotte for over a week, and hadn't had the chance to try any non-chain restaurants until Sunday night.  Fonda las Cazuelas is delicious!  I had a seafood dish called the 2 Devils (I think), and it was so fantastic.  I'm still thinking about the sauce the large shrimp and white fish were cooked in, a little spicy, very savory and so yummy.  The guac was super good, too...really fresh and handmade.  A couple fo Dos Equis, a couple shots of tequila, and great service...I'm hooked, Fonda las Cazuelas!
