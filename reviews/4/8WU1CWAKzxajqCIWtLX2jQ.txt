Alright, this place is my go to place for simple fish tacos. They have a hilarious young staff of what appears to be high school kids enjoying their first job. They do their job in style and look like they are happy to serve you. The place is always clean and is constantly being swept and mopped as customers come and go. 

One of my favorite things about this place is the salsa bar. They have a salsa verde that I can't get enough of. I always get extra chips to keep snacking. Sometimes I'll get chunky mild salsa to switch it up, but the verde is where it's at.

The fountain machine serves a unique option, vanilla coke, and no this is not one of those all in one coke machines.My main complaint about this chain is that that some of the best items in the menu get taken away... If you have been here before, you might remember a mango habanero version of their tacos and burritos. This is no longer an option.

Don't have me fall in love with an item and just take it away. I know this must have been a corporate decision, but still!!!

Regardless I will be back for $1.50 fish taco Tuesdays. Never forget Taco Tuesdays!
