Though the service was slow at the beginning, the place was crowded and had to wait 15 minutes.  Ordered the carna asada steak and my friend ordered the shredded beef chimi, both were really good.  The plates didn't look sloppy but appetizing.  The salsa and chips were also good, they add some herbs to their thick salsa which is pleasant.  Didn't order drinks but they seemed very reasonable.  Rita's for 5 bucks and they looked legit.  Look forward to going back.
