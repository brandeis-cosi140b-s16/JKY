I live next door to the TeePee. I've only lived here a year but I've fallen in love with the place. The service is hit or miss, the chips are at times stale, but it's a neighborhood staple. I don't go out to eat to nitpick everything apart in order to leave a scathing yelp review. I go out to enjoy myself. Go to TeePee with plenty of time, enjoy the greasy Mexican food and cheap margaritas, and keep the stick outta your ass. Otherwise don't come here. That way there's a booth for me.
