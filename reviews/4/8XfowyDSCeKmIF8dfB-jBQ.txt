whoever said it was the best damn chorizo is right. so good its only right that carolinas is located in so phx. 

my friends and i went probably during the worst possible time for our first taste, during lunch hours (noon) and the place was PACKED. standing room only. we hoovered around people for a bit and managed to grab a table right when our food was up (which took about 15 minutes). the line to order was pretty quick though.

i got a deep fried red chile burrito and my friends got tacos, a tamale, and an oaxaca burrito (chorizo with beans, potatoes, and cheese). that oaxaca was the best damn burrito i've ever had and am sad i didn't order it myself. my deep fried burrito was steaming hot and hard to eat so a quarter of the way through i gave up and just used a fork. i like my meat shredded, not chunky, but these chunks were tender and NON-FATTY. yes, that's right, not a single piece of fat in mine. amazing. the tacos were a little soggy but delicious none-the-less, their tortillas are amazing. i didn't get to try the tamale but my friend said it was definitely a winner. 

their fountain machine rocks. they have your usual mexican drinks on one side and pepsi products on the other. i got to mix in a little pepsi with my horchata and it is my new drink of choice.

carolinas is a must-eat for any mexican foodie.
