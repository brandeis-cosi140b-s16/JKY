Normally when I go here I only get a few things one being the asada fries. These things are awesome. Possibly the best ones I have had here. Every time I have ever been there it has been packed even at like 1 am so the rest of the food can't be that bad. 

The restaurant it's self is not in the best condition. It's in an older building. So don't expect to much from the decor. Service is nothing exceptional either. But in the taste category I cant get enough.
