After a long day on our business trip in Phoenix, my friend and I looked up a good place to relax and hang out for dinner and came across Mission on Yelp. We decided to stop by this place at around 6pm and, boy...this place was full aleady! There was a line already coming out of the restaurant...and as we inquired, it would already be another 1.5 hr of wait time! Luckily, there was just the last 2 spots left at a bar, so we decided to just grab those spots to forgo the actual restaurant seatings. There at the bar, we were able to order restaurant food as well....so we opted for (...ready for this?....*drum rolls**):

appetizer:
table-top guacamole
crispy pork
pork belly

main course:
duck confit
pork taco

dessert:
pumpkin bread pudding with fresh pomegrenate toppings

yea...I know...we were total pigs..but hey..the food was so good!! They brought out all the ingredients and customized the table-top guacamole for us according to how spicy we wanted it and what we wanted in there. The crispy pork/pork belly were also bite sizes (though still in good portions!)...and were delicious treats to us! I love the food there so much even though after eating all those dishes...I felt like I could never really have any Latin American/Mexican food for the next few months! The biggest let down though was the pumpkin bread pudding. It really didn't taste like bread pudding at all. It tasted more like pumpkin bread soaked in some sort of syrup and just topped with fresh pomegrenate seeds.  If I ever get to go there again, I would just skip desserts and only go for appetizers/main coruses there. Total damage to our wallet (e.g. cost without tip) was around $130, including soda/2 cocktails.

By the time we left (8:30pm), the bar/restaurant were both completely packed! I saw a couple waiting for a table just anywhere (bar/restaurant) and I felt like they must have been waiting at least 1+ hour! yikes!!

so...suggestion to all,...go early! eat lots..and be merry! :)
