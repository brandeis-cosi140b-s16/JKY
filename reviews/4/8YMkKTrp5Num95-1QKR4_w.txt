OK the food rates 5 stars but this is just a very small strip-mall joint, with a little more space it would be 5-star. I was taken there by a good friend for lunch who lived in New Mexico and offered that this is typical NM fare. I tried the Navajo Taco as suggested, and it was great. Mine was with the Pork Verde, the "taco" is Indian Fry-Bread and it was a sort of a tostada - but on steroids. The service was fast and friendly. The place was packed - with a line out to the door by 1pm. So if you are having lunch get there early. Aclear indication that this is the real-deal. If you are looking for something a bit different than the usual Mexican, Tex-Mex grub, this is the go-to place. You will not be disappointed. Not to mention that the cost is reasonable. I plan to go back often.
