I visited Cantina 1511 for a Saturday lunch and ordered the enchiladas de Dennis.  Although the flavor was warm and inviting it did not wow the palate.  The food seems to be very 'visitor friendly'.  It is as one would expect for TexMex, not a traditional enchilada but also not bold or daring in its ingredient selection or spices.  

Service was adequate as it was not very busy around 1 PM on a Saturday. We were seated in the front of the restaurant closest to the road.  I'm not sure if the guys at the table next to us just had large lungs with voices that carried or if the room could have used some sound barriers because I could hear their conversation better than our own!
