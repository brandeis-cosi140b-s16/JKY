I've heard a lot about this restaurant from my San Diego friends and I'm glad I finally got to try it.  The lines when we got there on Sunday at 1 was crazy but by the time we got our food and finished eating at 2:15 the line was just at the door. 

The restaurant has a interesting setup in that different lines serve only certain types of meat.  So the spicy pork is in a different line from the carne asada.  The tacos are typical small sized and most guys in our group had about 6-7 and I had 9. 

My Favs:
Spicy Pork
Lengua - tender but still has that tongue texture

Decent:
Carne Asada - a bit dry and not as much flavor
Cabeza - slightly on the fatty side imo
Tripe

Didn't like:
Pork Shoulder - I thought it was too salty and the meat was dry
Carne Asada fries
