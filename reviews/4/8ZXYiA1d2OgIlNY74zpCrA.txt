Stopped into Moes for the first time today for lunch and got a steak bowl.  They are WAY more generous with portions of proteins than Chipotle.  The options are also more varied...mushrooms, onions, peppers, cilantro.... than their neighbor.  It feels like Chipotle has been my fling but Moes and I could go steady but for the 'welcome to moes' thing every time someone walks in the door.
