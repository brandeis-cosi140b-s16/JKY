I was a bit hesitant about this place. It was pretty full of preppy kids all out getting drunk. But then, every other place nearby was the same thing due to the NCAA Play Offs down the street.

Well, I ended up in a secluded corner on the second floor. Despite the crowds and the fact that she had a twelve person table next door, the server was actually quite attentive. 

Drinks were reasonably priced. And the food, while not even close to authentic Mexican, was enjoyable. There were a lot of enjoyable flavor combinations that went down quite well. 

I will visit again when I'm in town.
