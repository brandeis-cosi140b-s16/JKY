You haven't eaten here yet? Seriously? Why not?

I'm trying to save my five stars for truly supernatural experiences but La Mestiza comes close. I may even upgrade after another visit.

This is some of the most delicious Mexican food I've ever had. Fresh ingredients, well seasoned with everything cooked to just the perfect consistency and texture. Featuring some less common menu items, beyond your enchiladas and your fajitas: they've got cactus on the menu; chilaquiles; queso fundido; rabbit; and cotija cheese that, while it's becoming more common, is still strangely missing from many Mexican restaurants.

I had the veggie enchiladas with pumpkin-seed mole sauce. Â¡Delicioso! We split the guacamole (fresh, yummy, and served in a nifty cold-stone dish). They have Pacifico on tap so I snagged one of those too.

Our server did this odd thing where he would hover, decide he didn't want to interrupt our conversation, and then turn around and walk away just as we were ready to give him our attention. But we weren't in a hurry, so it was more endearing than anything else.

Really happy this place is just down the road from me. I am quite sure I will be back.
