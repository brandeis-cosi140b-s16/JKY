I have some buddies that came up this weekend to celebrate ST. PATRICK'S DAY.  So where better to have a St. Paddy's day then Roberto's Taco Shop?  I told them that for Cinco de Mayo they will come back for a trip to a British Pub to have a pint of Guinness.  Anyhow, here is my review:

We checked out the menu that was here on Yelp!  and decided what we wanted before we came.  So, that's a bonus.  I ended up getting the 2 taco combo meal and a bean and cheese burrito.  I wasn't crazy about the tacos but the burrito was great.  A couple of my friends had the same thing and another had a torta.  She raved about it.  So, next time I go that will be the move I make.  We got our meals to go and they gave us all of the sides we needed.  

So, it was a 4 star experience and I'll be back as it is relatively close to home.
