Great alternative to my usual burrito stops. Fun stop to take in the SouthEnd scene. The BBQ chicken burrito is my go-to. I would stick with the tacos or burritos as the quesadillas are a bit boring. Chips and queso are very reasonably priced, but the chips are just a bag of Tostitos. 

Be prepared for a long line any time of day for the next year as all the surrounding construction crews pack this place. 

Nice outdoor seating nestled between the light rail and Camden road.
