Visited this place a few weeks ago with a friend....it was the first time there for both of us. 

This place was all around fantastic.

Our server, I believe his name was Josh, was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly from the first time he came up throughout the entire dinner.  

Our waters were constantly filled....which is a huge deal to me.

We had their bacon guacamole, a shishito roll, some tasty crab noodle dish, their tacos,salmon nigiri....all delicious and would have them again.  They had great flavors and some fun new things to try. The peach margarita was one of the best I've had.  It was actually frozen like a smoothie....it didn't melt in a minute.

We sat at the sushi bar, which is nice if you're in a group of 2.  The manager came by and was super courteous and talked a few minutes with us.  We complemented our waiter...it was all around great service and a wonderful dining experience.  We both agreed that we'd be back :)
