We went in the Silverton Casino to get our BASS PRO SHOPS on, and we stopped by this mexican restaurant. Good decor - fun, lively. The food was not stellar, but it was good--good salsas, good tacos (go soft taco, the hard shells were like store-bought Ortega or something) and an excellent cheese enchilada. I liked that the portions were not ridiculous-fat American size but then considering that they were smaller portions, the price was pretty high - $15 for each entree.
