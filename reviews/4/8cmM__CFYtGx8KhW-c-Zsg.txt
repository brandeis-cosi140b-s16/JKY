Great food! Rude girls at register. This was our first time and we really liked how fresh the food tasted and it came fairly quickly for how busy they were.... But, the (young) girl at the front counter register had a disrespectful tone, rolled her eyes and then smirked when I was mistaken about what comes with something I was trying to order.  I was truly perturbed with how rude she was, as if we were inconveniencing her(isn't that why they are needed?).
We had Chicken Enchiladas, Shrimp Enchiladas, Shrimp Tacos and Fish Tacos and all were quite tasty.
