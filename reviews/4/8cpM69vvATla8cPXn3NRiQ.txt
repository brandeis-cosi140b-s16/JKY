Food was good, we ordered breakfast burritos, steak and eggs, and it was all tasty. The inside only has 5 tables so it's probably better for takeout. Staff was friendly and on top of things. Nothing really stood out for me that would make me go out of my way to come back here but it was good, glad I tried it.
