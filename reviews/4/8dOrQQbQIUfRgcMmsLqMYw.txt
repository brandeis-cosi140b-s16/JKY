This is.a gem in a part of town where you will have a hard time finding fresh, delicious food. Taco frontera scores on all fronts. Great selection of real Mexican food, prepared fresh and fast. My very picky eater 11 year old son loved the quesadillas and wanted me to rate it a 4.5! I had the carne asada. Very nice, but I regretted not having tried the tacos or Cubano. Will definitely come back if we are in this area again. Loved the fresh tamarind drink. I'm holding back a star only because I'm comparing with great Mexican fast food sampled all over the country, especially from San Diego.
