A nice slice of coastal goodness that reminds me of my hometown San Diego...except it's in a parking lot in Boca Park!

The food is tasty, but the menu is a little overwhelming.  The first time I went, I was like, "Where are just fish tacos?"  Apparently, you pick your vehicle (taco, burrito, etc.), then you choose your innards (fish, chicken, tofu (!), mushrooms (!), etc), then you choose your rice (brown rice option (!)) and beans.  The fish tacos were a little dry and I would have liked more sauce.  I also got some sort of tofu bowl that I don't remember the name of, and it was goooood.  I prefer the Cajun white beans to the black beans (great flavor), but the rice lacks something (read: flavor).

They have a full bar and a nice happy hour special each day.  They have this nifty margarita where they stick a mini Corona in it.  It's fun and very college-Spring-Break inspired.

But I think my favorite part of the restaurant is the open patio.  The window/wall opens up from the bar area to a nice little patio with comfortable seating.  My only wish was that it didn't over look a black asphalt parking lot, but I'll take some al fresco drinking and eating any day, and I'll just imagine that the black asphalt is ocean water while I eat my fish taco and drink my beer/margarita concoction.
