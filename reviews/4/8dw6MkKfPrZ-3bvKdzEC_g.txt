This is good new spot for Mexican or Caribbean influenced foods. The two star reviews aren't warranted, but a little constructive criticism might help. It's true the food can come out a little slow at times and maybe they need to tighten up the kitchen staff to get orders out faster. And I think the reggae music needs to play a little louder in the dining room. It should feel welcoming like an island restaurant and midday when it's low light and low music it can feel a little cold. Other than that, I think the staff is all very nice and the food is great with lots of options - curry, jerk, mole options, chorizo, vegan chorizo, shrimp, chicken, ox tail. If you want your food super fast go get Chipotle, if you want bad Mexican food go to Patron across the street. If you want to support a local restauranteur doing something fun and different and producing good results in two locations, then this is a great option.
