4.5 Stars for me. This is my favorite place for fish tacos in AZ (That I've tried). They have this sauce that I don't know what they put in it, I just know I love it. I've tried a couple other things as well and they were also good, but I have a hard time ordering anything other than the fish tacos, because I just can't get enough of them. Delicious.
