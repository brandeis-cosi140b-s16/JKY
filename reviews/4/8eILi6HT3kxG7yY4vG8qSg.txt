Affordable and authentic--it's an A in my book! Recently moved here and I have only tried don Roberto's (yuck). Thankfully I tried this joint cause I'm sure gonna come back. Ordered to go my usual which I devoured cause it was tasty and juicy but I wish they would have given me some salsa and chips while I waited aprox. 15 min for my order..guess I've been spoiled with my other to go Mexican joints in Cali. Thus the -1 star!
