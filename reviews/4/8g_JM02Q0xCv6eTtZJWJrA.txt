My girlfriend and i did a 24-hour stint in Scottsdale last weekend and were craving Mexican food.  I found Carlsbad Tavern and decided to give it a try.  

Granted, like most eating experiences...i peeped out the menu before hand.  I already knew what I was going to get:  an ala carte order of Green Chile Macaroni and Cheese and an ala carte order of Veggies.  I love green chile (i think New Mexico when i see green chile) so i requested a side order of green chile to go with my order.  

Green Chile Macaroni and Cheese:  This was yummy.  It's served in a bowl lined with a large flour tortilla.  I knew i shoudn't have touched the flour tortilla, but the cheese was soaked through within the tortilla and after I took a bite of the tortilla.....it was gone quickly thereafter.  Okay, back to the Macaroni and Cheese.  I didn't notice a considerable amount of green chile, but luckily i requested a side, and i would put that over my mac and cheese as i was eating it.  With me, you can't go wrong with Mac and Cheese.  It was creamy and good.  I forced myself to NOT finish it...but as i type this review, i wish i had the left over so i can eat it now.  

Veggies:  The veggies was a meadly of onions, brocolli, carrots, zuchinni, mushrooms...i think that was it.  It was stir-fried or grilled, in some oil.  So although it may sound fairly healthy -- the oil was a FAIL.  it was good though.  It had to have been better than some of the other richly divine dishes.  

I'm sure they have a better crowd during happy hour and brunch.  But for me and my girlie...it was a good welcome to AZ straight from the airport.
