The Fashion Square location is the best one I have been to out of the locations in the valley.  My buddies and I have been there multiple times for day drinking and have never not had a great time.  Like the grammar?

We have always gotten drinks there with very little food, save the cornbread.  I am not a huge cornbread fan, but this cornbread is fantastic.  It always comes out hot with some butter.  Perfect for helping soak up copious amounts of alcohol.  And the alcohol of choice is the chambordrita.  These things are so strong that they limit it to 2 per person.  Somehow on a very long day of drinking my buddy Z had 4 and he was hammered.  We continued drinking after that mind you, but he could hardly stand.  They are tasty, but very cold so go slow.

The food I have had has been decent.  The chips and three different salsas they bring out are good and I have heard the guac is good as well.  I think I have had the green chili enchiladas which were tasty.  I have had some sort of shrimp dish that was palatable as well.  The service and atmosphere has always been above par.  The servers we have had have been personable and attentive.  Sitting on the patio on a spring day or early summer night is the tits.
