Let's be real. I'm only writing this to get the First to Review because if you've been to one Chipotle, you've been to them all.  ;P

Although this chain is known for their giant burritos, I like to pretend I'm eating healthy when I get their burrito bowls. Get the sofritas and tell your wee-tots it's ground pork because it's so flavorful, they wouldn't know they're eating tofu. Brown or white rice, black or pinto beans, with or without fajita veggies, sour cream, choice of salsa, and guacamole for an additional fee offered. Choose your poison.

This location just opened so it's still super clean. On this Thursday afternoon, 10-12 of the friendliest people were working. I normally go to the location by Chandler Fashion Center but the people here are so much more friendly and down-to-earth. This will be my new fave Chipotle.
