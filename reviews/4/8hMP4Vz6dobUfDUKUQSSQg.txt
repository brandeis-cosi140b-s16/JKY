If you are craving Mexican food at 3 in the morning, this place is for you.

Holy Taco Tuesday.  Who can say no to a delicious chicken or beef taco for a dollar?
Horchata is also a sugar-overdose of a wonderland.   

They also have the best breakfast burritos.  Hands down.  Eggs, bacon, extra cheese & pico.   They will put ANYTHING into your burrito.  Just ask.

I've heard a lot of things about the Super Nachos but I cannot find it in my heart to order them.

Make sure to extra red sauce all of the things.
