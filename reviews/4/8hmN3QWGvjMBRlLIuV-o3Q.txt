These guys do a great job on the service as well as the food. I've eaten here about 6 times and have had a verity of items. The grilled fish tacos are very good and I suggest trying those. But watch that habanero's sauce you'll feel it the next day if you know what I mean. It is hot stuff!   The place is a bit out of the view and hard to find...I always get northsight and hayden mixed up. I like the open kitchen so I can see what the cook is doing too. They serve beer, wine and hard liquor as well.
