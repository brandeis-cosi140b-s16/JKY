This place has a great happy hour, decent food, but slow service.  It's a little off the strip, but if you can find it, you won't be disappointed in the Mexican Food.  The only thing that I was craving was traditional chips and salsa brought to the table to keep me drinking while thinking of something to order.  Chips and Salsa were like $5 and there wasn't enough salsa.
