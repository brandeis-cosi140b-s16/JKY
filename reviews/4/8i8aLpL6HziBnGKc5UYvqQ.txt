This is one of our favorite Mexican restaurants. We love the flour chips and salsa that they always bring out.  The guacamole is good and fresh.  Margaritas are decent.  I have tried several items on the menu, but my favorite it their chicken fajitas!
We have always had great service and just an overall nice experience.  Last time we were their, the manger came to our table and asked how everything was.  It was nice to be able to compliment him face to face and tell him what a great job he was doing.
