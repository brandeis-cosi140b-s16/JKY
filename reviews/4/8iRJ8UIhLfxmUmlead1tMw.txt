Nice old ladies "if your into that sort of thing "


J/K!


My friends who have lived in mesa for  much longer have been going to Matt's for years. Well bummer when matta's closed and we patiently waited for the new one to open.

Looked at the reviews on here and others complained.. well not this yelper!


We walked in, the building is nice but really has a fresh paint look going on rather than an authentic or rustic look. The mission style is well done but it simply needs the walls a bit more filled up or some paint work to make it look more the part.

The service I thought was prompt, the salsa was fine and when the food came it was nice and hot. I ordered the chicken chimichanga and it was tasty.


The lady who sat us and the server were very warm and friendly, my friends mentioned they had seen one of them since a child.. either she really likes the place or she is in the family!

4 stars.. with some decor and not a strip mall feel it might get a fifth.
