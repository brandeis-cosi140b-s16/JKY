I have been a patron of this local,  fairly traditional spot for nearly 40 years!  I actually once worked at the one on 32nd Street and Indian School for a week.

The salsa I can eat as a soup.  Nice and chunky, fresh, all around yummy.  The spicier salsa can be slightly dipped in periodically as necessary for an added hotttttness.  

The menu hasn't changed much over the years.  The food is fresh and if not too careful could border non-authentic.  Overall, this is a great place you can count on for a sweet Mexican food experience.

My granddaughter and I are now the matriarch's in the family to continue the tradition of being loyal to this landmark!
