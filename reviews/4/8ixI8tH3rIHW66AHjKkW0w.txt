Filiberto's recently opened this location at a former Jack In the Box.

I ordered a carne asada quesadilla and pollo asado burrito.  Both were beyond crazy amounts of food - each was chock full of meat.  I preferred their chicken over the carne.  The chicken tasted flavorful and marinated, while the steak was just "gray" and didn't have a good grilled flavor (I know, what can you expect for meat cooked on the flattop).

The quesadilla came with a nice portion of sour cream and guac on the side.  Yeah, yellow cheese was the stuffing of choice, but it didn't taste too greasy.  

The burrito had guac inside with some onion/cilantro also.  They offered hot sauce and I happily obliged.

The staff was very friendly, and while I didn't go inside, I would expect it was your typical "relatively clean" -ertos style restaurant, although being Filiberto's is one of the larger chains, they seem to have better standards than their competitors.
