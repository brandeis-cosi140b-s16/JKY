While located in a bit of a dodgy neighborhood (I'm sure it's actually quite alright if you live there), Taquitos Jalisco offers excellent Mexican food on the cheap. Huuuuuge fan of the tacos al pastor.. They even give you double the tortillas. The storefront might look a bit dingy to someone who lives 3 blocks north/on the other side of town (or something), but the service is excellent, the burritos are quite filling and delicious, and while it is a bit difficult to pull out of the parking lot in my slammed-ass car, Taquitos Jalisco has a fan in me.
