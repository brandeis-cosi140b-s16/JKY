I live very close to Warner Park in bad need of a burrito and couldn't be bothered to drive to Qdobas. A quick walk to the new Habanero restaurant later and I found a similar set up to Qdobas and Chipotles. The menu had a good number of choices but I ultimately chose a steak burrito. It was very satisfying and there were lots of toppings to put in, although the slightest bit watery. Will be back to try their other entrees.
