I was a little hesitant about going here due to the look (silly me, my favorite place Los Dos Molinos is the same way), but I am glad I did. The employees were very, very friendly. The cheese crisp was really good, one of the better cheese crisps I had. Sopapillas were good - better than average but not as doughy as I love. Good place all around.
