This place is pretty good.  I only discovered it by happenstance a few months ago and have been back a few times.  I like their red sauce, they are always willing to make the modifications I ask for (I'm a really picky eater).  It isn't the very best I've ever had, but it's pretty darn good.  For the price/portion/taste, I'm glad I found this little hole in the wall.
