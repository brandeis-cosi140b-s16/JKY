For starters, you can easily miss this place if you are not paying attention because it is tucked away behind the Chevron/McDonalds and next to a service station. 

On my first visit I got the number 8 which is normally a Beef Burrito, Cheese Enchilada, Rice, and Refried beans. Since I do not eat meat, they were happy to substitute a bean burrito instead. I had no idea how much food could really fit into a little take away container! The bean burrito was huge and tasted fresh. The beans were seasoned well. None of those bootleg, bland bean burritos you will find at other Mexican places in town. The enchilada was also amazing and did not get lost in sauce. Although most people focus on the main dish, I must say the rice and refried beans on the side were amazing as well. None of the watery, flavorless beans or burnt crispy rice you are served elsewhere. While they are making your food (less than 6 minute wait for fresh take-out), you can visit the "salad bar" and get plenty of sauces to take home and try. I prefer the hotter sauces, but they have a wide variety. 

On my next visit, I just wanted a quick snack and got the chips and guacamole and that hit the spot. Freshly made chips and tangy guacamole was just what I needed!

Once your food is ready, get a big cup of Lemonade or Horchata and you are ready to roll out like an autobot!
