So excited when they opened up!  I have not been there when it is super busy but it is a very easy going atmosphere.  The more authentic way to go when compared to Chipotle or Qdoba.  Huge servings for less than Chipotle and Qdoba as well.  I had a plain bean and cheese burrito for $4.00 or so.  I think full on burritos run close to $5.50.  Not the fanciest place (a little tongue in cheek ;) ) but is clean!  The food is super.  Legit flavors and one of the only places that uses cilantro as a topping, not just thrown in with a salsa.  I love cilantro!!  Awesome food for sit down or a quick eat and run.
