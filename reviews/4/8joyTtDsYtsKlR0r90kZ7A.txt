We stopped eating at Super Mex because it was way too expensive for bad/mediocre food. Saw the sign changed and figured we would give it another try.

The menu was upgraded a bit over the Super Mex menu. Gave a combination a try, so I could try a couple different enchiladas and their crunchy taco.

The chips were better as chips, than the big discs. Their salsa has improved, too. We emptied that salsa bowl!

Food came out, maybe a little slow, piping hot! Seriously, the wife opened the foil wrapped around her tortillas and they were steaming for a couple minutes. So, the food is very fresh!

My crunchy taco was delicious. Their shredded chicken is moist and flavorful. The taco shell was not super hard and it seemed to be freshly created, rather than a packaged shell. Their enchiladas were equally as delicious, I cleared the plate completely, and went back for more chips. 

Stuffed is an understatement!

For the negative, $3.50 for a single taco seems high. $4.50 for a single enchilada also seems a bit high. The combination seemed to be relatively fairly priced.

Overall, we won't avoid this place like we did Super Mex, we just need to be in the mood for a little more expensive of a meal.
