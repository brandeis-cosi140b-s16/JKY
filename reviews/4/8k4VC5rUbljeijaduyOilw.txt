Taberna really impressed me! We went on a nice evening and sat outside on their beautiful patio. The patio definitely has more ambiance than the inside (though the inside is nicely decorated). We were immediately brought a gigantic bowl of plaintain chips, yucca, chips, blue corn tortilla chips, and thick-cut tortilla chips with two different types of salsa. I really appreciate a Mexican restaurant that gives their patrons chips and salsa and high quality too! 

My boyfriend said that his margarita was as good as the best margarita he's had in Mexico (quite a compliment from him). I had the michelada (a slight obsession of mine after sipping them poolside in Mexico last year), which involved beer, lime, siracha, and their "secret ingredient". It had a decent kick and was very good. 

We shared the Tres Picaditas for an appetizer. They're served on masa boats (basically very small, thick tortillas) and topped with braised pork, cheese, onion, and avocado. There were three of them and they were great bites, but they were exactly that: bites. Each one could be finished in one or two bites and at $10, not sure if I'd get it again. 

Now for the shining star: the Filet Mignon Tacos. I loved these! Great flavor, tender meat. The three tacos were served with a generous serving of black beans and rice (which I couldn't really eat after gorging on chips and salsa). My boyfriend had the scallop and pork belly tacos. The tacos are definitely heavier on the pork belly, with a thin slice of scallop on top. They had a nice, light flavor to them... a summery taco, if there is such a thing. 

Go sit outside and enjoy a drink and dinner on the patio before the sweltering summer sets in. You'll enjoy it!
