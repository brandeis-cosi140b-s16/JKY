Here I got the closest thing to a proper taco I've had in Pittsburgh. For that amazing feat it gets 4 stars. Were this place in a city with more taco choices, I'd give them maybe a 3. 

The tacos were on two corn tortillas w/ chopped cilantro & onion. salsa verde on the side. I had the barbacoa and lingua. Totally serviceable, which around here was something of a revelation.

Chips and salsa were good too.

If you are from a city that has actual mexican food, and you are jonesing for a "correct" taco you should definitely give this place a shot. It will fit the bill.
