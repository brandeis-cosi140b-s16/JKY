I have to say, I'm a bit addicted to the Jade Red Chicken with a side of Chicken Fried rice.

The flavor is excellent! You can taste a bit of everything before you order but I can say that the Jade Red Chicken is one of the best.  If you really want to burn up your face hole, go with "Jerk" anything!

The staff at Chino are very friendly and come to bring your food to you after you order it at the counter.

Just try this place out, you really won't regret it and you'll be back for more!

Oh and, hail to the snikerdoodle!
