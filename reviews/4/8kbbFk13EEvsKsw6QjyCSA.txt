Not much to look at from the outside, but the parking lot decor isn't as important as what is inside. I'll echo some of the other Yelpers, this place rocks! I try to skip  carbs, so I avoided the rice and bean filled burritos. I ordered a salad, and had several choices of protein. I went with the steak, which was a great choice on my part. The toppings bar took a beating, I told the woman behind the counter to load me up with all the hot stuff, especially the diced fresh jalapenos. My wife ordered a shredded pork burrito, with no hot stuff. We are the odd couple.

After receiving our meals, I headed to the vaunted salsa bar. Other places might have more choices, but few have more creative choices. Regular & spicy pico de gallo, several mild to medium salsas, and a few with some heat. My favorite was the Guarillo, a medium heat orange colored smooth salsa. 

How was our meal? Que delicioso! I chose the lime mint dressing for my salad, which blended well with the flames shooting from my bowl. The only complaint I had was that the lettuce could have been cut smaller or maybe shredded. Otherwise, my salad was far better than the other Mexican places we have tried. My wife's burrito was huge, she only finished half, she took the rest home with most of her tortilla chips. I rarely give 5 stars, tbf came pretty close. Maybe if one of the staff wasn't wearing a Jets cap, they would have gotten all 5. My wife is a Jets fan, I see enough of that crap at home. We will be back.
