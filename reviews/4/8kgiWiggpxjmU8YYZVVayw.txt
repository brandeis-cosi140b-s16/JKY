Joyride is a really cool place! I recommend going on Taco Tuesday, for they have specails! It is a laid back open atmosphere, kind of on the hipster side, friendly attentive staff and a decent size menu. I recommend their carne asada tacos, guac and chips and if you are not in the mood for tacos, their enchiladas are pretty tasty. AZ is finally having some awesome weather, go sit out on the patio and have some good food!
