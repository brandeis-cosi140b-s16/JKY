Friends and I made a late night stop here and it was great after a night out in Vegas. They have burritos, tacos, nachos, quesadillas and they're all customizable. The service was fast, prices were reasonable and the food was good. They also have aguas frescas and seating space indoors & outdoors. I would definitely come back!
