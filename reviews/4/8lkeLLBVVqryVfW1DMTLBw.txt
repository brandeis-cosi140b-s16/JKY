Guedo's (Hwed-ohs, not Gweed-ohs) has been a long standing favorite for many years. It remains up near the top of my list for lunch or dinner.

First of all, remember it's a taco shop. Do not order the filet mignon there, unless it's rolled into a taco. They also have burros and cheese crisps, but it's all basically the same stuff. There are plenty of veggie items as well as excellent fish and shrimp tacos.

The ordering of meat tacos is pretty basic: you say taco, you say beef, pork, chicken or combo (the combo is best, it is spiced differently from the rest), you say if you want cheese or not, and you can order some add-ins like guacamole. The rest of it you build over at the fixin's bar. 
Pay for your stuff and take a seat until you are called. There is limited inside seating, but there is also tull outdoor seating as well as an enclosed patio. The recently added cantina features a full bar.

If you are trying an Atkins diet, tell when when you are ordering, they have a few non-menu options for you. I have ordered off of the catering menu and gotten a pound of their beenj with fixins for $10.

It's good, basic Mexican food served by nice people. If you want something fancy, try El Zocalo just to the west. I'll take Guedo's 8 out of 10 times.
