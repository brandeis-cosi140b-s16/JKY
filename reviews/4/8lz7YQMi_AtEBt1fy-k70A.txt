Taco Tuesdays! Yeah!!!  Baja, Carne Asada & more -- for $2 a pop -- oh yeah!  It's probably the only time I'll attend since I can't be hanging with the drunk crowd anymore.  Place was pretty slow for a lunch hour, but I gather it's more for the bar/pick-up/rowdy/sport -- let's dress like hooches place; but I can dig :)  I really enjoyed the hugh panoramic wall mural in the back, think I can sit here for hours having a drink to two (margaritas of course)  Our service was very good.  Nothing like a friendly smile with my tacos - :)  Enjoy!
