Very pleasantly surprised with this place. I expected an Oregonian "Baja Fresh" experience but it was more than that. 

I had a beef tostado, and LOVED the shell. So fresh and not just a hard corn tortilla. It was fresh and flaky. The beef was also marinated well and was fresh too. The prices were reasonable (tostado was under 6 bucks) and food arrives fast and hot. A solid choice for a quick lunch.
