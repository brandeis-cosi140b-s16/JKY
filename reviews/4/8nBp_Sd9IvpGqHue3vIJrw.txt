Here's my down the street,  go-to for some normal mexican eats. Only thing missing is a good-dance-in-the-rain tamale.( But Maybe because I've been spoiled by my Mex friends with homemade tamales). I like the "call ahead for pick-up" option. Very convenient. Outdoor patio seating, maybe only good for 4 out of the 12 months in Vegas.

Eats: on all my visits, so far have never been out of anything and have always delivered my eats 100%. 

parking- or lack there of, isn't so fashionable. Good for the folks waiting for their car wash or oil change, which is in the same lot. 

Their smiles are hit or miss. kinda snobby at times.

On my last visit, I had a carne asada chimichanga. heart attack im willing to risk. deep fried burrito, but with a side of guac. Mmmm. never fails. of course, i can never finish it. way too huge. a sharable quality. i can count on them like uno, dos, tres.
