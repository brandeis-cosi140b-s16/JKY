Listen.....this ain't your average Mexican food restaurant. No Spanish rice and refried beans here! As the website states, its neuvo Mexican (with a bit of Cuban flare and culinary influence in my opinion). Oh, speaking of website. Theirs is just as enticing as the food. It's like a music video with a menu. It's sexy and food photography is amazing.  Check it out! 

I started with guacamole and salsa. Yum! The red Sangria was one of the best I've had in a long time. Not overly sweet with a nice kick! The (vegetarian) chile relleno was amazing! Stuffed with roasted zucchini,  onions and potatoes. The perfectly spicy ancho chilie was nicely contrasted with the sweetness of the veggies inside. 

My only complaint was that I had to ask my server for a fresh order of corn pudding b/c it was over done.  If you're familiar from Southern corn pudding, its not really like that. Theirs is thin and more dense like corn bread. But very delish! 

All the food was great and the atmosphere was rather unexpected for a restaurant in Tempe Marketplace. I was transported to another place. Refreshing. 

Bon Appetite!
