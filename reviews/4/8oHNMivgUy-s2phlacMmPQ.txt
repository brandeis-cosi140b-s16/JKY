OK, got my torta fix! Al Pastor was killer, never had a chance to eat here when it was under the original owners. With that being said the food was good. Ordered a torta and rolled tacos, taquitos. 5 came to an order and had melted cheese on top. Served with a side of guac creme as well. All for around $8 bucks. The place sits inside a gas station, it was dead at 11am, and tables were empty. Are there other place in the valley of the sun for better Mexican food? Sure. However why not support the local joint down on the corner that does serve straight forward great tasting Mexican food! If you are in the area check this place out! Maybe the owner from my last post should come here and see how a true Torta is made!!!!!!
