Food is super delicious here! The spicey pork tacos with extra hot sauce are my favorite!  Service is extremely fast and the workers are friendly.  I only gave this place a 4 instead of 5 stars because I think the place could be cleaner and updated.  Some of the decor look run down and look like DIY projects.
