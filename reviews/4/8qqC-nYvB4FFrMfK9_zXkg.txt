Have just ordered take out from this place. Very fast and competent service.  I don't know about authentic, but maybe this is what madison considers authentic. The dining room is set out like a cafeteria (no booths, high tables) but the patrons do not seem to mind. It looks like they have a banquet room, but no separate bar area (however, there are plenty of patron bottles everywhere so they offer libations). Currently there is a mariachi band serenading patrons. They are very good...maybe that's where the authentic reviews come from.
