Never disappointing here. Good reasonable prices and always great food. I good eat an entire meal of chips salsa and bean dip. I always ask for the hotter smooth sauce.  Ordered the combo and took half home.  If you love tamales for as order them from here they are awesome. One is plenty for a normal appetite.
