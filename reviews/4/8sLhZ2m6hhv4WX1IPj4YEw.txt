I think I have just discovered another must stop by place in vegas now after a night of drinking. We got here around 12/1 and the line was out the door so we waited well over 40min for our food but it was well worth it. 

Something new that I haven't seen at other places.. their Adobada is very delicious and flavorful. These are street taco size so I'm sure you will be able to chow down on more than 3 tacos. There are so many of their other stuff that I would like to try next time... like their fries? Yes please! Lengua Fries to be exact!

Free Refills, ample seating, decently priced delicious mexican food. I don't think theres more that needs to be said.
