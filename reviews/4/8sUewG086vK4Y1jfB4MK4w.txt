This resturant was absolutely delish!  We tried their shrimp cocktail that left my taste buds satisfied and had their seafood platter that had fried and grilled fish and shrimp,lobster etc plenty of tortillas and a a plate with rice and veggies.  They also had shrimp with fish rolled in bacon OMG.  My first time and it was great. Thy have a very impressive menu. The service was good and it was very clean.  I'll be back :)
