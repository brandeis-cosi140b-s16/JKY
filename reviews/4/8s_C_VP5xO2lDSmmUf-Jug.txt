I come to this Chipotle after class sometimes, though far less than I eat at the Student Union. Still, it's proximity to UNLV really makes it a cool place to eat when you're in the neighborhood. 

The way Chipotle works is simple: you walk in and decide how you want to eat your food. You can get it in a bowl, in burrito form, or taco form. Then you decide what kind of beans/rice/protein you want, followed by the lettuce, cheese, guacamole, whatever. 

Personally, I do not think you could go wrong getting the steak (carne asada) burrito. I get it with pinto beans, white rice, cheese, pico de gallo, and lettuce. All those things are extras, though, to meat. The meat is the main event, and it does not fail. The meat is so good! It's seasoned well and perfectly tender! I've had the chicken, too, and it's ok - but the steak is king!
