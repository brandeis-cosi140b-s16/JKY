Best carne asada in town!

Bro took us to lunch after the painstaking task of helping him move, ugh! We loved it! Fresh simple food! Only criticism..... use QuikTrips bathroom, don't use their. 

Their tacos are way cheap, $1.10/ea normally and I think on Wednesdays they are like half priced. Very goof fresh ingredients. 

Excited to try the other location close to my house.
