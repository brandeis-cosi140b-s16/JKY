Great place for tacos! Ordered 3 Tempura Tacos and Borracho Beans --- See pic I uploaded.  BF had the burrito, which wasn't tightly wrapped and fell apart.  The wait for food took about 20 minutes with not many ppl in the restaurant. I'll return because the food was delicious, but only if I don't have plans soon afterwards.
