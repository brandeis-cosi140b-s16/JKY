First things first.  These are not ta"masas".  You know what I mean, tamales made almost completely out of masa.  These aren't them.  Good sized and packed full of yummy goodness at 1.50 a piece, they are a good deal.  The fam and I tried the Chicken Green Chile (spicy).  Not our first choice but they were out of nearly everything else.  They were not kidding.  They are quite spicy but delicious nonetheless. I have knocked off a star due to not having the full experience of the other flavors that would have been my primary choices.  I look forward to trying the other flavors and possibly upping my score.  If you find yourself in need of tamales you need to check this place out.
