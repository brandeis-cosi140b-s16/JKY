Just ate at Senor Tequila for the first time in a while. They have added some good specials at lunch time so the prices are very affordable. My lunch dish was under $7 and the quality of the food was good. As always, service can be hit or miss here, but I stil like the food and will definitely go back.   Also, they have taken over some space from next door, so finally the restaurant will be a little roomier.
