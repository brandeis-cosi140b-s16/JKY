Went to agave for happy hour which starts at 4 pm. As expected from a Mexican restaurant we were served chips and salsa to start.salsas were a little to the sweet side as so was the rest of the food. 5 dollars  Margaritas during happy hour are very good! Just don't be in a hurry to get there. I got there 2 minutes before 4 pm which excluded me from happy hour prices. I was also told that my booth didn't  Qualify for happy hour. Only the tables around the bar which were three feet away from me. Ok, you got me..I paid full price and learned their happy hour rules. 
My rule is...I want to be happy during happy hour!
