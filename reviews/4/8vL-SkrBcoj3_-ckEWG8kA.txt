I've gone here for years. Went tonight after a heartbreaking UNLV loss. I get a Zaba Bowl each time. I love the fact that they have brown rice. The last time I was there I ordered the hot salsa. It was too hot. I did it again this time and decided not to eat it. I asked for another bowl of rice and beans so that I could transfer the shrimp and other sides from the bed of fire. They didn't charge me for the extra bowl. That was cool. It's fast, the food is good, and the servers are are friendly. I'll continue to go back. I'm a fan.
