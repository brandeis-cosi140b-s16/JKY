We stumbled upon this place after getting lost looking for another, and decided to give it a go.
As we parked, we noticed a "Best Of Vegas" sign outside and at that point we were even more excited. Upon entering we were welcomed with big smiles, music, and delicious aromas...and we immediately felt as if we were in someone's home.

I wanted to try just about everything based on reviews & tips, but decided on fish tacos. I must say I wasn't disappointed at all. As a matter of fact, these were the best fish tacos I've had at any Vegas joint, probably because they're made with mahi mahi and not some crap fish like swai. The slaw and sauce was also perfection, and I topped 'em with fresh lime and pickled onions. Perfection! 

I can't wait to come back and try everything else on the menu!!
