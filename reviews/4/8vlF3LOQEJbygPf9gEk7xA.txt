7 Mares was DELISH, the broth or Caldo was so good

We ate here because of a great deal we found on Resturaunts.com. we paid 10bucks for a $25 Gift cert. not bad, huh!?

so my Fajitas we're really good too...I had the Supreme, meaning Chicken Shrimp and steak.. I do wish there were a few more shrimp than 3 but hey with shrimp I'm always wanting more.

Only 4 stars 'cause I'm a yelper & nowadays I need to be WOWED and I was not impressed with only 1 refill on my Coke, I know I know how many cokes can one have but thats just how it is!
