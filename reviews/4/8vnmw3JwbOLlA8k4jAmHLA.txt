I bet the majority of Yelp users won't look up Chipotle and read its reviews, but I still wanted to say that Chipotle makes for a good affordable meal if your pockets are tight or if your time is tight or if you just want some mexican fast food.

They serve good burritos and tacos. And they have guacamole which they make from scratch several times each day so it's always fresh. The steak burrito is my favorite, their steak is juicy and grilled to just the perfect texture. On days that I don't feel like having meat, I would go for the vege tacos. Guac is included in the vege version, which is an added bonus. 

So, just keep this place in mind next time you would like some good mexican food. They open another outlet opposite the west side Target so all the more convenient to stop by.
