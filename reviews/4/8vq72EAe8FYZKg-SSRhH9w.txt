I've been going to Laredos ever since I moved to Madison, I call it my favorite restaurant in Madison, pretty big statement huh?  However, I am contemplating this now, I absolutely LOVE the service, maybe cause most of them know my name because I have been their countless times, But lately the prices have gone up and the last time I think I ordered the enchiladas and they were just average, I suggest going for dinner and ordering the steak jalisco, it's usally delicious and they are usually consistent with the food.  I'll have to try it soon to be sure but definitely go to the West Side on Whitney Way, the East Side Laredos is just NOT THE SAME!
