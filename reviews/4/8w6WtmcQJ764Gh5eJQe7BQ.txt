So many hours clocked in here I can't begin to imagine the number. When I followed a low carb diet I ate lunch here mon-fri almost everyday for a year and a half. When I say the chicken is consistently good I speak from experience.

Most of the staff has remained the same over the years. I've never had a bad experience service wise. All of this equates to a decent sized following of locals. You can expect to see many of the same faces in there for lunch and happy hour.

They have very good happy hour food and booze specials.

Chicken, tri tip, white fish, shrimp, lobster tacos, fajitas.. its all good. I haven't had anything here I wasn't happy with, excluding maybe the quesadilla.

All the meats are mesquite charbroiled and very tasty. The parking lot smells amazing all the time.

The chicken is very heavy on the black pepper and garlic. Their marinade/rub is put all over the chicken and under the skin as well at times.

They have a nice salsa bar with at least 4 different types of salsa plus spicy pickled jalapenos and carrots. Their chips never seem to be overly greasy and are surprisingly fresh for sitting at the salsa bar under a heat lamp.

I'm also a fan of the wings. They are nonstandard as far as the wing sauce goes but they are a nice change from the standard franks/butter.

When it comes down to it its solid food at a reasonable price. You can't ask for much more for a regular day lunch experience.
