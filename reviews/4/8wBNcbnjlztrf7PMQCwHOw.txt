Across the street from a Taco Bell - but so much better.  Located just south of Old Town on Thomas, to the West of Scottsdale Road, it is located in a small building on the North side of the street.  Depending on sensibilities, one may or may not want to eat in - it is a pretty basic interior with a few tables - some would even call it a greasy spoon.

However, the food is great - if you like authentic south of the border fare.  There is a large menu painted on the wall, with pictures of the food and descriptions .  You can get combinations, or individual orders of tacos, burritos, etc. It is inexpensive -  I had two carne asado tacos and a fountain drink for less than $5.00.  The hot sauce and condiments are great, and the people are friendly.  Great little place for a quick bite to eat for breakfast, lunch or late night.
