Absolutely love this place! Their chicken burrito is delicious & my husband loves the green chile pork.
I'm a huge fan of most items on their menu, the only reason I held back a star is because their chicken salad is kinda pathetic. It's shredded iceberg lettuce with minimal toppings. I'm not a fan- I wish they would upgrade their salad selection so there would be a few more "light" options on their menu.
