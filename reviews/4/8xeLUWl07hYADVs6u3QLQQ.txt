This place is way better then Filibertos because you don't wind up with the horrible bathroom problems. They are also cheaper, carne asada fries here are like $5 as opposed to $7 for the same amount.  They also have guacamole chips which I have not been able to find anywhere else and I have a serious addiction to them. There would be a picture but I eat them way too fast for that to happen!  The ground beef tacos are also super yummy!
