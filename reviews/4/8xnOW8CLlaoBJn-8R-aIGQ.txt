20 years in the area and I frequent Los Betos at least once a month.  Early (college days) consisted of the rolled tacos with guac...hard to beat for the price and the late night run.  While my experience with the broader menu is limited the chicken burritio (just chicken) is my go to item; it's a meal or two on it's own.  Additionally I often order the chicken tacos or pollo asada burrito, the asada burrito is grilled with lots of other ingredients so it takes a little while to make, expect a 5+ minute prep time but be aware that it often has a very high sodium content, wish they would not add salt.  The bean burrito is good but as with the last menu item comment  I'm sort of salt adverse and it too often has too much salt.  I'm not a breakfast person but have after a long night tried the eggs with machaca and while I'm no expert I dont think that was true machaca, more like the shredded beef but it hit the spot and was enough food for two or more.
