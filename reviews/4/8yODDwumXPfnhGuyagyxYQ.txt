My wife and I went here because we've heard good things about the location on Desert Inn Rd., and this location is closer to us. The food was a pleasant surprise, and although dinner was a bit pricy, the portions were large enough for us to have next-day leftovers. My cochinita revolcada (carnitas sauteed in multiple salsas) was delicious, and the pork was cooked perfectly - juicy and tender enough to cut with a fork. I'm not a fan of refried beans, but the beans served with the tortilla chips and salsa was good enough for us to ask for a second bowl. The good food coupled with the excellent service will definitely bring us back again.
