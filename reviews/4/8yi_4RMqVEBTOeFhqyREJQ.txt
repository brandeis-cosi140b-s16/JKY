I've been twice to the restaurant both for Happy Hour, and have enjoyed pretty every item on the HHr menu, from the empanadas, tacos, corned-souffle, fig and panela salad, etc.  The tacos and empanadas fillings were unique with the chiccaron, picadillo, huailcacoche, amongst the choice of chicken and potato, but we wanted to venture something different from the average.   The tamarind margarita was smooth sweet and soury, just as I like it.  We received free chips and salsa-maybe this was different from the past.    The service and prices were right on.  We will continue to return as I'm bored with other types of Tex-Mex menus and since this menu provides a fresh and well-prepared fare. .
