I know, its a chain.  Stick with me, not all chains are created equal.

I hadn't eated at a Qdoba in ages.  4 years, to be exact...and the last time was this location.

Stopped in Friday afternoon for a quick bite before a poker game, and I got the chicken nachos.

YUM.

First of all, service was great, offering samples, very polite...outstanding.

The food was fresh, and delicious. 
Mild chicken, spicy queso (try the bacon queso. Trust me), fresh veg...really good!! 

Its easy comfort food, but it was well prepared for what it was.  

I think I'll try to come back more often...
