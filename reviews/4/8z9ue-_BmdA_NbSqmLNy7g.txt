After wanting mexican food, and wanting to try something new. I stumbled upon this place. How you know its going to be good? Well having to point at the menu or ordering by number because you dont speak spanish. I had the Combo #1. A Burrito with meat of your choice. A Taco. Chips Beans and Rice. About the burrito i got with Carne Asada. It was perfectly seasoned and bundled tight. It looks smaller than some burritos at other places but they pack it with more meat and less on the beans and rice. So its feeling as hell. And the green salsa isnt bland IT HAS A KICK TO IT. The kind of kick that opens up your sinuses. So i will try the red at some point and i can handle spicy. On to the Taco. It was packed with carne asada to. And was moist and delicious. They use fresh vegetables. 

The chips were perfectly fried. The beans had bits of onions in them, and the cheese was gooey and melted on top. The rice was moist and fluffy not dry and dense with some meals at other places. I wanted a Al pastor taco but they were out. Hence the 4 stars but it was 11pm when i went in. And the tacos are only 1.35 thats a deal with how big they are too.
