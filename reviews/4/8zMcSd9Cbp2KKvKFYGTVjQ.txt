I went here with a group of friends before we started work because everyone had been raving and raving about the Sonoran hot dogs. I was skeptical, as anyone really should be, when they say it is wrapped in bacon. My first thought was helloooo heart attack. 

So I get there and I order it minus the guacamole. It comes to me 5 minutes later and it is the most delicious hot dog I have ever tasted. The bacon creates this crispness and the tomatoes and onions with the bean spread create a flavorful touch that is perfect for the hot dog. 

Nothing is over-powering and the flavors compliment each other. I recommend going if you haven't and just a reminder happy hour is 3-6!
