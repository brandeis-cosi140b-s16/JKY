Just a update that this one is fairly consistent and I've had few issues over the years. Even on a "off" day it's never bad, just maybe a tad dry/salty/greasier than I like. 

I mostly order the same things when I go here. I get the California burrito (carne asada, pico, cheese, potatoes), carnitas burrito, super nachos, breakfast burrito, chicken taquitos or chorizo plate. I have delved off before, but I feel these are the better things to order so I stick with it.  The only thing I avoid though is shredded chicken here - I'm not a fan of it shredded and then sitting in a sort've sauce. I prefer grilled and diced style chicken at other places. 

I always have found it amusing that somehow this is the unofficial hangout for teens who just got their cars. I guess there's not much up here they're allowed late-ish. 

24 hours, fairly decent fast food, inside the Fabulous Freddys. Don't be afraid of gas station food, this one isn't seedy or anything. It's rather clean and big, with seating inside. No, it's not like my favorite hole in the walls where they don't speak English, but don't turn your nose at this chain.

 It's decent late night food and is part of our rotation when we don't want to cook. I come at a certain time at night every night and usually on days we work. I don't know if that makes a difference as it seems its the same cook, but whoever is working after 10pm has been decent.
