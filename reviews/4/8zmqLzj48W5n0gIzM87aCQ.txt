I literally group up right around the corner from here and every time I go back and visit Phoenix this is my #1 stop :) I don't even visit my family 1st until I have grabbed a quick red burrito.  Very authentic and they cook their own pan (sweet bread) as well.  I also love their soups well actually I love everything they cook! #realmexicanfood
