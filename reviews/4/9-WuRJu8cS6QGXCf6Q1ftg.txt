My boyfriend and I stopped by here to grab some food for his family. The place looked clean and had their menu posted everywhere. We all enjoyed their food and everything was fresh. I got TJ (mini) carne asada tacos. The carne asade meat was huge chunks and cooked very well, no burnt charred pieces. I do wish they had a better salsa selection. They only had two kinds and they both tasted burnt, could have been an off day. I liked how well they organized the different orders and the cashier went over each order before we left as well. Definitely will be back whenever in the area again.
