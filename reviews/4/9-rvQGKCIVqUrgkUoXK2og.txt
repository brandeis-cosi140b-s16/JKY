Very cool taco and hot dog "garage"

I'm a new fan of Sir Veza's. Stumbled across the place when we decided to have lunch at the mall and yet wanted to avoid the food court. Yelp'd it and... What? A 4-star place here? Their food shall be had. Onward!

The concept is a garage restaurant-- garage decor, mechanics rags for napkins, staff in biker apparel, et al.  Cool look and vibe, along with lots of TVs to catch the games on while eating.

Menu is mainly tacos, salads, and a big sonoran hot dog. That latter was yummy as bucks. And the kids menu hit the spot with our little girls. 

A bit slow on the service and the young lady kept forgetting things in her rush. She was nice enough though and I forgive her attempt to give me diabetes with an Arnold Palmer so sweet that my relations felt the pucker. She's young and with some additional experience, she'll be rocking it.

We'll be back!
