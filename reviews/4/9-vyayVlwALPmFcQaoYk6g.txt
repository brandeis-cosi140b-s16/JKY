I asked my local friends to pick a place that locals like.  This is where they chose to take us.  

We are used to the Nashville Mexican Food, and this place certainly was so much better than I am used to.

The ambiance was fabulous, with authentic live Mexican music.

Service was prompt and friendly, with generous portions of Nachos.  As an exciting addition to what I'm used to, they include Beans as well as Salsa!

For my entree I had the Tierra Libertad, which was delicious.  They also give you Tortilla, but they are quite large, and I was not really sure HOW you were supposed to eat the meal with the Tortilla.

I would absolutely return!
