La Bamba is a pretty good cheap, 'authentic' Mexican food joint.  It's the closest I've been able to find to the taco trucks I'm used to from back home in California.  Is it perfect?  No, but it's close.  The super burritos are huge, loaded with stuff, and pretty tasty.

My only real complaint is the cheese they use.  They use sliced cheese on the burritos and liquid cheese on the nachos.  They should shell our for shredded cheese to put them over the top.  And maybe black beans, in place of refried pinto beans

I suggest the asada burrito, add rice.  Make sure you ask for extra hot sauce as it's really good.
