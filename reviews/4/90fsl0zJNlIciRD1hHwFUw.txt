This place is always a good choice when craving simple Mexican favorites like my choice of Burrito carne asada. 

It has tender pieces of steak, grilled and stuffed with pico de gallo. It's known as a big burrito, they say a pound plus, comes with rice and frijolles de la olla inside. It was also comes with sopa de fideos, arroz, and frijoles refritos. It is a lot of burrito and I ended up taking half home for lunch the next day! 

The flavors are good, the steak tender and juicy, and just right amount of spice. I enjoy most the menu items here and am never disappointed. The margarita's are sweet and cold, the service is fast and they are friendly. We never seem to have a bad meal here.
