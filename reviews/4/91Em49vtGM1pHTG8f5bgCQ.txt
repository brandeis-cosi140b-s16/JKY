Multiple visits through the years reaffirm my love for this place!  The pregnant tostadas are the best with real crab vs the other tostadas, accompanied by lovely scallops and shrimp.  As other say, the shrimp molcajete is very tasty, and also props to their goburnador tacos.  Avoid the stuffed filet preparations however.  

Overall, still extremely worth braving the sheriff's posse in Guadalupe to get some exceptionally good food!
