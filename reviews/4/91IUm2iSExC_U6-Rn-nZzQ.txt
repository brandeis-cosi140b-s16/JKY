This place is pretty hidden, but thank goodness for GPS, because it's literally in the corner of the plaza that it's located at. When entering inside, everything is plain, but don't expect the food to be the same way either...Well except the bulgolgi beef.

I knew exactly what I wanted when I went inside, so I went ahead and got the fusion burrito along with chicken. Once done ordering, I paid and waited for my order. They definitely take their time making your food and I'm not complaining at all.In fact, I like that, it shows that they really need to prepare their food. About 15 minutes of waiting later and my burrito was ready. 

The burrito is pretty thick and like most other places, but upon taking a bite, things were a lot different. It definitely gives off the KBBQ-esque taste with the kimchi, rice, and the beef. There's a nice spiciness to it and everything was great. I was sad that the wrap fell apart though and all of the food started spilling. (Luckily, not that much fell to the floor, because I was salivating the whole time I was eating it.)

The beef is plain though and is comparable to a $10 all you can eat KBBQ, but if you're going to compare the beef with those kinds of places, have a reality check. This isn't necessarily a KBBQ restaurant now is it? It's a Korean/Mexican fusion and it does a much better job than the Kogi Taco Trucks back home in California.

The burrito also came with a fortune cookie and mine said that with every burden comes a blessing? My burden today? Finishing my burrito, but the blessing is knowing that I finally found a place I really enjoy while living in Vegas. I'll definitely come back in the future to try more of the menu, including those fries.
