Expect to wait in line when you get to this spot as the lines go out the door. When you do get inside, understand how ordering works. There are two lines if your ordering a menu item for Adobada, two lines if your ordering Asada and just one line if you are ordering the Lengua, Cabeza, Sesos, or Buche. If your in a group, split up as once you get done in one line, you would have to wait in the other lines to get a different meat item but once your inside, you don't have to wait outside again in the long lines. Once you get your food, just pay at one of two cashiers.

Now on to the food. I'm a big fan of the Adobada Tacos however it's pretty small and I think I would at least need four to six to feel satisfied. Asada tacos are okay. The carne asada fries are okay with meat, guac, cheese, and salsa but I think it would have tasted a lot better with chips than fries. Overall, I would go back again if the lines were shorter and just order some Adobada tacos.
