Great customer service. The workers are always smiling and singing.  I come here alot because my son loves taco bell. 2x they have gotten the order wrong and one time the chalupas were cold and hard but when I go back to let them know... they apologize, fix the problem and have twice given me a $5 credit for the next visit. Thx guys for the great customer service.
