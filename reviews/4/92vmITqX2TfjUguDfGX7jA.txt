Say what you want about service- which I am usually very critical of.. but I like this location, the prices, and the food. A lot of it reminds me of the dirty parts of detroit, but with better quality food. The seafood fundido is my favorite dish, a little spicy and creamy. The complimentary bean dip and salsa with chips is nice too. Get a giant margarita during happy hour if you like tequila. I have never had bad service here, in fact that is what has made me come back a few times already. Not to mention, no one eats in the Arizona Mills mall because they think it is "ghetto" so it is not too busy. I prefer going here on a saturday afternoon or a monday evening myself. I will bring my friend after we hit up some of the local shops in the mall. The fried ice cream is good for dessert too. For being a chain, this place is one of my favorites, besides Serrano's.
