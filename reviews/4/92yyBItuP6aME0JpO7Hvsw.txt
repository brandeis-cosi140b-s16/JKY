I liked this place.  The menu kind of bugged me - in that they don't have anything above the cashier, merely copies of the menu taped to the counter next to the register.  But that has nothing to do with the food.  The chips and salsa were good, as was the fry bread / chimi that we tried.  It's not really close to us, so I won't be going out of my way to eat there - but still a worthy choice.
