If it's good enough George W. Bush it's good enough for you! I love this place and have been coming here since I can remember. They have the best cheese crisp and the bean burro enchilada style is awesome as is the green burro, great salsa as well.It's not fancy and has an old school feel but it's good. Top 10 Mexican food restaurant.
