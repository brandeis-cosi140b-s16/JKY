This place was pretty good.  We sat on the patio which was very nice.  The service was excellent, fast and very polite.  The food was cooked very quick (be careful the plates are very hot...they tell you in the menu and when they give you the food).  I had the chorizo tacos which were delicious!!!  My sister had the enchiladas, I wasn't a fan of the sauce but she really liked them.
