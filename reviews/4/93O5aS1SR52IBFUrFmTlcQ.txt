Ok yes, if someone blindfolded you and walked you to the front, you'd immediately think you're in chipotle. It's the same exact concept, menu features and the like, with one exception: It's not chipotle. From what I gather, it's an independent burrito spot, not a chain, which gives this place props. 

I came on $5 tuesday, just before the crowd rolled in (which is right around 11:45) and got the steak burrito bowl. All of the proteins looked fresh, along with the salsas/sides. Overall, I was very pleased with how everything tastes and will certainly come back to check out some of their other specials.
