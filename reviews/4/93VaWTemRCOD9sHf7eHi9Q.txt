This is truly an original concept.  I must say that I enjoy Cuban-Chinese food better, but this restaurant knows better than to go down the fusion route.  It is a truly fun place.  It is pricey but a good bargain by Las Vegas strip standards.  I enjoyed the 20 vegetable fried rice.  It gives you an interesting combo of flavors.  The pork sandwich is a winner, as is the langosto taco and the pan fried noodles.  Is it truly authentic: no.  If you are looking for dim sum or true Chinese or Mexican cuisine you will be disappointed.  However, it you enjoy creativity, and a restaurant willing to push the envelope with a fun atmosphere this is a great place.  I look forward to returning!
