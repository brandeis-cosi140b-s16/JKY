I really appreciate small neighborhood restaurants that take the time to do a complete decoration job.  The minute we walked in the door, the decor said "friendly and fun".   I'm not a big fan of the usual fare offered in Mexican restaurants, but this one offered small different selections.  The carne asada steaks were HUGE and quite tender.  And the price was below $15.00.  We'll definitely be going back.  (They are closed on Sundays.)
