I'm in the area frequently, so I eat lunch here often when I'm in need of a quick bite to eat.  Nine times out of ten, it's a good experience as long as I get here before 12 pm.  Once 12 pm hits, it's impossible to find a table/seat since it's the start of the lunch rush.

My fav items to get are 7 Layer Burritos and Bean Burritos.  This location makes larger than average portions too, so you get your money's worth.

The employees here are usually friendly and helpful.  That's one of the reasons I come back so often.
