Free chips, pretty cheap, right next to Brillobox, and open until 3am friday and saturday(Tacos and burritos only)? How could you not love this place? The food is decent, my friend raved about his pork, but my Pittsburgh burrito with veggies instead of meat was a bit dry - but with the combination of food how could it not be. Some Tapatio fixed the problem. Also, fries and tartar sauce, a "pittsburgh" burrito does not make. The place claims to be so-cal mexican food, and indeed the waitress's truck had a california plate on it - so they seem to be doing alright. 

They also have Carne Asada fries, which was something I thought was cool on the west coast that I hadn't seen here. My girlfriend coerced a meatless version off of the late-night menu which was really delicious - if they fix the sacrilegious pittsburgh burrito and  the yinzers ever find out about nacho fries then Los Cabos will be the mexican Primanti's in no time... In the best way possible
