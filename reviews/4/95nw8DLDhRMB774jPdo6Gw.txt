I've been eating here for 20 years. They've certainly had their ups and downs but my family and I are fans. The Chicken soup is probably the best I have ever had, and unlike Charanda, they didn't start serving it in tiny bowls and hope we didn't notice!
Total Mexican flair here and their menu has it all from burritos, tacos, carne asada, and fajitas.
Friendly staff and we've always felt welcome!
