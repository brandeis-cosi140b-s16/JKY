On a recent trip to Pittsburgh my friends and I were in the mood to start our day off with some margaritas.  Walking through downtown we found this place and were not disappointed.  The margaritas were strong and tasty.  My favorite had to be the guacamole which was prepared fresh at the table.  We tried a few other dishes and they were yummy!  The service was good and we had a great experience.
