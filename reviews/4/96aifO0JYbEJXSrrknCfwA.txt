My family and I went for breakfast and I thought the breakfast menu could be a little bigger but they have what you need to be satisfied. I had the chilaquiles , my husband had menudo and my mother in law had a sweet tamale and menudo as well. We ordered tamales to go oh and we also had coffee and the coffee is the type that is cooked in a pot and spiced with cinnamon.Will be going there again!
