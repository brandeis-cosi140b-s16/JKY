The prices are still excellent, but made wrong choice on my most recent visit. The free chips and salsa are still top notch as the chips are both crunchy and salty and then you get the smoky chipotle salsa to dip away. So the wrap and the ingredients did not really go together well despite getting the garlic hot sauce on the side. They had too much going on with corn, another sauce, two cheeses, etc and was not impressed with the green chile potato salad, which had green specks, but no green chile blast. The music starts at 9pm and it was your typical cover band, but it is better than watching Lockup or being locked up every Saturday night.
