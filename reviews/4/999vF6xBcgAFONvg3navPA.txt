Excellent menu range, very flavorful meals, free chips and salsa appetizers, gigantic portions, and prices in the $10-15 range typical of a Mexican restaurant combine to make Laredo's the best Mexican place I've yet tried in Madison.  My only complaints are the flavor of their lime margaritas (which is sub-par) and the lack of kick in their salsa (but I love very hot foods).
