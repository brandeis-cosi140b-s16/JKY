La Taqueria is located in the food court of the Boulevard Mall.  It may never rate a Michelin star, but it far surpassed what I would have expected from food court fair.

Most fast food Mexican restaurant give you a choice of hard or soft taco shells.  If it's a slightly better place they might even give you the option of flour or corn tortillas.  La Taqueria takes things just one step farther, offering you the option to eat your tacos on lettuce shells.  This is fantastic news for those who've chosen to go gluten free.  For me, it was just a very healthy and very tasty option that elevated my simple order of tacos with carnitas into something a little more special.   I ordered a plate of 3 lettuce tacos, each of which came on a very large leaf of what appeared to be romaine lettuce.  The lettuce was crisp and fresh, and was showing no signs of having been out of the cooler before my tacos were made.  I headed over to the salsa bar which had three different kinds of salsa and a variety of other veggies.  There was a mild red, medium red, and a green salsa.  There were chopped onions, chopped cilantro, sliced limes, whole radished, pickled jalapeno slices, and some kind of pickled onion or radish to choose from.  I loaded up my tacos with fresh condiments and headed for the tables to try them out.

Mmmmm.... Cool Crispy crunchy lettuce, warm tender moist carnitas, spicy salsa, juicy pico de gallo... These were damn good tacos for a food court.  I must admit the atmosphere is standard food court with a sterile feel and completely lacking in any character, but the food makes up for it in spades.  It was a fresh and tasty lunch that felt pretty healthy compared to some of the other stuff we ate in Vegas and I left feeling pretty satisfied.
