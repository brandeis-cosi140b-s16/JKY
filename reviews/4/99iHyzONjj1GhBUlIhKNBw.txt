This review is for 4.5 stars. I've been here a couple times before writing this review, but it had been years. My husband didn't like it his first time here. And so glad to have become reacquainted! We ended up going here twice in a two week period BTW. Funny short story. Recently, he asked me "What's for lunch? When I said "Zaba's". He said "Are you serious?" ("Cause, usually, I say "El Pollo Loco.") But we ended up at Baja Fresh.

Looks small from the outside appearance. Seating is in front, outside, inside (square booths, think kitchen nook), stools facing the window, looking outside, as well as another area outside, in back, too. Bathrooms are in the back of the restaurant. Clean place, clean bathroom. Your food is made to order, right in front of you, like Chipotle. You choose your preferred ingredients. Free Refills on fountain drinks.

We went for lunch, not crowded, but seems to have more takeout orders than dine-in. The first time, I had taquitos, which comes with a side of guacamole and chips. Crunchy goodness, but not greasy. The guacamole was fresh. I enjoyed it. The second time, I had the single tacos, one shrimp, one fish. I liked the fish taco better. Don't get me wrong, the shrimp one was good, but I liked the seasoning better on the fish, and the crunch, too. There is also a 3-taco combo, but the 2 tacos I got were good enough for me. The salsa is very good, too. 

My husband got a couple different items- a burrito, on both occasions; also sampled the different meats. I think I like the pork better here, than at Chipotle. I noticed that there are many different menu items (tacos, burritos, taquitos) but the salads cost much more. Much like Chipotle (he didn't like it there the first time, either), he likes Zaba again. But unlike Chipotle, also has shrimp and fish on the menu, too. 

I might get something different the next time we go.
