Tacos Tuesday, so two tacos and a drink were less than $5 and delicious. The free chips are great.  Service could be nicer, I accidentally took the wrong tray (I swear she said my number) and quickly brought it back when I heard my number again (I hadn't touched the food), but the lady behind the counter was not very nice about it even though I apologized about 5 times, she wouldnt even look at me lol. Oops!!
