We went to Hot Taco at the busy time on a Friday night. There was a little wait, but mostly because they seemed understaffed. The hostess was very shy.

The salsa was almost spicy. The cocktails are very very sweet, way too sweet for our liking, but if you like sweet drinks they would be good. My paloma ("Ventura") tasted more like pink lemonade.

The stuffed jalape√±os were out of this world!!! They're stuffed with pork and cheese and have plenty of heat. Yom! The enchilada was crispy fried, also tasted good.

I got the poblano stuffed with veggies and cheese,  which wasn't bad, but the cheese wasn't fully melted, which was a disappointment. The kale gave it a different flavor in a good way.

Sad we didn't try the tacos or empanadas, but we'll probably be back. Overall it was what you'd expect: casual, slightly overpriced Mexican-American fare in a great location.
