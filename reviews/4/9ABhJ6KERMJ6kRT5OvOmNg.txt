Have been to the one on Sunset, first exp here. Very cozy and comfortable in the restaurant section..bar laid back w/ lots of video going.  Food is pretty much the same..had a combo plate. enchildas were good...nice that you get a choice of sauces to blend. Chile Relanos..nice very mild, nice crunch went you bit into them, lots of filling. Food is not high end...great local place..chips, salsa, bean dip..great so if the meal doesnt satisfy...you have back up.....enjoy..
