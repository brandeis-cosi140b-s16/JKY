Very tasty taco. They have a nice variety, and they follow the golden rule, KISS, keep it simple stupid! Seasoned wet chicken, cilantro, lime on the side, oaxaca cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion. Simple is perfect. The cookies are on the firm side, but they taste good (think "less sugar" "more orange extract" than yours).
