Armando's is the perfect place to go to for a late night meal...  It's fast and it's cheap, and at 2 in the morning it's great to chow down on some nachos, or rolled tacos and guacamole.. Yum! 
 My only suggestion would be to sweep out all those weird car gangs in the parking lot, who just hang out.... It just doesn't look safe, nor attractive..

I will be back, as its the only place around there with good food that's open late at night..
