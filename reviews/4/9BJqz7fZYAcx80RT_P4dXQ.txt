Old and reliable.  The name has changed from Guadalajara to Cabo, but the food remains consistent and good.  Miss the days where they had a gigantic salsa bar with a wide variety of salsa recipes (Palace Station).  Only 2 exist now with the salsa bar, Sunset Station and Boulder Station.  The bar is scaled down from the days of old, but it is still good.  Food is pretty awesome and the prices are fair and competitive.  Only downfall is that sometimes the service is pretty slow.  Definitely recommend!
