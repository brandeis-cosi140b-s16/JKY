el pollo loco has really good chicken for the price and quality. my dad had some 12 pieces of chicken for 12 bucks and got some kind of chicken pocket pita with avocado and other stuff. really good value.

the chicken isnt all salty and greasy. baked with a seasoning marinade. considering they have to cook it for a while it was still juicy. their spicy guacamole sauce is really good. i didnt like their pico.

after i finish eating im pretty grubby and have food all over my hands a face and scream "VIVA EL CHUPACABRA!"
