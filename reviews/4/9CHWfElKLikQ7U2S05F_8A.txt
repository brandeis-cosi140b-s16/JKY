The bakery is fantastic but so is their food. I worked briefly for a real shithole in downtown but the one bright spot was it allowed me to lunch at Azteca almost daily. I fell in love with their carnitas burros, which are HUGE and about 3 bucks if I recall correctly. One of the things I miss about being in California is how you can find those huge $3 burros just about everywhere, well Azteca is your place for that sort of thing.

Please go there and help support a great local restaurant and bakery.
