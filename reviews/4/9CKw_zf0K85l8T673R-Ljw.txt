I'm not sure why this place only has 3 stars because its one of my fav's for Mexican. The chicken tortilla soup is amazingly scrumptious!  Huge chuncks of white meat chicken as well as other veggies!  On the lunch menu I always order the buckin burro with chicken enchilada style.  Oh my yumminess!  You get beans and rice as well. The chips and salsa are good too... If u like spicy you can ask for the hotter stuff. Service can vary depending on your server but most are pretty good. Had chicken fajitas too. Came out on sizzling plate as usual.  Pretty good but not the best I've ever had.
