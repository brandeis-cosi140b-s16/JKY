Went early on a Friday evening. We were the first ones in for dinner and by the time our food came the restaurant was full. 

We had the shrimp ceviche and Flautas as starters. Both were amazing. It's not often that I'm struck by a unique flavor but both had a rare distinct taste. 

Between the four people in our party we had carne de sada, Camarones Enchilados (jumbo shrimp), pork and lamb chops. The meats were super tender and juicy. The shrimp were the largest I've seen in a restaurant and coated with a SPICEY orange sauce. I love spicy food and this sauce had a kick. The meal was served with fresh flour tortillas; something I've never seen in the midwest.

The only weakness in the food were the chips (little greasy). But this in no way detracts from the awesomeness of the entrees.
