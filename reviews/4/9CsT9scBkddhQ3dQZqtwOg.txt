Chicken marinated and grilled to crispy skin perfection over an open flame. I love it. I love it so much I could marry it. Only if I did, we would never have kids since she'd be barren from all the flame grilling and marinating. 
I'm not sure that's the life I envisioned as a young man. 
I want a couple more kids, but not with a flame-broiled chicken.                                               i don't care how hot she is. 

The pollo bowl is only five bucks...'bout a half of a breast, rice and beans in a six inch bowl. Quite a lot actually. 
EIther get here at 11:30 or wait until after 1:30, when after the lunch crowd subsides.

Be prepared for panhandlers standing just outside the door asking for loose change.
Such a great hood. 
Enjoy.
