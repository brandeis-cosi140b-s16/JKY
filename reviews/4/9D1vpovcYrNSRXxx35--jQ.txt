Stopped by here for the first time today.  Had the taco platter with a side of rice and beans and a horchata. Thought it was good and authentic.   It was fast and there was a variety of meat to choose from.  Reminded me of La Bamba only without a drive thru and you get to see your food being made.  Would recommend and will be coming back.
