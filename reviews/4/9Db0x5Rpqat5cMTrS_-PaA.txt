The food was extremely fast and tasty! Portion sizes are unbelievable. I ordered three taquitos and a quesadilla and wasn't even able to finish the quesadilla. I've seen smaller car tires...this thing was HUGE!! The joint was nearly empty when we got there but filled up quickly. Even so, the good prep pace never slowed. I'll definitely be back!
