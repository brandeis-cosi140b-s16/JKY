Ate here a couple of times. Didn't know they gave you so much food. I ordered Fajitas with a side of guaco and a side of pico de gallo....The bag that I picked up felt like 15 pounds of food.  This was for less than $25.  

They forgot my side of guacomole =(...that's $5 of nothing.  I was looking forward to it too.  =(.

They are insanely busy. I think this is a good place to go for drinks or to watch baseball or basketball.  But I would call ahead (like 30 min) to order my food and then take it to go.  The food isn't that good for that long of a wait. That's just my opinion. 

If you are hungry or have a big appetite then this is the place to go because you do get a lot of food.

Pres Bush ate here. boo.

I prefer Panchos on Baseline and Central (Clinton ate there =) ) and they give you large portions and it is way cheaper but much much much more tastier.  That's just my opinion...this is coming from a Californian who looooooooooves Mexican food.
