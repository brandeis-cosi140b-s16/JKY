I have recently moved much closer to 1900 and find myself here about once a week. I have really enjoying it lately. Their veggie burrito is superior to the local competition, the fact that they use lard-free re-fried beans is awesome! The complimentary salsa is okay, but has a hint of canned tomato to it that prevents it from being great.

They have a very nice selection of mixed drinks that are very tasty. On of my extremely picky friends tried their jalapeno margarita on my suggestion and was ecstatic about it.

The place has a nice wide open dining area with plenty of seating and nice cultural decoration. Good for everything from a family dinner, to a business meeting, to a date. The bar is kinda of small compared to the dinning area, but I have always been able to get a seat there. I'm really glad I started trying this place out more often.
