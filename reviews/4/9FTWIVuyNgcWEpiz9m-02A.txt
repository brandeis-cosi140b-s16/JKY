Recently stopped in for lunch and had an excellent meal. Chicken taco, chic enchilada, beans and rice were excellent. Ordered the Ceviche to share and we were very pleased. Seafood is their specialty and I plan on returning for something more daring. Restaurant is bright and comfortable. Service is friendly and efficient. Glad I found you Mariscos Sinaloa.
