Did you know that on Tuesday you can get tacos for 99 cents?  Well, you can, and the beef tacos are amazing.  When you bite into them, you have grease running down your chin, so keep a napkin handy.   They come with a ton of fresh crispy shredded lettuce, and they don't skimp on the cheese either.  The chicken however, always tastes funny to me.  STAY AWAY FROM THE CHICKEN.......  They do have some outdoor seats, but this place is pretty much a drive through.
