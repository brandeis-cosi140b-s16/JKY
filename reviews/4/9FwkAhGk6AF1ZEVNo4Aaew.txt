First of all, let me say I cant believe this place got so many bad reviews on here other then the first review. Second of all let me say that the only thing i've had here are the burritos and tacos so maybe that is why. 

I have been here about 5 times now so I can comfortable say that the flavor is consistent and the quality is the same every time. My first trip was their opening weekend and my latest trip was last Tuesday. On Tuesdays they have 99 cent tacos and 1.99$ burritos. 

I would say that it is a tie between the Arizona burrito and the Green Chili burrito for top burrito i've ever had....they are amazing...add sour cream to the green chili burrito to really bring it to life. 

I've also had the beef taco, carne asada taco, and pork taco....all were good, but not as good as the burritos. 


I recommend you try this place on a Tuesday and get the Green Chili burrito and judge this place for yourself....if its bad, you are out 1.99$...if it is good you just found a great burrito place like I have. 

Again...im shocked this place has received so many 1-2 stars so far....
