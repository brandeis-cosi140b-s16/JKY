Got here right before they close at 9pm. My husband and I are staying at the lake Las Vegas resorts and were a little hesitant to eat at the resorts due to the high prices. It's definitely a hole-in-the-wall place but it's really tasty, authentic Mexican food. The men were very sweet and quick. Ordered a Carne Asada torta ($4.95) and my husband ordered an Al Pastor Burrito ($5.40) Very reasonable pricing. Definitely can't beat the prices compared to eating in the resorts. 4 stars, not 5 due to cleanliness.
