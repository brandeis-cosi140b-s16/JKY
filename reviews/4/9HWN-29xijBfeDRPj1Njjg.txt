Ever since coming back from Miami and experiencing their cortadito coffees, my friends and I have been on the endless search for this espresso drink. 
I've always known about Havana Grill as my hairdresser and fave eatery, Jun's, is in the same complex; I guess I just never had the chance to eat here.

One morning I convinced my roomie to come with; and boy did we have more than just cortaditos! lol

We were the 1st ones there and I had read reviews about coconut water in their mojitos so, I had one (or two). It was very refreshing. I think too much ice as I was done with my 1st one very quickly...I guess I was thirsty ;)

Ordered shrimp ceviche, 2 orders of plantains (obvi), and vaca frita for me; and lechon asado for him. 

The waiter's recommendation of shrimp ceviche was so good as there was lots of shrimp and avocado, not just lots of onions. After we finished the ceviche, we just kept dipping the chips in the lemony sauce.

Plantains are always good. Sweet and crunchy on the side. YUM. I could just eat that and rice, like a Filipino breakfast.

Vaca frita is something I ordered based on the tips on Yelp but, I had no real clue on what it was. And deng, was it delicious. Shredded beef and onions and garlic was sooooooooooooooooooo tasty; and went sooooooooooooooooooo well with the rice. UGH. So reminiscent of Filipino breakfast with the garlic and salt on the rice.

Roomie loved his lechon asado. He said it was better than what he imagined it would be.  

We were about to leave when the waiter asked if we wanted coffee.....can you believe that we almost left without the very thing that got us there (cortadito)!!!?!!!! lol
