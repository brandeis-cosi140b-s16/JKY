I still have to give it 4 stars because the food really is tasty. (minus the salsa it isn't very good)

I however had a bad experience when eating here the last time that I feel you need to know about.

We ordered the special they had at the time where you get Fajitas and a Margarita for $9.99. When it came time to pay the check the server said she needed one of our Stations Reward Cards for the discounted price of $9.99 (without your card you don't get it at that price) and I happened to have mine handy so I gave it to her along with $45 to pay for the meal and asked for the change. I looked at my receipt when I got home and noticed she used my stations card to pay for the meal with point from my card and not the cash which leads me to believe she pocketed the cash. She did bring change back but said it was $7 and I had told her to keep that for her tip. I wish I would have payed attention to the receipt then and there but I just didn't and trusted her and what she said.
I called the Reward Center and told them about hat happened and that I wanted the points put back on my card that this was absolutely unacceptable. She agreed and assured me someone from Food and Beverage would be contacting me.
Well, after 3 phone calls and 2 e-mails I cannot get anybody to respond to this complaint. I even went in person to Cabo and they said that person was off and they would have them contact me.
This is FRAUD. I will never ever go back to this location.  can't believe Stations which caters to mostly locals would allow something like this to happen?!
I will always check my receipt at any Stations from now on and encourage you to pay attention as well. This is just so upsetting.
