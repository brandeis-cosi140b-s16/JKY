Ok.. so I heard from several different people how good this place is and I finally made it in myself. I am really looking forward to going again.
I will return for dinner as I just stopped in for lunch. They get an A+ for the Guava Margarita...  The food is definitely an upscale Mexican.
I have a love/hate relationship with a menu where I can narrow down what I want to only 5 things!!
Super easy to get in and out as the valet is right in front of the restaurant. 
Food was excellent and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Just go you will enjoy it!
