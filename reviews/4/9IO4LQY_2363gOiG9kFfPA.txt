Emilianos doesn't always have a good rep which I don't get. Living/working in the area and loving Mexican food I've been going here for years. The food and service is consistent and delicious. One star deducted because sometimes the lunch can be downright slow. I love their veggie burritos, fajitas, chicken chimichangas, chicken soup, guac...did I mention the sangria? If you're not an alcohol drink their cheese sauce is pretty drinkable too. Cheers!
