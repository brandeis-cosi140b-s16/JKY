I've eaten here a number of times since they opened, both in the restaurant and take-out.  Have never had a bad meal (even fast food can be over or under cooked, just ask my son).  Service is always good and they keep the dining area clean.  Having the sauces in the large dispensers is one item I love since you don't have to deal with the little plastic bags and more often, take more than one needs.
