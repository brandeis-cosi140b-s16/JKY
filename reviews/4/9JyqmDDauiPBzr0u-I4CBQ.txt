I finally had the chance to eat at Roberto's Taco! Whoot whoot! Roberto's Taco is a take out staple after school meal for kiddos and I ALWAYS end up eating their leftovers. I was very satisfied how excellent my taco salad came out. Surprisingly, all other taco salads I've ordered previously from other places use room temperature taco shells. I really like Roberto's for deep frying their taco salad shell for that added crunch! And oh my! The meat was tender and moist with all the fixings that came with this salad! Not a waist friendly salad! But who cares! Loved every single bite :)
