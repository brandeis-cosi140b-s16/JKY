When it comes to authentic Mexican food, this place does it right!  None of the "Tex-Mex" silliness here. I always get their flautas, beans and rice. The rice isn't like mom's but THE FLAUTAS are just like mom's!!! Yeah, it's by the old freeway in the non gentrifying part of downtown, but the portions and taste make this place worth driving a little off the beaten path. Lunch is always busy but once you are seated the wait is never long. I always suggest this place as a lunch spot for lunch meetings! Go now, thank me later.
