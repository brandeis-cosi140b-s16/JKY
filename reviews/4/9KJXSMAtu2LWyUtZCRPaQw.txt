I came here without reading the reviews first and I'm glad I didn't because I probably wouldn't have tried it, but I thought it was pretty good actually. 

The prices are very reasonable, especially for the combination plates. I had a combination plate with 2 empanadas, 2 tacos and 2 stuffed jalapenos with rice and beans for only $12. Stuffed jalapenos were the best thing and dipping those and the empanadas in the chipotle ranch made them even better. The fish and shrimp tacos were pretty good, but a little bland as others have mentioned. Once I put some cholula on them they were good though.

We came on a Monday and they had the mini margaritas on special for $4. They were very good. Not too sweet and decently strong. They have a great tequila selection with flights available as well. Will try that next time.

Overall, nothing too fancy but certainly good for such reasonable prices. Service was great as well. Also, they have plenty of big screen tv's showing MNF at the moment.
