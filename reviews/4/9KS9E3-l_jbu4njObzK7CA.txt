Overall this place is really good. I like the burritos and have tried most things on the menu. The only complaint I have is the selection of sauces for the food. They have the typical red/green sauce which both are not even slightly hot, salty, tasty and honestly just add some sort of wetness to a dry burrito. I will say hands down my favorite item is the beef taco bowls. They cook the bowls fresh and they use a nice thick shredded beef which is plentiful. I also really enjoy the menudo which is only served on weekends and is first come. I will say that sometimes when I get a container to go, about 50% of the time there is a huge bone with fat on it which takes up a good portion if the container. Also the menudo does not contain hominy and they don't offer it at all. The restaurant is clean and has nice seating area if you are eating in and the staff speaks English well enough that your order is easy. I will say that anything that involves beef tongue has a weird taste. I have tried that multiple times and maybe it's the way it's cooked but it does not taste as good as other places I have tried. Overall good prices and a great place to get a bite.
