Embarrassingly upset that I lived in the Phoenix area for a few years and had never tried this dive. Heresy. I am ashamed.  I am bitter.  But when i think about the food I suddenly feel better, willing to let bygones be bygones.  It has some simply amazing street tacos and probably the best salsa bar I have ever encountered. 

Easy to miss (when driving and also after not eating there for a few days), so prepare! If only their cool Dia de Los Muertos t-shirts came in big guys sizes.  I would've bought the pink one, even.
