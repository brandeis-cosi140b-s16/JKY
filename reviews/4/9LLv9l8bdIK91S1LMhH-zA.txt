This is my favorite Gilbert Taqueria. Yes, I know it's a chain but it's just sooo good! Great burros, quesadillas, salads, Mexican pasta you name it! 

The burrito's are HUGE, expect to take home leftovers, I often can make three meals out of just one burrito! My favorite being the carne asada with black beans served enchilada style with melted cheese as salsa verde! 

The salads are also very big! Served in a giant plate, with lots of lettuce, your choice of meat, cheese, beans, salsa ect. How can you go wrong? 

The queso dip is very good but you need a minimum of 2-3 people to justify ordering that much queso. 

What would a Mexican meal be without dessert? I love flan and this is probably my favorite place to get it! They have two kinds a chocolate flan covered with strawberries and a coconut flan. Both are wonderful! When I'm in town I live to swing by just to grab a dessert!
