Such a cool space! The outdoor patio is absolutely beautiful & would be the perfect spot for a group dinner. We sat inside for lunch & started with chips and guac. For my entree I ordered the special of the day, the blackened mahi spinach salad. Huge portion - essentially there was an entire piece of fish on top of a bed of spinach. Definitely couldn't eat the entire thing.

Their happy hour deals look amazing - I'm sure I'll be back!
