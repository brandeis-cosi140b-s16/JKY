Good food, great chips.  The green salsa is excellent.  I had a fish taco and it was very good, fresh fish well seasoned.  The enchilada sauce is smokier than most enchilada sauces.  I liked it but my wife didn't.

And one more time:  Chips and green salsa were fantastic.  It wasn't so much better than other mexican food places that I'd go way out of my way for it, but I'll be back for sure.
