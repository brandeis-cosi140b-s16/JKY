Happy hour special: $5 margs and $4 chips and salsa. This is about the best deal I found in Vegas. The margs were strong so it only takes a couple. I would love to get food here next time but the appetizers alone were great. I also loved the atmosphere! It was a little quiet in the restaurant, which was a nice break from the Strip, but they still have televisions in the bar area where it seemed to be busy. I plan on coming back on my next trip out!
