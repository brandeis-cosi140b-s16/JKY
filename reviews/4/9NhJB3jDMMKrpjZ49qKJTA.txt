I was visiting in LV and saw the 5 star ratings here, so had to try it as it was close by.  It was very clean and a friendly staff.  I can't give it 5 stars tho'.... the food was pretty good, the salsa was great, and I will probably go back whenever I get back to LV.  I'd recommend it if you're in the area, but wouldn't make a trip across LV for it.
