I have been going back to Rio Mirage once again, management got  a hold of me. We were able to discuss the situation. Again, I was never asking for anything! Food and service were never an issue. We discussed the problem, management gave me an reason, and everything is fine. Rachel admitted there is a problem with their website and getting her messages off the website is not the easiest way. The only reason why she knew there was an problem, was reading my review on yelp! Once she knew there was an issue, she messaged me right away! I could accept that, and will move on! Rio Mirage can expect me there once a week again! Glad to be back!
