Update: Years since original review in 2011.
Still eat here. Ratio of burned to not-burned food has decreased, but not enough to merit the 5th star.

I eat here often. 
Good food at a decent price.
Hit or miss though on the quality.
I hate it when they burn the taco shell or tortillas and I don't find out until I get home.
It doesn't happen all the time, but enough to make me comment.
Glad I didn't leave a review the day that happened.
I'd give them 5 stars if it never happened again.
