My husband and I ordered a togo here for dinner. They closed at 7 and we walked in 20 min till close. The service was excellent, super friendly and helpful. We ordered a Big Burrito combo at his recomendation (pork), also ordered a carne burrito and a cheese crisp, add an extra drink to that and our total came to 20 bucks. Not too bad. The carne was excellent. My husband liked the pork as well and it was a good size. He was a little dissapointed that the jalapeno salsa was supposed to ber the hottest, and it was not hot at all. The red was more spicy. Chips were okay. Overall I really enjoyed the food and would recommend it to others. Not super greasy, fresh food, from a nice clean place. My only complaint is that he forgot my sour cream ob the side, and I know I paid for it :(
