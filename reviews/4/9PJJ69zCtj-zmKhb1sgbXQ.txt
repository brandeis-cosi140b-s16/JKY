I had the chicken chimichanga burrito it was tasty and flavorful.  The beans and rice are pretty good not a lot of seasoning but simple and not bland either.  My husband had the chili relleno burrito which was flavorful and delicious.  The chips werr ok and the salsas were fresh but a little on the bland side.
