Once you enter, head to the deli line or straight ahead to the lady with baskets on the counter. Someone will take your tortilla and/or meat order. Once you have your order head back to the front of store to pay at register. Add on salsa, avocado, or bag of cilantro/onion at the register. Those condiments need to be paid with cash. Everything else can be paid with credit/debit.

The tortillas are absolutely amazing fresh and the real deal. Love their salsa verde too! Their carnitas are are okay...a bit greasy. The cheapest dinner you'll get for sure. Regardless, you can't beat homemade fresh tortillas. A must stop when in Charlotte.
