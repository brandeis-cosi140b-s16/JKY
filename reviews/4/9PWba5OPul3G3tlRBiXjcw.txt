I come here for one reason only! $1.50 fish taco Tuesday's! Of course there are other things on the menu, but the fish tacos are delicious!! The fish is fried perfectly crispy and is served with your choice of corn or flour tortillas. And at $1.50 each, you can easily wolf down 5 or 6 depending on your appetite. The kitchen is open, so you can watch them prepare your food. The employees have always been nice. And the salsa bar is awesome!! Mild, medium, hot...they have it all. Don't forget to load up on the cilantro/onion garnish too. Two thumbs up for me!
