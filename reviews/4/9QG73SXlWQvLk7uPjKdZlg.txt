Servers were a bit busy and distracted. But the food was sooooo good. If you are expecting watered down strip mall Mexican food, this isn't your place. The traditional soups are really good. Chorizo has a great smokey pepper flavor. The Flan was also very authentic and traditional and best of all, fresh and delicious!
