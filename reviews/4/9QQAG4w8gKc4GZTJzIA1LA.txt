Visiting from Austin, TX!  Wanted to check this place out last Xmas but they hadn't opened yet.  You had to know this was my first stop in town once the hangover from the drive was gone.

Went with my boy Bry and little one E!  LOVED that they were kid friendly and offered a menu and the bonus upon delivery of his meal.  A temporary tattoo was a fabulous bonus!  Bry and I had 3 tacos each.  

Loved the build out!  Upward does a great job paying attention to detail and branding.  That's no secret.  Loved their standard margarita (we had two each).  The Pork taco was great!  Service was awesome as EVERYONE in the building was attentive to our needs!  HUGE plus in my book being a restaurant owner.

Chips and Salsa - okay.  Fish Taco - flavorless.  Other tacos were okay.

This place gets high marks for service and overall concept.  You always want to feel transported when you dine out.  I was truly happy with the destination I landed in.  Its one ride I would take again and again!  Keep it up Joyride and cannot wait to visit you again later in the week!
