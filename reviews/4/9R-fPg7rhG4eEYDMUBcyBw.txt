I used to live across the street from Blancos and this is one of my go-to spots whenever I'm near the Biltmore mall.

The guacamole is fantastic and the margaritas are delicious.  The service is typically of any Sam Fox restaurant...always great.

The chips here aren't my favorite, but you can't go wrong with any of the tacos on the menu.  It's also a great little place for happy hour.
