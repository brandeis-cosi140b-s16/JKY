For home-style Northern New Mexican food, this is as good as it gets in North Phoenix, and Gil's is one of the best places in the valley for this style.  As mentioned in other reviews, the chips are fantastic. The little patio with the fountain is great.  Green and Red Chile are right on.  Good sopapillas.   Overall, it is worth going out of the way to eat here.
