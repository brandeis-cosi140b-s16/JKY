See "Bud W." review. As you can tell this is a hole in the wall place but sooo much better tasting food than Roberto's. I don't know what they season the carne asada with but it gives it a much better flavor than the blandness of Roberto's. Always quick service and good service. Definitely worth the hunting, finding and stopping here. 9am-9pm
