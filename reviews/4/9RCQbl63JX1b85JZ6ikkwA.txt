wow, the places you'll go when you're hungry....

actually was working on some property in area, needed to find close place for lunch for myself and work crew, Rigo's was the spot

ordered the taco plate special which included a drink and 4-5 small street style tacos
pretty good for price, I think was about 20 bucks for 3 orders

we all got the carnitas, and appearance of the restaurant aside, they were actually pretty decent

I know the salsa bar looks like crap, and restaurant could use a makeover, but seriously guys, look at the area....kind of to be expected!  Gotta have your pickled carrots, radishes and jalapenos to accompany the tacos right?

I'm from the los angeles area, so in comparison, these were actually decent tacos
not anything special, or a place to go out of your way for, but if you need a quick, cheap bite in the area, this place will do.

have actually been here a few times now, sometimes they don't have counter person that speaks English....but not hard to order, plus you can always just point to pics of specials!

again, be realistic with your expectations and you'll be fine here.
