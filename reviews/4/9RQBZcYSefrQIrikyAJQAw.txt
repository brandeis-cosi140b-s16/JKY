It becomes clear the moment that you walk in, you are in an authentic Mexican Restaurant.  Great food and great service.  Prices are more than reasonable. We got nothing fancy, but everything was top notch and tasted great. Make sure to try the guacamole. My wife loved her Taco Salad. I always test a Mexican place by checking the enchiladas as I find it is a good measure.  Mine were perfect.  Kids were happy.  Simple atmosphere.
