This place opened on December 15th. We originally went to Tea Time when we found out about this place months before it was open. The owner seemed really excited about this spot, which made us want to come back and try his grub. 

Meats are flavorful and juicy. I tried many different items including the Tinga, Carnitas, and Al Pastor. Then I went for the Sonoran Style Hot Dog. To finish off, I had the Tres Leches cake. 

All food was delicious. It wasn't super-special, but this place will definitely catch people's attention in the area that it's in because there aren't too many other places like it around the northern area.
