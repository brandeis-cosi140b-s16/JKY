Finally this new location opened. It was crowded with the East Side people who have been waiting for a new watering hole with the Avenue Bar still closed for the remodeling. The bar is a big oval one with lots of room and good drinks just like the other locations. Our food was very good and served in a timely manner. I think things have improved since some of these other review were done. The building was not changed too much since it was the Cobblestone Station and other names in the last few years. It is still very noisy in the bar and restaurant and I do agree that some soundproofing would improve the experience. Great to have TexMex on the east side again.
