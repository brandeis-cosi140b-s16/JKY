On a business trip to Vegas, I needed some place to eat. I came across Peppers, and thought "I'll give it a shot". At first I was concerned because it was around 5pm and there was only one other person besides my self in the place. I looked at the menu and saw authentic Mexican food and went for it. 

I ordered the chicken in tomotillio sauce. I never had this before, but was pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious. I also had a pair of flautas. Now, I am sure I am crossing the line here, but they are really just taquitos for those who aren't latin/hispanic. 

The customer service was great, and the place was really clean. I used the restroom and I felt like I was in a hotel suite. 

Really nice spot, especially for an "out of town-er" like myself.
