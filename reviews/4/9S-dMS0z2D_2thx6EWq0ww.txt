Tasty, affordable and quick. Friendly staff. I liked the mini burrito options to try favorites. My go to is the chicken green chile burrito. The Beef enchilada my husband had was fantastic and tostada was delicious. We ordered nachos which come with shredded cheese, unmelted and were handed a hot sauce. It looked weird but was different and enjoyable.
