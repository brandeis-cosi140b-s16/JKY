Whenever I forget to defrost something for dinner or the family is having a lazy night I like to run by El Pollo Loco. Its fairly healthy, inexpensive, and taste good. I have even catered from them in the past when a last minute get together landed in my lap. 

The chicken is pretty good, but I really like the chicken rollers and Loco Salad. They have a decent menu with options for just about everyone. Its fast food, so you get what you pay for.
