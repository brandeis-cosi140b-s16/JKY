Las Tapatias is closed, but don't be sad! Chuy's Tacos Mexican food is here. They have been in business for two months. The food is fast and fresh. He salsas are tasty, the chips crisp and filling, and the service is very polite. I did have to brush up on my Spanish, but we got it done.

The helpings are generous and the prices reasonable. The food is tasty and I'd really like to see this place stick around.

In a neighborhood of fast food, this is a nice change of pace.
