I've found, to my disappointment, that Pittsburgh and Mexican food generally don't mix. Let me give you a heads up and say that I did recently move from TX, so make of my comment what you will. However, having moved from TX, I feel like my opinion should count for something, right? ; ) 

I always order a chicken quesadilla from all the new Mexican restaurants I try. It's my go to dish for determining whether I'll be back. While other Mexican(y) restaurants here have failed to deliver on the quesadilla front, Los Cabos has not. Their chicken quesadilla was nicely flavored and had a crispy tortilla shell....just the way they served it in TX! Granted, it's probably not the best tasting quesadilla I've ever had, but it's definitely the best I've tried in Pittsburgh! I also appreciate that they throw in a free basket of chips and salsa with your order (what's with the whole charging for a basket of chips? I've never seen that until I moved here!). I've tried their queso and while it wasn't bad tasting, it wasn't what I was expecting. It was more of a salsa/cheese mix than a creamy, thick, cheese sauce. I think I'll pass on the queso next time I'm there and try their guac instead. 

If you go, just keep in mind this place is more of a order at the front, seat yourself, grab your own drink kind of place (think Panera) instead of an actual sit down restaurant with a bar. So while I'm still in search of a great tasting Margarita here in the 'Burgh, I at least know exactly where to go to get my fill of Mexican food.
