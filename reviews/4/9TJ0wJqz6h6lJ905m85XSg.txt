Really good. We got the spinach con quest and guacamole for a started. The guac was very fresh. I ordered the chimi macayo with and it was delicious. I thought the enchilada sauce would have been a little more flavorful. My favorite was the dessert. We got the deep fried ice cream and added chocolate sauce. It was amazing.
