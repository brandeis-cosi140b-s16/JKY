As other reviewers have stated, this is not true, authentic Mexican food. Macayo's, along with Top Shelf, serves the white people's version of Mexican food. Nothing too scary or spicy to freak us out, right?
That being said...it's Macayo's! Native Arizonans at least know about the chain, if not having been raised on their food. Yes, the decor is loud and obnoxious with bright colors and enormous parrot statues, but it's awesomely bad. Appreciate the eccentricity, people! The food is decent. It's a bit on the greasy side, but if you came in here expecting something healthy and easy on your stomach, that's your problem. I will say that the wait staff is unpredictable; they have a high turnover rate of employees except for the tiny woman who brings the chips and salsa who has been there for years. You could end up waiting a long time; my personal experience is that our food usually comes so damn fast that it startles me. One last thing: if you like your margaritas sweet, you won't like theirs. Always very tart. They're drinkable, but sour. They say they put triple sec in there but I'm calling shenanigans on that.
