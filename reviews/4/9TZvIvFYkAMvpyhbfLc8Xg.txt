As the four stars would imply, I'm a fan of Qdoba.  

Nothing against other places like Moe's, Salsarita's and Chipotle, I just think Qdoba tastes a lot better.

They have multiple types of burritos that you can order with tortilla or without (saves you a surprising amount of calories).  They also have quesadillas, nachos, soups, etc.

Recommendations:  Naked BBQ Chicken burrito.  It's sort of amazing.

Not sure of how long this will last or if it's just this location, but they have Buy One Get One Free Burritos at the Woodlawn/Park location.
