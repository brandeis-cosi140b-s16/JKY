I have to say I've always loved me some On The Border. I'm definitely not a picky person when it comes to Mexican. This Tex-Mex chain is one of the best though. I used to live near the one in Concord, NC and seemed to eat there at least twice a month. Now that I'm on the other side of town, this location isn't that close to me, so I don't make it out to On The Border as much as I would like. The free chips and salsa that they first bring out are the best. I always find this to be a test with any Mexican restaurant. If the Chips and Salsa suck.... then things usually go down from there...lol. I have always seemed to enjoy everything I have ever ordered on the menu, but on this visit I got the Southwest Chicken Tacos with a bed of rice (no beans). I had already told my friends at the table about it, and it just so happened that the Waitress recommended it also. And any good meal at a Mexican restaurant can't be complete unless you have a Margarita, and On The Border has one of my favorites. Its a Swirl Margarita with Sangria mixed in it!!! And you have to make sure you ask for the Sangria one, as there are different selections. I highly recommend this Margarita. If anything go to On The Border just for it...... you won't be disappointed!!!
