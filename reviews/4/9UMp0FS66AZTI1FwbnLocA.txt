I've been here a few times because it's close by..  This is basically a Roberto's but I do find it to be a tad bit better.  I like their beans.  The salsa verde is a bit spicy. The service is good and the food comes out quickly. The sign on the window says they're open from 5am - 12am so I'm assuming they aren't 24 hours.
