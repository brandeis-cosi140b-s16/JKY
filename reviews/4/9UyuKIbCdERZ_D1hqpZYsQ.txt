Diego is a very contemporary, romantic,maroon colored restaurant with mood lighting and bubbly aquatic windows.

Here, the taste of Mexico comes to life! Delight in the rock candy syrup margaritas, queso fundido con chorizo (melted Oaxacan and Chihuahua cheese with house made chorizo sausage), tortilla soup (pasilla chile laced chicken broth with crispy tortillas, doused in cream and cheese), and the twin souffle battered chile rellano, one stuffed with Chihuahua cheese and one of chef's choice...

the food is prepared like a piece of art, the portions are not as sizeable as with most standard mexican restaurants, and the prices are noticeably higher, but the food speaks for itself. in addition, you will find the traditional chocolate and bean "mole" sauce accompanying many of the dishes, which i love!

there is a reason it was voted "best mexican restaurant" in the Las Vegas Weekly.
