Went on a Friday for happy hour with a friend.  The food absolutely rocked!  Had the chimi with a red sauce and it had some of the best seasoned beef packed throughout.  Rice & beans were standard and acceptable.  Margarita was good and reasonably priced for hh, though the server added salt when i asked for none.  Only negative in the experience was the heat in the enclosed patio.  They have fans and Ac but it either wasn't working or they didn't have it turned up enough.  Will be back for the food and drinks though!
