I ate here for the first time at this particular restaurant and loved the authenticity of their food..their salsa was good! I had the fish tacos..they were fresh tasting, no fish flavor at all=]
I had a beer for only $2.25(i believe). My husband had an octopus tostada..which when i took a bite of, it was delicious.
So, if your looking for a yummy mariscos place to eat where they are friendly and it's clean, i would go back again, for sure!
