I was looking for a decent Mexican food restaurant close to work and stumbled across Susie's. Similar in price to Filiberto's but the serving sizes weren't quite as big as Filiberto's is (that's fine with me; I actually prefer "normal" serving sizes.) Loved the soft tacos! Ate there while on lunch break so didn't get to try the 1 cent beer with lunch, but made me want to go back on a Saturday to check it out!
