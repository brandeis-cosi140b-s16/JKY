two words for you... CHEESE DIP!

No lie, as soon as the plane lands in Charlotte I high tail it to this place. The Cheese Dip is so amazing that I dream about it when I'm in CA.  It can't be recreated and I can't find anything close to it in southern CA.  
The margarita's here are also very yummy! Service is quick and prices are super reasonable (i guess anything is compared to LA)

Can't wait to go back...
