The guy who yells "Welcome to Chipotle" is so enthusiastic. :)

Food tasted usual.

The the server who made the bowl for chick in front of me piled hers high with almost the same thing I was getting.


The dude that ended up making mine just stood there at first warming tortillas n wiping down the counter in between the meat. The lined backed to to the door before he looked at me with this blank stare then said, "can I help you?" When he made mine, he totally skimped on everything.  I Kinda laughed, like "really dude? Obviously I like food n u really gna half spoon it?" Lol

Seriously though.... It's all good... Sometimes u get the bomb server, sometimes you don't.
