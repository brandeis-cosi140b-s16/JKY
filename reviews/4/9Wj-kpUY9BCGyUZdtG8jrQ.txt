I can't believe Matta's closed.  I used to work there back in the early 90's , and was friends with several of the family.  I loved their food.  Last time I was there was about 5 years ago, though.  same waitresses were still there.  Our Saturday/Sunday going to work hungover food was chips and hot sauce mixed with ranch dressing!!  Their chips were really light and crispy.  Hot sauce was just that ... hot.  My favorite was probably their chicken burro, no tortilla and rice.  Makes my mouth water just thinking about it.

There was also a restaurant that was opened up in .... Pine? Is that one still around??
