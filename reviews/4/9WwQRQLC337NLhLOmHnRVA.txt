Grim strip mall outside.
Bright and cute inside.

Very spicy salsa. Nice!
Homemade flour tortillas. Good.
Barbacoa seca. Stewed, tender and falling off the bone.

Will return to try the mole.

Update: Returned for mole, twice. 4 star mole. Very good, better than most, but not knock my socks off mole.
