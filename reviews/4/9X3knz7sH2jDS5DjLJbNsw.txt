Id like to start of this review by saying I am a Vegas local and attend pool parties in Vegaswhenever I get the chance. I absolutely loved this place, I cant tell you enough. No lines, No cover (not that I've ever paid one), Decent Music, and really freaking BEAUTIFUL people. The water was clear which is more then nice if you have ever gone to Rehab at the Hard Rock. The Cabanas looked cozy and comfortable, and the drinks were good. My favorite part about my time there was people watching, everyone there was looking there best but I couldn't believe how everyone has tattoos, most of them not even artful or nice looking. The amount of hearts, stars and tribal designs was a bit overwhelming. Overall I had a great time, but hey, that could have just been the company.
