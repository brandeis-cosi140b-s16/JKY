Ah, Texano's.  It's not always the cleanest place (I've seen the trash overflowing on a few visits) but the food is always good.  The dining area isn't the biggest but they offer outdoor seating as well and I'm fairly certain most come for takeout.  Finding seating should never be an issue.  At times the table may need a scrubbing but I generally look past that.

There's a jukebox stocked with mariachi music.  Most times it's silent but when it's on the mariachi is blasting.  Distracting for some, no doubt, but I always get a kick out of it.  Typically a song pops up after I order and sit down to wait for my meal.  The timing is such that it's almost playing in celebration of my patronage.

I have never been less than satisfied with the food at Texano's.  Typically I order the California burrito but I've also had the Oaxaca burrito and enchilada's.  The menu consists of typical fast food Mexican and is virtually identical to Filiberto's .  With the exception of the standard taco, I prefer everything from Texano's over Filiberto's.  

One week I must have eaten here 3-4 days in a row.  I would on a regular basis if I had the money to eat out as often as I would like to.  Texano's might be my favorite Mexican joint in Tempe, possibly even my favorite Tempe restaurant in general.

Be sure to try the house spicy guacamole sauce.  This stuff is delicious and actually spicy (that will always impress me).  The sauce, however, has been out a few times when I went late night or early morning.  I think they make a supply for each day and let the customers partake on a first-come, first-served basis.
