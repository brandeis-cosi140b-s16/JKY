Great authentic place for Mexican cuisine. The second you walk in it just gives off a good vibe. Food was really good too, I ordered the fajitas and everything came out fresh and hot. Only thing I wasn't too fond of was the guacamole. It was too plain. Just avocados and cilantro. It needed more salt line juice onions peppers etc.
