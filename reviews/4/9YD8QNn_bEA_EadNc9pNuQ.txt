I love Baja Fresh. sadly I didnt know this till it was too late. I used to live in Vista, CA where there was one within walking distance to me and one day I was craving it hardcore and realized it was closed! NO!!!! and the closest one was like 45 min. away. So when I moved here to LV I realized... Game on! I love their mahi mahi tacos. blackened espec. ! I love ALL their salsas. . the only thing I wouldnt order again was their Chicken Tortilla Soup.um. . more like woudl you like some chicken with your BIG BOWL OF ONIONS? yuck. I've ordere this soup at many other places typically b/c this is one of the semi healthy things u can have @ a mexican rest. and i've never seen this many onions in soup b4.. not even ONION soup. . . So I'd never order that again but other than that.. everything I've ordered here is always so good. giving Rubio's a run for their $.
