I wan't sure about this place when we first arrived as it is just off the freeway and shares a parking lot with a Mexican auto / tire shop.  However, when you step inside, this little gem looks like it belongs in Old Town Scottsdale.

I made a mistake and order my old standby, shredded beef tacos.  Don't get me wrong, they were okay, but nothing like my GF's order.  She order the steak fajitas which were amazing!  In fact, these are by far the best fajitas either one of us has ever experienced.  They came with all the usual suspects, however they are of the highest quality.

I want to go back and try more items on the menu, but I am definetly ordering the steak fajitas next time!!!

If you like fajitas, you must try Rita's!
