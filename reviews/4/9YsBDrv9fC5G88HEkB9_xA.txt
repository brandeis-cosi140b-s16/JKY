This was the second place we ate at while visiting LV(check my other reviews for into).  Coming from the San Francisco area, where good Mexican food is hard to find, this place was a step up with chips and great refried beans served right up, nice Mexican decor, and excellent service.  I started with their Cadillac Margarita with Patron Silver.  Nice size goblet and a nice buzz that lasted the meal.  My girlfriend ordered the "Vampiro" which tasted like slightly alcoholic cool aid.  We sent it back and immediately had it replace with a delicious pina colada.  I had read about their Chile Colorado, a new york cut into pieces in a red sauce(gringos need not worry about it being a spicy sauce) to which I added their flavorful spicy sauce and that did the trick.  I ordered the flour tortillas (I believe they are freshly made, as it tasted that way to me.)   My girlfriend ordered the Mexican combo beef taco, chicken enchilada,  and chile relleno ( The beef taco took first place, chili relleno second, I found it delicious on a taste test, and enchilada a distant third.  Finally, always in search for the authentic churro, it was done right served with small decorative flowered whip cream flowers to dip in.  It was crisp and not overly sweet.   Overall I give this place a B+, as their chili colorado good have been better, perhaps make it bit more flavorful.  Nevertheless, as Mexican restaurant goes from where I am from, this place any day.
