KoMex is very different. For one, despite the very affordable meal, you get the sitdown restaurant treatment, menus and tables and all, when they could easily have made us fall in line food-court style for the quality they're delivering for the price-point. Even just the crisps they serve you when you first are seated are generous, considering your bill will likely over around $4-$7 per person by the end of it.

The service is very friendly, warm, but efficient, which makes this very busy and small establishment more cozy than hectic. That was unexpected, too.

More unexpected was the fact that I actually liked their tacos - the seafood was very good, not quite fantastic, but definitely good. The textures could have stood to be more sharp and firm, but it did make for a pretty nice cohesive taco. It was a little bit on the harsh side, with the combination of strong spices and strong citrus, but it's a nice tasteful kick instead of being outright offensive. Besides the tacos, the bulgogi fries were very, very good too, and the water was ice cold and frequently filled. 

I'm not a taco person by any means, but these are tacos I'll definitely eat, especially at a bargain like this, and with such a cute, welcoming, clean, but very casual set-up like this. Definitely very different.
