I love the milkshakes here. I've tried almost all of them, got one more to try! 
The burger and fries were good... reminded me of In-n-Out (which is a good thing for me). 
Another time tried the tacos and it didn't mesh with my palate, I thought they were too sweet. 
But I will be back for burgers and fries and of course the milkshakes!
