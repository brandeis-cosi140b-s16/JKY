I have only been here once, but I thought it was awesome.  I loved the atmosphere and the Mexico decor.  I especially like that it was indoor/outdoor seating and a pretty big bar. 
I had a great time here, the food came in big portions and everyone who worked there were pretty nice and helpful.  I can't wait to go back!
