OK I like this place. One of the better low priced Mexican places in town. It is not fancy...so don't get crazy here.

Portion sizes are huge. I killed a chicken burrito here and was full till the next day.  

It's quick, the same lady serves me every time, and she'll help you rearrange your order if you need to.  For instance, I now ask for lettuce and tomato & just a little rice with my burrito. 

Took 3 co-workers there last week and they were all presentably surprised at how good it was
