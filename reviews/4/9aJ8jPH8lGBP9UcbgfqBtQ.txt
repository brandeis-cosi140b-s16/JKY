I love Diego Pops, such an awesome and welcome addition to Old Town Scottsdale. It has good food, a fun and whimsical atmosphere without the attitude. 

Food has always been pretty stellar, not mind blowing but pretty flippin awesome! Think your usual small joint taco fare with a few additions that take it over the top... think fresh poke bowls and honestly no visit is really complete without an order of their in my own opinion famous Brussels sprout nachos; yes I just said what you think I did, and seriously I get what is going through your mind but somehow they make brussels sprouts and nachos work. No joke, these are not your mothers Brussels sprouts doused in nasty cheese. Just try them and you can send me a thank you card later. 

So go.... go on Margarita Mondays, Taco Tuesday, Wasted Wednesday, Tequila Thursdays you get my drift, any night is a good night for Diego Pops!
