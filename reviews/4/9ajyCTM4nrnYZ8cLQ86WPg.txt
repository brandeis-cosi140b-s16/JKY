Had lunch here today, yummy! Fresh, flavorful food with excellent service. Casual clean sit down or take out spot. Had the Carne Asada taco and pollo taco Azule (with cabbage, cheese and tomatoes). All tacos are on soft corn tortillas with fresh onion and cilantro. The meats had a great flavor and the house made salsa is awesome! Will definitely be back, can't wait  to try the rice pudding!
