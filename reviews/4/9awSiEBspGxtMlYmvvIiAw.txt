This is a little North Phoenix strip mall restaurant with consistently tasty breakfast burritos and great service. I've never waited longer than 5 minutes to get my food after placing an order; super efficient when picking up food to go.
Try some chips and delicious homemade salsa while you wait, they do not disappoint.
