For airport food, this was pretty decent. Ordered fish tacos and they brought me shrimp. Waitress felt bad and brought me two extra fish tacos, so I could taste them. AND AND they are hardly selfish with the avocado! I got over a 4th of an avocado on each taco. Do the math! 

The waitress was helpful and extremely friendly. 
 
And don't get me started on the margarita! Don Julio Cadillac Margarita, and MAN! It was RIGHT! She was not selfish with the tequila and I sure appreciated that! 

I will DEFINITELY try again.
