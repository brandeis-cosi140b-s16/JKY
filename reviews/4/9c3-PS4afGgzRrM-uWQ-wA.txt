I always order the same thing as I don't think I will ever get tired of it.  I get the Mole Poblano chicken.  The sauce is so delicious and I order extra of it.  I also love their pico de gallo and other salas as they taste fresh made. The rest of us has ordered various items and all has been really tasty.  While it isn't strictly authentic, it's hundreds times better than most so called Mexican places nearby.  Only reason I gave it a 4 stars as sometimes they play around with their mole and it isn't consistently the same.  But that only happened twice in the years I have been eating here.  I would recommend this place!
