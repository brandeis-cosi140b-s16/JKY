The decor of this restaurant is so authentic its bright and colorful. We ordered apple margaritas they were delicious instead of salt they honored our request to put sugar on the rim. For the entrees we ordered chicken,  shrimp and steak quesidillas they were delicious and flavorful. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Waitstaff was very attentive.
