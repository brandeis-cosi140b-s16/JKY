This place caught my eye a couple of months ago, but I've not made the time to stop until today.  Took my favorite foodie friend to check it out with me.  Between the two of us, we tried their 3 tacos (chicken, pastor and fish), a shrimp tostada and their tamarindo.

For me, the chicken taco was the suprising winner -- with their fabulous green sauce with cilantro and onions.  The shrimp tostada was dynamite -- and a great value at $3.95 for a large plate full of freshly marinated shrimp, fresh avocado and pico -- more than enough to fill two crisply fried corn tortillas -- served separately, which I loved.

The tamarindo had that wonderful tart -- think Mexican Arnold Palmer - taste that goes so well with Mexican food  -- for lunch, at least...

This is a one man show -- he cooks, he cleans, he serves, he takes your money -- and the menu is fairly extensive for such a tiny place.  It was clean -- and he was pleasant.   Plus the 24 hour drive-thru makes for a super convenient option, I'm thinking on the way home...when the weather cools off and their albondigas soup will be the perfect supper...

I've found at some of the smaller mom&pop joints, that if I don't speak Spanish, my meal suffers...but not here.  This is a great find.  

Oh, and on their website, it says they deliver...not sure who does that -- but hey -- for nearby college students (and staff) at UNLV...it would be awesome (who wants to give up their parking spot?!)
