We had a really good meal here. I had the Shrimp Rellenos and my husband had the chicken enchiladas. Both were very good. The actual restaurant was really quaint and inviting. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was for two reasons. First,  the guacamole appetizer was tiny....I mean really small. It could easily be fixed by upsizing to a small bowl. Second, the prices were a tad high. I would pay $13-$17 for items...but pushing $23 is a bit high.  The saving grace on price would be happy hour...$1 street tacos and $3 cheese quesadillas are a steal.  Overall, great food..but pricey.
