Legit, delicious food. 

A few pals and I came here after volunteering at a school nearby. When we drove past in the morning, we knew we'd have to forgo the volunteers' lunch and save room for this. 

I went for cheese enchiladas while my dining companions got various tacos. Their enchilada sauce was super flavorful as was the hot sauce (which I always drench my food with). Didn't love the refried beans but otherwise my meal was on point. 

Bonus for the meat being grilled outside, so you can follow the scent into the restaurant, knowing you're in for a treat. 

Also, the place is nice and bright and clean.
