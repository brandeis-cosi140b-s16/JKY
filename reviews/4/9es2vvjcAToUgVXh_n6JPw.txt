Migos is a remodeled and has new ownership.  It's in the same building as the old Taco Migos was, but is a much more like a real restaurant with a full bar and music at night, not fast food walk-up-to-the counter type.
My friend and I went for a quick lunch and got more than enough food for 2.  Their servings are huge and everything was tasty.
I had the Chicken Taco trio with lots of moist chicken a tasty cabbage mixture on top of the traditional corn tortilla. I couldn't eat it all.
My friend had a really tasty cheese quesadilla that comes with guacamole & sour cream.  The cheese was really good not some cheap american or cheddar cheese.

I hope to try them for Happy Hour soon.
