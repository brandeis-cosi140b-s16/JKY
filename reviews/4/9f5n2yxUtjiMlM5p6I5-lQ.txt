The high quality fresh ingredients, plus the  Mexican preparation style of combining simple fresh and authentic ingredients (cheeses used for toppings, for ex.) for mouthfuls of complex deliciousness make this place. I had 5 different taco varieties and found the meat of each cooked very well, tasty, and the taco toppings perfect combinations. The mole of the mole fries dish was surprisingly good. The guac is unadulterated with chemical additives (of good enough to fool me). The corn on the cob was authentically prepared with typical toppings. I'm so over Roberto's. Other authentic taquerias aren't as refined in the cooking and delivery of the dishes.
