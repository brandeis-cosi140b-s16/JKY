Really good food and yes- really pretty waitresses!

Invited here by a contractor after completing a job- probably not a lot of gringo's like me going through the doors, but I found out I was missing out.  Like this place a lot, the hustle, the volume, total atmosphere- very friendly.  Never once felt out of place.

Had a shrimp tostada that was very "cool" on a warm day- refreshing. Could eat that starter clam soup all day long though!  Also had my first Michelada- think I might be hooked on that!  Great with Pacifico.

Place reminds me a lot of my younger years in El Paso.  Too bad the staff had to put up with my seriously lacking Spanish- but they weren't too hard on me.  Definitely want to go back again for some fresh mariscos dishes- maybe help some friends discover this place too, who may not otherwise venture in.  

Try it for some really fresh sea food, Mexican style.  Close your eyes and imagine the beach right outside.  That's the feel.
