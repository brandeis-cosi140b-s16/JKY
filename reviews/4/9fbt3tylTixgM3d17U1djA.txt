I was excited to see another Barrio outpost make their home at the Yard!  I came by with two friends for dinner and we sat on the "patio".  We started with skinny margaritas and guacamole made tableside and I had the famous enchilada suizas for my entree...just as good as I remembered them at the original Barrio on 16th Street.  Good service, good location in the Yard and seriously tasty food!
