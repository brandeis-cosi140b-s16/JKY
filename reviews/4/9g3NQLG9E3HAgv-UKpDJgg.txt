3 1/2 stars (but I'll round up).

It's good, but not particularly outstanding.
I love New Mexican (as in the state) food and understand the addition of broader American and Mexican options in the menu... but found myself wishing they had stuck with a single theme, and done it well.

The sauces (for enchilada, chile relleno) were wonderfully flavored.  I was not impressed with the ceviche (probably because I was not anticipating a tomato based marinade).  Wine list was good.  

It's an accessible menu.  I think I was hoping for more niche-cuisine.
