This taqueria used to be a small hot dog stand called Senor Dogs, and my husband and I would frequent the place after some debauchery on The Strip or Downtown.  They then expanded and have a full on taco stand going on now.  They still serve the hot dogs if that's what you're hungry for, but I've ditched them and am now turned on to the delicious Mexican food that is so good after you've had a few cocktails.

The quesadilla with carne asade is huge and they do not skimp on the cheese or the meat.  The meat is seasoned well.  I've also tried the carne asade burrito and the street style tacos, both of which were pretty good.

To be honest, I've only eaten here when I've been buzzed after some cocktails, and everything tastes good when you're buzzed.  But I can say that whenever I am feeling hungry after some late nights, I'll be the first to yell out, "Let's go to the gas station taco stand!!!"  And that's where we always end up!
