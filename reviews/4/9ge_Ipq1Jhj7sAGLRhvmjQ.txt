Great Ranchero meal. I lived in Mexico for 9 years and this food is the closest thing to BCS I've had in the states. Miguel, the owner is a super friendly guy and eager to please. 

They will have liquor starting around Feb 8th 2012 or so. 

Don't pass them by, stop in for a good meal or order to go and please your pallet at home.
