I tried the carne asada plate, per Russ V.'s suggestion, and it was really good!  Keep in mind, it's a ton of food.  But so yummy!  And a reasonable price for $7.  Why didn't someone tell me about this place when I went to UNLV?

They only offer outdoor seating and it was a little cold outside so I had to take it to go.  Also, not necessarily the safest location in the world.  I wouldn't go there in the middle of the night by myself.  But I highly recommend it for a quick yet tasty lunch or late night cravings with a group.
