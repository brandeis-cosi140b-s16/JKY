Just got home from eating lunch at Zaba's. No problems or complaints from this place! I ordered the shredded beef burrito [$6.89] that came with your choice of white/wheat flour tortilla, white/brown rice, black/pinto beans, salsa pico de gallo/seasoned corn/green tomatillo, shredded cheese & lettuce. My main man ordered the carnitas burrito [$6.49], same choices. The total came to $17 with a small soda & brownie :) 

The burritos seem bigger than the other burrito places, but tiny me never really finishes a fat burrito in one sitting :P Zaba's seems to have larger portions & more variety on their menu. OH & that brownie we ate was bomb. I don't wana say it's as thick as the rice crispy treats they have at starbucks, but it's maybe half that size? Still a big size if you ask me [yea, that's what SHE said].. Anyway ...

It doesn't seem as busy as the other signature gourmet Mexican grills, but I like Zaba's since they have healthier choices as far as the wheat & brown rice. They serve coke products & they have the tabasco sauces [jalapeno, smoked], also cholula! yum yumm.. Since it's in the same shopping area that LVAC is in, they probably have discounts for LVAC members. They also have their liquor license so they have domestic & Mexican beers. I know one of these days I'll show up there sweaty from the gym & drink some beer to gain those calories back. oOoh yes! haha
