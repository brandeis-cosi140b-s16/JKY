Wow. Total re-do/double-take Batman! This place has had a facelift and it's a very good facelift indeed. The last time I trekked to this Roberto's it was probably 4 or 5 years ago. I remember it being a kind of greasy taco shop in need of a major upgrade. Ya, the food was okay, and the place was... eh.

But I came here today for a torta and the shop is really nice. The tables are clean and the entire kitchen has been turned around. The employees are nice too and my food was served up quick. I was the only one there at the time.

I ordered a carne asada torta with everything. I enjoyed this torta. I felt as though it was well made, like they actually put thought into it. I have had so many tortas that I felt were just thrown together and the guac was dripping out the sides, the pico was all runny and gross. But not this torta! It helps that it was wrapped up very tightly in the waxy-paper and then the aluminum foil. Plus the bread was hefty. It wasn't a light bread. Therefore, even though the sandwich is juicy, the bread is holding up to it. I have had a lot of tortas when I got to the bottom I just tossed the damn thing because the bread was SO mushy and gross. Not this torta. The bread was only just a bit of mush, so I could eat it with no problem.

I didn't realize this Roberto's had had a little renaissance. Now that I know, I'll probably be back more than once every 4 years.
