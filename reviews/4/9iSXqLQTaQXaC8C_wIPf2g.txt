"Nobody goes there, it's too crowded."

Darn, I like the food at Cafe Rio.  Big servings, wonderful flavor, quality ingredients.  And the freshly made tortillas are beyond compare.  It's just wonderful.  If I were to rate the place purely on the food, it would be 5 stars.

Unfortunately, I've got to knock off a star for other factors.  First, even though I said big servings were a positive, they're also a negative.  I have no idea how single people eat here.  The wife and I always split a meal because there's no way we could each eat one of anything not on the child's menu.  Yet, we see bajillions of these young, thin women in there with meals bigger than their heads.  I have no idea how they do it.  The second negative is that the prices are high.  Yes, big servings of excellent food made with quality ingredients will cost.  But, this is a place where you stand in a long line to order your food and eat it from an aluminum bowl/plate with plastic utensils.  Because we always split a single entree, the prices are fine for us.  But, again, for lone individuals, I think it's a lot of money (but, then, I'm old).  Then, there's the environment:  the place is usually jammed with people and it's unbelievably loud.  It's just an uncomfortable place.

So, wonderful food with a few other factors that knock it down by a star.  Still, a very good place to eat.
