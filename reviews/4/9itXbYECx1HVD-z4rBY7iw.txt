A really low-key, really authentic Mexican food experience. 

The food was simple, delicious, and clearly bad food you...which is exactly what we wanted out of our first Phoenix Mexican food attempt. 

The location can seem a little off-putting from the outside, but we felt 100% comfortable with taking our 1 year old daughter there once we were inside.
