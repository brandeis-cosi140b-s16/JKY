This place is so good!    They don't just have fish tacos; they have all kinds of tacos and all are great.   Parking can be a pain in NoDa, but if you drive around a little, you can often find something.   The one downside to this place is that there is no reservations.   :(   So you will have to wait.   But they will take down your number and you can check the status of your wait while you enjoy some drinks at a neighboring bar.    The other downside is that it can get loud inside.   Therefore if it is nice outside, I recommend sitting on the patio where it is a little less loud.   Even with the down "downsides" though, it is definitely worth going to!
