Street style tacos,  al pastor,  chorizo,  lengua,  buche,  pollo,  nopal,  cesos, tripa,  all delicious minus the gawking men.  It's very female friendly.  I mean,  I love the flavors of tacos El gordo,  but I don't like the ambiance,  it's the  ghetto side of town,  the loud obnoxious music playing in the background,  and I don't like being starred at by men with mouths open and gawking eyes. 

Taco y taco is fun,  with a small bar,  where you can order mixed tequila Drinks, and beer. There is an upstairs area for larger parties or special occasions.  I would definitely come back and get my taco fix.
