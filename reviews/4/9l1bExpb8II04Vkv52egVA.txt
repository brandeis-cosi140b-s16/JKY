Be careful during the lunch rush, this store will have a line out the door! (For good reason though). All Chipotles use quality ingredients, and have a superior product. In my opinion, this store stands out because of the staff. Very friendly and extremely efficient. I use the iPhone app (ya, there's an app for that) and order/pay from my office. When you get there you can stroll right up to the counter and simply pick up your bag to-go. Nothing to sign, no hassle, and no wait. Can't beat it!! Don't stress accuracy of your order either. I've had zero issues with that.
