Chipotle is a concept restaurant, so no its not going to be "authentic mexican" nor will it be authentic mexican portions prices and sizes. Try to remember what state you're in....

But I love them for other reasons, like their attempts to use more humanely raised beef, pork and chicken. 

Also the Chipotle in Midvale, UT used to donate food to the treatment center I worked at for women and children. So two days a week I got to eat it for lunch, and one time they messed up catering order. I was asked to pick up 40 free burritoes, hell yess I would, damn that was one heavy box but I got to take home 8 free burritoes! 

Anyway back to the basics, the beef is the closest thing to Carne Esada you will find in this town, the Carnitas are pretty good. Chicken is not my fav, ask for veggies on your burrito, and add Guac its worth it. 

I like that they have a variety of salsas to choose from, mild, med hot, and stock extra hot sauce. I just wish it was Cholula hot sauce but oh well. 

Someone said this location was dirty and gross, I didn't find it to be. I think Guac could be a little cheaper, seeing as how i can make it for half that price but that is my only gripe. Love these guys!
