This restaurant has over 500 reviews and has nearly 5 stars so you'd have to be sorta not too smart not to understand that this is a good restaurant. 

The people who run the place seem very nice and are super accommodating. 

It is a little cramped but the tasty food makes up for having to nearly brush elbows with the person next to you. 

When I'm in Vegas, I will be back!

Oh, I had the bulgogi and rice which was delish but I have to say that I did miss all the side items that usually accompany traditional Korean restaurant meals.
