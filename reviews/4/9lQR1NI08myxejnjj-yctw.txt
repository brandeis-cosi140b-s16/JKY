Casa Rasta has moved a few doors upstreet from its old location (now in the former Lunardi's location, which has closed).  
One thing I miss is not being able to see the staff cooking and talking with them when they have a moment.  But there is more seating with a very nice atmosphere.

The menu is limited.  Check it out on their website.  Some specials on weekends. 
We stopped by over the weekend and there were a couple of specials.  One was a sandwich with your choice of meat that came with black beans and avocado that we split and had along with a couple of tacos.  All the food was very fresh and flavorful.  Also, there is complimentary homemade salsa. 

Jarriots soda for a drink or BYOB.
