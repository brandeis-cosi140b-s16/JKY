I've only been here on two occasions: once when I first moved here and was craving a breakfast burrito on the go, and once late night. Let me start of by saying that Eribertos is the perfect drunk food...seriously. I got the crane asada tacos an was a very happy camper. The staff is friendly, and if you speak to them en espanol they're even friendlier. Their menu is extensive and you can get essentially anything Mexican you crave--even horchata.

Overall, if you're inebriated and starving, DEFINITELY try eribertos late night delights.
