Overall I would say this place is nice place to have friday night dinner with the whole family. Inside in very spacious with a lot of tables so good for big groups and it has a nice atmosphere.

Meals come with chips, salsa, and a bean dip. Yum! Also, if you order an entree it comes with a cup of noodle soup which was pretty good. The portions here are HUGE so maybe consider ordering your dishes A la carte (which means without the sides of refried beans and rice). 

I ordered the carne asada tacos which were so good. The meat wasn't too salty (which is the case a lot of the time) and the tortillas were so fresh. This restaurant makes their tortialls in house and you can smell the freshly made tortillas instantly when you walk inside. 

Their menu has a lot of choices too so there are a lot of options to please almost everyone. It took me a good 10 mins to decide what I wanted to order. This place definitely satisfied my mexican food craving.
