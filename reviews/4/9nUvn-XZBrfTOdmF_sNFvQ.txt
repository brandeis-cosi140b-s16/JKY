Being Korean and loving Mexican food... I of course had to try this place.  Also the great Yelp reviews helped.

I wasn't disappointed.  Wow!  This is one of those places where you wish they had a location near your home.  Unfortunately, it's only in Vegas.    

So if you're in Vegas you have to make a trip to try this mom and pop shop with the yummiest pul go gi burrito.  Awesome..  yummmy spicy  korean pork nachos... that's right you heard me... spicy korean nachos.  I know.. I originally though.. uh-huh cheese and korean pork... doesn't go together..  WRONG!  it's ono licious!  lick your fingers. yummy!

It's not the easiest place to find if you're going by strict GPS directions.. once you get really close 500 feet.. you have to use your eyes to find the place.

The only mild negative is that, BECAUSE it's made to order... you have to wait.  We waited 20 minutes, but it was worth it.    The food is hot and fresh, like mom or grandma would have made in their kitchen.

If you like spicy and sweet... with some teriyaki style flavors... this is the place for you!
