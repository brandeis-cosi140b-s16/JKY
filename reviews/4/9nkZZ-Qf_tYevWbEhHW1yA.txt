From the chips and salsa to the end of the meal it was delicious and satisfying. Freddie our waiter was tip notch and very friendly and helpful. It was just by pure chance we stopped to eat there but definitely will be a frequent spot from now on. I recommend it highly. Plus they swipe your card right at the table when your ready to pay. It was awesome
