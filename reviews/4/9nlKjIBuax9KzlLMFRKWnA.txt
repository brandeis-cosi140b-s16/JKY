This place is great. I feel bad because it does not seem to get a lot of business. Hopefully it stays open. Place is fairly priced, and has great food. Really a gem if you live in the neighborhood as I have found it hard to find a quality, affordable sit-down mexican restaurant with a bar in east vegas. Only downside is bathrooms, but they aren't horrid. Just extremely small.
