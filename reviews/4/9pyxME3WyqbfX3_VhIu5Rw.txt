I have never heard of "Chipotle" before but my husband wanted to try it while on vacation in Las Vegas... It was surprisingly delicious! I got the chicken bowl with white lime cilantro rice, corn, and salsa. I didn't get a whole lotta "extras" but it was so refreshing. Maybe because we were in buffet gluttony and this was "light" compared to what I was shoving down my esophagus for the first 4 days of vacay. Oh, and it was cheap! Nice! They should open one in Hawaii :)
