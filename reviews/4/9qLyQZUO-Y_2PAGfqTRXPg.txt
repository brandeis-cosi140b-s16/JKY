Drinks were great.  My friend and I sat out back on the patio which was really nice.  The first time I had sat inside and it was really noisy due to the small space.  It does always seem to be busy there, but we've always gotten a seat.

I've had:

chips and salsa, which are delicious.  Their salsa is really good.  Tastes like the salsa I always loved when I lived in California.
papas con coliflor - i'd definitely order this again.  
puerco- this came out as one piece of pork belly, and it was really fatty, which I get, but it was hard to eat.  I think it would taste better if they cubed it.  

sangria was really tasty.  I also had the angelita. It was ok, but I wasn't into the flavor pairing.
