Been back a few times since my last review and things are still solid here. The patio still appears like your sitting in an alley, so I prefer the indoor seating with the weird decorations. Finally have tried the chicken tinga $2 tacos and it is a good dose of white chicken in that famous crispy taco shell which never breaks apart when you bite down. Also, margarita's are 1/2 price (only house), but they could be stronger. The quesadilla was just $5 at HH and again, it was loaded with filling and had a nice crispness on the edges. They could give you a cup of guacamole, but you get a side of sour cream instead.
