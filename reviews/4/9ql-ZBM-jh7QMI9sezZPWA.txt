Good spot for a late night weekend dinner. We came at around 8pm. Cool vibe, lovely decor. I love that they have the same elot√© corn on the cob appetizer as Gallo Blanco, it is the thing that I crave most from their menu. Hubby was very pleased with his torta, which I believe was stuffed with barbacoa meat, and I had the ensalada de la casa, without the meat, because I am a vegetarian. No problems there. The only problem we had was the service - it was a bit lackluster. For a restaurant featured in Phoenix magazine I would have expected a bit more, but it won't stop me from coming back.
