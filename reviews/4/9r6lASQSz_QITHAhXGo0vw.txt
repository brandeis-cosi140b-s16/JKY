Still a fave place in Madison for authenticity. the salsa bar is awesome- (disregard the review that says the salsas all taste the same, as that is just not true. the avocado one is fantastic, as is the chipotle and the salsa verde.)
Always check out the weekend specials. the posole I had was filled with big chucks of pork and hominy and was deeeelish. One Sunday I had the green chile stew/soup which made me happy for days. I can almost look forward to winter and getting this again.
The fajitas are regularly excellent, with lots of stuff piled on the cast-iron skillet brought to the table.

They REALLY need to start making the lime margaritas with real lime juice and sugar. A mix just does not taste good.
The strawberry one I had was pretty good, maybe made with frozen berries blended.

Viva Mexico!!
