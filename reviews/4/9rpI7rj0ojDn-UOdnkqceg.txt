Had a coupon for a free appetizer from our  lodging, so thought we would give it a try.  I had to ask our server Stephanie her name (not giving their name is a particular pet peeve of mine,) but she quickly warmed up and gave us individual attention.  She recommended the renowned margaritas, and my wife tried the Paradise Rita and I tried the Chambord Rita.  Both were delicious and refreshing and $1 off due to happy hour.  We had also noticed that wine bottles were half price on Tuesday nights on the way in, and we sprung for the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc, and it was crisp and fruity in spite of being a screw top.  For our free appetizer, we got the table side guac, and Stephanie mixed it up at the table, but I noticed she did not use all of the pre-measured salt and pepper and it could have used it.  Still not table side guac up to our expectations.  My wife ordered the habanero chicken pasta, and it was good but the sun-dried tomatoes and the pasta were too dry.  I tried the Jack's 5 Cheese macaroni topped with achiote chicken, which was also dry.  The macaroni had bleu, jack, cheddar, Romano, and Parmesan cheeses with bacon, and had a good taste overall but just needed some moistening up.  Served with a skillet of cornbread and honey butter.  As Stephanie was packing up the leftovers for us, two slices of cornbread baptized the table next door, and she brought us a whole cornbread in its place (packed safely we assume in the kitchen!). Overall a great dining experience and we would visit again!
