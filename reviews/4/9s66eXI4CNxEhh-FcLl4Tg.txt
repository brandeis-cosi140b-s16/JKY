This place definitely exceeded my expectations. My boyfriend and I have been waiting for a good, not too expensive Spanish restaurant and here came La Palapa. First off we ordered chicken nachos, proved to be phenomenal. Fresh/homemade nachos, pulled chicken, guacamole, and all other things delicious. Surprised us we just expected regular ol nachos. Then we both ordered from the churrasco section and were blow away. I got tbone with rice and sweet potato fries. The tbone was seasoned pretty darn good and cooked to order and I never knew sweet potato fries could be so amazing from a Mexican place. The chicken seasoning made my boyfriend surrender to deliciousness, he put his fork down and said "im done. This is too good". Ended it all with a nice coffee. Not one complaint! Except they didn't give us Ice with the water which i thought was weird, but I'm sure they would have gave me some if I asked. Also BYOB nice touch always. The owner and staff were also a pleasant part of the whole thing, so friendly and personable. Will be going back.... Quite often.
