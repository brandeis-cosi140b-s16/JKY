Let me start by saying I am not a seafood fan. I know! For shame! I am a native Arizonan, so give me a break here. The oysters looked so delicious that I decided to face my fears and try one. I am SO GLAD I did. The age old Mexican symphony of hot sauce, lime juice and avocado makes these ugly little mollusks sing! TRY THEM. I even ate some fried Octopus...several pieces. Who am I??? It was delicious! My mom and I are Michelada connoisseurs, so I has high expectations. They were delicious (and nutritious?). I had the Tostada with shrimp ceviche, piled high with shrimp & avocado. My mom had the beef albondigas soup. It was delicious, but I like rice in my albondigas, to be honest. The meatballs can't be all alone in their last moments! We rolled ourselves out of there impressed and stuffed. I will definitely come back. And to anyone on here complaining about lack of English skills...I just can't roll my eyes hard enough at you. It's a Mexican restaurant in a historically Mexican neighborhood in a state that used to be...you guessed it... MEXICO.
