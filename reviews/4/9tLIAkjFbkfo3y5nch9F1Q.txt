Cabo Fish Taco never dissappoints!

Several of my coworkers are in LOVE with Cabo Fish Taco, so I go there every 6-8 weeks for work-related lunches. The service is usually very prompt and there is typically no problem getting a table during the lunch rush. 

I love the salsa, and have tried virtually everything on the menu and have never had a bad meal!

I've also been to Cabo for brunch and dinner. Our brunch experiences have been delightful and, if memory serves me correctly, I had a stellar bloody mary the last time I went there for lunch.

My only beef with Cabo Fish Taco is that they don't take reservations for dinner (or at least they didn't the few times I've called), I sincerely hope they'll reconsider because I would love to add the restaurant to our repertoire of locations to go for birthday celebrations and/or to bring out of town guests but I don't like to wait in line for 45+ minutes for a table. 

Cabo Fish Taco serves top notch food, and provides excellent service. I'll continue to eat there regularly and, if I find out they've started accepting reservations, I'll up my rating to five stars!!!
