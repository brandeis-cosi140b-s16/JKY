This location gets so jammed packed that its like chaos during the lunch rush.  I have always had great tacos here, especially the chicken is always hot.  Has anyone else noticed that their seating is quite uncomfortable?  I just can't sit for too long, but I think that is all part of their plan, they don't want their patrons to stay for too long. 

One thing I need to add is Chipotle does NOT use dairy products in their meats, rice, tacos shells/tortillas/chips or salsas.  It is a fabulous place to eat if you have a pesky food allergy.
