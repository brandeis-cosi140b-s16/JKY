Sunday specials are awesome....chicken/mushroom fajitas, crab/shrimp relleno or charred steak tips w/ portobello mushrooms.  

The chicken/mushrooms had really good flavor.   The steak tips looked more like chopped steak'um sandwich meat than what I consider steak tips, but was still decent.  

Service is always amazingly fast.   Chips/salsa met me at the table!   Margarita was just 3 minutes behind!!  

Prices are ok...$60 for dinner + drinks for 2.  There's probably cheaper out there but there's something about this place I love.   

Attire is low key.  It's not upscale by any means but date night clothes or super casual Sunday afternoon shorts both work.  

Drinks are yummy.  Go straight to the Cadillac margarita & the red sangria is full of Apple chunks (a little small so they can clog up the straw...annoying!)

If you hate peppers or onions, be sure to ask to leave them out.   Even though they may not be in the entree description it's highly likely they're in there somewhere.
