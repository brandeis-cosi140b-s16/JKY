Chipotle may not be authentic Mexican, but it does set itself apart from other chains. The primary reason to go to Chipotle is the quality of the ingredients. Niman Ranch pork is ten times more juicy and delectable than the factory farmed version. It's also much more humanely raised and ecologically friendly. Chipotle braises the pork with pepper and other mild spices and the tender and flavorful result is what keeps me coming back all the time. 

There are lots of other options ranging from chicken to vegetarian, but in my opinion the pork is really the best. This location sometimes will give you a discount if you order just meat/cheese/rice and sometimes not...it's rather bizarre, but I think it depends on if the manager is around or not. I keep my receipts as a rather amusing record of how many times I have gotten the "Ilini secret special."

It's quite expensive as "fast food" goes and it gets crowded. I usually take mine to go, since every Chipotle I've visited has had a harried atmosphere that makes dining in unpleasant...but even if it upscale fast food, it's still fast food, so that's what I expect.
