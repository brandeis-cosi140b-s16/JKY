I really love the food here. It's pricey - so expect to spend a good dollar for your meal. I've been to this restaurant a few times to celebrate birthdays, and really enjoy the food and ambiance. 

Here are few foods I love:

Queso Fundido
Enchiladas
Chips and Salsa
Guacamole
Pork Belly Taco

I'll likely be back next time I come back to Sin City...
