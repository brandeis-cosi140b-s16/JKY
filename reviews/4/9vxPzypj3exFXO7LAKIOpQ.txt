Had lunch here the other day with a Groupon.  The staff as well as the chips and salsa were great.  The food was super.  The lunch deal included the entree as well as beans and rice and the portion was more than substantial.  The server (Carlos, I think) was super polite, very efficient and explained  what was contained in each item we ordered. A great Mexican place in this part of town.
