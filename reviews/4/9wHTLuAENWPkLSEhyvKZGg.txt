For lunch near Lakepointe, this is pretty quick, cheap & delicious.  I've never had to wait for a table, and the food is always brought out quickly.  Service is good and the food isn't bad either - but I'm not a Mexican food critic either, I stick to the Speedy Gonzales special (enchilada, taco & rice).  Great option if you're tired of waiting in line at Salsaritas and want to enjoy a sit down lunch.
