My son and I ate here the last time we were out in the Phoenix area. I always make it a point to eat at Filibertos every time I am in Arizona since all we have is bland Tex-Mex in Texas. As with the other two locations I've been to, the food quality was very good and the service was quick. I guess the only bad thing I can say is the person who sat behind us was a really loud gangbanger wannabe who was telling the person she was with about all the gangs she ran with in El Paso. Guess that really isn't the restaurant's fault though.
