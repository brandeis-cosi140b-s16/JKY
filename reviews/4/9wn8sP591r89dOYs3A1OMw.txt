Fresh and delicious!!!  If I could, I'd give this place 4.5 stars.  This is a small, cozy joint with a simple menu that is clearly done well.  The place is filled with small tables that could probably hold about 20 people.

On to the food.  Everything tasted excitingly fresh.  That was the overall pleasing feeling that I had.  The horchata is the best that I've ever tasted.  If I had thought quick like my coworker, I would have asked for little or no ice in my drink to enjoy even more of it.  As for the meal, I ordered the carne asada combination platter with a side of guacamole.  The carne asada tacos were quite tasty.  The charro beans were light and flavorful, but the star of the show was the rice.  It was full flavored and refreshing.  I definitely could have eaten more of that.  One of my lunch buddies ordered the combo and an extra taco to try one of each of the meats (carne asada, barbacoa, and chicken).  He claimed that all were good, but that the standout was the barbacoa, which he described as "juicy."  The guacamole was good, too.  I think that those of us who ordered just the combination platter wanted a little more meat on our plate, but we all walked away full.

My plan is to go back and try the burrito with barbacoa and another glass of horchata.
