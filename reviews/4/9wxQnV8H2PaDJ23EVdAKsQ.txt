Friends wanted to eat here before a dbacks game...nwent inside the restaurant and it was poppin in the waiting room... It was a 45 minute wait for a table for four... Friend reassured us that it was worth it so we decided to wait... 
It was kinda cool waiting for a table because of how many people were going in and out of the restaurant and they seem to have a system all set up.. There were parties of 2, 4, 7 12 and even 14... There were a few parties that was more than 10 people....
Definitely a family friendly place!

Looked at the menu and the prices were reasonable... About 8-15 dollars a plate depending on what you order
Service was fast and friendly! 
We got the our drinks and chips and salsa (free) real quickly! The salsa was pretty spicy for me but still good!

I ordered taquitos de carne asada.. It was delicious I posted a pic.. The rice and beans were so good.. The rice has a little bit of crispyness to it.. And the meat was juicy...pico de gallo was also fresh and delicious!

Only down side is how greasy the tacos were but what Mexican food isn't greasy right? 

I can't wait to come back and try more and maybe take a huge party with me too!

Love the family atmostphere :)
