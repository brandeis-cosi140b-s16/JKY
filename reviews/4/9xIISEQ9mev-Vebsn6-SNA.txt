Real solid mexican food waaay down South Blvd.  The decor is busy and festive and so are the staff.  I've been down to Mexico for lunch a few times and always left happy and satisfied.

I like the combo dishes, anything that involves a chile relleno and enchiladas or flautas.

Apart from doing all the basic entrees right, this place have excellent tortilla chips and salsa, and there's plenty of it.

Come here with your friends and have a good time.
