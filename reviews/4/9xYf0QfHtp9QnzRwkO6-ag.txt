I usually go to Francisco's during my late night food binges. I have to say I really love their steak sopes! The sopes come topped with tomato, lettuce, sour cream, and cheese. They are like little boats of fried goodness topped with juicy, tender meat and toppings. Make sure to ask for their spicy homemade salsa that they have in squirt bottles. It has a real nice kick to it. Everything else on the menu is pretty decent. My favorites are mostly the ala carte items: tostadas, tacos, and sopes. I don't really care for the rice and beans that most of the entrees come with. If you do stop in for a weekend late night snack, then be ready to expect a busy restaurant!
