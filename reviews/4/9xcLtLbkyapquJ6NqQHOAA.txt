Mexican fast food... being from New York and then Miami this was pretty new to me (outside of taco bell, which brings great shame to the term "mexican" or "border"). So at about 2 a.m. with some large amounts of alcohol in my system, I decided to try it. The tacos were pretty good, especially at that point in the evening. Food was fast as the name would suggest, and cant beat it for a late night meal.
