Don Pedro is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Charlotte. My family and I have been there several times and we are rarely disappointed. The chips, salsa and pico de gallo are good. I love getting the fresh guacamole that they prepare at the table in front of you. We went there on a Sunday night once and they were out of avocados. I was devastated, to say the least.

My favorite meal is the chicken chalupa and chicken enchilada combination. Their combinations are the way to go in my opinion. My sister always gets the steak and chicken fajitas. The margaritas are good too and are always on point.

I took off one star because the service can be hit or miss. One time we had several different servers check on us and we asked each of them for another silverware and napkin set because my dad didn't get one. Each of them said yes but never came back. My dad finally had to ask the manager when he came with the food and then he finally got it. 

Another time we went and had the opposite issue - the waitress literally checked on us every MINUTE. I wish I was exaggerating.  We could barely have a conversation without her showing up and asking us if we needed something. It was beyond irritating and we all left seriously annoyed! Another time my parents went without me and they served my dad a beer in a HOT mug. He complained and they immediately brought a new one, but seriously? HOT BEER? LOL

So all in all - great food, but needs to work on service issues.
