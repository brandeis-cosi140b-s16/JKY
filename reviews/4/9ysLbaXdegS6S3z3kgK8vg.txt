Filiberto's is a local favorite for late-night Mexican food. The quality of food has always been decent and worth the wait-time. This location takes exceptionally long, but it's a good sign that your food is fresh. 

Items to get: Bacon Breakfast Burritos, Carne Asada Fries and anything with Guacamole. Their salsa is also decent and has some kick to it.
