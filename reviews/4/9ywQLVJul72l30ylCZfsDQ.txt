I like Backyard Tacos! The food is yummy and a good price. I really love sitting outside under the cute lights. 

My one issue with this place is the set up of the salsa bar! There is constantly a group of people around it because it's just not set up for more than 1 person at a time. 

Other than that I think it's a fun and casual place to eat!
