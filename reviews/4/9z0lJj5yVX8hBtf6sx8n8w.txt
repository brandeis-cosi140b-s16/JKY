I've been here 4-5 times since I yelped them.  I've got 3-4 people from my office going here once a week now.  When I reviewed them I gave them a "You've been Yelped" card.  

I was back recently and mentioned yelp.  I've shaved off my beard since I yelped them.  

So the guy at the counter was like, "Yelp?  Oh yeah this dude rolled in here like a month ago and he was like "I reviewed you guys" and I was like "cool!" and he was like can I take a few pictures for the website and I was like yeah whatever man 'cause I didn't even know he was coming in for the review, you know, but I think it's been good for business 'cause we're pretty busy now, man."

Cool.
