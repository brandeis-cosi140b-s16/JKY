It's been quite some time since I've been here given the fact I no longer live down the street from this joint.  I've been coming here even before it was Vaqueros so I know they've been doing something right to stick around this long.  The old days of Vaqueros featured cheaper eats with monster size portions.  So when pulling up and seeing that the prices have gone up a bit I was disappointed only to wonder if their portion size went in the opposite direction like most Mexican fast food joints (I.E filibertos).  I ordered the usual of Super Nachos and a California Burro.  I brought it home to my dad and daughter.  I opened the bag up and what do you know, a big monster burro sat there along with a tray of Super Nachos packed to the top! I was once again reminded why I come here when in need for a good Mexican fix! Yes, the prices have gone up but what hasn't these days.  I will say this, if you are the owner of this joint I highly recommend doing some remodeling of the property.  This place looks even worse than before and I can see many potential customers deciding not to pull in based on looks.  Clean this place up and your business will thrive even more. Otherwise, eat up people! It's worth the price of admission! 5 stars for food, -1 for appearance.
