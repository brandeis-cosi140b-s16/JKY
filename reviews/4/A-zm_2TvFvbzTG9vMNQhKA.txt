Tried The Stand twice now in a week, and very happy we tried it. It's my boss' new favorite lunch spot. 

I first tried The Standard (burger) with caramelized onions. It was good, but nothing special for me. However, i later tried the tacos and that will now be my go-to. The chicken tacos were delicious, but the braised short-rib tacos blew me away! So juicy and flavorful.

But the stars of the show are the shakes. Shakes for days! The Banana Stand... Chocolate Chili... Salted Dulce de Freakin' Leche! No lie... I double fisted the first two today. I feel like a disgusting human being... But I can't wipe this smug, satisfied smile off my face. Time for a nap.
