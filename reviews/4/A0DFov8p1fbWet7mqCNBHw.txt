They have specials listed on the front of the restaurant, but ask the bartenders as well.  Each bartender charged differently for their drinks.  I had some of their pre-mixed lime margaritas on ice.  I'm not usually a margarita on ice person, but they were pretty tasty.  HUGE free basket of nachos and salsa as soon as we sat at the bar. 

I saw large groups, parties, kids, the whole spectrum.
