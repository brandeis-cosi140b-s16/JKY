I've eaten here about 10 times already so I think it's safe to say that I love Zaba's. I've ordered both Bowls and Burritos. My usual order is Cilantro Lime Rice, Sweet Potato, either Carnitas or Beef, Medium Salsa, Sour Cream & Cheese. I also order a Side of Chips, which has a hint of salt & lime, for 99cents! Can't go wrong with that.

If you come as often as I do, it could come off a little pricey but I love the food and it's worth trying once, especially if you enjoy Mexican food. I think of it as a healthier version of Chipotle.
