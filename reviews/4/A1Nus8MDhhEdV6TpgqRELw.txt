Above average airport food. I ordered the chicken tacos with chips & guacamole. The tacos were flavorful and fresh (cilantro is a bonus) and the guacamole was good. A very refreshing option from the rest of the other gross fast-food chains. Another bonus, the staff were quick & friendly, not grumpy at all! I also agree with other reviewers that this is also a much healthier option than other places in the airport.
