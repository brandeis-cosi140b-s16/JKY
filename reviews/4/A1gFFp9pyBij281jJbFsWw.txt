Yummy!!!!!!!

I love this place, the food is awesome (especially at happy hour) the service is friendly and inviting and the atmosphere in the bar is excellent.

Just for the record I always went on happy hour, a few beers washing down the free tortilla chips and dips followed by one of their delicious appitizers.

I WILL BE BACK!!
