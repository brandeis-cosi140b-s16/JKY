This place is exactly what the name suggests. Tiny menu - fish tacos only - but they're yummy!

Pros: Nice salsa and topping selection, the staff were upbeat and helpful, the restaurant was clean and well maintained (it's brand new).

Cons: I would have liked more fresh salsa options, but they do what they do well.

Would definitely go back next time I'm over there at Costco or shopping for furniture!
