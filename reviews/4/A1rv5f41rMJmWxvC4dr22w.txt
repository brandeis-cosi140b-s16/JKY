Bea's Taco Town is a local version of Chipotle or Qdoba.  I think the food is a step above either chain, but it's not the best Mexican food either.

First, I ordered a Chorizo burrito ($8.56 with tax).  The burrito was good, and it traveled from work to school quite well.  I found the burrito to be a bit bland, personally.  There wasn't enough mixed in to get different textures and flavors in every bite.  It was still good, hence a four star rating, but it didn't quite blow my mind.  It could have used some of the spicy green salsa from Chicken Latino in the Strip.

The food options downtown are really lacking, and this is a good and quick lunch option.
