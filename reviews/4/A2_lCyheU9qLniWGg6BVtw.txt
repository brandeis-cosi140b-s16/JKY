Went to Mexico just a few days back before visiting this gem. While in Mexico was eager to try there tortas. I was able to try a torta ahogada and was disappointed with the overall taste and quality. Don't know if it was just the restaurant we decided to choose upon but it wasn't good. Fast forward a day back and was willing to try another torta place. And boy did this restaurant deliver! The tortas were just what I expected and had enough amount of meat as they pile loads of it on. The gf had the king torta while I had the queen. Though ironic both tortas  had both of us feeling full. Five stars would of been great but the waitress paid no regard to us only refilling our drinks twice. Overall food was good and not to mention the drinks were stellar (gf had the strawberry margarita and I freshly made mango juice) Will definitely try this restaurant again.
