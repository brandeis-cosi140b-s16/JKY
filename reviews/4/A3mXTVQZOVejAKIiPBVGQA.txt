Loved the food, but I could tell they just opened.  (The bar was a tad bit dirty, but promptly cleaned when brought to the bartender's attention) I enjoyed the salad, grilled chicken, fish and fresh cabbage.  The drink menu was bland, but there were plenty of  options as far as drinks went..  The food was extremely fast, so if you like to take your time-order bit ,by bit!  However, you do not get the "fast-food" feeling.  I look forward to more meals at my local Wahoo's.
