My roommate and I went here for our monthly roomie dinner, because I drive past it everyday for work.  

This is probably our favorite place we have gone to thus far, this year!  The food was fantastic! Our server was PHENOMENAL! I do not even like tequila, and he recommended something to try and I  even liked it! 

Being able to order tacos a la carte is such a great way to try all the different ones! Pork belly is my favorite! 

The atmosphere is really cool vibe as well!

Get a bunch of friends together and check it out!
