My mom and I stopped here after reading the yelp reviews while prowling for a good spot to eat.  We were pleasantly surprised and happy to find that they were open Sunday evening, since it seemed to be a smaller restaurant.
The customer service was fantastic.  My mom and I split an order of 5 rolled tacos and a carnitas plate, which was more than enough for 2 people.  Both dishes were fantastic, and we were both pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food.  We spent about $17 with drinks, but it was well worth it; we'll definitely be back!
