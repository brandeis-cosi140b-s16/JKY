I go to this Rubio's every week or so. For fast food fish tacos and burritos it's really good. The service at this store is good, the food always fresh and cooked to order.

Tonight I got an enchilada style blackened mahi burrito with the slightly spicy red sauce. For lower carbs, I order it with no rice, and they'll add a bit more fire-roasted corn instead. And black beans on the side instead of chips. Yum!
