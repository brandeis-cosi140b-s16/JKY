Took my daughter out to dinner Monday night because I didn't feel like cooking, I'm sure we all have had nights like that. I told her I wanted to check out the new Garcia's that is our area, she said ok, so off we went!

The restaurant from the outside does not look roomy, but once you are in you see that's not true.

I saw on the board their daily special was called an Ajo Grill, so I started to wonder what that was, but took the menu that was handed to me and checked out what other options I had.

Now my daughter, she knew right off the bat what she wanted, cheese enchiladas beans & rice, so when our server came to our table I asked him what the Ajo Grill was, he told me it was Steak or Chicken cut up with peppers and onions cut up on top of a bed of rice served on a skittle grill that came with pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream & tortillas, omg yes that's what I want to order!!

Dinner came, and it was beautifully colored, the red & green bell peppers or orange of the rice, it was very eye pleasing, and it tasted great! I made me some soft tacos with my tortillas and was only able to eat about half of it, but don't worry, it made for a great burrito at home!

My daughter, who turned 21 in June, but was prego and unable to drink, ordered her 1st strawberry margarita, and I giggled when she got carded!

We both wanted dessert, I had been craving Fried Ice Cream, and boy oh boy did their fried ice cream hit the spot! It was covered in chocolate & honey, and who would have thought those were good combos, but omg they were!

We did enjoy our meal; had great service and I do see us coming back!
