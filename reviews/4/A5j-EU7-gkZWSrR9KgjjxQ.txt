Good.  Cheap.  Tasty.   24/7.  Drive through.   That sums this place up.  

Highlights: 

Their Carnitas platter comes in a styrofoam plate with beans, rice, and two giant tortillas, weighs quite literally 2 lbs, and is enough to put two people to sleep for a little more than 7 dollars.  Now that's bang for your buck.  

Taquitos plate - at 4.50 - also good.  Burritos of all sorts but stay away from the fish.  Carnitas is probably the best.  Asada is a little gristly but good.  Barbacoa not bad.  Breakfast is quite tasty too.  Asada Fries will put you down for the count. 

But you're not paying for a glamorous atmosphere - or heat on a cold day, so don't expect it. 

I'd recommend it for a late nights, when you're really hungry
