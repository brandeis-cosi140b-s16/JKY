After watching the show about the next great restaurant or whatever it was called I really have a bad taste in my mouth for the dude that started this company but damnit if he doesn't offer a darn good product.

I really only like the carnitas here.  Steak seems to be hit and miss and I've never been a chicken fan.  

Green salsa is the best.  Pinto beans all the way.  Rice with a hint of lemon and cilantro is so darn good.  

Try their quesadillas - so yummy.

This location has the friendliest people.
