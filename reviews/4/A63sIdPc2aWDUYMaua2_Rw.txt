Tried out this place because I had a Groupon deal. Food was pretty good, prices were great, and service was excellent! My only complaint would be that the strawberry margarita, which I paid an extra $3 for (upgraded from the on-the-rocks lime margarita that came with the Groupon), was the most bland, watery margarita I've ever had. When I ordered it, the server warned me that the regular margarita was better. I should've listened to him, because boy was he right! I tried the regular margarita as well, and it was good. For some reason, the strawberry one tasted like ice with a hint of bland strawberry flavor. Couldn't taste any tequila at all! But the food was decent (great for the price). I ordered the cheese enchiladas, which is probably my favorite food of all time. They were good. For the price, I'd come back to order them again.
