Dinner for Lunch today:  Chips, Salsa, Sweet Plantains with Cheese (what Plantains with cheese, where have I been).  I have never left this continent, though I have had Plantains in Louisiana in a Haitian Dish and many South American Restaurants and a few Spanish Restaurants and I have never had Plantains with cheese.  Before I scraped the cheese off I snapped a photo and tasted one, ummmm, OK I'll leave the cheese on!

Steak with Chimichurri Sauce and Garlic Sauce, Sausage, Potatoes, Peppers, Spinach and Rice.  I'm not a big fan of any of this food, though all of it was better than Three yelp stars and the service was perfect.  I would eat here again, ONLY because there are too many places I like better, I'll stick with the places I like more!
