I think authentic pretty well sums it up. This spot has excellent basic Mexican staples, is affordable, and probably rocks it out for best Mexican in Madison. Very different atmosphere from La Mestiza, which is typically quiet and more private. This place is bustling and loud; great for groups. The tacos were delicious, served on double corn tortillas (good move). Chips and salsa were so-so (Mestiza much better). Odd thing: soft drinks served in individual cans, not as fountain beverage (not a huge fan). But overall, where it counts-- for an entree, this place was the bomb.
