Would certainly go back!!

We tried:
Pork Tamales
Chicken Enchiladas with Green Sauce
Sopes with Carne Asada

I placed them in order of our preference.  The menu is huge, so we definitely still have much to try.

We went on a Monday early evening and we still had to wait for a table. This place does get packed. As we waited we asked those around us if they had been here before and all of them said yes and raved about it.

During our meal, Leticia walked the floor checking how everyone was doing. That was a nice touch.  All servers were attentive and prompt.
