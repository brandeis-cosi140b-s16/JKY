Second time here wife and I brought another couple this time. I had the Arizona burger again loved I so much last time had to have it again. Wife had chicken fajitas again she really like them last time we shared another Half pitcher of margaritas which is 2 1/2 glasses of marg for only $6. Other couple both had chicken tacos they both liked them. The only issue any one had was the beans were salty and rice was also. The other couple had a bottle beer and a half pitcher of pi√±a colada all for $27. My wife and I spent $22. Also the bar is pretty much a full bar but with selection limitations so like they might have well vodka but not hammer an sickle vodka.
