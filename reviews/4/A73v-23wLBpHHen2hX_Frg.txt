This particular Roberto's is like a beacon of light among a sea of ticky-tacky track homes.  It's conveniently tucked away in at the corner of Cactus and Bermuda.  Since it sits in a low traffic area, it's never super busy like others. 

It has a drive thru located at the end of a mini strip mall.  I love Roberto's food and they are always generous with their portions.  My favorites are the unbelieveably savory rolled beef tacos (always with Guacamole and cheese), fish tacos, carne asada chimichangas, carnitas nachos and even chips with guacamole and cheese.  The drive thru is open 24 hours, so it's probably the best and cheapest after-gambling or clubbing food around!

As a frequent visitor to Vegas, sometimes you start to hate/dread the strip and just want something cheap (why not?) simple and fast ...you get all this and so much more!!!

PS... OK, I'll share a funny story regarding the rolled tacos... I ordered them through the drive thru and was so hungry, I couldn't wait to get home and started eating them in the car.  I had no idea I was dripping sauce, guacamole and cheese on myself.  Before I got home, I had to stop off at a drugstore to pick up a few things.  I distinctly remember the guy at the checkout having a funny look on his face and never really making eye contact with me.  I just brushed it off and hurried back in the car when I saw my reflection on the store glass - my shirt looked like an art canvas of green, orange and red!! I can't imagine what the checker thought... maybe one too many martinis... Geez...at that point I just laughed and cleaned myself up!
