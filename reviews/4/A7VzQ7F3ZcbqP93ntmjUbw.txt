I finally gave this place a chance. I been a few times and never stayed and ordered. FInally, gave it a chance when I saw they have a 4 Taco and a Drink special for $7 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Granted its a little pricey but very well worth it. Its very clean inside and the menu pops right in front of you. Big bold yellow board lol. They have the typical menu you see in most places like Roberto's, Fausto's.....etc. They have the radish, carrots and salsa right by the register which makes it nice after you order. Decided on the Taco Special, 4 tacos and a drink and a side of refried beans. You get to choose your meat. Had one order with Carne Asada and another order with Chicken. They topped the tacos with Onion, Cilantro and salsa. Very liberal on the Cilantro onion. Which is a good thing. They were fast and wrapped my to go order. I got home and we ate. Awesome flavor and no fat on the meat. The onions and cilantro popped like flavor crystals in your mouth. The salsa was pretty good. Not spicy as I would of liked, but decent. This is the way street tacos should of looked and tasted unlike Tacos El Gordo. That place was garbage and I'll never go there again lol. The beans were very good. Not over salty and had a great homemade taste to them. Almost like my moms. I hope the beans stay consistent because I plan to order those again and hope this wasn't a fluke lol. All in all, very good and I can see why this place is always packed. Until next time, Let's eat!!!
