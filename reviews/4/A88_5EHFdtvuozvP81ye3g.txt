Picking up a few things around the corner at CVS, Bear and I were trying to figure out what to have for dinner.  He found Fatburger across the way, but neither one of us was in the mood for THAT. What he wanted was good Mexican food, which sounded alright to me.  That's when I remembered that a co-worker of mine, who's also a local, RAVED about Roberto's.  We'd already seen a few of them around, but hadn't yet taken the plunge, so it was settled.

NOW I get the raves.  Quality-wise, this is DA MUY BUENO BOMB-DIGGETY. Bear had the chicken burrito - which was HUGE - while I settled on the chicken chimichanga, which was REDONKULOUS. Paired with a beef quesadilla, it looked (and felt like) enough to feed an army...and at a reasonable price! Yet unlike your typical fast Mexican food, say, that place with the bell and the chihuahua? THIS was good stuff, yet not at all heavy or greasy.  It took some time to finish so we didn't have leftovers, (which we couldn't have taken with us, anyway), but I didn't feel like I needed the entire defensive line of the Atlanta Falcons to help roll my ass outta there when we were done.

The place was pretty clean and the service surprisingly fast for a place run by just two guys behind the counter.  As a local myself now, I sure am glad there's a bazillion Roberto's around town, so we can find one whenever we need one!
