Definitely a different experience than most places you go to, but the food is very much like Tijuana street food.  When you go there, there are separate prep stations for each type of meat that they serve.  I'm still not clear if you can order from any of the prep stations, or if you have to go to the one in particular that you want.  I accidentially ordered brains, which was gross, but the other tacos I tried were really good.  If you want something more familiar, just go to Los Tacos.  It is literally across the parking lot.
