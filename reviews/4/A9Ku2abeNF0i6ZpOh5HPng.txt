I like the food. But Viva Mercados gets 4 stars because they have a vegetarian menu. They also tell you in the menu how they make their soup, rice and their beans. No guess work, no awkward questions, just answers. Now on to the food. I think I've eaten at more Mexican places since coming to Vegas than I did the 26 years I lived somewhere else. There are only a few that I would even consider recommending to someone who likes good Mexican food. This is one of them. In the 4 months we lived in the area, I've been at least 5 times. I am always impressed. The service is great, very prompt and friendly. The food always tastes fresh, and the chips and salsa are pretty much irresistible. I've ordered off the of the veg menu all but one time, and have been very pleased. My favorite is the peasant tacos. They are really a taste explosion.  From what my friends and family have said, the meat dishes are also quite good and very fresh. I've also had their sopapilla's which are quite tasty, but because the food portion sizes are so big, you really have to plan ahead for desert.
Definitely some of the best Mexican I've had in Vegas. It may be a bit pricier than other places, but totally worth it.
