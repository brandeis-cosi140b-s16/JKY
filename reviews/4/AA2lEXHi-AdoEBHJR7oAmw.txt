Another Yelp gem... Sonora Mesquite Grill is a place you'd easily drive right by dozens of times and never notice. Inside, it's a cute, clean little restaurant. The guy working there was super friendly and helpful. 

We shared the guacamole, very good. It wasn't the think and creamy type, but the flavor was great! 

I ordered the platter, which came with two barbacoa tacos, rice, and beans. The rice was delicious and perfectly seasoned. The beans were excellent, some of the best I've had in a while. The barbacoa was pure smoky deliciousness. The tacos were topped with cilantro and red onions. I cleaned my plate. 

My boyfriend got the carne asada burrito. It was a perfect size, generous, but not so big it was difficult to manage. The beef, tortilla, and other fillings were all very good. 

My horchata was a little too strong for me (I guess I like it to be more watery), but was still nice to have to drink after some spicy salsa. 

Definitely would recommend this place if you're looking for tasty, authentic Mexican food.
