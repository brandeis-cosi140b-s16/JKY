I had the fajitas.  I combined the shrimp and steak.  The steak was very good, but I didn't care for the sauce on the shrimp.  My wife had 3 tacos (fish, steak and shrimp.  She also thought the sauce on the shrimp was not right.  She liked the other tacos.  When you arrive, they give you chips and salsa.  The red salsa was our favorite.  Our Daughter had the cheese quesadilla.  This restaurant has a bunch of Tequila (hence the name TQLA).  I have come here at least a dozen times.  It is good, more expensive Mexican food.
