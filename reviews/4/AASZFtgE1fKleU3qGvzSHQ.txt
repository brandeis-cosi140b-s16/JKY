Grilled onions!
This looks like a familia owned Carne asada joint.  A place you would normally drive by & miss.  It's worth to make that turn into the shopping center & stop for the Carne asada.

They have many dish options, legit authentic mexican dishes.  I finally settled for  the Carne asada plate after looking at the menu for a good 5 minutes.  Everything looked good.  
Two people can easily eat out of one plate.  The Carne asada was very good & tasty.  Had that char taste as if you just barbqued it outside.  I felt like I was eating at my madres house.  My niece swears by the caramel grilled onions in the salsa bar.  She gives this place 5 stars just for the onions. This place is legit.  

We do Plan on coming back to try the other menu items. I keep reading about the el pastor from other Yelp reviewers.  This one is a keeper when you cant light up the BBQ.  Oh beans are legit too.
