The food is solid and the people are generally quite friendly. It's like a local (Las Vegas-based) version of Chipotle, but with seafood options. I generally go in when I have complete disregard for my cholesterol and order up 3 shrimp tacos loaded with rice, potato, sour cream, chipotle ranch, and cheese. Try 'em up that way and you'll be in what Guy Fieri calls "Flavortown".

Just kidding. You'll still be in Henderson. But the tacos are delicious.
