Based on my husband's meal and mine - 5 stars.  The other two in the car said 4.  So I wish 4.5 stars was a choice...
Tostada, bean burrito, fish taco, and 3 meat combo platter all excellent.  The beans were a little runny which I like but 2 people thought was strange.  Came here because of D3 (diners, dine ins and dives) and glad we did!  Be prepared to wait a moment to order, and another for the meal to be ready.  And do everyone a favor and wait to order before securing a table...otherwise you are just being annoying.
