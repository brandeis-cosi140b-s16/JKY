This is about a 3.5 star mexican place to me. I've always had good service but watched other folks get like 1-star service, at a level I might not come back.

I like the White Chimichanga here. The Chili Verde is decent, and the Hatch Chilis are nice too, if you haven't had those.

4 Stars - White Chimi
3 Stars - Chili Verde
3 Stars - Cheese crips with Hatch chilis

I'm sure there are better places around but I've been coming here for several years when in the area, and I definitely enjoy this place.

Sometimes they have hot chicks working up front. If you keep up this practice Arriba, I'll five-star you sometime soon!
