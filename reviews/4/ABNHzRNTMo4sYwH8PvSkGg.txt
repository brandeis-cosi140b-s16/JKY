I like Roberto's. This one (the closest one to my house) is one of the nicer ones in town. I tend to try different stuff when I visit. Tonight I was in a carne asada burrito mood. Got the special which came with rice, beans and a drink for $6.75. I always take advantage of their salsa and veggie bar as well. Great, quick service too.
Always a satisfied customer!
