Taco madness is a great deal, 3 street tacos and a margarita or beer for $12. Chips and salsa were good, three different heat levels. Fajitas smelled really good, if it's the same chicken as they use in one of the street tacos then they are probably amazing. Not the best Mexican food but the happy hour drink specials and street tacos are a good deal. Service was incredibly fast, staff was very attentive (hostess, waiter, busser).
