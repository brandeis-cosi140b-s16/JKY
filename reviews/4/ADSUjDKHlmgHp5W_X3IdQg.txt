How did I end up in Maricopa?  Rhetorical, unimportant question, but I kept asking myself anyway.  What was important was my hunger.  I spotted Penascos in a relatively new strip center on the main drag and even through my myopic, sunglass covered eyes going 40 MPH, clearly read their happy hour sign - $2 Coronas!  An hour later, we're sitting on their patio with said Coronas and fish tacos.  I will admit I'm not a fish taco expert like many Yelpers, so I'll defer to you all, but they tasted very very good to me.   Unbattered fish with a creamy vodka sauce and what I think are all the other regular condiments.  The beans and rice were so good.  Their House beans are very like homemade; left whole and filled with lots of good things.  The free chips and fresh, thick, spicy salsa were also excellent.  They were very attentive, keeping the necessities and chips/salsa coming.  I'll be back!
