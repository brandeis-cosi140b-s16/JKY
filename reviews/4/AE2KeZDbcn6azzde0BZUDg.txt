Came in craving taquitos. Low and behold my wish was granted with handmade chicken rolled tacos made quickly and happily by a young man working the front bar. Service was wonderful with him explaining the kind of chicken I would receive, that it was semi spicy, and even asked my preference of "crunchiness". Food was quick, cheap and delivered with a smile. Restaurant was clean and appeared upgraded recently. Only thing I didn't like was the extra dollar fifty charge for a small ramekin of guacamole.
