I love Zaba's and was so sad when the one in Henderson on Eastern closed. Luckily, I started working near this one a few days a week and I'm getting my Zaba's fix again! They have excellent options for burritos - my favorite are the regular and sweet potatoes! The burritos are always way bigger than the ones I get at Qdoba. 

If you get the Zaba's card each meal will get you closer to a free burrito. The service is decent here but the lines at lunch time on the weekdays are RIDICULOUS. Sometimes they're out the door. The employees do a great job of keeping things moving but, with that much volume, it's hard. I waste a lot of my lunch break just standing in line. 

The place looks small when you first walk in but there's extra seating in the back and some outdoor seating, which is great when the weather is nice. 

Zaba's far surpasses Qdoba and Chipotle in taste and options. Get here before the lunch rush and you won't be disappointed!
