Maybe I went here on a good night, but I had one of the best chile rellenos ever. It was perfectly cooked and extremely flavorful. My friend enjoyed his meal just as much as I did. We got a queso dip appetizer, could have been better, but the chips were nice and fresh as well. I would go back here any time!
