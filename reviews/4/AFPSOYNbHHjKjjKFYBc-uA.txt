DEAL ME IN

This place is a total find and is located on Fremont Street next to the Heart Attack Cafe. You can not miss it because they have a blinking red neon sign that says $2 Tacos. Enough said!!!

I needed a light snack before dinner after skipping lunch, so I decided to pop in here. They had a large selection of meats to choose from. I decided to go with a pork carnitas taco and a shredded beef taco. Both were really good and packed full of meat. The $2 price also included a choice of hot sauce and I went with the medium green salsa.  Cilantro and raw onions were included too. I skipped the cilantro but dived in on the raw onions. Luckily I had a tin of the Yelp shaped breath mints to freshen me up afterwards. 

The meats were really tasty. There is nothing like a slow roasted piece of meat in my book. I saw the grilled steak and grilled chicken but they looked a little dried out. This location has many of its meats precooked and sitting in warming trays. This is why I choose the two meats I did. The pork carnitas and shredded beef were sitting in their own natural juices and I knew they would be yummy at any time of the day. I was dead on. 

I decided to go with a medium salsa because I was taking a redeye flight back home and I wasn't looking forward to terror at 30,000 feet, so I played it safe. They had several salsas to choose from but I was happy with the medium salsa verde. It had the perfect amount of spicy without being too over powering. 

The location is in a food court without any  mall. There were two other restaurants in here. One serving pizza/pasta and the other serving Asian food. I did not try the other food at these two places but was offered some Asian chicken on a toothpick that I nicely turned down. 

So if your on Fremont Street looking for a light but filling snack then I highly recommend this place. The tacos were really good and I would come back here in a heartbeat for a good meal deal that won't break the bank.
