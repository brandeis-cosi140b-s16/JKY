I live close to La Mestiza on Madison's west side, but I'd rather go to El Pastor. It's quieter, the staff is friendlier, and the food is great.

I've had several things off the menu (all good) but my favorite, by far, is the whole fried tilapia. It is exactly as billed - a whole fish, lightly floured and fried to perfection. It's fiddly food, to be sure - you're picking around a carcass. But it is absolutely delicious and well worth the effort. The fish comes with your choice of rice and beans, or salad and fries. Both options come with tortillas on the side, so you can make your own fish tacos, if you like. 

The margaritas are great - and are 2-for-1 on Wednesday evenings. They also have a variety of Mexican soft drinks (including Mexican Coca-Cola, made with sugar). And beer, of course.

My dining companion and I have been here so often, in fact, that we have a code for when one of us wants to go to El Pastor. We just say, "Let's go eat a fish." We always leave sated and happy.
