oh my GOD!!!! cheap, good food in a cute location in vegas.....CAN THIS BE?

YEP!  

the name is funny, (but i kind of like it) and the food is delish!  i went on the last night of a bachlorette weekend and it just so happened that on that very night we made the bride to be wear a shirt that said (titties pow) on the back.....i think it needed an exclamation point.... (titties pow!) don't you....ah well it was the perfect attire for a taco place named after a woman's most prized possession

anywho, i think you should go....the fish tacos are yummy and when in the hell will you ever go to a restaurant with a name like that again....and if you don't get it....think harder

don't get the sangria, i think a margarita is a better option and of the three salsas they bring to the table with chips....def go for the green one
