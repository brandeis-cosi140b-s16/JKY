A very good Mexican restaurant for Madison.  The bar is nice and cozy and the beer is always cold.  Good selection of beer too.

Food is excellent.  I usually go for a burrito but sometimes the have very interesting specials that are always great.  I had one that used cactus and it was a nice gamble for me.  Introduced something new for my palate.

The chips and salsa as appetizers are amount the best in town.  Te hot sauce has a good bite and the chips themselves have some good spice.

Definitely a place to try if you are craving Mexican.
