Stop in for happy hour here! The endless $3 chips (nice amount of salt and not greasy)  and 3 salsas are a great deal. I don't usually even like green salsa normally but i liked this one. The street tacos are the right size for a  happy hour snack and worth the price, might want to get 2 or 3 if you are really hungry. We  tried the pork and chicken, they were out of beef that day which was too bad.  Can't go wrong with the mango or pear margaritas and a  happy hour priced tequila shot.

For  happy hour specials, chips and salsa, and street tacos this is the place to go!
