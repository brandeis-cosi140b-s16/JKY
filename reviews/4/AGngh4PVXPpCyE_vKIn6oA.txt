Friendly, fast service.
You order at the counter, but a server came to our table to take our drink orders. They have decent cheap margaritas. They also have a chip and salsa bar that is self serve. The salsas were cold and tasted fresh, some with quite a kick.
The chicken they grill here is good (you can watch them do it through the glass kitchen wall), very flavorful and juicy. The rice and beans were ok too. This is not a fancy place (plastic plates and utensils), but it is clean, good, quick and inexpensive. It also seems a bit healthier then your traditional Americanized Mexican food drowning in cheese and grease.

Kid friendly, easy parking...check it out.
