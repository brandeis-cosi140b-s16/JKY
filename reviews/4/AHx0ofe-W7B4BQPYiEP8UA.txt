Came here for a late weeknight dinner. 
Im originally from Cali so my standard for Great Mexican food is very high. 
The ambiance is very festive & fun. Its a loud place with music and loud conversations so expect it & enjoy!
The staff is very attentive for refills but not in your face. (by the time i got half way done writing this.. That changed. Once the large group next to us left we went from attentive service to empty glasses and searching for our server) 
Now for the good part...THE FOOD: 
You get seated w chips, salsa, and bean dip (the chips were nice & warm/the salsa had just enough heat)
After we ordered... Yummy Soup came!!! 
I order the steak quesadilla w guac :
Idk if i would say the guac was the best in Vegas... It was good. 
The quesadilla was stuffed with steak & very yummy!!!
Hubby ordered Mole poblano:
Beans & rice were flavorful
The perfect Mole!!!!

All in All a yummy delicious experience!!! 
We will be back for more!
