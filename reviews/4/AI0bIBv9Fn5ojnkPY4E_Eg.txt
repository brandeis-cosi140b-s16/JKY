Agree this is the best of the Serrano's locations, and that the Val Vista and guadelupe location is the worst.  The bean dip is always warm and tasty, chips almost always hot and salted reasonably.  For the last 5 years the chicken tortilla soup and albondigas have never, ever been less than superb.  In terms of food, service, ambience this is really 3 stars, but for being so damn consistent over the years gotta give this one a 4.
