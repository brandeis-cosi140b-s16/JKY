My girlfriends and I stopped in last night for a quick bite before our movie and were very happy with our experience.  We were told it would be about a 25 min wait, but we were seated in about 15mins.  We ended up only ordering apps and margaritas.  Our server, John, was super friendly, attentive and quick to bring our items and check on us often. The pear margarita was delicious!!!!  We will definitely return.
