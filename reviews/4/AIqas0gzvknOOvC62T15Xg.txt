Even though the current decor/layout has been around for around 10 years, it still holds up well. The prices also haven't increased much over that time, so it's still a great neighborhood mexican restaurant. Been coming here for almost 20 years though, I remember back when they had a smoking section. 

Food and service is still great. Pro tip, they have a hot salsa that they don't bring out by default, but if you ask for it, they will bring you some. Try it, I like cutting it 50/50 with their mild salsa.
