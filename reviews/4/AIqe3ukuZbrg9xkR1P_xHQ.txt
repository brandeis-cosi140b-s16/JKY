We eat here once a week when we're in Casa Grande. It's a family-operated business, and they aim to please. The servers are friendly, but sometimes they don't have enough help. The food is good, and should something not be prepared to your liking, they will make it right. We like the cheese enchiladas and tacos. The salsa is good - not too hot, spicy. Iced tea is excellent. It's not a fancy place, but you can't beat the friendly service, hometown atmosphere and decent food. BTW, the fried ice cream is really terrific.
