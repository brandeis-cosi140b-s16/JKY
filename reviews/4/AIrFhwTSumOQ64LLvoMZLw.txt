This is my favorite quasi-Mexican restaurant in the city. It is not entirely authentic, so don't expect that, but it is good. I personally enjoy big burritos that are stuffed and wrapped in foil (seriously, no sarcasm here) with a nice selection of beer. I highly, highly recommend their pulled pork or Acapulco burrito!

They also have awesome daily specials on drinks and it is just an all-around chill place to hang out with friends. I love this place!
