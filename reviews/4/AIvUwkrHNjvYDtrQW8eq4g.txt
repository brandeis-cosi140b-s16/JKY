Went for dinner with my husband. We both had Fajitas, I had the Veggie, he had the El Patron. We were blown away by the amount of food we got. The veggies were fresh and the entire meal was good. We also have enough leftovers for at least one more meal. Service was good and the place was pretty busy.
