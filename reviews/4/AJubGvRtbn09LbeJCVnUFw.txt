My fiance loved the food so much he made us come back again!

He ordered the carne asada fries again, no doubt in his mind that's what he wanted. I wasn't as hungry, so I ordered the 3 taquito plate (I think it's the #11) with guacamole, rice and beans.

The service was super quick and the fries, I think, were better this time round. The guacomole was really loaded on my taquitos, and the pi√±a was delicious (as well as the tamarindo). The only thing that sucked was that I thought since ordering a combo, it would come with a drink. Looked at the receipt and they charged it extra, so I went up and asked and they said the combo didn't come with a drink. Shucks :(

Everything we got was super tasty, and we'd love to come back before our trip is over...I know my fiance is dying for those fries again, already!
