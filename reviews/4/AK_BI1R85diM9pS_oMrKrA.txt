Great place. Been twice, have had the combo tacos and the fajitas, both excellent, (meats have  been tasty and tender) really good service and kid friendly all the way to the frozen ice cream bars for the little ones. Adult beverages are quite good and I recommend the Pama Margarita. Tres Leches for desert is also a winner with our family. T
