My new favorite happy hour spot on Mill Avenue! $2 beers ($3 Guinness) until 8:00. And at 9:00, reverse happy hour starts with $2 you-call-its for ladies. Good beer selection, lots of liquor and a build your burrito/taco/nacho bar. The owner was friendly and remembered me when I came back later for reverse happy hour. The outside patio area is small, but perfect for getting your "happy hour" on after a long week.
