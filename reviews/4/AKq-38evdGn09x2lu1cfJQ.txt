after a morning of errands, i met the wife here for our first try at America's taco shop. 

very simple. very good. the veggie quesadilla however was so basic, i was a bit surprised. it seemed like there was only lettuce and guac and that was it. we also had the bean burrito and the refried beans were more of a puree bean paste than anything else. it was messy eating but i still liked it. 

the ceviche was delicious. the sauce on the side was the fantastic and we practically licked the little cup clean. 

i hear they have a decent happy hour. we paid about 14 bucks between the 2 of us.
