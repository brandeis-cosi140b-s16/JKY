I found the people here very friendly and helpful.  I came in for take out and found the menu very well laid-out so I could make my choices quickly.  My order of two plates and a kids plate were ready in 15 minutes.  Now, my favorite Mexican food is TexMex due to being raised in south Texas and really enjoy that flavor.  This food is not TexMex but has a good flavor.  The refried beans and rice were excellent, as good as any I've ever had.  My daughter's taco had a generous helping of shredded beef, lettuce, cheese, etc.  My wife's burro (burrito) also had a generous amount of shredded beef, served without a sauce poured over it.  My plate had a tamale with the same shredded beef and had a cheese enchilada with a sauce.  It's probably the "Arizonan/Sonoran" style but we all thought the beef didn't have seasoning.  My wife and I thought it was delicious, but tasted like moist roast beef that was shredded without seasonings appropriate for a taco, burrito, or tamale.  The tamale was delicious with excellent seasoning in the masa.  My only concern was the masa was very thick (about 3/4 to 1 inch) around a normal amount of beef for a tamale.  Maybe this is the Sonoran style?  Overall, all the food tasted good.  We'll need to try more from their menu to see how everything else tastes.
