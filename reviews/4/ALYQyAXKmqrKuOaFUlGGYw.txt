I want to give 5 stars. But the reason i dont is because I've been there once a week for the past 4. The first time the tacos al pastor were excellent!  But they cant keep the consistency.  Today was lacking salt (and I usually eat low in salt).  
I'll give it a rest for now. 
The guys/girls working there are really nice by the way
