One of my favorite Mariscos joints in the valley.  It's shady, it's small, it's delicious.  They sometimes have smoked marlin available (which I feel bad about, but holy mother of god is epic).  My favorite dishes here are the Campenchana Cocktail and their tostadas de ceviche.

One final non-food related but VERY IMPORTANT note here (and I will say this is also true to many of the other Mariscos joints in the valley- like Acupulco)... PAY WITH CASH if you don't want to deal with your CC info being stolen.
