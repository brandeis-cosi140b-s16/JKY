Let me make myself clear, the only reason I am giving the Rokerij 4 stars is because of the downstairs.  This downstairs bar area of the restaurant has a taverny-old world-European feel to it.  It is usually crowded, but despite the crowd, the atmosphere still feels fairly intimate.  They have a decent wine list with friendly bartenders.  I enjoyed a nice Malbec which seems to be hard to come by here in Phoenix.  This is a great place to relax with a couple of friends or a casual date, but not a good place for large groups.

As for the upstairs dining room...I was not impressed.  The restaurant attempts to keep a similar theme from the downstairs, but in a more fine dining way.  It doesn't really work.  I am a small person and the booths swallowed me up because they are so huge.  The booths have pillows but there is just something weird about sitting on a pillow to reach the table.  I felt like a child but not in a good way.

Our server was great, she was new, but she did a great job.  I can imagine we would have stressed her out a bit more had we been more high maintenance.  The food, well, did not live up to its glory.  Let's just say I wasn't in a hurry to finish my food or willing to take anything home with me.  The food just missed something and was over powered by one particular sauce that left a terrible aftertaste.  

To sum things up, check out the basement but avoid the dining room, the whole fine-dining thing is completely overrated.
