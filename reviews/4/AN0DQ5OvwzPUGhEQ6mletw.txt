Every year I participate in the Komen Cancer Walk in Las Vegas and this year our team treated ourselves to Dona Maria's.  This was the first time I have been here since I am not a local but I am sure I will be coming back.  The tamales were good of course!  And the menudo was great! It can be hard sometimes to find a good tasting and clean menudo.  The only draw back was that they restaurant didnt seem prepared for large parties.
