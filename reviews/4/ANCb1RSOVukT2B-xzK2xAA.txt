Finally made it to lunch here yesterday. I used to enjoy cheap lunch at Plaza Fiesta whenever I went down for gas fill-up. Now that Plaza Fiesta is gone (I wonder where did G.H. Bass move to... anyone knows?), my choice for lunch down in Carowinds Blvd is limited to basically one.  
Westinghouse isn't exactly on my way to and from anywhere, but I couldn't resist my curiosity. I took a detour, and was glad that I did.
I got to the restaurant shortly after 1. There's really no system to the operation; by that I mean there's not a permanent hostess, so just say hi to whoever walking by to get their attention. I recognized the man who used to run the food court location (I'm sure he didn't recognize me) and he promptly sat me at a booth.
The decor is kind of groovy. Bright orange walls, Ikea style sphere paper light fixtures. The place is obviously a lot nicer than the crowded food court. I saw on their doors that they have karaokes and live music too. 
The lunch special menu is served during the week for $5.99. You have several options and the meat choices are little more authentic than the typical Mexican joint (thank goodness, because I'm here to have my lengua and al pastor). I was curious about the sopes, so I asked my waitress instead of having 2 sopes or 2 tacos lunch special if I can have 1 of each. She said sure but she didn't explain that she's basically ringing it up as individual items. My lunch "special" ended up being $6.75 instead $5.99, no biggie, but she could have informed me upfront. (FYI, taco is still $1.75 each, sope is $2 each, and apparently rice & beans is $2.99)
Don't forget to ask for the avocado pepper sauce. It's not as hot as it used to be, but still good. I think overall it's a good cheap lunch spot.
