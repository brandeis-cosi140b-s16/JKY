Rok is probably one of the dopest joints in phoenix. If your trying to get a girl or guy to make out with you, I  highly suggest going to the down stairs bar and parking near the fire place. The service is awesome, every time I go the bartenders remembers my name, (I love that shit) the music is amazing one minute radiohead the next mgmt, really great stuff. The food is a bit pricey but you get a salad with most meals which is a rare thing these days. So overall Rok is a great spot to impress someone you want to make out with.
