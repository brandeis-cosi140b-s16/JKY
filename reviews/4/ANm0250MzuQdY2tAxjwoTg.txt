So there's this place right across the street from my favorite
Korean restaurant Chodang that looks like some kind of converted
motel or something. Plenty of parking if you keep driving through
the parking lot till you find a space. You walk inside and there's 
a number of Mexican shops inside and lots and lots of seating and 
tables. Feels like you just crossed the border into Mexico. But the 
main star of this show is the taco and torta shop Tortas Ahogadas 
Guadalajara. I love a good torta every now and then - this may not 
be Los Reyes de la Torta but it probably is the closest thing to it 
you'll find in Chandler. I had the torta named after the place - Torta 
Ahogadas. They have some soft drinks in bottles but if you want some 
fresh Mexican fruit drinks or Horchata you just need to get it at the 
place right next to it. Not sure if they take credit cards - I just 
paid with cash. You get the little number stands so they can see where
the order needs to be delivered. My torta was delivered by a lovely 
dreamy tattooed angel - of course, I could've been hallucinating since
I was starving. My torta came in a dish and was soaking in sauce - 
pretty much ate it with fork and knife. After we finished our tortas 
the same sweet woman brought us a complimentary taco cut in two to share. 
It was delicious. Real casual place. I think my dining partner and I were 
the only non Spanish speaking folks in the entire place. ¿Muy Auténtico? 
Si! Will definitely be back!
