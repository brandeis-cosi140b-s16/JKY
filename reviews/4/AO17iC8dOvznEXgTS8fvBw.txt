The airport can be such a drag. All the hot bodies, angry travelers and yelling children can be quite a buzz kill. We needed a pick me up before heading home. Popped into Barrio for drinks. We were seated in the middle at a small barish table. It was so hot and loud. We saw the exterior bar open up and asked to move. No problem. Ahhhh we were already feeling better.

We had a great waitress who took cars of us the whole time. We started with a bloody Maria for me and a margarita for Derek. Followed with a 16 oz beer and what do you know, you can add a shot of Jameson on for $4. Yes please. Great break in between flights.
