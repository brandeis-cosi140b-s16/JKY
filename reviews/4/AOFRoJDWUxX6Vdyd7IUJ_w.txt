After working a long day at work my wife and I decided to come to El Pollo Loco for a late night dinner. Jasmine took our order. She greeted us right away and seemed  very friendly and approachable. 

We ordered the double chicken avocado salad with out sour cream, corn mix or citrus vinegar. I ordered a Chicken Tostada no Pico or sour cream with extra chicken and I added cheese :) We ordered it to go. The wait was rather fast. When she gave us our order she read back our order to make sure it was correct and didn't forget to ask us about salad dressings even though we didn't need any I was happy she offered.

We came here a few times and every time we had a pleasant experience.
