ode to a Chilaquiles.

so i ate some Chilaquiles at Pepe's the other morning. not ever having Chilaquiles before i was not sure if my Chilaquiles was good or great, but the Chilaquiles was good to me. very tasty Chilaquiles that is. i had my Chilaquiles with hard fried eggs because i'm not a fan of runny yoke. my Chilaquiles egg was only 85% to my requested hard fried, resulting in a missing star. tho my Chilaquiles was very good. my Chilaquiles was made with a tomatoes salsa texture of sauce..watery in a way..but not knowing how Chilaquiles should look..i thought it was good. Chilaquiles.

the tortilla chips are also good. and i kinda liked the squeeze bottles. cause i just squeeze it onto a chip and put it in my mouth. tasty salsas..i squirted a bunch onto my Chilaquiles egg that wasn't fried enough..so i didn't notice the runny texture. Chilaquiles. Chilaquiles. the beans with my Chilaquiles had white cheese on them, alot of mexican restuarants use a handful of yellow cheese so i was impressed..it wasn't crumble queso-fresco..but it was still tasty with my Chilaquiles. Chilaquiles.


ok i think i have used Chilaquiles eighteen times now..umm ok nineteen times...so to finish off with an even twenty...Chilaquiles. yummm. ohh btw they take bank cards now.
