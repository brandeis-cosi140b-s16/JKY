Don't know what the issues were that had the staff all discumbuberated but I hope the drama has cleared and customers are their focus. The drama  was a distraction and obvious. 

The food was yummy! Tamales YES... PORK!  Very good! 
Chimichanga wasn't fried crisp but the filling was better than most. 
Good food my foodie partner wants to take his parents here! That's a good sign.
