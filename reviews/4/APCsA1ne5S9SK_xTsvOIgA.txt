Home of the $2 Dos....Equis that is... Since this is the closest to my house (and I've been to the others) I like coming here when I feel like an after work beer and an afternoon breeze. the bartenders here are always good to me (which unfortunately, is more than I can say for the Scottsdale crew, just seems to much of a clique up there).

Love the food, love the crowd here as well.I'll miss you when I move Chandler DOS
