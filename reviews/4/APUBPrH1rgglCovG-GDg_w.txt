I know I know! I disliked Roberto's because I felt that there food was too oily. However, these past few days I have been binging on some food and I can't believe how much I fell in love with the chicken tacos! I can't believe they are so darn good and crispy fried! In addition, the chicken rolled tacos was even more filthy delicious considering it was slapped on with avocado sauce and sour cream.  

Yes, I am reverting back to liking Mr. Roberto's!
