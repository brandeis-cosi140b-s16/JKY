Yummy Yummy tacos! Great price too, I personally wouldn't recommend the shrimp cocktail because it tasted like ketchup, also don't spend $4 on the guacamole, it's more of a paste and not fresh. I was kinda bummed that they didn't offer shrimp tacos, seems like they would have them since they have the cocktail and and a shrimp burrito. 

Over all the food was pretty good and came out fast!
