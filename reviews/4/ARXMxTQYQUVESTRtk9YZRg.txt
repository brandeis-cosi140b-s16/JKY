J and I are fans of the Fish Tacos here.  And we usually only go on Tuesday when they're $1.50 a piece. Dinner for the 2 of us for under $9.00, not too shabby!!!  

J is a fan of the hot carrots they have at the salsa bar. It usually never fails when I go, I'm scavenging for the last few slices from the two containers. So I casually mentioned, "You know, you guys should have a separate container just for carrots!" The lady informed me that they do not make their hot carrots (I was under the impression they did), but that they come from a can that has both the chilis and carrots. She then said, "Let me go open a new can and get you some." Sweet!!! Well, more like HOT!! :) 

Arcadia Rubio's, you're a-okay in my book!  Especially on Taco Tuesdays! :)
