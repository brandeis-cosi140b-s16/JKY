Lively atmosphere maybe too much.  Above average food but not exquisite thus the barely four star rating.  Perhaps bigger menu than needed.  At your face but not rude service that won't over sweeten you.  That said the service was still good.  The booths felt odd to sit on.  They were spaced too far back from table and too low.  Will go back.
