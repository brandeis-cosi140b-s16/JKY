The tacos here are tasty!  I'm glad I decided to give this place a try.  This location used to be La Guanajuatence, which had an amazing salsa bar and delicious tacos.  This new restaurant doesn't boast a salsa bar and the salsa they serve with the chips is mediocre, but the tacos are still tasty.  

I ordered the carne asada taco, chorizo taco, lengua taco and a chicken tamale with onions and cilantro on everything. They brought out a smoky salsa in a squeeze tube with the tacos.  The lengua taco was delicious.  The beef tongue was tender and juicy.  The chorizo taco was full of flavor.  Chorizo can be very greasy but I felt that this was just right for me.  Everything was ordered a la carte, so no rice and no beans and that's just how I prefer it.  

The only thing I was not a fan of the chicken tamale.  I found it too heavy in the masa and light on the filling. It felt dry, and I wouldn't order it again.  It's a shame because apparently the market in the same plaza makes amazing tamales on the weekends.  

I haven't tried other things on the menu, and honestly, I probably never will.  Tacos are what I love and I almost never want anything else.
