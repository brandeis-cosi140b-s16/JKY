Two words:  Lunch Buffet!!!  I usually associate buffets with chinese/asian cuisine, but Los Arcos does it up big with their own lunch buffet.  

Sadly, I did not partake in the buffet... I ordered off the regular menu which didn't seem overly priced or too big.  Had a Chicken Taco Salad and it was just the right size for my lunch that day.  Have to say, I was a little jealous of the buffet eaters since they seemed to be enjoying each and ever trip back to the buffet.

I believe this site used to be where Max & Erma's was... but they did a complete gut job.  The space is divided with lots of turns and individual booths so no really big open spaces (unless you count the outdoor patio).   The inside still has the "new paint/construction" smell and everything has been kept clean and tidy despite the number of people that come in and out on a daily basis.

I'm assuming the buffet is only offered for lunch, but it seems to be quite the popular spot.  One of these days, when I stop running and training for races, I will be a frequent buffet guest here.
