I've been to this On the Border location twice recently, and I have left impressed with my dining experience each time.

When I go to On the Border, I prefer to go to the bar - the service is usually quicker and I have easier excess to Dos Equis and extra salsa if I need.

I ran my usual the Big Borderrito - chicken with refried beans on the side.  After only a short wait, my order was brought to me at bar where I was sitting.  The Bid Borderrito was awesome.  What I like most about this monster burrito isn't the bell peppers, or tender grilled chicken, its the versatility of burrito.  You can pick it up and eat it with your hands, or you can use and knife and fork and eat it with that way as well.  In short, the burrito was awesome and satisfied all of my burrito requirements.  

No review of On The Border would be complete without mention of the fresh made salsa they keep on hand and gladly refill for you, and lets not forget the fresh, warm, crunchy, perfectly-salted tortilla chips they crank out of that place.  

On The Border is the best (not necessarily the most authentic) chain-restaurant Mexican food you can get in the area.
