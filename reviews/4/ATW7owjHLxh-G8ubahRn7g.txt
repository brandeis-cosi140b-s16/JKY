One word YUMMY.  loved the rice and beans tasted home made.  Great service.  They even have diet coke.  CarnAsada tacos very good.  nice and fresh. The salsa and chips comes if you order dinner.  Really good slightly salty but it is mexican food.  They brought out green and red hot sauce for the tacos.  Which excited me but neither of them had anything amazing.  But I like spicy and it was mild.  Not saying bad just that I expected them to knock my shoes off because everything else about this place did. I have a feeling there are a few other menu items to try that would make me want to give them 5 stars.
