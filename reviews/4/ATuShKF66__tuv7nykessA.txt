This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas thus far. I have only been there once, but I will go again shortly. Service was prompt and friendly.
The salsa's were very good, especially the green salsa. We asked for habanero, which about burned my mouth right off my face, but it hurt so good.We also ordered the guacamole which was very yummy. It wasn't very hot, (which I prefer) but it was very tasty and chunky with avacodos. 

My boyfriend  and I ordered two dishes and split them. We got the Quesa Tacos with shrimp. They were pretty good. I don't really like my tacos smothered with anything, but I still enjoyed it. We also got the Enchiladas Del Mar with shrimp. THEY WERE SOOOO DELICIOUS!

Shrimp And/Or fish in Leticia's white Cream and Cheese
sauce or Chile de Arbol spicy sauce. Served with white
Poblano casserole of crema, cheese and rajas.

I like really authentic Mexican food, such as great taco stands and places east of downtown that look shady, but are amazing. This place does not fit that category to a t, but it is still very good.
