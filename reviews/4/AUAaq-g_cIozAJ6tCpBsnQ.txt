Wow, tonight was interesting. We've been here a bunch of times and it's kinda always been 'meh' but tonight I liked everything (which is difficult for me). 
First the salsa. It wasn't heavy on the cilantro at all, obviously I'm a cilantro hater. I ordered the appetizer chimi - taquitos and they were crispy, flaky and yummy (chicken). Finally the hubby ordered the table side spinach salad, and they have a smoky pepper dressing which was tasty too.
Maybe they're starting to turn around? I'll be back hoping it's not a fluke.
