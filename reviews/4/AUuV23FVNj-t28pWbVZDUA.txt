Yay a new place to add to my list of good grub and a menu that makes me want to come back several times to try out more.

My girlfriend and I went for dinner last night and had a great meal.  She got the chile rellano plate and I got a filet salad.  Yes I know I just said salad but it had filet mignon on it and jalapeno bacon.  I mean come on it's not healthy especially with the chipotle ranch dressing on it.  It was just what I needed.  I had a bite of the chile rellano and I thought they were good as well.  

Like I said there were many other things on the menu that I for sure want to try so I will be back and hopefully soon.
