This little taco place is legit! Last night my hubby and I got the keys to our new house in Madison Manor, and were thrilled to see Urban Taco had opened right at the end of our street. I had high hopes for this place because who doesn't want access to awesome Mexican food just a block away from home?
Well folks, I am pleased to report it was incredibly delicious! We started with a tasting flight of 5 salsas, and that honestly could've been my whole meal right there. Chips and salsa are where my judgment of a Mexican restaurant lies, and all of the ones we sampled were great. The variety of flavors they've created are sure to please most everyone's palate.
For the meal I tried the costilla short rib taco and the Baja shrimp taco, which were delightful. Hubs had both of their pork offerings and they were thoroughly enjoyed as well.
They have a nice little bar with a selection of wine and beer that includes a few craft brews (which hopefully they will expand more as the business grows). There's also a selection of specialty mixed drinks for those of you looking for an extra kick in the pants.
During our dinner last night, the owner himself welcomed us to the neighborhood, so come on out CenPho and welcome him too!
