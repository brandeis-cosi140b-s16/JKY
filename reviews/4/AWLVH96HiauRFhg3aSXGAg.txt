Despite being taped to the 7-11 next door, border between the two easily blurred and at first sight can make one cringe, it's pretty solid.  Staff was friendly enough at 7 in the morning.  TV on full blast in competition with Spanish radio station was interesting-- suppose it gets people in and out.  Salsa bar was shot to hell and in need of makeover--scared to touch it.  Mixed breakfast burrito was tasty.
