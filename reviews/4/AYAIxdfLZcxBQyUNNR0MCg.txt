The thing about Serrano's is that you have to know what to order. The food is a hit and miss. Some of it is really good and some of it isn't. Their bean dip is amazing as well as their chunky house made salsa. The fajitas are weird, don't order them. The burritos and the chimichangas are the best things on the menu. Their sour cream is seasoned and it tastes kinda strange to be honest. But on the plus side their fried ice cream is to die for! Also they have some pretty damn decent cocktails and their happy hour prices are affordable. It is right next to my doctor's office so I will be back.
