I absolutely LOVE Mexican food, so I'm pretty much willing to try any Mexican spot that may look appealing. Don Pedro's from the outside may look a little run down and old, but that did not take away from the great customer experience. Sever was very attentive and friendly. I LOVE guacamole, so I was thrilled when I saw the guy come around making fresh guacamole in front of me. All in all, food was average, but the great customer service we experienced was deserving of 4 stars.
