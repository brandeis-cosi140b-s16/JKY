After reading reviews here on Yelp, decided to give it a try for lunch. We were not disappointed at all. My wife and I prefer  the little, local, hole in the wall places, and this place definitely qualifies. But DO NOT let that deter you, because this little place is worth a try. 
We started with chips and salsa and an order of guacamole. Salsa was spicy with a nice, fresh made flavor. The made fresh when you order it guac knocked our socks off, not overly spicy, but fresh, fresh, fresh...and you can't beat that. 
And enjoying it on fresh made tortilla chips was even better, second batch was still warm. 
For entrees my wife went with the shredded beef tostada, I had the smothered pork chili burrito and we shared a cheese quesadilla. The best testament I can give is that we both left empty plates. Wife said the tostada was very good, with fresh veggies and a couple big slices of avacado. The pork burrito was delicious, with the right amount of spice and very flavorful pork filling. The tomatillo "smother" added a nice bite as well. 
Server was attentive and never let our drink glasses empty. For a price of $20 it was a very good experience.
