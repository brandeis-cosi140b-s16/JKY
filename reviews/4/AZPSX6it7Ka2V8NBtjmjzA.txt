My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch. The service was shockingly friendly. Phrank was cheerful and pleasant. The prices are awesome. We filled our bellies under twenty bucks! The only down side is the food is simple and plain. I had the chicken tacos combo and my boyfriend had a wet red sauce burrito. Neither had much taste at all, which was disappointing because it looked so yummy and the service/environment was five stars easily. Please Phrank you have an awesome set up! Don't let the bland bandit get you.
