Great little neighborhood find! Loved the fish tacos. Great big portion sizes for a cheap cheap price. Friendly staff, clean restaurant, fresh food.

Easy to find at the front of a strip mall. Lots of parking, plenty of seating. Owners take pride in the food and the service. Highly recommend for a quick bite when you're in the neighborhood.
