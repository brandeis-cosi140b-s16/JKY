Eating at locally owned establishments is grassroots economic development & when you make a discovery, tell everyone!  RED just opened recently and is still putting its pieces together.  However, they have the food nailed!  Fresh ingredients for gourmet Mexican, well prepared and presented, served by eager and enthusiastic staff, reasonably priced.  Chef Michael Brinkin appears to have put together another winning formula, like his successful Big House just around the corner. Those of you traveling up and down I-10, come explore #DowntownCasaGrande and grab a bite at RED. Let's support! @EvelynCasuga
