Let's see open 24 hours and drive thru service I'm sold. Really I ordered a chicken and a cheese enchilada. It came with rice and beans for under $7.00. It was really food. The chicken had a good flavor. The rice was cooked to perfection. The beans were just how I like them not to runny or dry. Must use the red hot sauce they give you it just kicks up the meal. Next time I'll ask for sour cream.
