Their crunchy tacos with barbacoa are one of the best things I have ever tasted. I live on the other side of town and still drive 20 minutes just to have their tacos. My only complaint is that the inside is very small and the place fills up pretty quickly, so if no tables are available, you just stand there awkwardly. But the barbacoa is very much worth it.
