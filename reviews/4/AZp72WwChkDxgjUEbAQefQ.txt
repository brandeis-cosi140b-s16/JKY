I've been here quite a few times.  I usually order the same thing, last time I branched out and tried a chicken and shrimp burrito.  It was ok but the real winner for me here is the mahi tacos, they're great!  It's disappointing though when you place a to go order and get no chips and salsa.  Thought that was a fluke the first time but they don't give them for to go orders.  Tacos are so good though it doesn't matter too much.
