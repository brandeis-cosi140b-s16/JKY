Easily the best Chimichanga and Burritos in the valley. Ingredients are very fresh and portions are huge for the price. Under $6 with a drink! I guess the best way to describe this place is authentic.

I do have one complaint however... they did double charge my once and they were very un-accommodating. I called them and told them this over the phone and they were aggressive and not apologetic what so ever. I had to physically print off my transaction history from my bank and take it into them. VERY bad customer service. If their food wasn't so good I probably wouldn't come back.
