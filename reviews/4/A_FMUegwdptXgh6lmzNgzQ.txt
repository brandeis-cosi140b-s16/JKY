Oh Dell Taco, how I love you.  I know, I know, I'm reviewing the local Dell Taco?  Who does that?  However, I've eaten dinner here about six out of the past seven days, so I feel that I'm justified in writing this review.  I pretty much only get the 1/2 pound bean & cheese burrito, the chicken soft taco, and maybe the bean & cheese cup.  Mmm good; make sure to smother everything in hot sauce.  

I once threw in a Macho burrito and ate the whole thing; but that was a mistake because it was about the size of my thigh, ugh.  Seriously, way too much food.  

I've only ever gone through the drive-thru for dinner and late night.  The workers are nice; very diverse -- there's an African-American guy with crazy hair who works the night shift, a nice Hispanic girl who works the evenings, and a nondescript middle-aged white guy who works the weekends.  Anyway, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come to this Dell Taco specifically, but it's close to my house, so I go, way too much.
