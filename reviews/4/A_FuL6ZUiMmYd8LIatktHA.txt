On The Border is probably my favorite full service Mexican restaurant. I realize it probably isn't the most authentic Mexican food, if at all, but I love it anyways!

One thing though is that they don't always give a lot of guacamole if you order that. You seem to get more if you order it the live way! 

I was pleased with the restaurant decor. Its simple but nice and is one of the reasons I enjoy eating here! The food is all quite good!
