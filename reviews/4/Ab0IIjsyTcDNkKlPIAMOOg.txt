One of my favorite places to eat in Arizona! I now live in Scottsdale and sometimes make the trip all the way to that side of town just for Chino. Been going for years and will continue to go. I always end up getting the same thing. The jade chicken, emerald chicken and jerk rice and the black beans. Amazing!! And then they throw in an awesome tasting cookie with it. If you want a good new taste and amazing food Chino is a good new place to try!
