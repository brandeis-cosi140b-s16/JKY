First time here and it was. A good experience. I love the atmosphere. The place is decorated in a southern California Surf/Skate theme. I ordered the cajun fish tacos with citrus slaw and it was very good. The fish was a little on the dry side but not too bad. The flavor was good and the citrus slaw was perfect with the fish. While not the best fish tacos I have had. They are very good and I will be back here.
