Haven't explored this shopping center yet so I stopped by looking for a quick lunch. There are quite a few choices over here but I decided on Qdoba since I have never been here before.  Reminds me of a Moe's or Chipotle with the service line and restaurant set up. I decided on a chicken quesadilla and a drink . They asked if I wanted a whole wheat or white/flour tortilla, I had no idea they even made whole wheat tortillas but I don't think I have ever been asked that at Moe's (granted I haven't been in about a year) . I choose the whole wheat one , and added pico inside with the cheese and chicken. Overall it was a pretty good quesadilla , they offer guac and sour cream on the side with lettuce . I will say that it's huge and I was not able to finish it so I guess I got my money's worth! Clean restaurant with quick service by the time I left plenty of people were coming in for lunch
Parking is pretty good , but I noticed the lot started to fill up as the lunch time crowd came in .
