I really like this place!  The food is so good and fast.  I think the longest we've waited is about 10 minutes to get our food...I would strongly suggest the carne asada plate.  Awesome meat!  There is guacamole on the side, along with rice, beans, and tortillas.  Can't go wrong!  

It's kind of a random location off of Maryland and Pebble...just look right behind/next to the Shell Station and you'll see it.
