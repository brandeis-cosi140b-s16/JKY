We had the Shrimp Burrito & the Carne Asada Chimichanga special. The special came with rice, re-fried beans and a drink. 
The food was really good, the chimichanga & the burrito were both large. The rice and re-fried beans are very average so don't get your hopes up. 
The decor is a combo of cafeteria and take out style, kinda like a "Baja Fresh" remix, but not many people go there for the ambiance. 

However I will repeat , the main entrees were good. A great value when compared to taco bell or dell taco, we had more than we could eat with drinks and spent less than $17.        :-)
