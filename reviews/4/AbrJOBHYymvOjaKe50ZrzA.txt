I have one word for you JOEY! He is the reason to stop by for a visit as he is an Amazing bartender with a very fun personality! This is a fun joint to stop by for a drink and some good grub. I have been missing out all of this time as I have heard of it through friends however been remise at making a visit.

I had the carne asada breakfast, which came with eggs, hashed browns and tortilla. The carne asada was tender and tasty. It was a generous portion of meat which left me stuffed to the brim, mmmmmm just how I like it!

Drinks and food are reasonable and pretty good.  I had a delicious drink that was custom made by Joey. He is the kind of bartender that you can throw some ideas at and he can create a masterpiece. That night I was craving something with vodka, pineapple, cherry, and orange juice. He kicked it up a notch and created this island treat of a drink so refreshing it made me wet.

I will be back for sure to enjoy a good time with friends, drinks and food.
