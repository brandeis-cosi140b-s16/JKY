we needed a small pick me up before donning our halloween get up and decided to try the hotel's mexican establishment. 

the price was reasonable and the food was very good. i had the fish tacos and they tasted like really good fish tacos. crispy and manageable (i love big food, but hate tacos that are so overstuffed, you wind up using a fork to eat them). the margarita was stiff and had just the right amount of salt on the rim. 

it's in the imperial palace, but don't let that get you down...the IP is a great place! and our waitress, contrary to other reviews, was pretty darn hot.
