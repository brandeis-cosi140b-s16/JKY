Cleanliness: 3 Stars
The front of the restaurant looks like the rest of it, everything was completely cluttered. For the volume this place and being a chain resturant the amount of people this place sees on any given morning I am disappointed by the food storage and prep areas..

Hospitality: 4 stars
The staff was smiling and greeted me with a welcome. Aside from being a snippy and trying to continently ask if "That's It" after each item my experience wasn't bad.

Food: 5 Stars
The portions are large and made fresh to order. All our meals were hot and came accurate.

Overall:
This place is great for a "quick" meal and more affordable than a traditional sit down restaurant. I would recommend to others looking for non-traditional Mexican food..
