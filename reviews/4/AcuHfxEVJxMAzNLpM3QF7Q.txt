YOLO.....I didn't like the name of this restaurant, nor did I care for the environment...but we were too lazy to walk anywhere else on the strip so we decided to go here.

The hostess was kind of weird but after we were seated....we had exceptional service. I mean exceptional. Our waiter was friendly, honest and very customer service oriented. The entire staff (busboys, etc) were actually well presented.

The food....delicious! Very yummy mexican food...I had the shredded beef enchiladas and the appetizer guacamole and everything was very tasted. Worth every cent :D

The margarita.....eh it was tasty but not strong enough thats why I gave four stars
