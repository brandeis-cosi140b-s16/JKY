This is another case where 3.5 stars would be perfect. We went on a Monday for lunch and the service was out standing, the portions were huge and the food was good. 

We had a chicken salad and carnitas along with the bacon wrapped jalapeno's between the three of us, all were very good! 

The jalapeno's are not the bland filled jalapeno's that you get at a lot of places but had a bit of a kick to them and were perfectly cooked.

The carnitas was excellent with the meat nice and tender the fresh tortilla's were excellent.

The only knock I had was the lighting of the place was quite dim.

Thanks!
