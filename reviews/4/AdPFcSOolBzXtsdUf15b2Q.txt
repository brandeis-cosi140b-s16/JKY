Los Dos Molinos is a Phoenix legend for a reason!

Yes, the food is notoriously spicy. Yes, the service can be a bit slow on a packed Friday night. And yes, the restaurant is located in South Phoenix, which apparently scares the pants off of some people.

But the food and drinks are top notch. We usually come at lunchtime on Saturday and have never run into a long wait. Service with a smile, and both seating and food service are fast. Los Dos has the best carnitas in town, and the most potent margaritas. If you're lucky enough to go on a day when the green chili stew special is available, don't miss it! 

Chef Victoria's amazing tamales are also available for the holidays. Which reminds me it's time to place my order.
