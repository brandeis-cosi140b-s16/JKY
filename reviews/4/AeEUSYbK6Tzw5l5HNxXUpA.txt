I love this place. No frills setting, but homey, inexpensive, and the food is so very good. I often stop on my way to or from Woodman's. 

You will get free chips and salsa with your meal. All three salsas are delicious--two reds and a green. They usually bring out the mild red one. It 's smoky, intriguing flavor puts all other mild salsas to shame. The hotter red and the green are also excellent.  All are fresh, made there.  

My favorite lunch is the free chips and salsa and a blackened tilapia taco. It comes in a double soft corn tortilla shell with a spicy mayonnaise sauce, pickled vegetable slaw and avocado slice on top. A little spicy for me, but I can never bring myself to order one of the milder alternatives. 

The chicken enchilada dinner is fabulous, although the portion is huge. 
It's three enchiladas with a high quality chicken and cheese filling covered with salsa and a lattice of sour cream. Delicious refried beans and Mexican rice come with it. Makes for wonderful leftovers the next day.  

The owner is is almost always there. If she's around, she will check on you and make you feel welcome. The seating, lighting, etc. could be spiffier, but this is a home-away-from-home destination for comfort food at its very best.
