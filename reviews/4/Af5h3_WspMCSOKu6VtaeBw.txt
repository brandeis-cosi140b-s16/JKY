Exactly what I was looking for and more. 

A family friendly, sit-down establishment with a fun and welcoming atmosphere with live music, house made tortilla chips, fresh guacamole made at the table, attractive and tasty dishes, with an extensive beer and cocktail menu. 

Perfect for parties and one-on-ones alike. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be sure to have a meal here.
