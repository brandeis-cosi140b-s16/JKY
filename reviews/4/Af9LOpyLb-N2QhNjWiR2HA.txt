like any other born-and-raised west coaster, i know that a hole-in-the-wall mexican restaurant is where the good food is at. el norteno doesn't let down that philosophy. i knew immediately what i wanted when i walked in: a chile relleno burrito with horchata. my boyfriend and my friends, however, didn't -- the server was nice enough to explain everything slowly, and even gave them some of the sauce to try when they asked how spicy everything was. 

on top of the super good service, the chile relleno was perfectly filled with cheese, battered, and fried. it got pretty messy eating it burrito-style though, so i had to eat it with a fork and knife. my stomach was satisfied no matter how i chose to eat.
