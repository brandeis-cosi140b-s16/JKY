We were visiting Las Vegas and staying in Henderson. I ate here twice and had the chicken fajitas. They were one of the best I've had. The serving was very generous, the chicken was seasoned lightly. The salsa was fresh and tasty. My friend had the chicken salad with the creamy Italian dressing and said it was good.
