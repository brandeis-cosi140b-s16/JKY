I'm a New Yorker in town for a few days and was looking for a good fish taco (a rare find in NY) when I came across Filibertos here on Yelp. I might not be the best judge but I've tried em in New Orleans, Austin and New York and these were the best so far. Nice fresh fillets of fried fish, along with big chunks of pork in my carnitas. Burrito.  2 fish tacos and the burrito along with a side of guacamole for under $11 bucks. Well worth the 8 mile drive from where I'm staying. That's my story and I'm sticking too it.
