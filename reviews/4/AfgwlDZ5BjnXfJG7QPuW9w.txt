So yes I went back.  And YUM!  The chips and salsa are really my fave.  It didn't seem so chaotic as my last visit and my waiter was so accomodating.  I had a cheese crisp with beans, black olives, and onions and it really satisfied  my craving.  Can't wait to go back for more...  And the iced tea is fresh!
