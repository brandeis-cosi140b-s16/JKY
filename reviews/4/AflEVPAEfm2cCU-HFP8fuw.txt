A Mexican friend of mine introduced me to Pedros, saying the food was just like his mother's.  (Which could be a compliment or concern; my mom can't cook at all.  Apparently his can.)

Each time I go here, I have good intentions to try something different, but I always end up getting the chicken tacos.  Sometimes I'll mix it up and get a tamale or a shrimp taco with my chicken taco, but generally... you can't go wrong with the chicken.  It is tender, and incredibly flavorful.  I wan to work here just to learn how they cook their chicken.

The chips are bottomless and fresh.  The salsa is a build-your-own kind of thing: they provide the pico base, always full of fresh tomato, onion and cilatro flavor.  Then, if you like a little more spice, you can add some home-made hot sauce to taste.  And, if you're brave, you can request the chunky salsa which, if added liberally, is kicky enough to make the people a table over cry.

My parents, whenever they come to town, insist on visiting Pedros.  Mom swears by the wine margaritas.  

Service is always friendly and efficient; instead of one server, everyone working takes care of every table.  So your water glass doesn't stay empty long.

I could go here weekly, and never get tired of the food.  Why not 5 stars?  Well, I haven't been to every Mexican restaurant in the valley, so there is the (remote) possibility that there is a better place.  But I doubt it.
