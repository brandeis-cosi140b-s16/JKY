OMG Burrito the size of my arm! This is a great location, and the staff is amazing.  Everyone is always so friendly and nice.  I love the cilantro lime rice Chipoltle offers, and when I want something filling but not *terribly* bad for me, this is a great option.  I usually get my order to go, and they are always super nice about adding extra layers of foil to keep my burrito at optimum munching temperature.   All I can really say is YAY BURRITOS!
