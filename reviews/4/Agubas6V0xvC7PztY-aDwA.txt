This place is legit. There are tons of things on the menu I've never even heard of. It's in a questionable area but for food this tasty, I don't mind locking the car doors and windows.

Pros:

-The tacos are amazing. The sauces really complement the tacos and remind me of gourmet taco sauce with barrio pricing.
-Tacos come with grilled onions and other veggies. How awesome is that?
-If you're looking for legit tacos and Mexican food, this is the place.

Cons:

-Kind of difficult to find. 
-If you're looking for date night, this is not the place. 
-Not in the most desirable area.

Verdict:

This is a definite must try if you're ever in the area. Owner is very nice too!
