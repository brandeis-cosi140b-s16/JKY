I stopped in to Sofia's after concluding a meeting at the Town of Gila Bend. The pickings in Gila Bend are pretty slim, but thankfully this place makes up for the lack of restaurants. I had a carne asada burrito and took it to go. While I was there, I did note that the dining area is reasonably clean. The burrito was delicious and filling. I will definitely make this a regular stop when I'm down here for work.
