simple, fresh, and delicious. all important things to consider when picking out a place to grub at after an ass kicking workout at the y.  maybe not the healthiest option, but at least we don't have to tip out a waiter or spend 15 minutes deliberating on what we want.

i've tried the red chili beef, green chili pork, oregano lime chicken, tacos al fresco, and one of their breakfast burritos. nothing disappointed.  their tortillas, named best of phoenix new times, are so soft they nearly melt in your mouth.  the oregano lime chicken is my fave, because you literally get half of a chicken, on the bones and all.  makes me feel animalistic. rawr.  portions are generous, they come with a side of rice, beans, and two tortillas. their auga fresca changes daily, and if you catch them serving watermelon be sure to get it.  it's delicious and refreshing.  i don't know if they make their salsa in house, but it's fantastic.

the space is interesting with an open-ish kitchen and a lab where they hand craft their tortillas.  there is a tv awkwardly placed in the corner which doesn't seem practical for this place.  their hours are really odd, so i'd call ahead to make sure they're open if you're hungry like a wolf.
