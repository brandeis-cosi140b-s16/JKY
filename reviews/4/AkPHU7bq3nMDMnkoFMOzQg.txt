Ambiance:  Definite Cabo feel.  I sat indoors at the bar, but think sitting outdoors would be a fun feel in Vegas.

Food/Drink:  Had nachos, a couple specialty cocktails, and a fried ice cream.  The nachos were plentiful with a nice blend of toppings.  I didn't necessarily love all the cheeses in their blend, but it was good.  They sprinkle on cojita cheese which should be mandatory for all nachos.   I had a alcoholic version of an Arnold Palmer which had fresh mint, which was refreshing, along with a new berry based drink which was also great.  The topper was the fried ice cream.  They put a coat of frosted flakes on it, and it was easily one of the best desserts I ever had.

Service:  The waitresses/bartenders were friendly, and on top of everything.   Being the strip you would hope app servers had this down.

Price:  Slightly pricey.  You do pay for the location and name recognition, but certainly not exorbitantly priced.

Overall:  Great experience, excellent drinks, solid service, good food.  Next time I am staying in the area or with a group of buddies I will stop by.
