My husband and I have been here quite a few times. The food is really good! However, there needs to be an upgrade in the speaker system because I am a
Loud talker and I am constantly having to repeat myself, and I can't think of anything more annoying right now than having to repeat myself 10 times in the drive through, although the employees are always very nice. It's time for an upgrade!
