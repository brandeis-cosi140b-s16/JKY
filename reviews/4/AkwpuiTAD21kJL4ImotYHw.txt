Newer spot in Tempe serving great Mexican food. They are smoking their own meats in the back, are BYOB, and will start to sell meats by the pound here in the near future. The food is really good, the salsa bar let's you kick up the spices to your liking and the staff is friendly. Definitely give it a try if you are in the neighborhood.
