Growing up in Tucson, I often have a craving for Mexican food.  I have tried many places throughout the valley and Rositas is great.  The food is cheap and is consistent.  I typically get the taco/enchilada combo, or a green chile chimi.  The margaritas are also pretty good.  I also always ask for the hot sauce with my chips and salsa.  I can't give it 5 stars because I have had better Mexican food, but this is the best I have had in the Phoenix area so far.
