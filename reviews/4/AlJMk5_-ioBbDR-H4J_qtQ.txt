There is sand at the Sandbar underneath some of the tables.  It gives it a beach type of feel on the outside.  I did feel like coming from the beach because I had a precarious event happen right before.  I was at a pool party, and I was wearing casual clothes because I knew I was going to join a birthday party right after at Sandbar.  I was about to leave, and one of the girls was really drunk and said that I had to be in the pool.  Her and her friend literally double teamed me and started to take off my shoes, socks, and important articles.  I started to get a cramp, so I resisted the fight.  I got thrown in the pool with my clothes on!

Luckily, it was an AZ summer night of 100 degrees and I would dry off right away.  When I entered Sandbar, I felt like I was in the right place because of what just happened.  It was a very casual atmosphere, very much many AZ bars.  Near the entrance, they had a cute girl giving out shots and beers.  Once every hour or so, they would announce some drinks specials to order from her.  Drinks in general were about standard prices.  I got some beer, so I can't comment on any mixed drinks.  There was a medium size dance floor on the inside.  I like the fact Sandbar gives a casual beach vibe, but you can still rock it out on the dance floor inside.

Overall, it was a fun experience to a crazy night, and I can see myself out here again.  Hopefully this time I am not soaking wet!
