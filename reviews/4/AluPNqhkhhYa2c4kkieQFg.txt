This is a great place for affordable, good quality, Mexican food. The burritos have lots of flavor in them and are seasoned very nicely for a good Mexican taste. The salsa bar is great and let you add your own onions and cilantro to your salsa which helps since people can choose how much onion they want in their salsa. The staff is very friendly and the food comes out at a good pace. I love the fact that they use silverware and ceramic plates. The only thing I would say is that the food portions are not as big as I would prefer.
