What a tremendous place to check out in Lawrenceville.  Just keep in mind that this isn't a real restaurant per se, but really more of a bar with tapas.  Food items include tacos, fajitas, rellenos etc.  

I checked this place out with  my roommate and overall, I'd say we had a good experience.  The service was prompt and the food was fresh and hot.  The price was very reasonable.  

Very impressive drink selection, especially tequilas, if that's your thing.

Why four stars?  You have to pay for chips and salsa.
