Coconuts Beach Bar...went on a Wednesday night and it was dead. Of course it was 30 minutes before closing when we showed up but the bartender was super nice and hospitable. Used our free dessert from checking in and got the churros....YUMMY! to eat with our margaritas.

The establishment was very well maintained and looked clean. I will definitely be back again on my next visit to Vegas!
