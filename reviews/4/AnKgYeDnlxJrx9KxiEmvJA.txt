I think you could sum up the next 30 years of my life in Huntersville as a constant internal battle over one critical question: La Unica or Azteca?

My loyalties have been with La Unica since I first experienced it at its old location off Sam Furr Road and have continued at its new, larger location. But then Azteca entered the battlefield.

Azteca has great food and great service, but most importantly it has GREAT DRINKS. Strong margaritas, huge beers, good tequila. Everything you need for an excellent Mexican(-American) dining experience.

The only downside to Azteca is the location--a bit off the beaten path, although it's nominally near Northlake Mall. Once you find it, it's remoteness is actually kind of pleasant, but it could be a dealbreaker for folks not committed to an above-average Mexican meal.

I have to give Azteca 4 stars for now--but this battle is far from over. I will see you on the battlefield.
