The manager: Kat was super friendly... You can appreciate, I can at least someone that is upbeat and nice at any place of business that deals with the public all the time.  
This is a great location, even the employees seemed in good spirits and talkative.  
I cannot complain about a happy work environment here.  The food tasted fresh and the location was clean and in order.  I plan on visiting the staff here again.  This has to be my favorite Rubios.  If you like fish tacos, try the salmon taco, lots of flavor....
