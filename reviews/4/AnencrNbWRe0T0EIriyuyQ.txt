We decided to get a quick dinner and we were craving Mexican. This location is not far from our house so the husband and I decided to get it to go and went through the drive thru. The speaker is horrible! We couldn't understand anything the guy said! So we placed our order and hoped for the best. He actually got our order right! We ordered a chicken tostada and beef tacos. They were actually very good with a lot of meat in the tacos. The only downside was that the shells were on the greasy side. The tacos were 1.99 each which we felt was reasonable. We will definitely be back next craving. I want to try the carne asada burrito!
