I'm glad they opened this place up right by me.  Its basically Chipotle.  With few Chipotle locations in Vegas, and their quality going down, yes, admit it, Zaba's is I'd have to say just as good.  You have pretty much all of the same options. I'm sure some of the seasonings or whatever might be different, but still basically the same.  They do however add a potato option to burritos, or I guess whatever you are getting.  My burrito was MASSIVE.  Bigger than Chipotle for sure.  I still love Chipotle, but with none close by me, this is its equal replacement.
