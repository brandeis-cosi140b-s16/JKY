A good little Mexican restaurant for happy hour. A great spot for after work drinks and chips and salsa. $4.85 for a big cheese crisp and $3 dollar drafts.

I have gone here for years for the family meet up spots. Its a great location that can accommodate big tables and any budget. The parking outside is great too. 

Valle Luna is a community restaurant that helps fund lots of different activities such as softball teams, baseball leagues and bowling!  They have lots of pictures on there wall of thank you pictures and plaques to all the people they have helped. 

Its not the best place in the valley but worth a stop in if your in the neighborhood or with family.
