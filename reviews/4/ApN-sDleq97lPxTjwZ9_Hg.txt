I'm really happy that Diego Pops opened recently. I live in the area and have been looking for a Mexican restaurant that is nicer than fast food drive-thrus, but not as upscale as The Mission. Diego Pops is in a great location in Old Town and I'm really impressed with the way they've designed the restaurant. The decor is fresh and fun - everything is colorful and the place feels tropical. Parking out front is very limited, so save yourself the trouble of their tiny lot and go park behind the building. 

The food deserves five stars, without a doubt. I usually order two or three tacos depending how hungry I am, and whether or not we get guacamole. (Order the guac!) They serve you chips and salsa, which aren't terrible but nothing spectacular. I like that they give you a basket with a variety of sauces (chipotle, avocado puree, salsa verde, spicy red salsa, and others), but everytime I've gone the bottles have been low. How often are they refilled... and are the sauces fresh?

My favorite tacos are the steak, pineapple pork, and grilled shrimp. Go with the recommended tortilla on each one. Maybe order two pineapple pork tacos, because they really are delicious! Sometimes I'll get fried plantains as dessert. If you've never tried them, I would suggest ordering them next time you go!

The only downside to this restaurant is the service. I've been five or six times in the last few months and some days are worse than others. The staff is nice but not very attentive... sometimes I will literally have to flag someone down to get a water refill, a napkin, or even silverware! It's frustrating because all of those things are components of good, even mediocre, restaurant service. I hope the management decides to put more emphasis on good service - it's really the only thing lacking from a great restaurant.
