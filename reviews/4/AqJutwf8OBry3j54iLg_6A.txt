Food was really good, very fresh. I ordered the huarache, it came with a side of pico de gallo salad? A little confusing and quite heavy handed with cilantro. But that's my only complaint. My boyfriend ordered the chicken fajitas and they were screaming hot (as they should be) and the chicken had an excellent flavor. We would both highly our dishes. 

As for service, our server was Jennifer. She was very sweet and patient. I was really indecisive. I could tell she really knew the menu and was able to talk me into trying something new! I had requested no onions and she gave me the info on them, that they were pickled and could have them on the side---turned out they were delicious. I also overhead her talking to another table and she expertly answered questions about the tequilas. I'd say keep this girl and giver her a raise!!!
