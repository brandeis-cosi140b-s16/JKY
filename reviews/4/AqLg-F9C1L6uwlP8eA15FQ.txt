Went for the first time today for lunch. Had the enchilada and shredded beef taco. It was great! They accidentally brought a cheese enchilada instead of beef. The waiter caught this and brought out a beef one even though I said I was fine with the cheese. Service was prompt, friendly and attentive. I can't wait to go back for dinner now.
