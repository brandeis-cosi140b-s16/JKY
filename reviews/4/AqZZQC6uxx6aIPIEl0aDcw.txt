Revamped the menu & waaaayyy better! Had the fried baja rolls & dont know if the green sauce or the rolls tasted better.... Bomb!!! Then me an wifey split the machaca burrito (of course wet fools! ) red sauce!!! Substituted pork for carne... Freakin awesome... Changed staff of as late with a crew from hooters (yay!) Jen & tammy are the best female tenders in town! Would hire them at my joint anyday! Be back again.... Used to dislike this place but am a regular now!
