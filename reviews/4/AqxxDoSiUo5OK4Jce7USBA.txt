Got lunch here, tried the green chili super burro.  Very good, especially with the red and green chili sauce they give to you on the side. Spouse tried the chicken soup,  very good as well.  Soup had veggies and big pieces of chicken.   Will definitely be visiting again soon. Very much a hole-in-the-wall Good Food place.
