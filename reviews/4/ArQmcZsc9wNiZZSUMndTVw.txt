I had a craving for a breakfast burrito this morning, so I got on Yelp  to find a local establishment. The location at Cooper and Ray is where I chose. I ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito to go, and it was accurate and delicious. The cashier was friendly and smiling, even as she answered the phone for the fifth time in the approximately 5 minutes that I waited for my order. I will be back to try more of the menu.
