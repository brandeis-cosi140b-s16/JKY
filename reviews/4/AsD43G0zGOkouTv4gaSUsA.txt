Walking in, probably the first thing I noticed was that the carpet looked like it was straight out of a Chuckie Cheese.  Don't worry though, that's pretty much the only thing they have in common.

The service was pretty good.  Drink orders were fast and they dropped warm chips and hot and mild salsas at the same time to snack on.

I ordered the Flautas with shredded chicken.  The number 7 combo.  It seemed to come pretty quickly and was quite tasty.  The refried beans were topped with a good amount of shredded cheese as well.  The guac was quite good as well.  The biggest travesty of this meal was that I had semi recently eaten and was pretty full and unable to finish it.

Price for combo a soda and tip was $20.00

Would definitely go back.
