We began going to Rubio's 7 years ago when we first moved to the west side and loved their food then.

They've recently changed the menu and I must say, although we don't go that often anymore we love sitting outside when the weather's nice and enjoy our food. I usually have their salad bowl and it's plenty of food (I share with my 3 year old daughter). 

Their food's good, it's prepared when ordered and they give little kids a little bag with crayons for them to stay busy.
