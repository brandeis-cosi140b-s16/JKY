I've been going here for about 12 years.  I have always loved the food, and every single friend I've taken has also loved it.  Now they go when they can, and recommend it to others.

It's true that I've gone on nights where it takes some time to get a table, and I've been there when it took a very long time to get food.  However, that has only happened to me a handful of times in 12 years so I can get over it.  Besides, it usually happens when they are short staffed on that night.

My only real complaint is that for some reason there's this one fly that continues to live in there and just flies around everywhere.  Very annoying.

The place is local, almost dive-ish, it's not fancy.  It's a great little joint and I crave 'em about once a week.  I highly recommend this place.
