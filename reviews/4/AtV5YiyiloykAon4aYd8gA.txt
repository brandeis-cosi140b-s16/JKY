Alan came and saved the day. This started at a one and after a couple of bumps increased greatly. I believe we must have come in during a shift change because we walked in the door and no one seated us. Then after we were seated we sat for 15 mins. before any server even approached us this however was the end of the bad experience.
  Just as I began my review a gentleman named Alan stopped by my table to ask had we been helped yet he wasn't on the clock yet but stated he'd noticed we were just sitting there. He quickly took our drink orders and brought them out before even clocking in. After he was officially began work he got our food orders. My wife had the chimichangas (huge portion), my sister had a cantina burger & I tried the en feugo wings challenge (great taste super hot yea). Everyone loved there food. While I was doing the challenge he kept me supplied with milk. I failed the challenge but when I gave up the chef came out and told me how to cool down my mouth (apparently he'd just tried the challenge a few days earlier). Then when our bill came half of it was comped. We all really enjoyed ourselves after the initial mishap I'd go back I really think they must have been mid shift change when we arrived because as we were being served I noticed the place filling and the service was equally excellent for all of the guest following us. Great food and good service thanks to Alan I'm very pleased
