Red or green?  Yes!

I had no idea that I would like New Mexican food so much! Further, I had no idea that "New Mexican" food was a thing.

A friend of mine in Buffalo, NY recommended this place to me a few years ago & I've been carrying that around in my mind ever since.  This was my first trip to Phoenix since he told me about this.  I had just a little bit of hard time convincing my friends & family to try this place but none of us was disappointed!  

The food is delicious  :)  Try the salsas prior to ordering so that you'll know how you want your food prepared.

The service was great.  Our waiter took the time to explain everything to us & was very attentive to our requests (my wife orders food like Meg Ryan from "When Harry Met Sally" - ugh).

If you don't like spicy food then you should just leave now, you'll be sorry if you don't.  I have a friend who can't eat too much black pepper - she would probably explode if she ate here.
