Out of all the La Canastas in town, this is my favorite. Mostly due to the chip and salsa bar. The flour tortilla chips are so good! The salsas are really good too. I have not had a bad meal here. I  really like the Nana's Bowl either red chili. Their red chili could be the best in town. They also have great lunch combos. You will definitely be full when you leave. 
It does get crowded from time to time, but they have an outdoor patio. Too bad the patio is only useful for part of the year.
