Great staff, prompt service always with a smile and eager to please.  This is our pregame spot for ASU football and basketball games.  I wouldn't recommend the food as it is below average, at best, which accounts for the lack of a fifth star.  Great place to watch games before the game, and their beer is always ice cold.
