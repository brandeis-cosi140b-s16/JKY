It's not everyday that you encounter a restaurant that has their own butcher! You can taste the quality and care the chef places in each meat that is cooked. There is a smoker on premises and a flame broiler for the meats. 

We came in and I ordered the chorizo and egg burrito with a horchata. The chorizo is very flavorful and made in-house. It was a huge burrito and every bite had a good balance of meat to egg. My husband had the chorizo breakfast platter which was a hearty portion that he enjoyed. The horchata was decent, but too sweet for me. 

There is a great salsa bar with various salsas, limes, and pickled jalapenos. It's covered as well which I appreciate since it keeps things more hygienic.

The only real negative was that there isn't a soda fountain so all drinks are by the bottle or in a large glass container for aguas frescas. The sodas are only Jarritos brand, which I believe has no diet soda option. 

Overall though, I'll definitely come here again for more tasty and quick options for Mexican food.
