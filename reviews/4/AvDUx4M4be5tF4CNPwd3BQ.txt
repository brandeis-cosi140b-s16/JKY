A very good transitional Mexican Food.  Unfortunately, the area of town does not have the best of reputations, however, if you get beyond that, the food is good. 

Fresh salsa and warm chips, unlimited. 

I ordered the carnitas chimi.  Would have preferred that it come smothered, but I am sure it can be ordered that way.  I also had the Chili Relleno.  Was not very impressed with this dish as the chili was very small and got lost in the egg. 

Friend had chicken enchilada and taco.  She enjoyed this as well. 

4 stars only because a place has to really stand out to get that fifth star.  I would definitely return if I am on this side of town.  Next time, maybe try a special margarita too!
