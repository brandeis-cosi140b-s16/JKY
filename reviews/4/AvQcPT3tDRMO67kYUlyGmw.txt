I'm a fan of this place!  If only it were slightly closer to my work, I would be eating here a lot more often.  I've been here twice with co-workers for lunch during the workday.  It can get crowded, so if you have a larger group, I suggest showing up before noon.  They have a great lunch special that offers a small salad and two tacos of your choice for $10 (or is it $9?).  I've gotten that each time I've visited and have not been disappointed!

What's good/dangerous about this place is that they also serve delicious chips and salsa while you wait for your food.  Fortunately, I have a decent amount of self control, so I don't go crazy on the chips and salsa -- but the salsa really is great!

The decor is eclectic, colorful, funky, definitely a very joyful feel when you walk in!  They have a small parking lot, but if you come at peak lunch time it might be full.
