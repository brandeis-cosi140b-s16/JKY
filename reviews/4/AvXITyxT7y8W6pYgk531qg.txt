omg, I have been away from hot food too long. the heat from the basic jalape√±os and green chile's set my tongue on fire. Gringo mouth...
the chips and salsa were warm and crispy. we both ordered the green tamale combo. I've never had the tamales like they make them...there is some kind of baked cheese thing in there. I thought it was a hot dog! it was ok, not my favorite. the side of rice and beans was great but so much food.
I felt very authentic. and price point was good for the amount of food.
