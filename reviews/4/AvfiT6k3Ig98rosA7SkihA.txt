I ordered delivery through them from Wheel Delivery, so I can't attest to the atmosphere of the actual restaurant, but the food was decent. I moved here from San Diego a few months ago and it's been hard to find Mexican food that's been up to par. That being said, that's the only reason this place didn't get 5 stars from me- I'm conditioned to knowing what authentic Mexican food tastes like, and it wasn't quite at that level.

BUT ...I think it's a good substitute and the best I've had in Pittsburgh, and I'll definitely be ordering from them again.

Pros:
Fresh tortillas
Great salsa
Big menu with west coast options

Cons:
Fish tacos pretty much fall apart in your hands (although they're delicious)
Carne asada in the California burrito was a bit too much like ground beef
Bacon in breakfast burrito was undercooked and fatty
