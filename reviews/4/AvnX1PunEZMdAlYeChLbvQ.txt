Finding a place to eat on Christmas without reservations was always going to be difficult, so we settled on Canonita. Fortunately, everything turned out really well. The service was attentive and friendly. The roasted mussels were very good indeed. I had the catch of the day, which was mahi-mahi, in a spicy tomato broth. My friend had the wild mushrooms enchiladas. Both were very delicate and rich in flavors. On the whole, a wonderful experience.
