Actually kinda shocked... When I first got in I thought the combination made no sense to me... Restaurant without an identity... I was ready to yelp badly..... However the food was quite tasty and not too overpriced... They could use some help on their decorations..... Shrimp tacos were excellent and bilbogi was great.... Totally recommend this place!!!!!
