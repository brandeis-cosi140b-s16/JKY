Stopped in to check out the Revival for lunch. They have a great patio that will be perfect for outdoor gatherings and enjoying the weather. The music selection was perfect- a fun mix of "feel good" music.

I scanned the menu, and looked around at other diners plates. Looking forward to coming back for the burger and duck taquitos. I sat at the bar and ordered the mussels and a bowl of black bean soup. Soup was delicious. Mussels were tasty- even though I'm not a fan of cream based dishes. The chorizo was a bit overpowering with the cream broth- and the dish could be better if switched out to a broth base- as both are pretty strong on their own. 

Bartender was very attentive and made sure my water was always full. We will definitely be back. During the week it's a great spot for lunch meetings, etc. Great to have them in Tempe!
