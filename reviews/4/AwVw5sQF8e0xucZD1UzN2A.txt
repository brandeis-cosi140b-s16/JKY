Love the salsa, which is always a good indicator about whether or not the food will be worth the calories at a Mexican food restaurant.  It had a little kick and some pickled jalapenos mixed in to give it a distinct flavor.  The chili con queso also had a chipotle flavor, which was killer.  The food was very good and we were extremely full and satisfied at the end of our meal.  I was so full that I could not take advantage of the free sopapillas.  I never expect much for service at chain restaurants; however, this was an exception to the rule.  Our waiter was awesome.  He was on top of everything, including the five diet cokes we each drank (hungover).  Being a fan of Tex-Mex, this restaurant satisfies that aspect as well as New Mexican style.
