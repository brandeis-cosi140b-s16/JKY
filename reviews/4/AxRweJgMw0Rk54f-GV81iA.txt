This place is phenomenal!

I had a quite a dilemma while eating here: i was sad because I didn't want my meal to end... But also i wanna eat it as soon as I can because the tacos are so much better hot off the grill...

I got two ASADA (steak) tacos and two PASTOR (marinated pork) tacos. The ASADA was delicious as expected. Tender juicy steak nom nom.... And the marinated pork was full of flavor...but personally I still like the asada bettter. Their salad bar has a good selection of toppings and tasted fresh... The cucumbers with lime and salt! Mmmhmmm... One thing that would be better would be labels for the salsa because I wasn't sure which is hot or mild so I just got the green tomatillo salsa and the avocado sauce.

I found out so interesting that they ask for payment at the end of your meal. I think that it is a great idea to bring in more business. It worked on me because I ended up getting one more taco lol. 

Service was really good. It was super fast we received our food less than 10 minutes after ordering. 

And I have to mention how they maintain their place. The dining room is very clean AND the restroom is also very clean 

Can't wait to try more of the menu items next time.

4.5 stars!!!!!!! But really close to almost five!
