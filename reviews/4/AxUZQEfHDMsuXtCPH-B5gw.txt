What's not to love! How can a place called the Crescent Ballroom not be an experience! It is not a place where little old ladies dodder around, looking for a handsome, dashing, debonair dance partner. It is also not a place for the faint of heart who wish to challenge the trivia gods on a Sunday night.
It is primarily a music venue where local acts can hone their skills in front of an appreciative audience of just post adolescent audiophiles.
If you do venture out on a Sunday evening to play trivia here, be prepared to be completely destroyed by the local experts. They really know their stuff. 
There is some parking around back and I think you have to pay unless you are a gambler.
The food choices are limited but they do have an eat-your-face-off plate of nachos that should satisfy anyone's hunger.
The drink choices are quite acceptable if you can get the waiter to hear what you want.
Try this place. You won't be disappointed.
