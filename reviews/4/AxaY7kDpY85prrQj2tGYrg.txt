I had planned on grabbing some McD's and saw the bright lights of Rosa's in the same parking lot.  I saw it as a sign to avoid fastfood for tonight.

I ordered the Plato de Carne Pork.  The portions were HUGE.  I probably ate about 1/2 the port.  

My fav part of the meal was the free chips and salsa.  The red salsa was great.  The green salsa was addicting!

Total damage was $19 including tip.
