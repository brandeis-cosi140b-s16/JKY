I don't come to Chipotle often because of the price.  $7 seems much for a fast food burrito.  Regardless, I do like Chipotle.  They make a big and filling burrito.  They have a nice selection of toppings to go on their burritos and I appreciate that one of those toppings is brown rice.  I almost always get  my burrito with brown rice and black beans.  For a meat I alternate between chicken, steak and barbacoa.  Last night I opted for the barbacoa.  It is a spicy braised beef shredded up nice.  It has a ton of flavor and is always tender.  Unfortunately is is also always salty.  As good as it is I could do without the heavy salt.  Maybe last night I should have gone with the chicken or steak.  Those seem to have a more pure and fresh taste.  But that is why I alternate between the three.  I like them all depending on my mood.  Moving down the line as I create my custom burrito I ask for one of the four salsas.  Yesterday I went for the corn salsa but usually I go with the medium heat tomatillo and tomato salsa.  I rarely get the hot salsa and the mild is too much so.  The corn salsa was not at all hot but it was tasty.  The corn adds a nice texture in the buritto.  On top of my black beans, brown rice, barbacoa, and salsa I asked for sour cream and cheese.  That completed my order.  A quick swipe of the plastic money and I was on my way home to enjoy a warm burrito on a chilly night.  It was quick and easy and service was professional and courteous.  When all was said and done I was satisfied.  What more could you ask for?
