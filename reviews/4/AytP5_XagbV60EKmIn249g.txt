I didn't know Susan Feniger was at Mandalay!! I saw her face plastered on the wall next to Hubert and Rick advertising their restaurants at the hotel. 

Decided to go to her restaurant to try it out. Seated outside and served freshly made chips and salsas. YUM. The tomatillo salsa is sooo good! Opted for the Machaca Chilaquiles off the Brunch Menu. The machaca was perfect. Flavors melded well together. They forgot to bring out our pastries and fruits (comes with Brunch) but then I told our server and she packed them up so I could take to-go. 

Our server was Jaime. She was really nice but overall service was slow. Good thing I was on Hawaiian time and didn't care. I was happily basking in the Las Vegas sun :)
