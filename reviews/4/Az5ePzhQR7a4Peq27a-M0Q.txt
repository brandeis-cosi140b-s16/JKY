I've been eating here frequently for a couple of years.  I like this location of all the ones I've been to in town.  It is fast and tastey.  They give generous portions and I appreciate the brown rice and whole wheat tortilla options.  I usually get a salad because it comes with guacamole and sour cream included in the price.
