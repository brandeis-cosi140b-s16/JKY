This was my first time at La Poblanita and it was good. I would go back again. On the menu is the usual Mexican fare, and I ordered the tinga chimichanga for $8.99.  And it was big and very good and came with a side of beans & yellow rice. This location does also sell hard to find candy straight from Mexico. Kids just love to go to the candy store inside the restaurant.  Nice meal. Lots of great parking.
