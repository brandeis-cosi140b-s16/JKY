We went for lunch today,  I had the chile roast beef taco  with rice and pinto beans. I like how they made the tortillas fresh in front of you.  The meat had a great flavor. The rice and beans were nothing to write home about.  While we were ordering I saw the group in front of us ordering chicken and beef nachos.  Those looked delicious,  I wish I would of gotten those.  For every nacho order that is placed the whole crew will sing "nacho nacho man" song. Javier got the Chile beef burrito enchilada style.  He said it was a little small but that thing looked huge. The taste of it was really good.  It's a little different then chipotle, which I'm getting tired of anyways.  I will be going back soon for those nachos.
