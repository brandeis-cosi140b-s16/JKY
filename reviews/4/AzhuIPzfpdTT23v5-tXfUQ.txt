After one visit, I was sold on this place. I ordered the gordita de chicharron plate and was wonderfully surprised. Initially, I was imagining larger chunks of chicharron but the gorditas were filled with a finer chopped protein. I brought some in for my coworker and he's planning to head there with me soon.
