First time we have eaten here last Week. It was $5 margarita and  $5 taco night. My wife had the sangria and tj out it was good. Two of us picked two different tacos and everything was very good. My wife had the chicken nachos . I liked the topping but the chips were thicker than I prefer. Overall a god meal for a good price .
