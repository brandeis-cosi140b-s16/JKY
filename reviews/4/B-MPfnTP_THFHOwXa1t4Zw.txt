Found this spot while walking down the Freemont experience.  The name caught sister's eye as she is an authority on nachos,  so we decided to stop by for a  snack before dinner. We decided on the Tostada nachos, and they were something delicious.  I really like the medley of red onion, tomatoes, and jalape√±o that was diced perfectly atop nachos that were kissed with fresh beans, cheese,  and seasoned ground beef. Our server, Brendan was a bearded lil cutie who was very nice and took care of business. I noticed several people taking shots with baby scorpions in them (which is a specialty of some sort there). If you're brave enough   give it a try, and If you want a quick bite, this is the place for you.
