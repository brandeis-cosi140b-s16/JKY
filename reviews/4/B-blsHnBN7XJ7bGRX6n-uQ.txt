This is a small place that is our neighborhood secret!  Nothing too fancy, but darn good, homemade food that is served up efficiently and professionally.  You can see into the kitchen and watch the cooks working.  Very clean and orderly.  The chips and salsa and the burritos and the tacos have always been great..  And your meal is topped off just perfectly with a melt-in-your-mouth crispy sweet Mexican cookie, no charge!
