I went here with my grandparents and Dad the other day... 

My grandparents go here enough that they are recognized by the staff. :)

So you walk in and it looks very much like a mexican 5 and diner.  Very bright mexican restaurant colors (turquoise, red, yellow) and neon lights.  Modern-ish type decor... but not all the mexican decor like you would find in a normal mexican restaurant.

The full bar was a cool touch though.  I didn't get to try any drinks... didn't think I should get tipsy in front of my grandparents. lol

I had the Tiajuana Taco plate... it was good, but nothing to write home about.  My dad enjoyed his enchiladas and my grandpa got a veggie platter that was HUGE.  Veggie soup, grilled veggies and something else I wasn't able to recognize right away but he loved every single bit of it.

The chips and salsa... I could eat it for days.  Awesome.

The fast food side of Julio's is a nice touch, with menus you can take home to decide out of their large menu.
