Great food but this place is always a pain in the ass to park and get into.  Great place to watch a University of Iowa game if you are in the PHX/Mesa area.  There are a lot of Iowans in PHX, which makes watching the games fun.  This is probably the 2nd best place next to sandbar to watch the games with a huge Iowa crowd.

Looking for more Iowa Natives to review this bar, though.
