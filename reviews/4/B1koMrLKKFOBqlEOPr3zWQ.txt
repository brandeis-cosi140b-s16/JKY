I love that all the new Chipotles are going with a modern minimalist look. Keep the decor simple, focus on the food! And the food is amazing here, just as you would expect to find at any establishment bearing this chains name! Beware the lunch hour during the week. Downtown phoenix gets CRAZY between 11am and 1pm Monday through Friday, and cityscape offers business people a newfound conveniece: good fast food!
