Tostadas de ceviche where delicious, but a little high priced @7. My boyfriend got a tostada of aguachile and for $9 it wasn't spicy at all, he even had to add hot sauce. I would recommend the ceviche but not aguachile. I would also recommend going midday since other reviews complain about loud music and I went around 2:00p.m. And the  music was fine, it was actually pretty empty, so service was good. Not sure if I will be returning to try their shrimp cocktail or just wait to go to CA?
