I've been here a few times, and the food is always tasty.

That's not to say what the first impressions are like, because the doors are plain, solid wood boards, making you think either they are closed down, or a car drove through their front window.  Seriously, guys.  Get some better doors with some detail on them that don't look like they were made in shop class.

The service is generally very good.  Today's server took forever to notice that we came in, waited, then eventually seated ourselves, but she was sincerely apologetic about not hearing us come in, and was always around for the rest of the meal, so we were "good" after that.

I normally get some seafood related meal, and of all the choices, they haven't disappointed.  The appetizers are tasty as well, as is the chip salsa.  Margaritas?  Well, you can't go wrong with a good tequila, now can you?

Prices are reasonable, and it's never really crowded when I go in there.  The food is flavorful, but not so spicy that you'll end up with a severe case of "rumble tum" later.  Just enough flavor to keep it from being bland,  And it works.

As I've said, I've been over there a few times, and while I don't travel in that area of town too often, at least I know of one decent Mexican food place over there.

My only regret is that I didn't grab a margarita today.  Don't ask why.  I'm still pondering that myself.
