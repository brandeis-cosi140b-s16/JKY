Went there to grab something to eat because the Patriots bar across the street was too crowded.  Glad me and the wife made the choice.  I had the fish taco's and she got the pesto shrimp taco's.  Both were fresh and very flavorful.  The fish taco's were beer battered and fried and came out great, not greasy like most places.  The chips were home made and hot and the salsa was fantastic.  I live in east Mesa but am definitely going back for more.  Well worth the trip.
