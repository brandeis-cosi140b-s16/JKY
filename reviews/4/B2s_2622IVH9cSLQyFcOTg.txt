Pleasantly surprised when I walked in looking to get some tacos and they had mariscos on the menu!! The chips and salsa were delicious as well and the prices were super reasonable. 
I'm always searching for a good authentic Mexican food place and this is DEF it!  I live right down the street so I will be frequenting this place more often :)
