I love this place. Every time I come here I get shredded beef chimi plate with fresh green chilis and green chili sauce. PERFECT. Even when we get to go it's still hot and crispy. My only compliant is they are stingy on there salsa. They make you pay extra for EVERYTHING. Some of there people are a little cranky too.....but the food is amazing!!!
