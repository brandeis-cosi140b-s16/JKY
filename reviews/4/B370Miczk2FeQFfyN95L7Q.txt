While I was one of the lucky ones to watch this place grow from the hole it occupied on the south side of the complex to the larger, currently occupied spot, on the North side, it still serves a mean dish. 

My favorite is the Pollo Fundito. The Baby Banditos are hard to pass up too. 

The building appears to be a little cleaner then in the past. Not sure if it is the new'er owners or the City but it a nice change.
