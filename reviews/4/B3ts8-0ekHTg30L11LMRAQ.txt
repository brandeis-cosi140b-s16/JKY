I hope maybe my visit was a sign that this place is turning around a bit. I went to Barrio in the airport on the way to NYC a couple weeks ago. I had the burrito with chicken and goat cheese and all sorts of yummyness inside. I thought it was very good! Very close to the quality of the food at their original restaurant. The service was a bit slow for an airport place, but that means you have to get there a bit earlier. The BF had the pulled pork torta and really enjoyed his food as well. I would say the cons include: expensive, not enough space between tables for a place in an airport...need a little space for luggage etc, and the service is slower than fast casual places (obviously). The pros, however, include: The food is very tasty, the ingredients in my food tasted fresh, they have tasty margaritas, and you're in the airport and not eating at pizza hut.....Hopefully the kinks will get worked out at this location and it can be just as successful as the location on 16th st.
