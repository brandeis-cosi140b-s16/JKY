Really good food!!! I love their molcajete!!! the prices are decent. The atmosphere is very Mexico like. The only reason I would take a star out is for the price of their Mariachi. They charged me $15 per song which I thought was pretty pricey in least than 10 minutes I ended up paying $45 dollars which I did not have budget.
