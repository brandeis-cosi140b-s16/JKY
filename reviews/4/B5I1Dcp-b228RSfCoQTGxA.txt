Salsarita's is a regular stop for me and the kids.  We all get the kids meals.  For me, that is all the food I can eat (or rather, that I need to eat).  The meal comes with a hard or soft taco with chicken or beef and fixin's of your choice, chips, a cookie, and a small drink.  All for less than $5!  Service is fast so if you're starving, you won't have a long wait to fill your tummy.  Salsarita's also has food to go for large parties - great for when unexpected guests arrive.
