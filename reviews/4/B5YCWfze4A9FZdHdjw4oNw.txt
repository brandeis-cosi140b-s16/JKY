Decided to try this place for the breakfast burritos. They are served all day, which is nice. There was a long line of cars in the drive thru, but we went in to eat. My boyfriend & I ordered a bacon burrito and a steak & egg burrito so we could try both. They were huge! We only ate half of each and took the other halves home to eat later. Very hot and delicious. The tortillas were fresh and yummy. We also ordered some fries just because. They were a little dark and had a crunchy exterior, almost like they were battered but I think they were just left in too long and/or maybe they used old oil. So the fries were nothing special, but it's a Mexican place so not a big deal. The iced tea was on point today. Would definitely go back for the breakfast burritos and maybe try some other menu items.
