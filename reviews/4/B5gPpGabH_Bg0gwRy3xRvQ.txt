I think this place is great. The food is terrific, the staff is great. The location and parking are fine. This is nothing fancy, but it's fast and good. 


So, mainly, they serve Fajitas but there are other things on the menu. I've never eaten any of them and, in fact, I never even looked at them. We get  1/2 pound of the "Cadillac" which is filet mignon for the meat and it's plenty for two of us. I'd be just as happy with skirt steak or chicken but we like to upgrade things when we can. It comes with sour cream, cheddar cheese and some kind of tomato/onion salsa. Oh, and you get chips and salsa before the meal!! I got a "salad" as part of my meal. I don't recommend it. It was tiny and expensive for a slice of tomato and iceberg. The grilled zucchini is a nice add on if you want more food. 

The food, overall, is a tad bit high for the kind of place this is, IMHO. You have to order the extras separately, but those are things like beans, rice and guacamole.  But, I didn't deduct much for that experience. But, the decor is old. It looks like this place has been around a long time and everything is showing wear and looks a bit dated. Charming in a way, but not that much. Maybe in 25 more years it'll be charming in a good way, if they wait it out. LOL. 

I enjoy this place and look forward to eating there when we can.  I always leave full and happy.
