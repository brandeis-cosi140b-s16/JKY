If you're looking for clean, chic Mexican food, don't go to Los Beto's. But, if you want a messy, cheesy brick of goodness late at night to soak up some booze, look no further. 

Los Beto's is my favorite 24 hour Mexican food drive thru around. I have heard murmurings of health violations but only for really minor infractions that you would probably expect at a place like this anyway. Like I said, if you want to sit down in a clean restaurant with light ingredients this isn't for you. 

The Texas Burrito is stuffed with chicken, potatoes and melted cheese. Pour a little salsa on every bite as you go and you're on your way. 

But, don't eat and drive! I have salsa stains on many a pant that can tell you why not.
