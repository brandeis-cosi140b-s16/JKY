Just 5 minute drive from the Strip, this place seems quite distant from lights, casinos and tourist traps. Clean, informal yet pleasant with many locals attending.
Guacamole prepared at your table is amongst the very best (comparable to Rosa Mexicano in NYC), excellent fish prepared with style, proper flavour and moderate spiciness. Once again we europeans marvel at the quantity of food offered in USA, but in this case quality remains well over standard. 
Margarita was much better than average (usually large and bland in the USA lots of ice and not enough tequila), whlist the tequila selection accomodates important brands.
There was live music (acoustic so not improperly amplified) with guitars and trumpets...a good touch for a friendly evening.
Prompt service and polite but not overzelous waiters add to the wonderful experience. I will be there again.
