I can't imagine that there's a person who has been in Vegas and been in some sort of nightlife scene and not ended a night with a big heap of Roberto's.  I mean, it's like peanut butter and jelly - they just go hand in hand.

And let me tell you, on a late weekend night there are few things better than some Roberto's.  The rolled tacos with guacamole are good for a cheap snack, a quesadilla can feed an entire family, and their combination plates will sate even the most drunken hunger.  The most famous however, and probably least consumed, are the Chupacabra fries.  Well, that's what we call them at least since they will suck your soul.  It's a plate of fries covered in cheese, salsa, peppers - you know, all the type of stuff that goes on TOP of your usual Mexican fare.

The odd thing about Roberto's is that when you have it during daylight hours, it loses some of it's magic and you sometimes wonder how you can eat all that stuff at 3 AM.  But 3 AM will roll around again, do not fear, and the magic will return.
