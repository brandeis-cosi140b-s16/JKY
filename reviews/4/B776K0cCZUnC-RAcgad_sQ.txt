very tasty!

tonight the steak was a tiny bit tough for my enjoyment but there was a bunch of flavor going on that it didn't matter. the chicken was very tender.

i had the salad bowl, with seaweed brown rice, mango & roasted corn, guacamole, sour cream, lava chips, and roasted sesame gingerette on the side. this was a very unique yummy combination!
