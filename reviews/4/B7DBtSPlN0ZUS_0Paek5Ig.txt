Food, drinks, and atmosphere were good. Nice addition to Westgate. Only complaint is the management's inability to use a remote control and read a TV guide. We stopped in to watch the end of the Michigan vs OSU game. Of the 14 TV's on display, the game wasn't on any of them. We asked several times to change one of the TV's to the game and we're finally told that the game isn't televised. Instead the West Virginia vs Iowa state game played in our view.
