Upon my first trip to Urbana, the locals brought me to El Toro for dinner.  Being a city girl who has tried about a million Mexican places, granted I was drunk and it was 3am for most of those experiences, I didn't know what to expect from central Illinois.  Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised.

I cruised the menu for my standby favorites but I spotted a Hawaiian fajita.  It was huge.  Seriously, I ate as much as I could and handed the rest to my boyfriend.  Even after both of us ate a ton, half the entree was still on the plate.  Wowza.  And let me tell you, it tasted great.  Perfect blend of authentic Mexican flavors and textures with a bit of a Hawaiian twist.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I'd also like to give them kudos on their guacamole.  It is so refreshing to find a place that doesn't overload the guac with lemon juice to preserve it.  I also appreciated that it wasn't too spicy, something that has been hit or miss lately.

We were there on a Tuesday night in early August so I wasn't at all surprised that they were pretty slow.  So obviously, we were well attended to and the staff seemed happy to have us there.
