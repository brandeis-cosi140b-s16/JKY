For a cheap ass mexican place, its damned good! Lets face it there are a TON of "-bertos" and "-icos" ending mexican joints with interchangeable prefixes  but the Federicos on 32nd and Shea is truly one of the good ones. The AZ burritos are awesome as well as the quesadillas - try it with their green sauce and you wont be disappointed! Tostadas arent bad either :)(: one thing, steer clear of adding chicken or steak the quesadillas it ruins them, they get extra fatty/greasy! And hey, open 24 hours? Cant beat that with a stick lol
