This rating is on a scale of fast food restaurants and on that scale, Rubio's is pretty much top notch.  The fish tacos are delicious and the sauces are all tasty, especially the verde salsa...yummy.  There are not too many "healthy" options that are that tasty, but it definitely beats the fattiness of Baja Fresh any day.  If we are in a hurry and in an area with Rubio's, it is my pick.  It would be so much better if Texas was invaded by Rubio's instead of Taco Del Mar.
