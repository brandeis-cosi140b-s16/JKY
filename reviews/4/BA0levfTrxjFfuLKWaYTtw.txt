I always am a huge fan of this place. As a student it was a regular spot for us to stop after games because it was guaranteed to have seats. It also makes great drunk food but odds are you will need a cab or a designated driver because it's a hike from most bars. 

I'm a huge fan of the fajitas. You get that sizzling platter of meats, peppers, and onions. I don't advise the fish it just is mediocre. But the steak and chicken is great. With their homemade guac and pico you will never be fuller. 

Oh and don't forget the margaritas. They have a variety of sizes but let's be real you need the one that's the size of your head. I suggest the strawberry but I haven't had the lime so I am sure that's great too!
