In the almost-3 years I've lived in Las Vegas, I've seen new Roberto's locations pop up all over the place.  One thing to remember is that many of the stores are owned by different people, and the quality and menu definitely vary from store to store.  For some reason, the green salsa at this place is WAY hotter than it is at the other locations I've been too.  Huh.

This Roberto's is the closest to where I live, and it has always been pretty good.  The carne asada is so-so, the breakfast burritos are okay, but I've found that the carnitas here are better than other Roberto's locations.  When you order the carnitas they quickly fry them to a crisp right before putting them in the burrito or taco.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.
