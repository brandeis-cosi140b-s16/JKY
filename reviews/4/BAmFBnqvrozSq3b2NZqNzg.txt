This was a great meal. Loved the open air seating and the decor, the waitstaff is so friendly and attentive (and in the case of our waiter, Frank, adorable!) Prickly pear margaritas in the ubiquitously hip mason jars were delicious... and then the food was great! I had the Pollo al Horno...chicken, nopales, mexican squash, onions and achiote sauce. It was perfect. So good in fact that I'm contemplating walking over for dinner by myself this time. I need to try some more options... and it has to be good if I'm willing to venture there alone. So happy my friend and I gave it a try!
