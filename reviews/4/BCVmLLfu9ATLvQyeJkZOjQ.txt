Everything we've tried is always fresh tasting and delicious.  Typical Mexican menu plus some American mac & cheese/chicken fingers for kids and some burgers.

Fan of the entire menu.  But I think this location is best considered as Guadalupe, unless that side of the street is Tempe(?)

I have ordered several catering platters and they're always a hit for b-days and work events.  Yummy dark red salsa too.
