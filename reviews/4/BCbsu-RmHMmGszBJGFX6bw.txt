Very unusual place. Most bars and nightclubs don't have a pool. Honestly I don't see this place surviving long term given its location.  Large menu. Good Happy Hour prices on food and drinks.  Food was just average.  Hot waitresses, typical for Scottsdale.  Almost more like hanging out at a resort pool than a bar/restaurant.
