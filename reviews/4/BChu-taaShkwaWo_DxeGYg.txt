The only reason I am  not giving Verde 5 stars is because it is not at all what I expected.  Still delicious.  I ordered a soup but it ended up being a cold soup I was shocked but loved it.  My friend ordered a cheese appetizer and we ate the whole thing.  The margaritas were superb.  Not authentic Mexican but a pleasant interpretation.  Will go again soon. Sat outside which was nice for the summer day.  The inside is nice looking so when the weather cools will go again.  Excellent and friendly service.  Prices were a bit high but not astronomical.
