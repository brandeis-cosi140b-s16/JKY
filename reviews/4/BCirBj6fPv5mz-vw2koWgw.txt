So you just had a crazy night out in Old Town and you have to go pick up your car in the morning, so you head over to Cafe Carumba to refuel from a long night of a few too many adult beverages.

Migas or Huevos Rancheros?  Maybe the French Toast or the Stuffed Croissant?  All are a delicious.

The biggest issue I have with Cafe Carumba, is that the party always seems to keep coming.  You hit up a cup of coffee and then the mimosa festivals start to roll out from behind the bar.  You are sitting on the patio, and nothing seems better than a few glasses of champagne while hanging telling stories with a few friends about the night prior.

Next thing you know, you are back at Cafe Carumba the next morning because Cafe Carumba turned into a few beers at Loco Patron on their patio, which turned into a few sake bombers on the patio at Stingray, and a few shots over at Saddle Ranch...I mean, this all could happen in theory...

I'm a big fan of Cafe Carumba.  It's a great morning addition to the old town circuit.
