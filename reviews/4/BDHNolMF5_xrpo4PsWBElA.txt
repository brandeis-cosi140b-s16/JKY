We have been wanting to go here since they opened, as we live within two miles.  Finally made it in on Saturday, and were not disappointed.  My husband had the three way burrito, red, green and bean.  He said it was yummy.  I had the green burrito, and was impressed.  It was tasty and not full of beans and rice like some others.  Just the tortilla and meaty filling.  
We will be back.
