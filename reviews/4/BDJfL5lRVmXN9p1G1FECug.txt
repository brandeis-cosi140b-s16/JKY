Don Pedro is awesome. It's run/owned by the same people as Azteca (on Woodlawn) so you KNOW it's great food with huge portions. This last trip was no disappointment. 

After what was at a minimum the worst hangover of my life kept me indoors and in bed for roughly 18 hours, I was beyond ready for something scrumptious to bring me back to life. I had this grand idea in my head that authentic Mexican would somehow do the trick, and boy did it ever. My wife didn't mind this plan, as Mexican food is her favorite form of sustenance. 

My go-to; 2 enchiladas & a taco, extra rice with no beans. I believe this is the #22, and it's something stupid cheap like $10.95. I almost always get two meals out of it. I recommend upgrading (for $.50) to the pulled/shredded beef instead of ground beef. The shredded chicken is also moist and packs a great flavor. Their rice is tasty & never dry.

Don't hestitate to make a stop here on your next jaunt down in the Ayrsley area.
