Thank goodness for fellow yelpers that give recommendations in comment boxes. I was reading reviews for a different Mexican joint (as I've been on a search for authentic food) and was about to settle on going to that place when I saw someone say that this place had the best tacos in Vegas and was extremely authentic. So my fiance and I went there and were given slightly quizzical looks (as we were the only asians in the restaurant) but nonetheless the cashier was friendly and the place smelled sooo good. 

We had planned on only getting tacos but after looking at the menu and smelling the goodness coming from the kitchen, we decided to also order a combo burrito and pork with verde sauce. Everything was good, even the rice and beans. The only complaint is that the pork w/green sauce was really fatty which is typical of authentic Mexican spots so I picked the fat out. We are so happy to have found this hidden gem!!
