I'm not entirely sure what all this "bad service" nonsense is about.  I've generally been pleased with the servers here.  I've also found that the food is served fast and fresh.

Regarding the quality of that food: questionable.  The food is hardcore mediocre mexican.  It's nothing to write home about, but it's fast, hot and tastes fresh.  Just not that great.

The margaritas were really the reason that I dragged my ex to this place so much.  The margaritas were pretty decent and came in many different flavors.  Plus, they come in insane novelty sizes.

If you want good Mexican food, I suggest you try Casa De Lara, down the street.  This place is mostly for the drinking and the nightlife.
