Service is always good. Salsa and ranch is so good. I don't like how they give small portions of it. Salsa is a very small portion and me and my husband had to ask for more salsa 3x. Burritos are so good!! Rice is fluffy and flavorful. Fajitas are good but there was a time where my fajitas didn't sizzle to the table. Other than that, it's good!!
