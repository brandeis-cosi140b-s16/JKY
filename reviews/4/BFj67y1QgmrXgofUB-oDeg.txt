The food is great - Pasquals easily does the best southwest fare in the Verona area.  It got better with the recent addition of lunch portions and the welcome return of their weekend brunch menu.

Unfortunately, their parking lot is an absolute combat zone.  They'd benefit from some additional parking and an exit to Cross Country Rd.
