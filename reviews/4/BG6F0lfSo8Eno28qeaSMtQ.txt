This place is solid.  Great carne asada, but stay away from the burritos.  This place leans towards the authentic, and burritos aren't actually all that authentic.  A torta or tacos will do you much, much better - especially the tortas, which aren't stacked ridiculously high with cheap meat like most of the tortas in town.
