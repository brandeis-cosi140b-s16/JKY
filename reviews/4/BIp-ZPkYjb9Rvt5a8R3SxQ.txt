OMG,  I'm very happy to find something to replace long lost California Taco in my heart and in my stomach.  Very casual and fine with us BYOBing.  Most importantly,  we all were very happy with the food which did not have that typical mid-western Mexican food taste.  Ironically,  I've never seen a surcharge for the vegetarian version, but no complaints as it was well worth it.
