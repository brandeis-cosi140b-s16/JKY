First, let me say that I have Celiac Disease, and so so dining choices are limited. As such, I love Chipotle for their burrito bowls with steak. However, with the recent price increase for steak, I switched to chicken, and have been having Celiac-related issues ever since. I suspect that the chicken breast used in the chicken has broth injected to keep it moist, which may or may not contain gluten. I write this so that people sensitive to gluten can be on their guard, and so that Chipotle can re-evaluate their choice of supplier.
