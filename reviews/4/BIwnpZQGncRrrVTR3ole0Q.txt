The Chambord Margaritas here should come with a warning label!  Soooo delicious, but lethal to your sobriety. In fact, the restaurant enforces a strict 2 margarita max, and for good reason!  I happened to finish a third once (handed over by a friend that couldn't handle any more), and we spent a hilarious afternoon walking off the tequila inside Fashion Square, and instigating purchases of each other that were well outside of our budget...but I digress.

Z Tejas has some amazing food and drink options to suit any palate.  From apps (try their tableside guacamole or chili pork verde), to steaks and seafood (grilled miso salmon is amazing), to specialties (santa fe smoked chicken enchiladas, mmmmmmmm).  They also offer gluten free and vegetarian options!  One down side - I asked if they offered mac and cheese, and was told to order the Diablo Pasta....soooooo disappointing, and definitely NOT mac N cheese!

Their hh runs from 3-6:30, so they get mixed marks for that...good that they last past 6, but I'd REALLY prefer them to offer it until 7.  

Their atmosphere is pretty laid back and comfortable, while still looking classy and contemporary.  Service has also never been an issue here.

This is one of my favorite happy hour locations, although I don't love that if you want to sit on the 'patio', you are actually basically sitting in a valet garage - not ideal.  

I do love their queso dip, and as I stated in the beginning, the chambord margarita is to die for...so I say check this place out!!
