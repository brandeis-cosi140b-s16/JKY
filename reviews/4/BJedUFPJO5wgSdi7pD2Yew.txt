Ordered a dirty vodka martini and received it on rocks in plastic rocks glass. And was only offered olives after. I guess it's fine - and it tasted good - but the experience of a martini just isn't the same with ice and straws. I ditched the straws in the interest of not downing it too fast. I thought "up" was the default but not here so request it. Bar tender was nice, fast and attentive and the drink was still tasty. Bar itself is ok. Views "motel pool" and ASU on either side.
