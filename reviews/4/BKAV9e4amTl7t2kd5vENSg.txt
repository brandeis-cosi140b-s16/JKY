This by far has to be the best Filiberto's location. I have been to the Phoenix, Tempe, Chandler, Prescott, Mesa, Gilbert, Tucson and Casa Grande locations. 

-Clean salsa bar with chunky and smooth salsa options.
-Free chips, most places will charge you for a small order.
-Gold Peak green tea!
-Smoothies and juices
-Video games, tv's and free wifi
-Fruit filled churros 

The tortillas are fresh and the place was actually clean, shocking. For what it is, this is a good location to stop by at if you are in the mood for this type of mexican food.
