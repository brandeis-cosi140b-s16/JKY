I am not a big fan of Mexican food but as this place was around the corner from our home and both me and my boyfriend wanted some drinks, we thought we'd give them a try. We love a good local hole in the wall. This place was almost perfect.

I had the Blake's tacos and I asked to have the tomatillo sauce on the side. I loved them and wish I could order them a la carte without the beans or rice. 

Our only disappointment was that the margaritas were not very strong.
