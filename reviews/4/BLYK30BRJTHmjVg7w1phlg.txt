The tacos are tasty and sometimes amazing. For  $5 a taco, I'm expecting amazing. But extra points for originality. The appetizers I've tried were fantastic. 

Our service was very friendly and knowledgeable,  but slightly forgetful as it got busier. The lunch rush was definitely a factor in the timeliness. We make sure to come early, but it's still difficult to get in and out in an hour.

The ambiance is super cool. I love looking at all the stained glass and murals. It's a very hip place to grab a bite or a few drinks.
