Great food at a reasonable price, considering you're in Vegas.

Front desk didn't receive my online reservation somehow, but we were still seated right away.  I purchased a Groupon for $15 for $30 worth of food the day before, and the waiter took it cheerfully.  

I ordered the chicken fajita which was absolutely delicious.  My boyfriend was jealous of my meal (he ordered the Isla sliders).  

Service was great, water glass was constantly refilled (I drink a lot of water too!).  I would definitely go back.
