I grew up on the east coast and spent time in the northeast, Midwest, and south before I did my tour of duty for work in Phoenix.  I was used to east coast version of Mexican food and when I moved to Phoenix and had authentic, well I missed the version I knew.  When we moved back east to Charlotte, we tried Cabos and have been going there ever since.  We enjoy their salsa, their chips are always fresh, and the tres compadres dip is a must for us each time.
