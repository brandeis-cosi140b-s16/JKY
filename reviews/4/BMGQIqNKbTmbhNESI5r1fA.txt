I'm a sucker for fries and Mexican food and this place has them both. It was ran by all teenage boys who were all seemingly nice...they just couldn't get our orders right. "No special sauces" turned into "go ahead keep the ones that I put the sauce on". I can deal with that after they gladly replaced them, but I can't deal with beef instead of chicken... Over all, I'd go back again and was torn between a 3 and 4 star rating.
