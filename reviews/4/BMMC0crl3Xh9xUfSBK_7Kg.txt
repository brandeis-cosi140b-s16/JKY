You don't need to order the Speedy Gonzales to experience extremely speedy service! They are FAST!

Food is spectacular. I recommend checking out their "special" menu that has pictures and everything... those aren't your run-of-the-mill items... we tried a dish that had fish, chicken and steak (and I wish I could remember the name of it!) Anyway, my boyfriend and I split it... it was so much food! Absolutely delicious though... more authentic than other menu items. The chips/salsa were plentiful and their fresh-made (in front of you) guacamole is delicious.

Love the sopapillas you get before you leave! Great touch!
