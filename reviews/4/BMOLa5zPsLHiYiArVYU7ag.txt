Yum! Ever since moving to Las Vegas from Los Angeles I miss King Taco. This place satisfies my authentic taco cravings. I usually go to this place because they accept debit/credit cards. Other places (the one on sahara ave. and the one by stratosphere does not.)

So here's 4 stars for you, Tacos Mexico!
