OK so being that I can cook really good Mexican food( or obtain it thru family) I am usually harsh when rating places like this. But when first walking in I was amazed by how clean it was. Also the staff was super super friendly like showing us the size of the tacos and quesadillas. I got the chicken taquitos and I have to say the freaking guacamole is amazing!!!! The rice and beans were very mediocre and lacked flavor. But my taquitos and hubby's asada tacos were pretty good. I also liked that they have orange soda. If grape soda would have been present I would have given this review 5 stars. All in all for a Robertos chain it was pretty good and Ill be coming back!
