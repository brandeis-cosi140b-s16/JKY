This has been the only Tacos Mexico that I have ever been to since the one out in Montclair, CA in the I.E. shut down for some unknown reason.

Every time I am in Las Vegas, I make at least one stop (usually late night) to this mecca of Mexican food goodness. 

The carne asada, al pastor, and carnitas tacos are always a favorite of mine. The amount of meat that they put on their tacos is always comparable to the size of the corn tortillas they serve them on.

Another thing I typically get is the tostada with carne asada. Now here is a generous serving of meat. The way the refried beans mingle with the lettuce, meat, salsa, tomato, and cheese complete with the satisfying crunch of the tostada.. Mmm, Mmm!! It doesn't get any better than that!

My drink of choice here has always been the jamaica. I've always liked hibiscus tea leaves and they do a very good job of it here. It's definitely worth stopping by here. In fact, it's one of the places I look forward to going every time I plan a Vegas trip.
