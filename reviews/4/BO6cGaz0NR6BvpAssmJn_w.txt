Great place to sit outside & enjoy an afternoon with a friend, especially since the AZ weather is startin to cool slightly!  There were mostly business types and tourists dining around us.  We chatted over drinks while taking in the water fountains @ the AZ Center and soaking up comfortably warm sun rays.

While waiting for our food, we grazed on chips that resembled a mix of real tortilla chips and some potato puffs that reminded me of Munchos.  Except the things that looked & crunched like Munchos had a slightly sweet taste.  I ordered the blackened fish tacos.  My plate came with the double shelled tacos with a zesty sauce and a choice of toppings for you to spoon yourself--black beans, spicy coleslaw mix & Spanish rice.  AT the end of the meal, they brought out white chocolate that had been chilled & wrapped in a corn husk.  It was just enough to satisfy a dessert craving without making you feel like crap, if you'd decided to order dessert after a deliciously filling meal.

The only drawback is that the prices are a lil high--$10.95 for my Orange Beso margarita, which was poured @ the table.  (The server left the remainder in the shaker for me to imbibe).  And my taco plate was around $10 too.
