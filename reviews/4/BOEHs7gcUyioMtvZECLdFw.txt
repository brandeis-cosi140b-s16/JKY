I would rate the ambiance 5 stars, I love the decor!  The "big ass fan"(yes, that is what it's called) on the patio, the chain links separating the dining room from the entryway, and the tree/candle back lit bar are great touches.  I would like to give a pat on the back to whoever their interior designer was.  

Now for the food and the only part I really care about.  It was actually pretty good.  It's definitely not typical Arizona-style Mexican, so don't expect that.  I had the Chicken Burrito Maria and my dining partner had some sort of crab and shrimp enchilada plate.  I really liked my burrito, the black beans were a healthier alternative to refried, which I liked.  I knew that the plates didn't come with beans and rice, but that didn't bother me- the burrito was enough to fill me up and it came with some kind of coleslaw.  Now the crab/shrimp enchiladas looked so good that I had to try a bite.  The sauce is unique and unlike your typical enchilada sauce- it was cinnamony and creamy!  I will definitely get that next time.  I also thought the chips and salsa were good, minus one major problem... too much salt.  I had to dust each one off before I ate it.  I finally had to ask the waitress if there was anyway to get less salt on the chips, she was nice about it and completely understanding.  I guess it was just a mixing problem.  Oh, and having 3 salsas to choose from is always a plus in my book.  Overall, it was service with a smile. 

I would go back and enjoy Maria Maria's patio anytime.
