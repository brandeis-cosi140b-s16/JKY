When I want something quick but I don't want to feel gross this is always a go to spot for me.  

Inexpensive, filling and reasonably healthy (if you skip the sour cream, cheese and taco shells haha).

I love a good burrito bowl!!!  If only this place wasn't right next to a Five Guys.  I feel like it's always Russian roulette about which one I'll pick haha.
