I found out about this place by sitting next to the owner, Eddie, on a flight. He's a professional chef who decided to out on his own. He is so anal about being sanitary that he taught me a few things about how a restaurant kitchen should be run. 

The thing Eddie is most proud of is that he ONLY uses ANGUS BEEF. He showed me the bright red color of the meat and how he trims the fat every morning as he's prepping the various cuts for the day.

His carne asada burrito is really good! It's seasoned well so I don't know why others complain that the food here is bland. I was there tonight and saw that they're running a special - $1 tacos. I ended up cutting the burrito in half. It was enough for two meals. Not bad for $5.45 incl tax. 

It's located between Subway and a Chinese place, across from Smiths. I used to go to Roberto's just down the street, but not anymore.
