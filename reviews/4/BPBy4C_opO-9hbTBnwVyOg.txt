Stopped by here on a Saturday evening for some takeout. I ordered I think the #5. It was two tacos with rice and beans. It all came out fairly quickly. The food was very delicious. My steak tacos had a delicious corn Tortilla, the steak was seasoned very well, and was topped with lettuce tomatoes and cheese. It was seriously so full I'd guess there was a full 1/4 c of steak in it. The rice and beans were also quite tasty. The highlight for me was the chips and salsa. Both the green and red salsa were fantastic and the chips were truly amazing. So to cap
Pro: food, portion size, service, price, local business
Cons: steak was a bit dry, not entirely authentic (they had cheeseburgers and my tacos like I said had pretty "Americanized" condiments) 
But as for the place itself, it was outstanding !and Id definitely recommend it
