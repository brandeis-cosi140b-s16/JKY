I really like this place. Probably because of the location: about two miles from my house, the owners: just friendly good people, the clientele: construction workers, crusty old guys, I'm not sure I've ever seen another woman there now that I think of it...They make a big, inexpensive, good burrito. My oldest boys loves the breakfast burrito with potatoes and bacon. And I mean bacon. Real, huge, chunks of delicious bacon. Man bacon. It's delicious. Not that I've ever gotten one of these because women have no business eating huge, bacon burritos right? Yeah. That's it. Never. 
On to girly food: green chile pork is delish. My younger boys always loves the bean & cheese.  And it's awesome on the way to the lake in the morning. 
Did I mention it really is a shack?? Really Really.
