I felt like rice & beans so I thought of trying Federico's since we had only had their breakfast burritos before. I went with the Green Chile plate which came with a big flour tortilla. I assumed it was beef but I honestly couldn't tell what kind of meat it was since it was swimming in green chile sauce. It was tasty though. And I really liked the rice & beans. Very filling plate!
