My husband and I just ate here for the first time. It is really cute and colorful. Service was friendly and the drinks and food came promptly. I had the house margarita and it was quite good. I ordered nachos and specifically asked for shredded beef and jalape√±os. There was not much beef but they were fairly tasty. Not the best I've had but I would not say they were bad either. My husband said his shredded beef taco was very good.

Overall I was happy and would return.
