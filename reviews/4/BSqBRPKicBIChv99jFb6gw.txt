I really liked it and it's become a new place on my list of places to go around campus.

The owner and staff is friendly and helpful.
The food, price and specials are good.
Nice, personal vibe, I love the atmosphere, great hole in the wall place that makes you feel like you're not in Vegas anymore (or in a cookie cutter corporate chain- yay for variety).

Tried the steak, fish and potato tacos, all good. Rice and beans are quite good too (for just being rice and beans).

Yum :)
