Good, tastee, Mexican.  reasonable price.  Don't let the fact it is in a strip shopping center put you off.  Owner served me.  Surprised that I liked hot, spicy foods.  The food was spicy, but I added a rockin hot habinero sauce.  my only criticism if that there could be a little more flavoring such as cilantro.  This restauraunt is within walking distance to the hotel Rio down Valley View blvd.
