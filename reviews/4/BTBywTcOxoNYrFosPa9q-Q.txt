My husband ordered a few carnitas tacos and el pastor burritos. Everything was seasoned well and tasted delicious. The stand out was their ceviche!! I LOVE ceviche and theirs was authentic. I also ordered the special of the day: braised beef plate with rice and beans and tortillas. It was phenomenal!! We're definitely coming back. And the horchata was really tasty. Not watered down at all. The only bummer was their rice. It was really bland and didn't taste like authentic Spanish rice.
