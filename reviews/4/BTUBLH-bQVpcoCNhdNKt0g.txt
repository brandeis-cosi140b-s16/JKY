this place is good. bottom line. if youre hungry for good mexican food and dont have time to deal with going to one of the fancier restaurants, this place will fit the bill. it is a sit down restaurant but you can surely order to go. you roberto's fans know you only go there because theyre only at 4 in the morning when youre drunk. that crap doesnt compare to tony's mexican food.

ive been going to tony's mexican food for the past 6 years starting off at the lake mead and jones location and now go to the one on russell and ft apache. either side of town youre on, you will get your food exactly the same. its amazing that you can count on top quality food consistently from them. 

i started off with just carne asada burritos and they hooked me. im talking carne asada, beans, rice, and sauce all wrapped up in a good size burrito that wont leave you hungry. their birria burrito is amazing and their chicken burrito is so good too. i also get their chicken enchiladas and theyre satisfying as well. 

go in there and get something. get anything. you wont be disappointed.
