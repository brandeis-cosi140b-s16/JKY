My wife and I went there for lunch today (only open for lunch on Saturdays). The server was friendly and checked on us regularly. I found the prices to be on the high side for the quality of the food (entrees 10-18, no lunch menu). We got the Nachos Cuzamil (with chicken) and the Poblano Chile Rellenos (with pork).

The Nachos were disappointing: the chicken was somewhat dry, they forgot the guacamole, and the chips were overdone in spots. When we asked for the guacamole, they brought a small bowl. I found the guac to be passably tasty, but weird. It was thin and had an odd color (not bright green, as I would expect). Maybe heavy on the onion and with some tomatillo in there? Hard to tell.

The chile rellenos, however, were outstanding. The pork was succulent, the chiles were tasty, the sauce was tangy and delicious, and the accompanying rice and beans were good. The portion was big enough that we probably could have just split that entree and foregone the nachos.

All in all, the place seemed good, but a bit uneven. The discrepancy between the nachos and the rellenos was striking, but we will definitely return.
