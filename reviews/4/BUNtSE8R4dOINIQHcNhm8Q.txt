First time ever at El Dorado Cantina. Had the Brazilian Wax as my starting cocktail and ended up drinking their fab margaritas! Jalape√±o margarita is the best! I love mole, so I decided to try the mole sampler tacos which give you 3 different miles... They were to die for!! Definitely coming back. Ambience is awesome and so is the music. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas :)
