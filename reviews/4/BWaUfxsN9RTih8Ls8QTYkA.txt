I harshed this place in my last review of it, deservedly in my opinion. 

I gave Cabo Wabo another chance on a recent trip.  My buddy and I wanted to chill and have a couple drinks, so we gave it another try for drinks and appetizers. 

We asked to sit on the outdoor deck overlooking the strip, and it was all good this time.  Our server was very attentive and fun.  The margaritas were good.  The chips and salsa were good.  The "Mexiyaki" chicken wings were great.  We had a great time and ended up having "more than couple" margaritas along the way.   

Pricing seemed fine for drinks and appetizers in Vegas.  I think the tab with tax for chips and salsa, chicken wings, and about 8 margaritas was about $100.00  

All in all, I'd say Cabo Wabo is great for drinks and appetizers if you want casual and if you want to sit outside.  They have indoor seating, but I can't speak to that.  For me at least, one the main draws is the outdoor deck overlooking the strip.
