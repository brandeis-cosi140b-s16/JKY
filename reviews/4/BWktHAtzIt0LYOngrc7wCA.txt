Read about this place serving a great Mexican breakfast and it lived up to its billing. The Mrs ordered Huevos Divorciados which I haven't seen outside Mexico. It was killer. I had the Chilaquiles (very good) and the nipper had Pancakes, which didn't look like much but were delicious. Excellent homemade corn tortillas proved that the place is most certainly legit, and all at very cheap prices.
It was only 10am, so it was an hour or two early for me, but the vibey surroundings made me want to start necking beers, cranking the mariachi tunes and watch the footy.
