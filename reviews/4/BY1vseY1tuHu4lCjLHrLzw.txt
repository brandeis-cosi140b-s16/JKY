I like Canteen. As others have mentioned, it is different compared to all the other usual Mill Ave spots. It's definitely appreciated and I hope more spots like this pop up on and around Mill Ave. I'm only reviewing the nightlife part of it since I did not come here to dine. 

Their drinks are decently priced. Margaritas were in the $6-8 range. I normally don't like margaritas because I dislike tequilas but the Hibiscus one (I think it was called a Sonoran) was delicious. 

I also loved the music they played. They had me and my girls singing along and dancing the night away. Our servers (we were early enough to snatch a table by the dance floor) were very friendly. For the fellas... there were also some very pretty girls working here, as well. The crowd was mixed and it wasn't too crowded on this particular night. There was still maneuvering space to get to the bar, back to the dance floor or out to the patio. 

The only downside was that they did not have gingerale for a drink I had  asked for. Sucks! Still, I had a blast and I'm sure I will return. And for sure, will have to visit during happy hour one of these days and try their food!
