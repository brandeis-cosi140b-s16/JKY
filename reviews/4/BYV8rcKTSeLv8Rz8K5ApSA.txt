This is a great Moes, and it's not too far from my house. Their burritos are gigantic, and I usually wrap my burrito butt back up and bring it home with me. It's nice to have leftovers for lunch the next day.

The salsa bar is awesome, and it's one of the big bonuses for me when I'm choosing between Qdoba or Moe's, which are both near my house. Their selection isn't as fabulous as Phat Burrito, but it's cheap, close, and delicious, so I can forgive them for some kind of funky hot sause.
