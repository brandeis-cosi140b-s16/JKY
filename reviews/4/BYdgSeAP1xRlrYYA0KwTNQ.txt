These guys make the best chicken, bar none.  And that includes much pricier and higher-end restaurants.  I'm a particular fan of their rice bowl (which KFC tried to imitate with little success) and find that its mix of chicken, pico di gallo, onion, cilantro, beans and Spanish rice make for a very tasty concoction.

When they first came out with their Sirloin, I was skeptical, but the lime marinade they use on their chicken tastes even better on the steak.

So it was high on my list to try their new fish tacos when they started advertising them a few weeks back.  I finally got there to try them both (Original Baja & Spicy Avocado) last night.

I can't say I was blown away.  First, no lime marinade.  Instead the plain foil wrapper included a wedge of lime and it was my job to squirt lime on my fish (not nearly enough lime for my taste).  The soft tacos are really very small (especially when compared with Taco Bell or Del Taco) and for some reason, they use two of them.  Not a particular fan of too much carbs, I abandoned the outer soft taco and ate just the inner one.  And figured out that they use two because on is not quite strong enough to hold the stuff inside.  

I was not impressed by the tacos and I'll probably head back to Rubio's the next time I want a fish taco fix.  Still, this will remain my first choice for chicken and for the Pollo Chicken Bowl.

The subtraction of one star is more because of the very spotty drive thru service, the horrible speaker they have out there, and the long waits that are often the norm (their average serve time per customer is in excess of 3 minutes I would guess).

One final pet peeve - they frequently leave all their signage lights on well after the restaurant has closed.  Which means I have to drive through to find out that they're actually closed.  (Yes, I admit I'm not bright enough to remember their drive thru hours.)
