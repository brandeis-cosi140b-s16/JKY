Let me tell you about the Burrito Factory: 

It's clean, the food is fresh, the workers are very nice, they have a television inside, there's a salsa bar, the nacho chips are yummy, they have a cooler full of Jarritos and the Coca-Cola made with cane sugar (it's better than our stuff), they deliver, there's space inside to eat as well, their beans and rice will make you want to throw something because they're just that good, they have daily specials... 

Most importantly, you will never be disappointed. Seriously. Just go.
