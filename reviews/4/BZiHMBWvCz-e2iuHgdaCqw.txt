I love this place. FRESH HOMEMADE Horchata!! Nothing powder and fake like other places. 

The carne asada tacos are delicious. The caldo is a wonderful treat that taste just like your mother made it. I recently had the menudo and I will rate 
it a 3 star. Needs a bit more sal and just a punch of a little more hotter red chile. Although, I would buy it again. All in all, this place leaves Filibertos or any "Betos" places like Filibertos, macayos, garcias, south of the border, etc......in the DUST!!!

The place is clean and  there is an outdoor sitting area as well. The staff is friendly and the music gives the place a nice touch.
