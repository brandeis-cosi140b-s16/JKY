Always loved this place. Especially the corn bread which is the best you can get in town. Get nacho chips with three dip salsa and gauc for appetizers. 

Recently had the Fish Tacos and it tasted amazing with pieces of mango and tomato.

For desert: Ancho chili Fudge just makes me dreamy.

If you wanna take a girl to a place with good food and great ambiance this is your spot.
