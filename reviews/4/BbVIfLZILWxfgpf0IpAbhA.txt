Seen this place was new on Grubhub saw they had Carne asada fries and Nachos so we figured we'd give it a shot. The nachos were ok. I mean the topping were good, the meat was tender and flavorful, but the chips were kind of chewy. The same with the fries all was good but the fries could have cooked longer. Will definitely order again. Next time we'll try the tacos and burritos
