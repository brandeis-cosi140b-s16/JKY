We visited this place while we were visiting some foodie friends in Phoenix. They were raving about this place and I love me some Mexican food so they drug us here. 
Firstly, I didn't know what to expect because the place looks fast foody, but once you get your amazing food in front of you it's like the rays of heaven come down and shine on their tacos, anything weird or whatever about the place disappears. 
The chicken taco was A-Maz-In!!!! Stuffed with chicken, lots of cheese, pour some of their salsa on it... oh dear, I've gotten overexcited. :)
I had a taco and two tamales, which weren't the greatest honestly, but I've eaten fresh homemade tamales most of my life so I'm a bit spoiled. They were made with beef instead of pork (my favorito), but the beef was good, just not my cup of tea. From what I understand, they don't serve any pork there which is just bummer but eh, their chicken is pretty good.

I also had a bite of my friends red chili chicken burrito and was instantly jealous I didn't get one of those too. :( 

Let me say, they bought a package of their freshly made giant tortillas and...shudder. They were absolutely perfection. So yummy in the morning with melted cheese on them. 
I really liked this place and will definitely go back next time I'm in Phoenix.
