This was my first stop when I got to the city to visit my friend as we were starving an it was basically across the street from where she lived. I love small family owned hole in the wall style places so this was perfect for me. We sat out on the patio and I think because of that we kind of got forgotten about a couple times but it wasn't bad. We sat next to two retired couples doing a road trip across America stopping everywhere for everything. They were from Alabama, they were so cute I want to be just like that when I get old. 
The chips were hott and tasty but a little oily, no worries just cover them in the delicious salsa and its all good. I ordered the chicken lime salad and it was amazing. All the chicken had so much flavor and the salad was sitting on a crisp tortilla covered in beans and cheese. It was all soo good. My friend got the steak fajita and complained that the meat was a bit dry and it did look it so watch out for that. My other friend got the cheese enchilada plate and I could tell it must have been good because she was the first to clean her plate. The portions were plenty and the prices were right.
