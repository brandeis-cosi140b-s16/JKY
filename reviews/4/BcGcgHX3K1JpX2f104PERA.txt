I have been going to this Manuel's since 1983! My baby ate cheese crisp & green corn tamales in the high chair there. Guess what, still goes there for the same! The green corn tamales haven't changed in all these years, still great. The sampler platter is awesome. The margaritas are good, not watered down like some places! I love the chicken chimis, seasoned wonderfully, not just meat in a tortilla, like many places! The flan is YUMMY! So are the sopapillas!! The decor is "vintage mexican restaurant" with thick leather booths and hanging plants. There is a bar in the restaurant area with sports on the tvs and a full separate bar called Tiajuana Tilly's.he parking can be touch on Friday & Sat night. Monday night in the restuarant they have 1/2 price margaritas and Tuesday is kids eat FREE night- I think? Mine are grown. They had this busboy 20 years ago that we dubbed "The World's Greatest Busboy" because he could work the whole dining room and you never wanted for anything! He ws AMAZING! I hear he is a maitre d' in Phoenix now. But, never fear they have a fantastic waiter- Luis. We only go when he is working, so if you go, tell him Desertdoll sent you! He will take good care of you! and live a little, get the green corn tamale!
