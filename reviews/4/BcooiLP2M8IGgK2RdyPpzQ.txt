I have been eating El Burrito since it was on Decatur, when we were all super young. That soup is soooo good. The macaroni soup. I used to ask the lady in the old restaurant for the recipe EVERY time. She was so nice, but not nice enough to hand it over. I found that several friends and family have tried to replicate, and fail. Myself, included. I also enjoy there chicken tacos. They wind up become a salad, for me, and that's cool. The cheese enchiladas are super yum. I always get the same things. But the soup? Always. And the staff? We adore the two young men that host and help out. They know there stuff. The only problem I've ever had is that the little space gets so packed! Well, it's my problem for going at prime hours, I supoose. These people can't help it if they freakin love the food! So just get it to go. I will, forever love this place, and if they ever decide to close, please giv me the recipe for the soup. Please.
