I honestly had to write this review solely based on the friendly staff-I can't even imagine what high standards the manager here must have but the staff is so freaking nice that I couldn't not give them props. 

As a lifelong salesperson, I eat on the road often, well a lot, so I can pretty much tell you the nutrition facts of most chains, which led me here in the first place-4 stars!  Also, when I'm working from home, sometimes I just need to get out for a meal to see some other living, breathing people and this is where I go.  First, it's super quick, you can be in and out if here in no time! Second, it's healthy. All the food is made fresh, right behind the counter, and they are one of the few chains who use hormone/antibiotic free meat and organic produce when possible...hard to find today when everyone is trying to save a dime. Lastly, the staff always greets you with a smile, asks you about your day and says hello and goodbye (one thing this Philly girl never takes for granted). 

So if you're looking for a quick and healthy meal, this is the place.  My two favs are the chicken burrito bowl and the crunchy tacos.
