Chuy's Mesquite Broiler is my new fave post-gym dinner haunt.  I heart the namesake mesquite broiled chicken. A  1/2 chicken + rice + ranchero beans + tortillas (corn or flour, your choice) + cabbage salad is $5.99.  Add in the FREE (yes, I said free and unlimited) chips & salsa and you're set!  The chips are not only free & umlimited -- there's an entire chips & salsa bar/buffet with like 4 kinds of chilled conidments including a delightful salsa fresca & my fave salsa (not sure what it';s called) that's like pulverized tomatatillos & it's super peppery.  They also have that curious carrot/pepper blend that's often found in SoCal & AZ.

Chuy's embodies SoCal/baja California cuisine -- right here in the desert.  They are a chain, not like McDo's -- with ~17 locations in AZ & 10 locations in Cali.  Each location is a little unique. I've been to about 3 of them in AZ and the food is consistently nom-nom-nom-a-licious and CHEAP.  I've been for drinks as well and the beers are cold & plentiful.  

I like the Indian School location b/c, well, it's close to me and the patio is awesome for al fresco dining and smoking is permitted out-of-doors, natch.  The staff is typically young, friendly ladies and I have  anew fan at the Ind.School location -- she freaked out (in a good way) when she saw my JÃ¤ger tattoo and told me I'm her new fave customer.  Nice!

The crowd tends to be baby boomer stoner & surfer types & younger folks looking to dine/drink on the cheap, but it's never rowdy and usually people are very friendly and oddly communal for a restaurant.  There is a sense of community around dining at Chuy's -- almost like the OG's slogan "when you're here -- you're family" -- it's like, "when you're here  -- you're Chuy'n".  (OK, I know that was bad, but I had too...)

The downsides: (if this is a downside to you) you serve yourself on the chips & salsa (buffets do NOT bother me) and you bus your own plates & cups after eating.  Big whoop.  Clean up after yourself -- it'll make your mama proud!  Also, the tables can be SLIGHTLY sticky at times...but randomly.  Everything else is top notch, so I give them 4 stars.

All in all, for the value, the amount of food and the friendly, welcoming atmosphere, Chuy's gets my vote!
