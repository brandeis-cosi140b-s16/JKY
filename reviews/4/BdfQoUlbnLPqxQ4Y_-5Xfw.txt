We have been to Arriba's several times now and yesterday for brunch was really good.  The food is fantastic, waiter friendly.  
What made the experience so awesome was even though they forgot the appetizer that my son had ordered but apologized and came out with it pretty fast! We had two different waiters and the second was really up on things.
They constantly asked " do you need anything"?
Love the fundido sauce and walking out the door they all said "thanks for coming, have a good day".
