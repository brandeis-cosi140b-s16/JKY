The seating in the dining area is pretty bare.  Service was very fast, even had we not been occupied with the chips and salsa.

I get the same thing pretty much every Mexican place I go to (name that Johnny Depp movie) - enchiladas - and these were a cut above.  Meats were juicy without being runny or greasy.
