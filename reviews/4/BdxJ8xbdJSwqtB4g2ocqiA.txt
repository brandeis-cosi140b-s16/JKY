Chinese + Mexican? Does that even make sense? It did for me. To be fair, I came just for a snack between meals, so the small portions were not a problem. It is pricey for the portion sizes. 
But all of the items I had were very good. Mushroom tacos, great. Not sure what the sauce was (soy+?) but was tasty. "Twenty vegetable" fried rice was one of the best examples I had.
The sticky rice desert was non-traditional but excellent.
