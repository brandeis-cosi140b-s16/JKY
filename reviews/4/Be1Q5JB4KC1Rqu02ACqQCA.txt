Here it is.. they get four stars because I love their breakfast burritos and because they are the closest place to my house to get fuel in a pinch, but you will pay a premium and may have to wait for a local farmer to get his tractor out of the way to get to the pump. Not the cleanest feeling place in the world for sure, but I do like that its family owned and they always seem to remember me. QC is still considered far away, but we have the small town feel going for us, which to me is super cool, and this place is an example of that!
