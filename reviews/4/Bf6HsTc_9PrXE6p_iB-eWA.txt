Yelp and Guy Feri got it right! Searching Yelp for Chinese in Phoenix directed us to this strange place that somehow works. Rather than being a fusion of both Chinese and Mexican, most of the dishes lean closer to one or the other category.

I definitely recommend getting the combo as getting a regular ends up being very plain (literally just white rice with whatever you choose). 

I opted for the vegetarian friendly combo: #2 Chile Relllano and #21 Veggie fajitas with a side of white rice and black beans. The Chile Rellano was deliciously cheesy but the veggies were too oily.

PS. This place is the opposite of eco-friendly, using all disposable dishes and utensils.. Booo!
