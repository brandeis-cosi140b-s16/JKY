I have been coming here for a few years now and really like the tamales. I tell everyone I know about them and have taken them to work functions. My complaint is that over the last couple of years, the size of the tamale is getting smaller, the filling is less but the prices are going up. I understand economics, food prices are rising so the cost of your product goes up so you have to raise your price to continue to be profitable. But if you are going to do this do NOT lower the quality of your food. I still enjoy the flavor, just wish they didn't skimp on the filling.
