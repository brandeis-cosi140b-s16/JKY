My fiancé and I dropped into Isla on a whim to silence some grumbling tummies while waiting for friends to get out of Mystère. The food was delish! Smokey salsa, salty chips and crunchy flautas rounded out our app-only meal.

We also dipped into the tequila selection and I have to give Isla props for a well organized and easy to read (and understand) menu that made picking a shot easy-peasy for someone who wouldn't know a good tequila if it bit her in the arse (that would be me). Bottoms up!
