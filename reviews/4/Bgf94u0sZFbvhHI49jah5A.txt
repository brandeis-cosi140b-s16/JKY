I am a local in Las Vegas so I always goto the Red Rock. Tho this restaurant always has a while wait it's worth it. I always start off with the guacamole, great starter and the Strawberry cinnamon fresco drink. It is non-alcoholic and I LOVE the drink!! I also always order the Lobster tacos, I highly recommend you try them! I love coming here!
