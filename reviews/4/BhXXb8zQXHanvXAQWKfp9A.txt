I love the atmosphere of the outdoor dining patio. All summer long I have driven by this place which is literally down the street from me and though how nice it would be to eat on the patio, but summers in Vegas are hot and thought I would wait. Now it is too cold, but luckily earlier this month the weather was perfect and I had the chance to eat hear. I ordered a burrito and taco combination plate which came with rice and beans. My friends ordered tacos. The food is a little pricey for the quality although it is yummy food, but I have had just as yummy or better for a slightly lesser price. There is an indoor dining area, but this place is best for outdoor. All the food is cooked at the outdoor patio and there is a nice salsa bar. If you ever find your self in North Las Vegas, make this one of your stops.
