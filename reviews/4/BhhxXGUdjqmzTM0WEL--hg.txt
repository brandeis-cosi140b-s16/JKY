Ate lunch here again today and love this place.  I have probably eaten here at least 50 times and my wife probably 100.  She eats here at least once or twice a week.  The five rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole are her favorite and their unsweetened ice tea is excellent.  I am in love with their chilled red sauce and have tried plenty at just about every bertos and mexican restaurant in town.  This is by far my favorite and I could literally drink it, the taste is so good.  I have a bunch of favorites form the shredded beef tacos, el burrito bandito (with shredded beef), to the fried bean and cheese burritos, fish tacos, pork adobado, etc.  

I also thought Menudo (cow stomach soup) was disgusting until I tried it here.  I now love it and their red chile broth is amazing.  I am still the only one in my family that will touch it with a 10ft pole, but it rocks at this place.  The owner and his wife are also very nice and very good people.  Can't really say anything bad other than sometimes at the drive through, it can be a little harder to order if it isn't the owner or his wife.  Some employees have a more difficult time understanding what you are asking them due to speaking spanish as a first language.  This is never an issue when inside where you might get to chat with the cool owners.  Keep up the good work!
