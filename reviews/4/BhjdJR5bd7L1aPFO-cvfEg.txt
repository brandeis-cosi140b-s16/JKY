The staff here was so very very friendly! I would return just to chat with them - but there was plenty more to like.  The salsa was delicious, the beans were lard free and the chips were piping hot.  My lunch was also fresh and tasty and not smothered in cheese or anything like that.

I would highly recommend stopping in for the lunch specials!
