Just came here last night and ate some popusas. I had the chicharon con queso...freaking bomb!!! I also had queso con loroco not bad but thought they were a bit stingy with the cheese. Overall the food was good staff was ok, environment not bad but just had some loud karaoke so couldn't really have a conversation with my date.
