Clean, solid restaurant.  Previous reviews had me skeptical about eating here , but a random conversation about favorite restaurants with people we met at Flying Biscuit pushed me over the edge.  To clear things up, this place is not nasty at all.  Its nicer than I remember it which says a lot for an old building at the corner of South B and Tyvola.  Very friendly and happy to be there staff.  The chips were ok, could have been better, salsa was fine.  My wife is the cheese dip queen and it passed her standards.  What I liked most about this place was that the menu had both more traditional dishes and a large Tex-Mex combos section as well.  I had carnitas while my wife had the 2 enchilada 1 taco combo.  So I got to try both worlds (even though I lean towards the traditional I got love for a cheese enchilada!).  My carnitas were flavorful and well cooked.  The meat had a little more fat than I liked, but I simply picked around it.  And I'm sure that the fat is where the flavor came from.  The meat was served covered with grilled onions that enhanced the flavor further.  The chicken taco from the combination dinner was really good - the chicken was shredded and juicy.  Cheese and chicken enchiladas were both solid.  I won't be bringing my parents or banker here, but my wife and I will be back soon.  Next time I will be getting the chilequilles.
