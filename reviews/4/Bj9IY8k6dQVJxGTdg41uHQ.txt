Okay, I finally need to do a review. Basically I could just say "ditto" to nearly everyone else. But since I have stopped by at least 4 or 5 times now for my "fix", I will add my take on it.

The Crisp Meat Burrito is all I need mention. ANYTIME is Crisp Meat Burrito time! It has the power to make my day and brings mouth watering delight with it's combination of juicy beef, whatever sauce is in it, and the crispy exterior. The Mexi Fries are also the same as in Seattle, but I can't count on anything else, so I just stick to the CMB. I think the Casita Burrito is probably different, and so is the Soft Taco. They don't even have a Soft Meat Burrito on the menu which makes me sad as that was my other favorite. I have no idea what was in that burrito/meat sauce (inside the burrito), but it was always simple, juicy, and delicious combined with shredded cheddar cheesiness, none of that nacho cheese crap. 

But I regress. Anyways. 

A hot fresh crispy meat burrito cannot be surpassed by any taquito or pale substitution. I get a side of sour cream and a side of ranch, and combined, it comes close to the "ranch sour cream" which is the only type they have in the NW area Taco Times. I get my first burrito, and then ask the server to drop the second in as I am finishing up the first. This keeps them both piping hot and in perfect crunchiness. 

This location truly sucks as it's a grungy truck stop across from the Silverton, but at least it is very close to the freeway. Unlike others,  service I have received every time has been very prompt and hospitable. 

The only reason for 4 stars is the lousy location and the highway robbery they are able to charge for a simple item. Usually, a crisp meat burrito was around maybe $2.75 or so? At this location, it is $3.65 and .89 for the sour cream. 

Oh well. I will return. Again and again and again.
