First time to visit this restaurant.  Peculiar location...  Beautiful decor, and nicely maintained inside and out.  Although, the padding on our chairs look like they'd seen better days.  Also, we were a bit cold sitting under the new wall AC unit.  Nice bathrooms (unlike some other Mexican restaurants).  

No hostess available, and after waiting a few minutes,  I went to look for someone to seat us.  The server said he'd be right with us.  

We ordered iced tea and it tasted fresh brewed.  The queso, chips and salsa (red and green) were all very good.   

Our dishes were brought out quickly --just before finishing our appetizer.  My chicken chimichanga was delicious and the plate presentation was nicely arranged with a radish as garnish.  My entree did have a bone in it, though.

Our server mentioned dessert, but we couldn't endulge as our lunch portion kept us satisfied.

We enjoyed the atmosphere (besides the cold air) and the food, and will return.
