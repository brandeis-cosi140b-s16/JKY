Good source to Kill your Carne Asada Burrito hunger!  this thing is big and cheap... real steak sliced up and well grilled (upon request) I always eat it california style which is to have everything including rice and beans inside. I do it "dry" style which is no sauce/gravy on top... that way I can pick it up, dump some hot sauce on it and crush it!  this place is open late, in fact 24 hours i believe... I have gone there at all hours of the morning only to find the food cheap and cheerful. The help is friendly, but the bar crowd have pretty much destroyed the bathroom so dont expect much in that department.
