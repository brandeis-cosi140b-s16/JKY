Great owner and takes interest in his customers!  I went and wasn't impressed with the food, owner contacted me apologized for the experience and asked that I give his restaurant another try.  Any establishment that takes the time to reach out to a customer and apologize for their experience...is a restaurant I want to support. My husband and I will be back to try the food again.
