My husband and I are from New Mexico so we like to seek these types of restaurants out. This place has great burritos and service. Their fry bread is to die for. But I'd advise staying away from their tamales. Not authentic or very good. The queen creek location has a better lobby/waiting area. The front door is a few feet from the counter at this locational so if you have more than three people in line it gets uncomfortable.  

All together, if you're looking for a taste of home, this is a good place to visit.
