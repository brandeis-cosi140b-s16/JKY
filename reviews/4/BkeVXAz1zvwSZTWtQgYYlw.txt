A great, convenient little food truck just around the block from my apartment.  OK...so the hot dogs aren't anything special, but they're good and its worth a stop now and then.  The little street tacos make a great late night snack.  And you can't go wrong with the Mexican sodas.  Mandarin is my fav.
