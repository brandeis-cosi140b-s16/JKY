good authentic Mexican food, just an awkward vibe being the only black person in these places sometime, i had to preoare my salsa which is in front of the tv....blank face. lol turned around & you can imagine the looks i got from a few ppl. lol. guess i was blocking the soccer game, tacos are A1 tho  makes me feel like im eating at a Cali joint
