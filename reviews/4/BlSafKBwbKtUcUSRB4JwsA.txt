Having been an employee of Chipotle you would expect horror stories from me I am sure but that is not the case.  In the year I worked there I never once witnessed anything that would make me not want to eat there again, I have eaten there several dozens of times since I left my job and when I was pregnant it was my craving for guacamole that kept me going! It is clean, fast and delicious! 

My only complaint would be the pricing, for two people it would be about $20-$25 with drinks which is pricey for a "faster food" type setting but it is delicious and large portions so it balances itself out for the most part.
