I have kind of gotten hooked on the place, and the workers all know me by name now. I'm here at least once a week if not 2 or 3 times. Love their chile rellanos & chile rellano burritos. Their carne asada chimichangas are perfect and my roommate loves the carne asada burritos. Their ben & chez (bean & cheese) burritos are huge and filling and like $2.50. Love their red hot sauce & the carrot/onion mix and radishes. Occasionally you get some tough meat, but the majority of the time it is super tender and flavorful.

Wish YELP would finally update their records with the new (its only been Don Tortaco for like a year +) name.
