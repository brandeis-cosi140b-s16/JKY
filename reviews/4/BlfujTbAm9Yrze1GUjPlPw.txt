I've only had the Jerk Chicken, one of their signature dishes and I can't bring myself to try anything else because its that good. The grilled veggies are always perfectly seasoned and fresh and their black beans are just stupid good. The chicken's always tender and juicy but the best part is the cloud of sour cream and pineapple goodness it sits on.  I need this dish right now aaaand it's 9am. They're not open yet. Suck!
They received 4 stars because service is on the slow side.
