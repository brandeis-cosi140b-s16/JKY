Hubby and I decided to go for Mexican and stopped in for a bite tonight. We pulled up and it looked like there was going to be a long wait for a Friday night. The hostess got us seated in less then 10min which was FAB! We decided to get the chips and queso to snack on while waiting for our food to arrive. I ordered the mango margarita which comes in a huge glass, so be prepared to come thirsty. While we waited for our food I noticed they had carts going around making table side guacamole. How cool is that? -Wish I had read T.T.'s post before going. 

Food: My husband ordered one of the large specials... The plate was HUGE! I still have no idea how he ate the entire meal. I got a smaller plate the chicken chimichanga, very tasty, not the best I've ever had but definitely very good and authentic. 

Service: The waiter we had was fast and always seemed to be right there just when we needed something. He was very attentive. My husband is a tea guzzler and his glass was never empty. 

I do have to say that this is a very family friendly restaurant. Be prepared to see kids and people of all ages dining. I would suggest if you have a choice between Azteca and Montery I would definitely go with Azteca, hands down! Great people, great food, great ambiance!
