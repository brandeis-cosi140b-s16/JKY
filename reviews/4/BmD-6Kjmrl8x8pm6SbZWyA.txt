Great food and really good prices! Staff is good most the time and has always got the order right. 3 words: Ava Pollo Fundido. If you like a Jalepeno kick and chicken chimichangas then that's your dish. Carne Asada Quesadilla is the bomb and they give you guac and sour cream FREE here! Nice little joint and nice to support local places.
