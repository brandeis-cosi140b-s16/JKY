Came in on a Sunday night at 10 p.m. and it was empty, yay! We ordered our food to go, it was ready in 10 minutes and the cashier was friendly. In my opinion, Fausto's is a step up from Roberto's, the quality of food is better and won't give you gas! Haha. They have a salsa bar with green and red salsa, pickled jalapenos/carrots/onions, cucumbers, lemons, etc.

 I went with the rolled chicken taquitos special that comes with beans/rice and a drink. My husband went with the chicken chimichanga, he wanted shredded beef but we were informed that they pre-make their beef with onions in it, so ordering without the onions was not possible, oh wells, the majority of Mexican establishments do that so we were not surprised. We ended up paying around $14 for both our meals so it's pretty cheap to eat here, they do charge $0.35 if you want to use a debit card, so if you're cheap and want to save a few cents, bring cash. 

Everything was great, beans are rice were surprisingly good! My chicken taquitos were a bit on the soggy side, but that's because we drove back home to eat, they were topped with guacamole and shredded cheese. Both the chicken and the guacamole had a good flavor. My husband was satisfied with his meal, he's normally a picky eater. We'd visit again if we get late night Mexican food cravings.
