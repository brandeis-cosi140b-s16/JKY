Bookmark day 
In the area and wanted to try some place new

The Stand was a joint that we had passed several times

Upon walking in, it is small and I felt like it had almost a "beach" feel... The inside is very nice and clean...

All of the workers seemed to be high school/college kids which I thought was pretty cool...

The menu is small but hey, it works
I got the cheeseburger, fries, and a coke
I enjoyed the burger
The fries were pretty okay too
The coke was good

The service was good

Next time I will try the tacos, a lot of people got those while we were in... 

The look yumzo...
