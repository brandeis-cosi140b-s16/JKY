This place has delicious pupusas!  I've been to both locations and both seem to have comparable quality. 

The menu is large, but it's honestly very difficult to order anything but the scrumptious pupusas. An old friend introduced me to this Salvadoran food, and it is safe to say that I have finally found an acceptable option for when his mom isn't cooking up a giant batch to share with friends and family. 

My only complaint is that they do not give enough of the cabbage when you order to go or carry out. Good homey vibes and an inexpensive, filling meal every time!
