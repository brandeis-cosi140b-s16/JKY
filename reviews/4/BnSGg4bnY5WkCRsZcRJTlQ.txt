The burritos are some of the best around.  We decided to get their taco plate last night and it ws not so great.   They filled the taco shell with mostly mashed potatoes - then just a little meat.   I like potato tacos....but I did not order a potato taco.  I will be back, but I will stick with the burritos!!!
