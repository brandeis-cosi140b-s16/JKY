Don't believe the lies!  It isn't closed. Las Palmas bought it and reopened it with an updated and still good menu. 

If you like Las Palmas tacos then you'll like this place too. Good flavors, good service, pretty good prices, and massive portions.

The menu is very interesting, many things for the adventurous eater, from goat curry to "Menudo" spicy beef tripe soup. 

Also, for the person who always orders fish tacos (and you know who you are), good news!  There are fish tacos. 

The queso chorizo appetizer is highly recommended and goes perfectly with the house made corn chips.The homemade drinks are very tasty, such as the hibiscus soda and the horchata. Not the best I've ever had, but definitely very solid latin caribbean fusion, and a easily one of Brookline's best dining options.
