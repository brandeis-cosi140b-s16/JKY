Visited mid afternoon on Saturday. Place was packed when we arrived but quickly cleared out after 3. The doors were up and it was nice to sit there and enjoy the weather. Service was good, attentive yet not overly. Food was good, order the braised beef and one of the chicken tacos. It came out quickly and was very good. Pitcher of margaritas was really good---huge for a couple of people. The only thing I see as an issue is parking. We tried to come here a few weeks ago and parking was an issue---valet full, "attendants" in the HT parking lot were threatening to tow. Not sure how they will solve this problem. Would definitely go back again. And definitely recommend this place. Tequila selection is pretty good as well.
