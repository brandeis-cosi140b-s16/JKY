Want to give 3 1/2 stars, but will round up because of great Happy Hour surprise on a Sunday!  Chambord margarita was very good. We had the Chips and trio with quac, salsa, and spicy queso dip, and really enjoyed that.  The chicken fajitas were ok.  Not bad, but just not much flavor to them.  We will definitely be back for Happy hour and will try something else. Nice patio and good service.
