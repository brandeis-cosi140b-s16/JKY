This is their new(er) location in the old KFC freestanding building, next door to their old location that got torn down and replaced with a Walgreens.

Hadn't been here in 10+ years (had a bad experience; sometimes that all it takes for me to avoid a place...even though I pass by EVERY day and see the parking lot full of cars). Really glad I gave them another try because my Chicken Chimi was super-yummy, with melted cheese, a side of sour cream and tomatoes, as well as rice and beans. I also got a side of chips and guacamole. Good stuff. Good prices. Efficient service too (in other words, the cashier spoke English, rang me up (complete with special instructions) very quickly, and the order came out exactly as I intended. Yay!

I'll definitely be back with my Mexican-food-loving-husband soon.
