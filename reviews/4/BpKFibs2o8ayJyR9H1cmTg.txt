Went to restaurant for late dinner. This is a small restaurant with outdoor seating as well. Our server Mike was very pleasant, gave us plenty of time to order our drinks and relax. He then came back for our food order. Our food was delivered warm, asked to be reheated and was returned hot. My husband ordered Chile rellano and I ordered enchiladas. Entree was accompanied by rice and beans. Food was tasty and not overpowering Presentation was excellent. I definitely would recommend trying Mejico.
