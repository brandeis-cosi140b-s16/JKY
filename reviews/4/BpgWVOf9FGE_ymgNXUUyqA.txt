Great food & beautiful remodel of this now Migo's

I enjoyed the 3 chicken taco platter that had a generous portion of moist chicken & a delicious cabbage salad on top. 

Very nice staff & was checked in on by manager twice! 
The only issue is getting into the parking lot....if you come from the west it's easy, if your coming from the east plan on making some u-turns.

We noticed that they have a live band performing on the weekends and margarita specials......sounds like I need to come back for dinner!
Hope everyone will check them out.
