Sometimes being pescetarian sucks when you are out drinking and need that lil something that could be the defining line between sobering up and making it home with both shoes and dignity, or, well..not. This place is great, happy hour dollar beers and great shrimp tacos...love!!Maybe it is just Wednesday night but I did not see anyone there old enough to drink, so this isn't a bar is it? The ratio of guys to girls was 11:1. Usually I'd be all over that if it didn't include a statutory rape case. Other than that I want to go back here like now. I definitely think I will be a regular here!
