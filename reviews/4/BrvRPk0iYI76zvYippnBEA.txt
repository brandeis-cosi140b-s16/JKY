I discovered they have tacos al pastor from a trompo and I had to go! 
For $5.99 I got 2 tacos, rice and beans and a drink. The taco could have had a smidge more meat in them, but they were good. The tacos al pastor I know and love from Mexico City are served with a tiny slice of pineapple that these didn't have. They do give you 6 bottles off different salsa to try with your food. I liked the tomatillo the best.

I'll be back again.
