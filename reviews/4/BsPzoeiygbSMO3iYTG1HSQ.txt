YES, I was gettin my BROWN on.....
         I came here after a long day of doing a whole bunch yard work. The sun had set and I was thinking about my mama and her deliciously comforting cooking...ah, but I am so lazy after busting my back en la yarda...what ever shall I do?? -----it's a good thing Los Molcajetes is JUST around the corner from my place (Hey, and for those of you Downtown looking for a fun environment to grab some Mexican food---come on down, I say).

 I would personally say the food is overpriced or more a $$$ than a $$ BUT it is DAMN good. There are some specials that would fit their price description but if you want an entree or anything seafood- you're gonna be looking at a hungry check later. 

Being a Latina I was raised having some very delicious food both inland and on the coastline, so If you are used to having some coastline food time in Mexico done right- THIS is your place!!

The environment is SO MUCH FUN. Next time I check in I will do the spot more justice so STAY TUNED! The place is completely painted and decked out with ocean life style kinds of things- which is SUCH a comforting thing given that we are all located in between two valleys/the desert. Dive in at the best ocean themed #divein north of #downtown.
