I panicked when Chuy's went out of business. We were regulars of their happy hours and boozy Sunday breakfasts. But luckily CC's is almost identical to Chuy's with the menu, pricing, and specials. 

They still have their free chip and salsa bar, amazing HH specials, dirt cheap breakfasts, and $1.50 build your own bloody marys on Sundays. Woo-hoo! 

Food is slightly better but as one reviewer stated portions are slightly smaller.

I think the service is better than Chuy's. They were very warm and friendly. 

The strawberry margaritas, while a great bargain, were a little too sugary for me. I miss the mix they had at Chuy's. 

Patio is dog friendly! We can watch a game on one of the TV's outside while chilling with our dog at our feet. Order a pitcher or 2 and that is a good time to me.
