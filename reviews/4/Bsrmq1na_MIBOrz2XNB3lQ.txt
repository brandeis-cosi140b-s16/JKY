Ate here tonight and it was all it was cracked up to be. It's a take out with same tables and no atmosphere (thus the 4 stars), but the service and food were both great and the prices are unbelievable. Who would have thought, bulgogi in a burrito or a chimichanga, but boy does it work (especially with the hot and tomatillo sauces - complimentary condiments). Could not eat the whole thing, but did anyway because it was too good to stop.
