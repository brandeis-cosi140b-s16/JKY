Really cool Mexican Restaurant! They have multiple open kitchen's so where ever you are sitting in the place you are close to your cook preparing your meals! 
The place is pretty modern, and cool looking and we were seated right next to our cook which was cool, cause he came over to talk to us about how much he loved cooking vegan food! 
He then told us about a Vegan Mexican place we needed to check out, and he even wrote it down for us!
The food was great, I had a Veggie Burrito with green sauce and it was packed to the brim, with veggies!  It also came with black beans, and rice!  It was great! 
The chips and salsa were plentiful and I was actually pretty full before my meal got out to us! 
This place is cool, only thing keeping back from a 5 star, was the 10 dollar Margarita-- It was pretty gross. At first I just thought it was strong, then I discovered it was just way to sugary.. And I love sugar
