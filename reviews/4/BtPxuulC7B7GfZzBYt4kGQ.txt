Sunday dinner, 5pm. No crowd, checked menu board, proceeded to order. Because of the loud music it was hard to hear the counter person, they had to repeat themselves so we could order. I had the salad with the chile roast beef, tasty, but they were out of salsa and guacamole.  I was not sure my salad was supposed to have the guacamole until I came to Yelp to post and checked the menu. They should have told me, offered to bring it out when ready, or offer a discount,  'cause they charge for extra guacamole. 
I guess if you don't know what isn't there you don't miss it, but when you find out you feel cheated.
