Since retiring here in AZ last year, my wife and I have looking for a good mexican resturant to have breakfast. We found it after our neighbor recommend we try it. It has been our Saturday (and sometimes Sunday) breakfast spot not only for us but the kids when they visit from California.The menudo is great along with the red and green salsa cups they serve with the complimentary chips. This is our main breakfast place on the weekends. Love it!!!
