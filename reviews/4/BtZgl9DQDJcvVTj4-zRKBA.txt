The restaurants ambience is amazing, and the staff where great. The food tasted great but... Not Las Vegas great. Anywhere else, in a medium city maybe, it would have been excellent. But Las Vegas is a notch up and the food was just under amazing. Still a 4 star review in Las Vegas, but it felt like an entree, not a Mexican dish.
