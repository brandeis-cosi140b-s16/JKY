being new to the area and finally regaining my desire to eat tacos again (had just been to mexico a couple months ago and ate tacos everyday for almost a week), i decided to hit up yelp for a local taco shop. since i live down from south blvd. and have seen all the spanish all up and down the street, i figured it was best to try my neighborhood first.

my husband, 3 year-old and i hit up casa grande yesterday night--hoping for dollar taco tuesdays (according to a previous review). however, it seems management has had problems with it in the past and have since removed that from their weekly deals. no bother. their tacos are only $1.75 a piece, delicious and filling. my husband always gets tacos de lengua, and i always get tacos al pastor. we were both not disappointed, and we both ordered an extra al pastor a piece to round out the yummy in our tummies. my husband often gets jugo de tamarindo (i think that's what it's called--he speaks spanish, but i do not), and it was large and in charge! i got a coke and realized that i probably should have got the juice. it seems that they dabble in other latin american cuisine--like el salvadorean, honduran, and colombian. 

service was friendly and accomodating (for a picky kid that actually does not like cheese quesadillas), food was delicious, and the price was right. the place was a bit of a hole, but that's never stopped me before when i've got a hankering for good, authentic food. we will definitely be going back!
