I am so glad a friend kept bugging me about needing to try La Mestiza. "It's so close to where you live," she said, "and they have great margaritas." Well, now that I have tasted La Mestiza, it might become a problem for me. It is so good!

First of all, the place is so cute. Tissue paper banners across the ceiling. Art from local artists on the walls. And the servers are wonderful! Attentive, but not in-your-face, friendly, and informative.

The food is delicious. It feels way more authentic than a lot of Mexican restaurants in the are: not over seasoned and made with fresh ingredients. The Chicken Enchiladas Rojas were so delicious, and a nice portion size. Enough I feel satisfied, but not stuffed. I also got to sample some of the pumpkin seed sauce. Yum!

Nice, strong, simple margaritas... Not made from a mix!

We will definitely be going back!
