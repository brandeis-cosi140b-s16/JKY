I would give this 5 stars except for one thing, it's only Mexican food.  How much can you dress up Mexican food...really?

The place was very clean and well decorated.  The hostesses wore beautiful traditional Mexican dresses.  We were immediately greeted and shown to our seats.  The musician/karaoke man in the corner was a bit loud, but not obnoxiously so.  He went out of his way to entertain our kids with some personal attention, a song while wearing a funny mask.  (They LOVED it!).  As a matter of fact, the entire staff were completely friendly and helpful.  Everyone went out of their way to make sure our experience was pleasant and enjoyable.  The prices were very reasonable too.

There's not much you can do with Mexican food, let's be honest.  But it was very good, as Mexican food goes.  The EXPERIENCE and customer service we were given earns Casa Don Juan 4 and a half stars in my book.  I highly recommend this restaurant.
