Non-GMO and Organic are important to me, as I eat this type of food back home. So while in Las Vegas, I had to try this place out because it fit the bill. Pulling into the parking lot on a Saturday night - it was confusing. Where do we go in?  Finally seeing the entrance on the side of the building, we knew we were in the right lot.

Walking in, we weren't sure *IF* we were in the strip club side or a restaurant. Realizing after the fact, a wedding had occurred and the wedding party was in the bar part of the restaurant, all dressed up making us feel like street bums.  Being escorted to the back past the DJ and the wedding party, there were a few small tables.  It was still very loud, but we gave it a try.

The food is AMAZING. Very good Habanero salsa, and we had the Al Pastor Street Tacos and Chicken Enchilada. Both had great flavor, good portion sizes and all the salsa you wanted to put on the food as well as eat with the chips. The food really is amazing. That's the reason for the 4 stars. I think next time we'll opt for carry out, and hope it survives the trip back to the hotel.  The only redeeming quality of this entire experience was our server Miguel, and the quality of the food.

But I have to say I have never been seated by a person wearing fish net stockings and lingerie. Hours later, I still can't shake the most bizarre dinner experience I have ever had in my life.  Blaring bad 80's music, drunk wedding party antics, Nascar on the big screen, and women walking around in lingerie? I guess that's why they say what happens in Vegas......
