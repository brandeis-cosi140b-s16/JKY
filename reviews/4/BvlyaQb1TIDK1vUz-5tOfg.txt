Hecho en Vegas is not your traditional Mexican food. It's a bit "kicked up." Some will like it and some will not.

My favorite part is the bar and bartenders. Perhaps I'm bias toward this location because of my old friends behind the bar. I love the tequila flights and Mojito's (raspberry, blueberry and tequila). Is tequila a flavor?

I'll return because I'm a Mojito freak and like the "off the beaten path" location. Yes, yes, and the bartenders.
