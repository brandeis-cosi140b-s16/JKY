Had a beef chimi at robertos a few nights ago, I was really hungry and its a lot of food. It was perfect and filled me up. The prices at robertos are awesome, the food hasn't disappointed me ever! And the service is usually spot on. Only waited a couple minutes, and they let me customize the chimi and sides just the way I wanted it which is huge for me (I don't like lettuce or tomatoes on anything!!!) Quick in and out transaction, food was really good, and its location and price is good for me.
