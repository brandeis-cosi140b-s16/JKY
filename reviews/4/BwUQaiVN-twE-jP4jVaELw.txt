Used to be Casa de Lara years ago to which I was not a fan.   Heard that Casa Del Sol was much better and so I finally got a chance to try them again.   
I ordered take out for three dishes to get an idea of what they were like.   For carry out Mexican food I was quite pleased.  
The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful showing a real concern for getting me my food quickly.   When we got it home it was all that we had hoped for.  Well made, good flavors, acceptable portions.
I would have liked a larger portion on the beans and rice but no big deal.
The food was good but didn't WOW me.  Thus one less star from 5.
I will definitely go back.
