Good food and great service.  Their lunch menu is very reasonably priced with many different combinations.   I have been here many times and have always been greeted with a smile.  The chips and salsa are delicious and the salsa has a kick.  The wife and I enjoy the Fajitas which is an enormous portion.  $2 drafts were the special today and I said yes please!
