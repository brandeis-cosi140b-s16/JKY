Great FRESH authentic Mexican food. Everything is made fresh to order (except the Menudo, which is made every day, and has hominy) so it takes some time, but is so worth it. They could use a "cashier / front of the house" person to greet, ring orders & help out; the cook does it all! Filling every job is a LOT to handle. The food is DELICIOUS.
