After hearing about La Fontera for years I decided to give this place a try today for lunch since I don't work to far from it and it was tolerable to sit outside for a change. 

While I pulled up there was the food truck then a blue tarp with 5 tables under it for shade. I went about 11:45 to beat the lunch hour rush and I'm glad I did. While all tables were full I asked a guy if I could share his table of 4 since it was only him and he was perfectly fine with that. 

The menu wasn't huge but what they had was perfect. Burritos, tacos, tostadas and a few other things. I did notice that nothing was over $4. They had about 6 different main items (meat, chicken, etc...) for anything you ordered. I had the Barbacoa Beef Burrito (beef, beans, rice, cabbage, cheese). When it arrived it was HUGE! it came with a side of limes, peppers and cucumbers (yummy). This thing had to weigh over a pound! Soooo I thought, great it's wrapped in foil so what I don't eat I'll take home for dinner...WRONG! I ate the entire thing! The tortilla was awesome and so fresh too (huge bonus for sure as I love homemade tortillas). 

They have two sauces you can put on anything as well as the bottles are on each table. One is a red sauce in which I didn't try but the green creamy sauce I did and it was awesome! I put it on each bite. Needless to say I won't be even slightly hungry for dinner tonight!!! 

This is one of the best burritos I've had in a very long time so I will for sure be back soon! Especially since it's going to start cooling off her (hopefully....).
