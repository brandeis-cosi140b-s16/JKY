First off, whats not to like?  Everything here is top notch.  The tortillas are freshly made, the service is refreshingly amazing and the food is awesome.  I have been to this cafe rio many a times and it always exceeds my expectations.  thats what it comes down to for me with service.... if you go to a place and they fail to meet your expectations or just barely meet them, you have to find somewhere new... but the freshness of the food and everything that goes into their preparation, you have to keep going back time and time again.  I would trust any cafe rio would do this for you...   proceed feeling assured that you are in good hands.
