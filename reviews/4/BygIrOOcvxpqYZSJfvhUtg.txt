This is a great little place, a pleasant surprise for authentic Mexican food. The portions are huge and the quality of food is amazing. We took one of the other reviews advice and mix the salsa and slaw together. 

We started off with cheese dip that comes in a bowl so if you like cheese dip make sure you order that. The mango frozen margaritas were delicious and I'm a huge fan of the Midori margarita.

We decided to split meals so we had the shredded beef quesadilla the Chicken soup and the shredded chicken chimichanga. This soup you have to try it comes in like a gallon size bowl so there's plenty take-home.

So if you're craving Mexican want a margarita and need enough food to eat the next day come on by won't be disappointed.
