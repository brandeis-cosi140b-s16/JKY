Not a glamourous place, but friendly.  The draw here is the best Mexican food in the Midwest, and a homemade salsa bar that is awesome, as long as you like spicy.  It is also a tremendous value.  And they are kind to vegetarians.  I would go five stars if they had a better margarita and offered a few more appetizers - still hoping someone re-creates Las Caszuelos' cheese dip with poblanos and mushrooms...
