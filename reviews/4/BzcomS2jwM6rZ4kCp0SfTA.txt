If you're planning a trip to Vegas, take note: this place will feed you when you've lost all your money to gambling, overpriced meals and club entry. And they will feed you well. I think we went 3 times during our 5 day stay. Just so darn good. Very authentic. And most importantly for Vegas, dirt cheap.
