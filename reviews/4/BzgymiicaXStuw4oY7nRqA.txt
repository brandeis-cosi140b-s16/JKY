I have been coming here for a while. I get the breakfast combos most of the time. The French toast being my favorite so far. The pancakes are not the best but not the worst. Combo comes with choice of eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, and surprisingly some fresh fruit on the side. The horchata and jamaica waters are not so great. It's not that expensive as well with less that 20 bucks you can eat good for two. I hate the fact that the place is really small and busy every Sunday!
