Carlos is the one man running the show at this location and it's important for you to get to know him -- He is very kind and hooks people up all the time -- TIP HIS ASS! -- The only down side to this place is that their are only 5 stools to sit on -- It's more-so for carry out -- I'd highly suggest getting a carne asada burrito with carne asada, rice, and cheese only inside the burrito -- This place is 10x better than Roberto's and no where near as greasy -- I like to get the TROPICAL TEA from the gas station section it's right beside this place inside LOOK FOR IT
