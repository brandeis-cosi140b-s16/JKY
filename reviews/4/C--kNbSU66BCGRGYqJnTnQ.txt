A good amount of good food for a good price.

The seating is limited to approx 5 big tables which seat 6 each.

I ordered a #11 combination meal which included a hearty amount of beans and rice along with an enchilada and tamale for $5.99. 

Their menu is huge though and contains many distinctive Mexican dishes that I've not heard of but I'm sure are delicious.
