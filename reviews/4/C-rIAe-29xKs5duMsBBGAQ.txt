Stopped here on the way back from a road trip. Enchiladas were very good. Tacos were also excellent. Chips, salsa, rice, and beans were also great. My favorite Mexican dish is a chili reilano. I was anticipating a great one due to the other food. I like them crispy and cheesy and hot. It was soggy and wrapped In a scrambled egg. I wouldn't write the place off because everything else was fantastic. I just wouldn't order that one item. Give it a try.
