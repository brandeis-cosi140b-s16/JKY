YUM!  My boyfriend and I frequented this place when we used to live in Madison.  Their food is probably the most "authentic" Mexican food you'll find in the downtown area.  I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food (it usually makes me sick) but I always enjoyed the things I've tried here.  If you knew me you would know what a credit that is to Casa De Lara's food.

Pros: You get an bottomless basket of tortilla chips and salsa before your meal.  Great margarita deals!

Cons: The verde stuff is so hot it'll burn you mouth and you won't taste the rest of your food.
