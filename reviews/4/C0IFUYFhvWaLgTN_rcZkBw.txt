UPDATE November 2015.

It's been almost a year since my last review, and we actually go to Three Amigos a lot. The service, as referenced below, can be slow ... sometimes. It wasn't us, though - sometimes it's great, sometimes it's a little slow. (The visit referenced below was definitely an anomaly). 

The authentic Mexican tacos are delicious, but the best thing to get is the tortas. Massive, meaty sandwiches with more flavor than I know what to do with. Seriously, the Torta Cubana is a perfect "I just ran a half marathon and mowed the lawn and now I'm hungry" meal. Carne asada beef, thin sliced hot dogs, queso fresco, bacon, lettuce, and probably a bunch of other stuff I'm forgetting are piled between two massive pieces of bread. It's enough for two but you won't want to share. Kid options are typical for a Mexican place. 

And the service, while sometimes slow, is always good. They're quick to address issues and they're great with being flexible with menu requests, and always really, really nice.


(original review follows)
Great food, lousy service. Came on a moderately weeknight. Every step of the meal took a long time - waiting for a server to acknowledge us, waiting for our food, waiting to order dessert, waiting for the bill. Our dinner plates were never cleared, even when dessert arrived. Strangely, it seemed to be our table - four parties came, ordered, ate and left after we ordered and before we left. Service was pleasant and our food was as ordered. It just took a really long time. 

The food was good, and they have a nice variety of taco fillings, including tongue and tripe.
