We went to dinner on a Wednesday prior to a show at the Smith Center. I read a lot of reviews putting down the service. I would rate the service an8/10. Our waiter asked if we were going to the show and we said we were. He told us we had a 10 min window to get our order in so that we would be on time for the show. Our food was very good. I had thr vegetarian quesadilla and my mother-in-law had Chicken enchiladas. I ordered a specialty drink, the one with jalape√±os. It was tasty! I probably would have had another if our waiter came back sooner. The decor is fresh/hip/modern. You get your mix of textiles/fabrics/patters. The lighting is dim. I would most definitely return.
