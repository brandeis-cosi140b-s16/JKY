After reading Candyce & Amy's reviews, I had to check it out. And, all I can say is they were right. The staff was very friendly & the line moved quickly. I ordered the 2 taco special with queso and salsa. I chose chicken tacos & the chicken was grilled to perfection, and they are not skimpy with the servings! The taco shell was heated to perfection and the additions I chose made it great. The chips had a great seasoning and matched perfectly with the salsa and queso. Although I usually do not enjoy fast food Mexican, Salsaritas does not fit in that category. It was much better & I will be back!
