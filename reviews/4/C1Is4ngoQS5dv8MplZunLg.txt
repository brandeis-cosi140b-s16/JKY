Carolina's is a great spot for some delish lunch. It's inexpensive and you get a good sized portion. Their known for their tortillas which are incredible. I usually go for their two hard shell beef tacos that have a nice crunch when you take a bite. I get the combo plate for the addition of rice and beans. I will say I've had that meal both as take-out and dine-in. I highly recommend dining in, it's the kind of food that should be eaten hot and ready.
