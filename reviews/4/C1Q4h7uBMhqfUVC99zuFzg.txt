Yeah back in the day I would have rated a 8. I have been going here since my parents were carring me in the restaurant. It used to be much smaller until they bought the bar next door and expanded. Then they opened another in mesa and now on bell rd. As many people know the bigger the restaurant gets the less it is like the mom n pop joins I LOVE. Also I used to go there many moons ago and eat the WONDERFUL chips and salsa and tuesday or saturday $0.99 margaritsa and walk out with a $5 dollar tab. Now you must order a combo plate or a min of 7or 8 bucks to qualify for the 99cents margarita. I usually stick with the happy hour $3 dollar margarita and chips n salsa.  Dont get me wrong I still eat here. :) Happy eating
