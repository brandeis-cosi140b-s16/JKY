El Norteno was a NICE surprise for me. A neighbor recommended it several times, it had marginal street appeal so I had never bothered to stop in. Their Enchilada Platter won me over and I've been back several times.

Make no mistake, this place looks like a dive...and it is. TASTY Mexican food though, with quick service, reasonable prices, in a convenient location. Their Breakfast Burrito is HUGE, delicious and a bargain at $3.75. Their rice and beans won't disappoint either.

Breakfast, lunch, dinner, or late nite snack, El Norteno gets the job done.
