This place is a small family owned Mexican restaurant common in CA (if you're from there) Maria is such as nice lady and the food is quite good and cheap. I've only had burritos here, but they also serve some soup (menudo, caldo de res), enchiladas, fajitas, and tacos. Even though it's usually one or two people behind the counter/kitchen, it's fairly fast service. The food is what you would expect from a Mexican mom n pop place. Nothing to fancy, but just the right ingredients wrapped up in a huge flour tortilla. I especially like their breakfast burritos. 

4 star for quality and price.
