A girl friend & I went to this place based on the rave reviews of a coworker. When we parked we thought about maybe reconsidering our decision because it didn't look quite that appealing. 

Thank goodness we stayed! As soon as we walked in the yummy smell hit us. The place is simple, nothing fancy, but the food is good (we shared a sampler, which filled us both to the brim), reasonably priced & the Cadillac Margaritas are STRONG. The waitress was very nice & didn't rush us when it was closing time,,,,, it took us a while to finish those Margaritas, lol. If you have more than 1 I have 2 words for you. Designated Driver :)

Great place to come for a casual dinner or lunch with coworkers or friends. Not a place to take a date if you're trying to impress them :) 
It's in a strip mall with limited parking, on some days I've heard you have to be there early to get a parking space & a table. We went late on a Friday night & had no issue with either though.
