Good food, good service, nice environment. Ok so I tried this place after reading the positive reviews and I must agree the outside parking lot is a bit crappy, but once you're in you'll soon forget about it. It has a nice traditional Mexican feel to it. The margarita's are tasty and the food is pretty good!

I went there with my family and we ordered the Plato de Carne( mixed meats) which was ok if you mix all the sauteed veggies with the meat because with out it the meat is pretty dry with little flavor. Although I must say if I was to order again I would get the chicken because it was very moist and flavorful. We also had the Shrimp plate, it was very good! I really enjoyed the grilled pineapples that accompany the shrimp. We did like that the plates come with lettuce, tom. s/c and guac. The salsa's are ok, I was excited to try the green that people raved about but was disappointed upon tasting it. The green sauce was very, very sweet with little- no hint of spice and the red wasn't much of an improvement.I did ask for something with a little more spice and the server brought out another but I think it was the same red? We ordered the bean dip and really enjoyed it (finger licking good) chips are very tasty and fresh.I would most definitely return and would not hesitate to bring others along to enjoy this great find!
