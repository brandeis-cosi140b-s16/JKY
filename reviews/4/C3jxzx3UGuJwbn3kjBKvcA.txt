This is one of my favorite places... My go too Mexican lunch spot!!   I prefer it over chipotle because they offer acquisition sauce option and I am a sucker for question!!   On a side not they now offer 3 flavors of quest... All 3 are good, but original is still my favorite!!   The craft 2 lunch menu is a good value... A smaller portions of 2 items for $6.49.  Make sure to try the Mexican Gumbo at some point... My second favorite item after the chicken quest buritto!!
