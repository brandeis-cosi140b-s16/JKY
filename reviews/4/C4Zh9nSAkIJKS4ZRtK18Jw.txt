Going through the mail: junk...junk...ju- whooaa - grilled stuffed bacon guac and chicken mushroom quesadillas... in high def images that make the mouth water so hard that even the worst marihuana cigarette-induced dry mouth is no match.

So yeah I went. This is a great spot for some fast food since they have healthy and fresh options like chicken and rice, guacamole, salsa, etc.. And yes I tried all three stuffed dillas and they are great...

Fuck there goes my mouth again
