This is the Chipotle in the Tempe Marketplace shopping center so I come here  occasionally when I am trying to get some shopping done on my lunch break. Weird thing is that if you get here at 11:30am (they open at 11) it is totally calm but between the hours of noon and 2pm the place is jam packed. They keep it well staffed though so you can still get in and out quickly. Or if you want to stay awhile they have a nice little patio area. Watch out for the birds, they can get pretty aggressive and apparently really love burritos.

fyi - they are on the Northeast area of the shopping plaza near Bar Louie. Come in the Smith Road entrance from Rio Salado then head straight back and make a right towards Harkins and you'll see it.
