What a great meal!  We were visiting from out of town and wanted to grab a good tasty mexican dinner.  We went here on recommendations from yelp and chowhound, and were delighted with the food!  The atmosphere was festive and lively, the margaritas were delicious (!), and our food was wonderful.  Highly recommended.
