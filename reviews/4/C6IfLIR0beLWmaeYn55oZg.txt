I love Del Taco for fast food when I have the right craving. I usually come to this location if I have a class to teach. I highly recommend the Tacos Carbon (chicken) mm tasty. This location is not the easiest to get in and out of. I recommend getting out at Shadow Ln and waiting for the light as opposed to trying your luck with traffic.
