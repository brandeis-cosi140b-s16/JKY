One of my friends was craving tacos, so we stopped by here for dinner. The chips and salsa were good, even better since there were two types of salsa that came with them. Loved their fajitas. This is the only place I've been to (so far) where they asked how I wanted my steak cooked for them. Medium steak on fajitas never tasted so darn good.
