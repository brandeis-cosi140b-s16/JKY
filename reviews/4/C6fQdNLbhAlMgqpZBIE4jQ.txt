Food is amazing. Not like your Mexican grandma amazing but 5 star chef amazing. Ambiance is upscale and pleasant. I didn't expect it to be this fancy. Dress is casual and staff is super friendly. Prices are  reasonable for the amount of thought and work that goes in to the food. We thought the bill would come out to be twice as much which I would have felt to be worth. Try their appetizers. Only place I've seen serve real Oaxaca cheese which is extremely yummy even if your not a cheese fan.  Will definitely come again.
