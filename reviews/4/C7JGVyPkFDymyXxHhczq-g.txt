One of my favorite type of places...a tourist trap! 

We eschewed spring training baseball in favor of visiting Tortilla Flat and chewing on some pretty good food at the Tortilla Flat Superstition Saloon. Our waitress, Mitzy, heartily recommended the Venom, a poisonous combination of excellent beef and unearthly hot chili.  She put it on the chili aficionado's hot scale of 7-8 out of 10. Good call, Mitz! The amber house beer, also with Venom as part of its title, was a bit thin but not too bad for a house beer, sort of like a Michalob brown/amber. Anyhow, it went well with the chiliburger.

Of course, part of the Superstition ambiance is the huge collection of dollar bills that covers the walls and ceiling. According to my wife, the women's restroom also had its own personality with head cutouts on the doors. To take full advantage of this novelty, you'd have to find someone willing to forgo the real reason for entering the restroom so your picture could be taken. 

The restaurant seating is tightly orchestrated. Unfortunately, a loutish foursome from "cheesehead" country tried to outshout each other about the perceived shortcomings of the food and service. Lunch over, we ambled past the few businesses of Tortilla Flat. The bellicose Wisconsin gentleman found another couple from his home state and they did some sort of bucolic ritual that involved calling each other a cheesehead and bumping elbows. 

Don't you just love tourist traps!
