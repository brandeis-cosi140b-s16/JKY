The beans and rice here are like crack. So addicting, so amazing. I'm actually pretty curious what they put it in, but it's probably best not to know.

I always get the same thing, a burro with beans, rice and potatoes. It's not on the menu, but it's always really tasty and lasts for two meals.

I've also tried the cheese enchiladas, which are really good as well, but a little rich and oily for my taste.

This is always on my must-eat list whenever I'm in AZ!
