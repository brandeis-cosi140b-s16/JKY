The best combination of good Mexican food and reasonable prices that I've experienced in Pittsburgh so far.

At 3:30/4:00ish, there was a handful of people in the restaurant.  Staff were friendly and efficient.  I ordered the chiles poblanos ($9.50).  My dining companions ordered El Combo ($12.50) and the Burritos Deluxe ($9.95).  The chiles poblanos came out steaming hot (actually too hot to eat), along with rice and beans.  Instead of red enchilada sauce on top, they had sour cream, which was interesting.  The cheese wasn't quite as melty as I like it, but they were still some of the best chiles rellenos I've had in Pittsburgh.  (Cuzamil's are good, but they're also $14.50 for 2.)  El Combo was so big that half of it got boxed.  There was a taco, a chile relleno, a tostada, two enchiladas, and rice and beans.  The burritos deluxe were fork-and-knife affairs, since they came out covered in enchilada sauce, lettuce, tomato, and sour cream.

They sort of nickel-and-dime you for some things -only the first basket of chips & salsa is free, you only get 3 refills on sodas (but their glasses are huge), that type of thing.  However, there have been $5 off $25 and $10 off $50 coupons in the last two Clipper magazines, and when I was Googling the address I came across a printable coupon.  Supposedly they have happy hour from 4-6.  They have a full bar, a good selection of Mexican and domestic beers, and two big TVs.

Not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it's good for Pittsburgh, and - more importantly - it's affordable.  I would definitely recommend coming here.
