Dropped in for a late lunch on Sunday.  I was encouraged by the fact that they had so many customers on an off hour. They've done a fantastic job with redoing the place.  The staff was very friendly and they seem to have regulars already. My husband and I had the burger, add jalapenos and split fries. The burger was great. The ingredients were fresh and delicious. The burger did remind me of in and out, which I'm fine with. I didn't like the fries but I'm weird about fries and don't like most. I really hope they make it, that location seems to have a quick turn over rate. I will definitely be back and I love they have a drive-thru.
