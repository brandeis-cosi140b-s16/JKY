Was walking around fremont and decided to pop into this place. Very nice decor and interesting concept. Shared a couple of dishes: Latin brisket, Cobb salad, and the crispy chicken torta. All three were delicious. The salad was just your normal cobb but was very good and a large portion. Brisket tasted great. Had the charred black beans and mexican rice as sides and everything was seasoned perfectly. By far the best was the chicken torta. Absolutely delicious. Prices were very reasonable.  Will definitely return.
