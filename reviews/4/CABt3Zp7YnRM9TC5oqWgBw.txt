Went for lunch today and this place was slammed! The line to order was almost out the door. What a great sign to see coming to a restaurant for your first time. I ended up ordering the the Pork Barbacoa Burritto Enchilda style w/ guacomole. It was GIGANTIC!  The taste of my burrito was amazing sweet smokey and spicy! I will definitely be back to try some other dishs here.
