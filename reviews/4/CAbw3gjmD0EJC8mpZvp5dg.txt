This place is a hidden gem. I used to work near the other location (near Metro Center) and ate there all the time. I was delighted to find another location closer to where I'm working now. Great place for lunch or take-away after work. The chips and salsa are possibly the best anywhere. The salsa is clearly fresh-made and it ROCKS. 

I swear they don't make anything until you order it. My favorite is the fajita burrito with chicken. The veggies are fresh-grilled and always have just the right texture, and the chicken is perfectly prepared as well. I have NEVER seen them put a styrofoam container in the microwave (as one poster stated) and can't imagine why they would (or would need to). 

This is not a fancy place. The atmosphere is just adequate. Go to Chili's for that. If it's really good food you're after, you won't be disappointed!
