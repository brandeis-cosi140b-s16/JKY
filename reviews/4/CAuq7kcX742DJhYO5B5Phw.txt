Not exactly cheap food, but for the most part you'll get what you pay for.
Pretty awesome 'Surf and Turf' burrito with a ton of shrimp and carne asada with guacamole and a few bonus french fries in the burrito for that trademark SoCal texture. This burrito is so big it can sit up on one end on its own, like a fat cat. Delicious. All the lunch money at $14, but delicious nonetheless!

The star of the Desnudo salsa show is the homemade habanero salsa, not too hot and refreshingly flavorful, we easily used 1/3 of the bottle on our food. Don't let the orange appearance scare you from trying it - it's really not that hot. The ceviche looked fantastic - the dudes next to us got it - big portion, too.

Diet Coke, one burrito, two tacos = $25 + tip and you're looking at a $30 meal. If it were half that I'd probably want to eat here at least once a week. But it's not, and unfortunately this neighborhood SUCKS (Arville between Sahara and Desert Inn) - I have to admit that part of me was wondering if the wheels on our Jeep would still be there after our meal was done. Kids in this neighborhood have no problem throwing landscaping rocks at moving cars (yes, this has happened to us) and their parents will defend them. You've been warned!

Desnudo's front doors were propped wide open, and as a result there were more than a few house flies divebombing our food plates. Swatting at flies during your restaurant meal is not that awesome. Maybe if the rock-throwing kids wouldn't litter on Arville so much there wouldn't be such swarms of flies?

I digress. Desnudo is definitely worth a try. You may fall in love with some of the recipes here. The environs will make you feel like you're off the beaten path.
