If you love Mexican food and will go anywhere for the authentic stuff, this is the place.
Pay no attention to the storefront, it seems to be clean and Sunday mornings, it is crowded. Yaaa but the food!
Seafood cocktails that are filled with shrimp or oysters or really fresh ceviche ( my favorite).Special plates with lobster tails, rice, salad. 
And wait until you try the soups.The 7 Seas is loaded with every kind of fish.Whole fish veracruz style is heavenly.The Paquette Carne Asada is excellent. All this along with the standard burritos, tacos and enchiladas. It is all fresh. They have many types of imported beer.
This is a real winner and the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 was the outside appearance.  But the food is definitely a 5.
