My family and I went last week. The way I like to rate Mexican places is by their chips and salsa. If they have good salsa, normally their food is good. If their salsa is full of flavor, their food will also contain flavor. Tis place had good salsa that was spicy. So, I ordered the chicken fajitas and they were in almost a tomato sauce. Not a lot, just a little. First reaction was huh? But then I tried it. Oh my they were very yummy! I darn near licked my plate when I was done. The only complaint I would have was the rice. Not sure if it was yesterday's or just undercooked. But..... Everything else was very good. The place is small, so be prepared, probably only 15 tables.
