This taqueria has so many home cooked touches.  The guacamole was quickly made to order.  The shredded pork in the tacos was slow cooked and tender.  The salsas were deep in flavor and contained fresh cilantro and chiles.  The pastor and chorizo were clearly house-made and richly prepared.

The ambiance is like so many of these great Mexican places.  Clearly not the comfort that you expect from more expensive restaurants.  It's the decor of a sandwich shop but the cuisine of great heights.
