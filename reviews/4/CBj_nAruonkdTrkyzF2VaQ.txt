In my experience with Mexican restaurants, you can never find that perfect place.  One place might have the best chips & salsa, as other places have better margaritas, while another place might have the best fish tacos. 

 With that being said, Leticia's definitely has the best Carnitas in Vegas.  Overall, I think their food is excellent.  They have some of the most tender, flavorful Carnitas I have ever eaten.  I've also had their Carne Asada burrito and the Milanesa; both where the steak was also tender and flavorful, and not tough and chewy.  I've had better chips & salsa at other places, but I can't complain when it's free (part of the meal).  Of the numerous visits, I've only had one visit with slow service, and our food took 30 minutes to come out from the time we ordered.  All other visits, the service was great and the food came out fast.  Prices are decent for lunch specials, but I haven't eaten dinner there yet.
I haven't been disappointed with the food there yet, and I would recommend this place to anyone.  It is located way up in the Northern part of Vegas, so it's not conveniently located (unless you live up there).  But if you love Carnitas, then you have to check out Leticia's.
