I felt like I was standing by my old bus stop in Nayarit eating my favorite "street chicken".  The chicken was delicious- and the tortillas were great. The beans were good, although a touch too salty. I thought the salsa was a complete miss. No flavor. Maybe it was an off day. The marinade is what makes this place worth going back for, even if they make me stop at the ATM first !
