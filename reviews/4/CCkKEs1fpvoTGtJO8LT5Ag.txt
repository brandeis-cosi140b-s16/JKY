I came here on a Monday night at the recommendation of the Patio edition of the Yelp newsletter. When I walked in, I felt like I was walking into one of those old-time, dusty, quiet bars in the southwest, which isn't a bad thing. It was dark and had a dive-bar vibe, but a bit cleaner. We went straight out to the patio in the back and I was very pleased with the bright Mexican decor, lights and decorative high top tables. We took a seat, ordered an array of margaritas and beers and stayed for a few hours. The drink prices are decent for what you get, they had half price tacos, and great chips and salsa. It definitely doesn't break the bank! My favorite drink of the night was the El Rey margarita which has some chile de arbol in it, which gave it a spicy kick. I also had the La Chiquita Sarita which was a strawberry margarita on the rocks with muddled lime, but way more unique than it sounds. It was a close second to the El Rey for me. Try the Micheladas for a beer/margarita hybrid beverage. The only thing that bumped a star down for me was the service. It was a little haphazard, but still overall attentive.
