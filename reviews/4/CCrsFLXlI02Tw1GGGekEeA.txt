I normally don't do reviews for fast food chains, but I think El Pollo Loco will be one of the exceptions. So I have been impressed with the remodel of this location, which can be best explained as traditional Mexican flair while being modern at the same time. I believe all the older locations will look like this too. I also like the new menu options, they are definitely adding that Tex-Mex attitude. Giving it that fresh taste similar to Chipotle. A good thing is the prices are still affordable and you can order a decent size meal for $5. Did corporate leadership hire a hip up to date marketing consultant to re-vamp their image? Something is definitely going on and I must say it is not just 1 step in the right direction but probably 2? And this is coming from someone with a business degree!
