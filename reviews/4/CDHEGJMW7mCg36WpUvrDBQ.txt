The service here was exceptional and everyone was very friendly. The cook came around and asked how everyone liked their meal. They also pride themselves in cooking your meal. This is one of the better Mexican places to eat at. Finally. I got the enchiladas and fries. My husband got a burrito and my daughter shared with us. We will definitely be back.
