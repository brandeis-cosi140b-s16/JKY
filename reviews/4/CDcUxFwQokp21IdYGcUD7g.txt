This was my first visit but friends said the menu has changed. There are other items I will try when I return to Charlotte. We ordered a margarita pitcher with house tequila. I had the calamari. The serving was generous enough to share as an appetizer but it was my meal. It was much better than expected; hot with heat and spice. One of my friends had the fish taco that he also enjoyed. I can't recall the 3rd dish but there were no complaints until it got close to closing (11p).  We arrived at 10p. The lights come up, the music stops which is acceptable.  the server damn near wiped the table down while we are still seated and nibbling on our well prepared dishes. He started pulling plates and glasses sometimes without asking if we were finished. We didn't appreciate that. We weren't lingering and we were not the only table still seated at 11p. If the staff is not prepared to seat a party at 10p for dinner and drinks they should have bar only seating for drinks and/or appetizers only.
