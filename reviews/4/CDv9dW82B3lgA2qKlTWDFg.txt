I come here for their breakfast burritos. I find them very tasty and reasonably priced. In my opinion, a great way to start the day. 

The older lady at the counter is always really friendly and always has a smile. 

Haven't really had much of their lunch / dinner menu. The first time I came here, I had lunch, a taco plate I believe. Nothing special and seemed expensive.

It's the breakfast burritos and the friendly people that bring me back every time!
