Saw this restaurant on "Check Please" and we had to try it. We ordered the # 5 & #6. Both were good. I didn't notice that the #6 didn't come with beans. I had to help my wife with her # 5 that has beans.  Next time I will get the #6 again (yes, I liked it that much) and order a side of beans. Guess you have figured out that I liked the beans. My #6 had a Clare Burro. This was a first for both of us and it was the first item that was eaten. Most likely I would order the same again. 
Next time I will ask about the daily special. I could have gotten the Clare Burro for less by ordering the Monday Special.
Service was fast, chips & salsa is mild and stewed. My wife commented that this is the first time she was able to enjoy the salsa. meaning that it isn't very spicy. 
I like this place. It isn't overly "draped out", the food doesn't make you break out in a sweat or  take the top of your head off. The people are friendly and actually concerned that you like the food. Yes we will be returning.
Oh by the way, FREE PARKING at 3rd & Mill, even though the lot says to pay. YOU DO NOT NEED VALIDATION. Restaurant customers park free .
