Food is excellent, environment is fun and friendly, and the service is great. Our cups were always full and numerous members of the wait and management staff stopped to make sure everything was to our liking. The chips, salsa, and bean dip were a nice touch while we waited for our food. The food came out quickly and was just as described on the menu. The only reason I didn't mark five stars is because I think the portions were a bit small for the price.
