The $7 lunch specials get 5 stars.....  all you can eat chips/salsa paired with about 6-ish entrees..... quesadillas, burgers, salads, etc.  All really good.  The Mexican chopped salad with chicken is by far my favorite.

Dinner entrees are all solid - I've tried just about everything over the years.  A tad expensive compared to market rates, perhaps.  4 stars.  

As busy as they are, service is efficient and warm.  Lunch or dinner.  5 stars.

I don't recall the day of week, but there is one particular day when they have margarita specials - very reasonably priced.  Even their basic house margarita was fantastic.  5 stars.

The parking is a joke and receives 1 star.  I give them credit for recently trying to offer valet service to improve the situation, but the lot is just too small and not laid out well.  Period.  One day I observed the valet turning people away because the lot was full.  Another day, they had cars (all running but no one in them) lined up two by two all the way out to the sidewalk preventing other cars from entering the lot.  I'm not sure what can be done, and, again, I give them credit for trying something, but it's just not good enough.

If you can walk here or if you can come during off hours, you'll have a fantastic experience.  Drive up when they are busy - you may struggle.
