VERY COOL RESTAURANT!!!!
Ceviche wasn't really what I expected, but it was very tasty and turned out to be a great appetizer. 
Also tried a few specialties, the huge combo platter with every piece of seafood on it. They are very generous in the amount of seafood given! As for the crab legs, you know you're in the Midwest so nothing much to complain about. The flavor of the crab legs is very good. Also tried the pasta. It was sour and spicy, but very refreshing.
My favorite was the seafood cocktail. The staff recommended us to try hot cocktail instead of cold. It was like a warm bowl of soup with TONS of seafood in it! Very interesting.
