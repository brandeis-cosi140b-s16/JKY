Hubby and I checked out Asado for brunch on Sunday afternoon.  Weather was perfect to enjoy their comfy patio seating and wait staff was excellent.  What's not to love about $5 create your own bloody marys and GRANDE mimosas???  Thankfully the food itself was great too and extremely reasonable. I had the carne asado omelet with the green chili biscuit on the side (the biscuit itself is worth going back for, nothing less than amazing).  Hubby had habanero benedict which he raved over.  Both were $9.  I was expecting very small portions or sub-par food for the prices, but didn't get either and was very pleasantely surprised.

The restaurant is spacious with a decent size bar with lots of tvs for watching sports.

Very excited to finally have some good food up in the Tatum/Dynamite area.  Long overdue!  And definitely looking forward to bringing some friends to Asado for brunch next time.
