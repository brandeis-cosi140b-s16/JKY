Yay! I'm a fan.

This place is quickly turning into my back-up plan if I forget to pack a lunch.  If I'm not feeling for anything in particular, I'd probably hit this place up.  And that doesn't count the times when I just plain hanker for Chipotle's.

I can't, and will not, call this place Mexican, but man do they know how to use Mexican flare.  I'm also not a fan of chain/franchise restaurants, but somehow I'm okay with this place.  Two aspects that usually make me run away are overwhelmed by the fact that they know how to make one tastey, healthy meal.  I see nothing but quality ingredients before me, and I couldn't be happier to taste them not minutes later.

Key is to avoid the lunch rush if at all possible, but even so, there's outdoor seating.  If you're not in the mood for meat, note that their awesome guacamole is free in vegetarian burritos.  If you're in the mood for many meats, why not get a taco for each of them.  If you're in the mood to watch your carbs/calories, just get the burrito bowl.  Fast food done right for once.
