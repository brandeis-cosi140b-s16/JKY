Ok I'm old. But this place is dark. So dark you can't read the menu. So I pull out my phone and use it as a light. We started off with the potstickers. They were a bit burnt so they started off on the wrong foot.  I ordered the filet salad. I enjoyed it. Couldn't see when I had eaten the good stuff so that was a negative. My husband had the green chile cheeseburger. He enjoyed it. We'll go back. During the day. They have windows so we'll be able to see!! We'd like to sit outside too. It looks nice to sit around the moat. ;-)
