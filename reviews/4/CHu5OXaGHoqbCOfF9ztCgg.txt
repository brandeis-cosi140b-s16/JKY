I was in the area on my way to the convention center when I stopped in for some lunch.  Place is only a half a block from the convention center so location was awesome! I know the place seems to be geared for Mexican cuisine, but their menu was a little all over the place.  They have sandwiches, Mexican food, and Mediterranean food.  I went with a grilled cheese sandwich, why not.  It was a huge grilled cheese on sour dough bread nice and buttery with a huge side of seasoned fries. It was soo good! I asked for a side of ranch and it was yummy!  I don't eat downtown to much but if I go to another convention I'll sure stop in for another grilled cheese.
