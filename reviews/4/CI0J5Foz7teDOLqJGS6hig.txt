I love this place!  Authentic mexican food at inexpensive prices.  Friendly and attentive staff.  The cleanest Filiberto's I have seen.  I visit at least once a week during the lunch hour.  The Chile Rellenos are awesome, lightly battered, lots of spicy sauce... just simply delicious.  Taco Tuesdays (99 cent tacos) are a great bargain.  Complimentary salsa bar with multiple hot sauce type salsas, sliced cucumbers, and a fantastic spicy carrot/onion/jalapeno/chile salad... all free.  My only complaint is the salsa bar, soda fountains and cashier area, which are all located up front, can get very congested... I wish they could rearrange that somehow.  Oh, plus it would be nice to offer a chunky (pico de gallo) type salsa on the salsa bar, similar to Baja Fresh.  Check out the website for coupons - great deals!  You also will receive a bright orange (can't miss it) set of coupons with each purchase, to use on your next visit.  I'm a fan!
