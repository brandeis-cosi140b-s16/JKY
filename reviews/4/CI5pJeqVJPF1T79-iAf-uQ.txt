One of the comments said its similar to Subway. Pick your platform (3 tacos, burrito, or quesadilla) and choose your meat. After that you add your condiments. They are quick and most people are in and out. It isn't like a traditional restaurant with waiters etc. The goal is for you to get your food and be out as quickly as possible. There are waves of people that come and go, it's that fast. We came during the evening, but I imagine this place is packed during lunch. 

I had three steak tacos. Prices were good, food was good, and it was super fast. I'll come back to eat here again.
