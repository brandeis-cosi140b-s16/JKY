LOVE THIS PLACE! I continually order the same thing, but I tell myself I will one day try something else :-). I do not agree with another reviewer who said that their steak quality is not good, I actually think it's QUITE good for the price and expectations you would have for this type of restaurant. Quality service.

I've been there MANY TIMES and WILL RETURN!
