Lots of TV's, great variety of food and pretty much anything you could ask for in a full bar. Great location, close to lite rail in Tempe. I went twice on this trip and each time every bartender that interacted with us was very pleasant. Chips and salsa were just okay, but the tacos were pretty dang good, and the dessert cookie ice cream thing was ridiculously great. One complaint, they allow people to smoke in the "outdoor" patio area which has a sliding garage door separating from inside, so basically they're smoking inside and you can smell it.
