It's safe to say that I love Filibertos. But all Filibertos are not all the same, and this location is superior than most. Why? Well, for one- you can actually park and eat your food inside without questioning how long ago things were cleaned or if you will get sick from the warm salsa bar. This location also has employees that will tell you your total before you get to the window, instead of having you sit there in awkward silence and assume they are done helping you.
