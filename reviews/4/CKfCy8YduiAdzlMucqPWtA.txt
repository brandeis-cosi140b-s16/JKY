Very good place to me anyway. Very authentic Mexican dishes offered plus the usual expected type items on the menu and presented very nicely, brightly colored room, very clean with fast service and super, super friendly staff that are sincerely glad you came. Very much worth trying if you really love Mexican food and fantastic Margaritas.
