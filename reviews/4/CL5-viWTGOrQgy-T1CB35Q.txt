OH MY GOSH!!  Not only was this the cheapest place I had ate at in Vegas, but also by far THE BEST fusion I have ever tried before.

The only thing is... don't count on eatting the food to-go or "later" you have to eat it fresh.... Portions are big so order accordingly...

Free Appetizer- fresh tortilla chips and "guacamole and salsa" 5.0!! YUMM
Super fries like-- 3.5 ( lack of sauce) but still yummy
Torta- 4.5 needs more sauce guac. or salsa would make it a ++++++
burrito- 5.0 my goodness too good!!!!

Hole in the wall, worth the drive out of the strip.  A must tryyyyyy!!!
