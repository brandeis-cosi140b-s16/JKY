Food is great!  Decor is eclectic and a little more upscale.  The salad has mixed greens rather than iceberg lettuce.  Portion sizes are good.  The chips and salsa taste fresh and the bean dip they serve with it is so yummy!  If I go by myself, the service can be spotty.  I like to eat out alone and I feel like I'm sort of a last priority at times, especially when it's busy.  When I'm with other people, the service seems much better.  They offer military discounts, which is a nice bonus!  :-)
