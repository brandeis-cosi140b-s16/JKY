Staff was very friendly.  Place is very clean inside and nice selection of salsas, limes, chopped onions w/ cilantro, marinated jalapeno peppers.  Ordered the 3 street tacos platter, two steak and one chicken taco, chips and beans.  Chips were very tasty, steak was nice and moist, more so than the chicken.  Nice bite size tacos.  Also got a Rice and bean burrito was was a nice size and cheap.  Left spending less than $12 for tasty lunch for two. Will be back.  For the price, place was fast, tasty, and accommodated custom orders.
