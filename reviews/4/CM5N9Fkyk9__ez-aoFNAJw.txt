The girlfriend and I stopped in for Taco Tuesday today, I got 2 large shredded beef tacos that were quite filling and very tasty. She also had two tacos and with a drink our total was around $10. Prices are competitive with fast food but the quality is much better. 
Service was rushed, but polite- as is to be expected during the lunch rush. You order in a line to expedite wait times, while you get a plain view of a remarkably clean kitchen (again, during the lunch rush) and your food is prepared in front of you. 
Bathrooms were equally clean, and despite not seeing any bussers the tables were all in good shape. 
My only complaint is that my tortillas were undercooked, for a place boasting homemade tortillas this was very disappointing. Nevertheless I will most certainly be back.
