Often forgotten, even as a neighbor (only because of the speak-easy lack of signage) but always a great place.  Little known fact: Dick's serves breakfast every day starting at 7am and their breakfast meals are amazing!  Go in for dinner and get there early, because this joint is small and space is limited.
