WOW!  If you can't have mama's cookin', you need to try this place!  

After a recommendation from local family, we went there for a quick morning bite.  A breakfast burrito happily made to order, friendly staff and a small, clean, dining room that sits about 25 ... the tummy filler was hot and tasty with their homemade salsa.  There's a "salad bar" of salsas and other goodies in the center of the small room so you can customize your dish.   My family's faves are their tacos of course, nachos, carne asada burritos and albondigas soup.  I asked if TACOS was family owned/operated, of course it was.  

This place is situated just South of the newly developed Maricopa commercial area.  If you blink, as you drive over some railroad tracks (from the North), you WILL miss it.  It's not because it's in a cluttered cookie-cutter modernesque outdoor mall that is now  prevalent in AZ, it simply is situated in, well, "quaint" looking AZ.. A hole-in-the-wall looking place with incredible food, TACOS N' MORE is on our Maricopa "TO-DO" list.
