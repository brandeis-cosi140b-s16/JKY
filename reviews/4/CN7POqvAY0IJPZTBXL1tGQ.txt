This restaurant has an interesting location but don't let that deter you from giving it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the set-up and decor was as I was prepared for a dive.  It was clean with a good size bar and comfortable booth seating.  There were many options for drinks and food but it wasn't overwhelming.  I was very happy to see vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free items were clearly identified as I recently started following a gluten free diet.  Everyone in my party ordered tacos and we were not disappointed!  Tacos come with a side of rice and black or refried beans.  I got the carne asada.  The meat was tender and seasoning was very tasty.  I didn't mind not having Spanish rice at all because the white cilantro rice was so good along with the black beans.  My only complaint was the temperature of my food was not hot.  I almost sent it back but was starving and tired so I happily ate away.  Didn't have any alcoholic drinks but my sisters did and they both liked theirs.  I'd definitely go back!  If you go, don't forget to check-in on Yelp for your free flan.  It was flantastic.
