This place is great! I've been here twice, with slightly conflicting results. First time was superfab, the second time was pretty good. I think the difference was lunch & dinner? Maybe?

First time was with a friend from my workplace during lunch. She got the taco salad, I got the grilled veggie wet burrito. fjadklfjafa;sl. The sauces on that burrito. Dayum. Halley also couldn't stop talking about her taco salad and how good it was, except when she was eating it. Then I had the most heavenly experience when I got their Mexican cruller, or basically kind of a smashed churro, fried & with sugar & cinnamon. I wanted like, 10 of these.

We had a great time talking to the two owners. So much so that my friend asked about catering for her wedding! (they can do it!!)

So the next time I went was with my husband Derek. We went pretty late, and instead of the two owners there it was one of the owners and two new-looking guys who seemed a little lost. Derek liked his 3 tacos well-enough, but said the meat was pretty dry (while Halley said the meat melted in her mouth). I got a grilled veggie taco salad. The grilled veggies were amazeballs and overall it was pretty good. We were both really disappointed by the chips & guac -- stale chips, and then two small plastic cups of guac ... one of which was basically a jalapeno puree, and not what I wanted at all.

Hoping the third time comes back to SUPERFAB.

Lastly, one of the biggest things keeping me from 5 stars ... everything is disposable: paper plates, plastic cups for water and for sides, paper plates, aluminum containers, etc. Not impressed. (NOTE: Jaime, one of the really nice owners, contacted me and said that at the moment, they're using disposable gear at night due to the drunk campus atmosphere. The late night crowd is a bit different than the lunch crowd. Makes sense, so drunk people: save your planet and stop taking stuff!)
