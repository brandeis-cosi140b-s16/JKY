I looooveee this place! The tortas are the bomb.com!!!

BUT...I usually order the quesadilla de maiz...no meat just enjoy the homemade masa and mexican cheese :D

The salsas are sooo good! I mean authentic...tastes like they've got an abuelita back there roasting the chiles and what not! lol

My boo gets the huarache....again, no meat. keeping things simple is sometimes better than all that fancy shmancy ingredients.
