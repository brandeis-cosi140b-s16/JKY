Don't be put off by the appearance of this strip mall eatery. Feels authentic as you walk through the door. We usually have to ask them to turn down one of the two conflicting jukeboxes (isn't irritation by music universal?). Which they always do with a smile. Unfortunately, they were out of margharitas the last time we visited so we enjoyed coca colas from glass bottles which come from Mexico! I am vegan and they usually are pretty helpful with custom making dishes for me. And they don't hesitate to remake a dish if the chef accidentally throws some cheese on there. It's habit I'm sure. Fairly inexpensive and very tasty!
