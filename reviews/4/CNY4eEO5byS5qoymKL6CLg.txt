we ate dinner there last night no problem with the food was great and awesome as it always is, great job chiefs. Service though was not very good, our waitress seemed to know the menu pretty well, but her listening skills need a lot of work. I had the mini combo and I asked for all beans and no rice, well I got both. I also ask for more ice tea 3 times and received no refills. AS far as the chips and salsa we got one helping and in the bottom of the bowl was nothing but oil. No refills on that either. So from now on I am going to have to ask to sit in any other section except hers. We eat here a lot and service has never been an issue. This all happened on 8/13/2014.
