Not really busy ever. But they got karaoke, fun bartenders, and its a cool environment. They got $1 PBR's which is cool cuz anywhere else beer is 3.5-5 a beer. We had stopped in once and then the next day the bartender let us in like we were regulars.. Thats what made me really like this place. PLUS BEER PONG!!!
