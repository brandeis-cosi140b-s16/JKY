I was a little uneasy coming here just based on the area around however I quickly found that for real authentic mexican food, not a whole lot can compare.

What I love about this place is that it is true mexican food.  Places like Macayos and Garcias may be good but they try to slop so much chile and baja sauce on everything that it really loses out on the real flavor.   However, Delosantos is delicious.

I always get the Via Chalupas which is some sort of marinated beef (carne asada) soft tacos.  They are massive and comes with 3 per order with rice and beans.  They are mouthwatering.  I never have to add salsa or sour cream to them and have never been disappointed with those.

Most of my family loves to get some form of the tacos, enchiladas, and tostadas.  Just depends on what they want mroe of that night I guess.  And the cheese crisps may be simple but they are cooked great everytime.

I don't drink however others in my family will dine on pitchers of margaritas there and they absolutely love them.  I myself hate tequila so no thanks but to each their own. 

The chips and salsa are staples but the hotter of the 2 salsas has the best flavor in my opinion.  The regular has too much cilantro in it for my liking and I could do without it.  

I had tried the chimichanga initially going there and it ws good but nothing too special.  But overall this place has solid mexican food, a friendly staff, and although it might be small and you may have a few minutes to wait, it is well worth it.  

I'm giving it 3.5 stars because I haven't tried the entire menu and I am very particular when it comes to Mexican food.  But from what I have tried, well done!
