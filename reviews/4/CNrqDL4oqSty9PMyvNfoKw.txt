The workers here are super customer-friendly. I only go through the drive thru but they always sound like they are smiling through the talk box, and even when you go up to the window they don't look like they hate their job like so many other fast food workers. It's refreshing. 

As for the food, it is always prepared well here, too! Never sloppy and always tastes fresh. 

It's never too crowded whenever I go either, which is nice. 

I'm just not a great fan of the location. I'm not too comfortable leaving my car by myself in this area but it's the closest Taco Bell to my home.. hence why I always use the drive thru
