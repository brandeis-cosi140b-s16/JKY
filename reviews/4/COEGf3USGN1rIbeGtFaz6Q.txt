Started with a virgin pina colada..the glass of which was humongous. But i loved it.. Their complimentary chips were fresh and crispy, the salsa was tasty too. We ordered the guacamole and this part is interesting : the waiter made delicious fresh guacamole direct from the avocado fruit, right in front of us :D :D. For the main course, i shared the enchilada , tostado combination with my mother. it was good..
I took away one star because being a vegetarian, all dishes come with the same same black bean filling. so apart from the presentation all the dishes taste pretty much the same. So for this I wont blame it on the restaurant but ya just doesnt make me want to give full stars.
Nice interiors, friendly waiters and good food.. u shud definitely go if in the area ..totally worth it..
