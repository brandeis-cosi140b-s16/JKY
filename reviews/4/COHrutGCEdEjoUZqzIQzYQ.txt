I have been here a few times and its a nice alternative to Taco Mexico or Roberto's. There are some items on the menu better than others. I had the San Francisco burrito and the super burrito on different occasion and both are really good but the tacos...I have better tacos at other spots. Salsa Verde is a major factor for me because I simply love salsa Verde; their salsa Verde is good--not bad but not great either. What I do enjoy is the extra tortilla chips on the side and I pour a some salsa Verde on top of it. 3 1/2 stars too bad Yelp doesn't incorporate a half star system.
