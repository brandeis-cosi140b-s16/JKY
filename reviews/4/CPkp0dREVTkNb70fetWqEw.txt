If your looking for excellent Mexican style mariscos this is a place I would highly recommend. The fish ceviche is delicious, the prices are lower then other marisco places in Vegas. The atmosphere is more like a deli, not exactly a "fine dinning" type of decor, not that there's anything wrong with that I came to eat not admire the decorations anyways.
