Almost missed the restaurant, the storefront at night was dark. Nevertheless it is Wonderful, delicious Mexican food. Our party ordered the Chile en Nogada, the Chuleta en Salsa Roja, the Cochinita Pibil, the Enchiladas Suizas and everything was extraordinary. My favorite by far was the Chile En Nogada. You wouldn't think that everything in that dish would work together, but the layers of flavors was like a party in my mouth! The waiter was fun, service was good. The dessert was not as good as the main dishes which is why I did not give a full five stars. We ordered the churro filled with cajeta. Somehow we don't think it was all prepared at the restaurant. If they ever make the churros from scratch it will be a winner. Definitely worth visiting if ever on the Phoenix area.
