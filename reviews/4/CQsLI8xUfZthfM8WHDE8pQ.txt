Here on a Tuesday afternoon with wifey when - while walking the strip, someone in front of Diablo's passed out a 2 for 1 drinks.  Since its lunchtime, we thought we'd try it out.  I atmosphere is casual & doesn't feel uptight.  I made my choice to order the Street Tacos when our waitress was able to get me a sample of the El Pastor Pork  & I can honestly say they were some of the BEST I ever had.  The place while a little overpriced, made up for it with good food & great service from the waitress'.
