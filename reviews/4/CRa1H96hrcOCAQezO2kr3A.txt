Umm, I love this place! The atmosphere is super fun - it's got that funky biker bar slash classy restaurant vibe about it. They play great music for starters, ACDC and other classic bands, plus they have a $25 all you can drink deal from 9pm-12am. Uhh yeah. Ok the food. It was soo good. I got the steak burrito and it was so huge! I suggest to get the burritos wet because the red chili sauce is awesome and gives the food a great kick. The only down side is the yelp check in "perk." It only works for well drinks so both people have to want to drink. In Vegas that might not be hard though. Definitely worth a try.
