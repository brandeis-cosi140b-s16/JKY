Just a few block south of my townhouse in Scottsdale so I have been eating here for some time now. This is literally a hole-in-the-wall restaurant in a beaten down strip plaza and practically next to a laundromat. Strangely enough this lends to the authenticity and ambience of this mexican dive restaurant. I had to try the mole dish since I went to university in Puebla which is where the dish originated. It was pretty good. Over the years I have tried different dishes from the menu and although not everything was to my liking, I can't say it wasn't truly representative of typical Chilango meals found all around D.F. (el Distrito Federal, otherwise referred to as Mexico City). As the name suggests afterall, that is their speaciality. 
[Chilango is a Mexican slang demonym for a person born in the Mexico City suburbs or its surrounding areas who moved there. Sometimes it has a negative connotation when used principally by someone from one of the 31 sovereign States of Mexico.]
