My wife had the chicken salad and was pleased, although she never eats the shell. It's common that she's not filled without eating the shell but that wasn't the case here and she gave it a thumbs-up. I had the enchiladas but was disappointed they couldn't be made with flour tortillas. I chose both with pork and the pork was very good. I still wish flour tortillas were an option with enchiladas as an option, and how adding tortas to the menu?  Great potential, listen to your customers, and update the menu, then we'll be back even more often!
