It might be hard to believe but we felt moving from Columbus a few years ago, that we'd taken a step backwards in the quality of Tex-Mex and Mexican food available to us.  We were pretty excited about California Taco but it was gone too soon for no reason I could begin to understand.  

Now we have another option in Cinco.  It's pretty much what you'd expect for Americanized Mexican food in decor, but I found the food to be very tasty.  I had the veggie burrito which was a very simple collection of grilled vegetables in a wrap with no heavy sauces or obscene amounts of cheese.  What it did have was an spicy jalapeno sauce on top (I requested they add jalapenos so perhaps that is why) that was a great mix of spicy and tasty.

We'll be back soon.
