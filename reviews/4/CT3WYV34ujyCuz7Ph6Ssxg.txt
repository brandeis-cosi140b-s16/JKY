Reluctantly tried this place out in wesley chapel thinking it wouldn't be good, was I ever in for a treat!  The food is really good and there are many options from authentic Latin street food to Americanized mexican. We had the empanadas and authentic tacos, with el pastor, chicken, and steak. All three were really good and very tender flavorful meat. The shredded chicken is so juicy and flavorful!  Theirs a nice salsa bar with some really unique hot flavors. The place is really clean and quick with order at counter style dining. I would have given 5 stars, but the margaritas were commercial tasting with that sweet sour mix that screams college margarita. All in all, can't wait to go back and try more menu items. Great beer selection as well, offering some local noda brew as well in cans. I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting a break from American mexican speedy #6 meals.
