My shop is right down the block from Bitzee's and we had to work late a few days last week.  Good thing, cuz I had the chance to try Bitzee's nachos.  They were so awesome, I ended up eating there 3 days in a row & shared the chicken nachos with my hunny each time.  The nachos were smothered in...everything!  Chicken was very flavorful and moist, and the portions were so huge that even though I shared (and I'm not a big fan of sharing) we were both stuffed!

I'll be back for sure :)
