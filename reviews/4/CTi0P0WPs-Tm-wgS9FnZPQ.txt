I adore this place. I've been here several times. Here are my tips. The margaritas are pretty good. They are just mix, but they are cheap. XX Amber is on tap, which is great. As far as eats, I love: the beef tacos, enchiladas of any kind (their sauce is great), and the pollo fundido. BUT! My two go to dishes are the the beef machacha (sp?) with eggs and red chili beef tamales. Both are amazing. The tamales are heaven. Creamy in texture, beef falling apart, and super moist. I like them with enchilada sauce too. They don't need it, but it is YUMMY. Lastly, it's a kitchy gringo place but still fun. A great spot in Sunnyslope.
