Roasted salsa and portabella enchiladas... I'm a fan! I can't believe I've never been here.  Hottie and I are always on the hunt for good Mexican food. Scottsdale falls short every time.  This is actually a pretty quick drive for us, with the 202 right behind us.  Okay back to the food. I tried the veggie enchiladas and the portabella mushroom enchiladas. Both were good, but I don't' think I would ever order anything but the mushroom enchiladas again. They were the most delicious enchilada I've ever had... topped with a marsala sauce.. OMG!!!  For desert we had an apple crisp made with a sopapilla and topped with ice cream, a great alternative to fried ice cream.  I'll be back!!!
