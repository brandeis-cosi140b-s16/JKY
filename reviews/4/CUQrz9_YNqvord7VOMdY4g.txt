ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh the burrito bowl!
I, for some reason, don't feel like such a hog when I have the bowl, as opposed to their gigantic burritos!
The barbacoa is delish!  
I also like that you can choose which beans you want: black or pinto.  Several different salsas to choose from.
Staff is always friendly, too.  
I usually go to the one near the Biltmore of the one on 92nd St and Shea.
Plus, it gives me an opportunity to use my Spanish!
