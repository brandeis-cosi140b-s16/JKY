Nestled amongst the dreary grit of Mesa's industrial district, Mickey's touts a specialty that's slowly gathering a diverse fan base:  Mexican-style hot dogs, *WRAPPED IN BACON*.

Mickey's serves traditional Mexican fare that's pretty good too.  A serve-yourself condiment station loaded with salsas and peppers stands in a customer accessible area.  A light-eating friend of mine comes here for low-buck lunches, and claims she can transform a pair of one-dollar quesadillas into a complete meal by covering them with ladle-fulls of complimentary salsa.

Mickey's has a tiny indoor dining area, but compensates with a small outdoor patio that faces MacDonald Street.  You order inside, then pick up your hot dogs from a mobile cart that sits outside the entrance.  The bacon-wrap combines with Mexican seasonings and a panaderia-style hot dog bun to make an interesting taste treat that's unlike any hot dog you've ever had.  Size-wise, the hot dogs aren't massive...picture a slightly plumper than normal dog on an average length bun.  At two-fifty each, a pair of them make a five-dollar lunch that'll satisfy most light to normal appetites.  The downside?  This is Arizona....evenings on the patio can be nice, but summer heat can make outdoor dining downright uncomfortable during the day.  Other odd quirks?  The guy running the hot dog cart has a ghetto blaster....and blast it he does.  Stranger yet, don't come  here looking for bacon-wrapped goodness at lunchtime....a sign behind the counter warns that hot dogs aren't available till after 4:00PM.

Prices?  Relatively Cheap.  Quality? Better than average.  Ambiance is minimal, and the surrounding area is utterly devoid of neighborly charm.  Still, a new taste treat that sets you back only five bucks doesn't come around that often.  My advice? Make your way down to the corner of Broadway and MacDonald.....after 4:00 PM.
