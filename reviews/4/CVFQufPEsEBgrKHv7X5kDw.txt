Taco TJ's Al Pastor tacos are really good. Thin slices of pineapple would make them even better but they're really good without. Their Carne Asada was alright. No "wow" factor there. The Al Pastor is where it's at. 

If you're not a fan of LOTS of raw onion, ask for it on the side. I'm a fan of it but even I thought it was a bit much. You've been warned. 

Like other reviewers have mentioned, a salsa bar would be nice but they do have lime wedges and sliced radishes available for the taking. However, you do get salsa on your tacos and a side of grilled onions (yes, more onions) & peppers. 

The BF and I got a plate of Al Pastor and Carne Asada, each for $9.99 and they came with a couple packets of hot tortillas. We went the DIY taco route. I'll be back for another fix soon.
