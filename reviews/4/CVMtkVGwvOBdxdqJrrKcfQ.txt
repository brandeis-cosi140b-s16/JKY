The food there is really good & spicy. I came in a couple times & sometimes I'll have my boyfriend pick me up some food there too. They have really nice portions. 

I want to go back but I felt unwelcome w/ the lady at the counter who took my order one Sunday morning. She never smiled at me while I greeted & smiled at her. When she took my order she looked annoyed. She was nice to the people in front of me.  I don't know if it was how I was dressed or she didn't like how I looked or what. Maybe she didn't like my kids. I just don't know. It sucks because whenever I go somewhere, I always try to be nice to whoever is serving or helping us. I even gave her a decent tip for a to go order. I watched her take an order for the couple after me & she was all nice & joking w/ them. When I came back in line because I forgot to order a drink for my sister she said in an odd tone of voice, "Can I help you?' It was the kind of tone of voice like I was not welcome there.

 When I told me sister & her mother in law about it, they were surprised because they said she was really nice. Very weird. So, since the customer service for me wasn't too great, I haven't been inside since. It sucks because the food is so good. Whenever I have a craving for it, I'll usually have someone go in & pick up something for me so I won't have to tolerate the rude service.
