Honestly, I'm not a big Mexican food fan and with me being Hispanic I think most of you would think "What!!!!??!?" But when I do feel like having Mexican food (which is once in a great while) I think Fausto's blows Roberto's out of the water.

Fausto's just tastes fresher and is less greasier than Roberto's. When I feel like going to have Mexican food from a sit down restaurant try El Torito. The service may be slow but the food is great!

Thanks.
