I have eaten at Round Corner Cantina a number of times and I have never been let down.  The menu is simple... which I like.  However, there is enough variety to keep it interesting with options for everyone.  

The staff is super friendly and always remembers me when I go there.  As an out of towner... this is a huge plus.  The service at the bar is a little slow but they put together some really great drinks so I understand.  They also have some great Mexican beers on tap and serve them in Mason jars.  Bonus.

If I was to recommend one thing it would be the seasonal pickled veggies.  You get a Mason jar full of pickled vegetables (and sometimes some fruit) for about 4 bucks and it is always full of flavor, fun to eat, and a total crowd pleaser.

The patio is also pretty rad and has been packed with people every time I go.

I am giving four stars because I have a great experience every time I go to Round Corner and I recommend it to anyone.
