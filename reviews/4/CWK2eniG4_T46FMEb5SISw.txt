It's Friday...strike that, Saturday morning. I have one mud covered high heel. I have had a few vodkas, so have my friends. We took a cab, but that doesn't stop us from getting a burrito. I buy one for the cab driver too since he was nice enough to turn off the meter and didn't mind that my shoe was extremely dirty.  

The pastor taco is delicious. The chorizo burrito is delicious. The bean and cheese burrito is delicious, not that you can mess up something that simple. The guy behind the counter is super and puts up with my drunken food requests (basically, that means adding sour cream, guacamole, and pico de gallo to everything). It also helps that my best friend speaks fluent Spanish and that the counter guy has a crush on me.

Super burrito is not only great for drunk binge eating, but also for awkward heart to hearts with your friends. If you can't say it over burritos on the patio, when can you say it? It reminds me of those 'chew it over with Twix' commercials, only you shove a burrito in your mouth instead of candy bars.
