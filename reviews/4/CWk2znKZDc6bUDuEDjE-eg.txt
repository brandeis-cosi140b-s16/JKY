Ajo Al's has been one of my favorite locals only places in the Valley. The food is great, the portions are large, and the atmosphere is homey. It's the kind of place that feels like if you started coming every week, people would know your name.

My two favorite dinners are both specialties: Mushroom Enchiladas Blancas and Pollo Blanco Enchilada. Both have their delicious white jalape√±o sauce. 

While you are here, check out the bathrooms. Very nice!
