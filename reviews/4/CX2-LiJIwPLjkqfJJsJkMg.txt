Fun little beachy taco stand here in Phoenix. My friends and I have been wanting to try this place forever and we finally did which we thoroughly enjoyed. Everyone was very friendly and extremely nice while we were ordering. There are a bunch of tables that good give vibes and it makes you feel like you are somewhere you right next to the beach. 

I tried the carne asada and grilled fish taco - both were very tasty. I didn't know there was rice and beans already on them otherwise I would have held off on them. Other than that, I really enjoyed Two Hippies and can't wait to go back!
