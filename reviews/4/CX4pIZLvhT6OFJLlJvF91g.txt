Went for the first time today. I was pleasantly surprised. You get a good value for what you pay. The food is well prepared and seasoned properly. It was actually a bit surprising to walk in the place and see so many people eating. 

The salsa bar was pretty average, the place is a bit run-down, and you have to pay for soda refills. But their chicken quesadilla and chicken burrito were great. I'll certainly return.
