Standard El Pollo Loco fare here - marinated flame-grilled chicken and all the fixins. The one thing that is notable about this particular location is the friendly service. We come here about once a month or so and the food and service is consistently above par (compared to other El Pollo Loco locations).  They are accommodating, efficient and work hard to ensure that the orders are correct. That's all management and they deserve a nod. If you're looking for a quick, delicious meal in the area, El Pollo Loco is an easy choice.
