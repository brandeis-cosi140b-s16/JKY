Algoberto's is similar to Roberto's similar menu. One of my favorite things to get here is the Menudo which you can only order on Saturday and Sundays, sometimes they run out quick so if your craving for some Menudo you have to make sure you come early. The lengua tacos are also delicious here. They have a special for 5 small tacos and a small drink for under $6.
