Delicious tacos! I always get the fish one which is mixture of fish and rice. The corn tortillas are homemade and they have buckets of sauces on the side to choose from. The tacos are a little bit small and not very filling but it's fun trying out all the food stands down the Strip anyways. The tortillas can get very soggy though and hard to eat so I recommend getting a fork. But the tacos have great flavor, especially with their sauces.
