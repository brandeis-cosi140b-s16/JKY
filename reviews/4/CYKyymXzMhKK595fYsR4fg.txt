Delicious Cerviche! I've lived down the road from this place almost 5 months and finally stopped tonight. I did take out just for me. I'm originally from New England and seafood is my favorite and obviously pretty sparse here in Arizona. I saw "fresh seafood" out front and hoped for some cerviche. It was indeed fresh! I got the shrimp and octopus mix. Also got an order of guacamole which was very good too! I will be returning.
