I have been going to El Bravo for more than 20 years.  It isn't fancy but the food is excellent and the people are friendly.

My husband and I have gotten to know the waiters and they even know what we will order.  We are predictable though.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE their Navajo Taco.  It's like a large fry bread with ground beef, lots of lettuce, tomatoes and cheese on top.  I usually eat half and take the rest home for another time.  My husband orders #9 which is an enchilada with an egg on top.  He loves it.  

If you just want some good Mexican food but don't care about the ambiance, this is your place.
