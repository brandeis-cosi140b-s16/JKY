Clean place to sit down and eat or pick-up. I go here a lot whenever I'm picking up food for my friends at work because they have a drive-thru. The speed is similar whether you use the drive-thru or come in but it's just more convenient to finish getting ready in the car lol. 

Their guacamole is really fresh and they give you a good portion size, it's like 2-3 tbsp. The flour tortillas are also very fresh too! Oh and also when you go through the drive-thru you can ask them to packet up the salsas, cucumbers, jalape√±o, or any of the other condiments. 

Highly recommend this place for their fresh food, friendly service, and clean dining area.
