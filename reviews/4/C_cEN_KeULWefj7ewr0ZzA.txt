I was never a fan of ANY Mexican food until I began to frequent Rio (both this one and the "mother-ship" down in El Mirage).  They have changed my mind by being so accommodating with my very specific order requests.  Since I do not eat veggies or any "rabbit food", Mexican food can be a challenge BUT Rio always listens and makes it perfectly!  I also love that they only use white-meat chicken for their entrees!  Often visit Rio 2-3 times per month and 99% of the staff are WONDERFUL!   The only reason for not giving a 5 star rating is that since the last super-friendly manager ( who knew our first names immediately when we walked in the door and often visited our table to chat)  left last year, we have yet to even meet the new manager. (?) That "face" needs to be easily visible to the patrons again :)
