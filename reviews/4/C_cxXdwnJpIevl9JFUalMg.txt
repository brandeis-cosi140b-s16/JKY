While in Arizona visiting the Grand Canyon I searched for some places to eat because we were staying in Vegas for the week. So when I saw this place on yelp I immediately yelped out and told my mom we must try this place. I was rushing her to get back to Vegas so I could try it. Good thing they close at 3:00 am because most places closed at 9:00 pm and this was one of the only ones open. When I got here I had to have some carne asada fries and a al pastor taco. So after ordering I sat down with my family to eat. Oh heads up the Jamaica drink mixed with sprite and fresh squeezed lime juice is amazing. So after we ate, we decided to just sit a little while and people watch. Well around 12/1 o'clock the crowd started coming and lines were out the door. After a while we left. But overall the food was good and the prices were reasonable. Will be coming back next time I'm in Vegas. Very good ambience. Loved the place
