I've been into Americas a few times. Its a very nice Taco shop, not sketchy at all. America's Taco Shop is named after the owner: America (is her first name).

I'm allergic to flour tortillas, so I havent really been able to enjoy them. But the taco meat is very good :)

Summer time drink: Try the Horchata. Or Horchata with Coffee.
