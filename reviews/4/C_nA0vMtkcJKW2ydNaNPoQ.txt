First, you have to start with the wonderful atmosphere. Its in an old church in central Phoenix and has a warm and charming environment. 

The menu is small, but of course most people are going to order the tacos. 

We had the guacamole for a starter, can't complain! I love guac and it was yummy! For dinner, I tried the yucatan shrimp, chipotle cherry steak, and urban bean coffee braised beef tacos. My favorite was the chipotle cherry steak - it was a unique flavor combination, but completely worked! My friend had the enchiladas and was very happy with the dish. It was a decent sized portion with a great flavor.

I also tried one of the margaritas, it was pretty strong, but still tasted yummy! Definite win!

I would  go back.
