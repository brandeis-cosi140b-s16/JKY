Had lunch here for the first time yesterday and thought the atmosphere was smart, current and open.  Menu was diverse and unique enough and there was a lot to tempt me, a big fresh-Mex fan.  

Service was undeniably slow and drinks were especially under-served.  This was a shame, as my cohorts were sloshin' it up and the proprietor could have generated some serious revenue on those margs if someone was willing to serve them! 

I had the shrimp tacos which weren't nearly as good as the shrimp/ancho tacos at Jasper's Bistro, but still quite tasty and served hot.  Chips & salsa are great, too.  

All in all, only the service brought us down.  It's never fun to have to ask for something twice, right? But one server does not kill a restaurant for me...I'll give them another chance and I'm hopeful they'll figure it out!
