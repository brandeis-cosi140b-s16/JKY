I ordered chicken nachos with the works. Delicious! Each bite was filled with crunch and evenly distributed cheese. I'm not a fan of excess black olives, beans, and sour cream but I was surprised how everything had just the right amount.  Nothing was overbearing! The flavors are just the right amount of spicy and they don't skimp on cheese like others! (Cough--Robertos)
Very impressed by not only the presentation and taste, but the fair pricing. The only thing I could say bad is that I have to reheat my leftovers in another container bc the to-go is in aluminium (microwave).
This is my first time here. I want to try more dishes before giving 5 stars.
