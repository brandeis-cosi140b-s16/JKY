I have seen this little food trailer on a number of occasions but I finally got the opportunity to try the food las weekend. 

They are located on the corner of Flamingo and Lindell. They have a number of daily specials and even items I had never heard of before. Once I see something new I know that's what I'm ordering. I was craving al pastor so I tried the pambazo with al pastor. It's a bit like a torts but the bread is marinated and fried I think. My fella for the al pastor burrito. Both of our orders came out quickly and we were on our way home with a back full of inexpensive goodies.

Both items were great. Not the best al pastor I've ever had, a little on the dry side, but good. We both preferred the pambazo to the burrito, though. The salsas were super spicy and I loved that. I have my eye in al pastor fries and I'll definitely be back for Taco Tuesday some time really soon.
