I love the open feeling and the view of the strip is amazing. The staff is always friendly and do not miss the opportunity to have the guacamole made fresh at your table.
Whenever I have out-of-town friends visit, this is on my to-do-list.

Parking lot is SMALL. If you do not hit it right, you have to park across the street, which is not safe, since it is on a hill.

The food is good and plentiful. Wait staff is attentive.
