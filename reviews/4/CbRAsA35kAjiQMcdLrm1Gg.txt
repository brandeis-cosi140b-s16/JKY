The bar, while fun and lively, is littered with sixty-somethings shuffling around the dance floor to Jimmy Buffet tunes. 
The band is good. But those haunting images of old men on bar stools... in Hawaiian shirts...hunkered over... head propped-up by one arm resting on the bar,  well that's just sad.
I hope I never get like that but I think it's inevitable. 
That's what men do when they get old. They become miserable. And by being miserable, they make guys like me miserable. 
Part of the great cosmic circle of life.

I ate "The Three Amigos."  No, not a dick buffet....Jesus! What's the matter with you?
Three Amigos is a menu item featuring three enchiladas; one chicken, one cheese and one red chili. Pretty tasty. Ten bucks, I think.

I can't believe you.
You really thought for a moment  I went down on three old Mexican dudes from the bar?
Way fucking uncool!
 
Kelli is an absolute charm. Best server I've ever had.
Left her a big tip and a note reading;

  "Thanks for such great service...The 3 Amigos were delicious, great suggestion."

STOP IT!
