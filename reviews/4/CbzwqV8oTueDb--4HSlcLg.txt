Dos Gringos is always a great place no matter when you go.  The recently re-modeled their inside to make it more fun!  They have full size Jenga, beer pong, Golden Tee, a Ms. Pacman machine, bean bag toss, and more.  They always have great drink specials and a friendly staff.  On my most recent visit, the manager bought our first round of drinks because he thought we waited to long-great service!  Food is good too.
