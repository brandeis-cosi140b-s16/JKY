We have been to Pasquale's 3 times in 10 days. 
First time I had the fajitas burrito and it was fantastic, Second time I got the tostado.Which was ok., yesterday We went back to have lunch and I got the fajitas burrito again hoping it would be just as good. It was ok
Overfilled, onions weren't cooked enough as were the pepper's , Needed to be recognizes more.

Granted they were busy and training new people so that pay have been a problem. We will definitely  come back.
Don't overlook the regulars
