I read a review on this place by Arizona Republic food critic, Howard Seftel and it sounded so good I had to check it out for myself. I was also excited to find out it's only about 5 minutes from my place.

I was surprised with how large and festive the restaurant was. The entrance leads you through an open courtyard where vendors sell items in makeshift shops and you can watch them make the tortillas fresh and grill the meat. The smell makes your mouth water in anticipation.

For starters, the complimentary chips and salsa are better than at most Mexican restaurants. You can tell the chips are made from their fresh tortillas - they're thick, crunchy and perfectly salted and the salsa verde is addictive.

I've had a few dishes here, but one of my favorites the pork carnitas. The meat is so juicy and tender and paired with those infamous tortillas. The accompanying rice and beans also hold their own. A second favorite is the red snapper (my mind is blanking on all the flavors - just try it!)

Overall it's a fun restaurant w/ great Mexican food - who could ask for more?
