Asked at a small bookstore west of town for a Mexican food recommendation, and the owner told us that Anita's was the place to go.  He was right.  Anita's is a very popular local hangout as well as a favorite tourist attraction.  Salads are of mixed baby greens rather than simply iceberg.  Great food, decent margaritas, reasonably priced, and delightful service.
