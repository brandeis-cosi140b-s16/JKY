Ahh finally a small AUTHENTIC Mexican spot! Its not the best Mexican I had, but its authentic and pretty decent.  Free fresh trips and salsa riight when you get in and if you speak spanish the waitress will joke with you.  The best part about this place is the price! I think for a beer and an entree it was like $9.  There a ton of options for anyone. Its a small quiet place with nothing to exciting in terms of decorating, but dont worry about that.  Good food, awesome price, and fast service. Definitely try it
