Different name, but still the same still of food. It is greasy, salty, and one of those essential eats after a drunken night. Beef rolled tacos with guacamole or the California burrito hits the spot when my head is pounding and my stomach is churning. That is right, no eating healthy when you might have alcohol poisoning. Instead just give your gut another punch.

With every purchase, you are welcomed to pack as much from the salsa bar as you wish. I end up eating a bag and a half of the spicy veggie mix. Although the carrots lost their crunch and the seasoning is not hot, it was still a nice accompaniment to the Mexican food. I also prefer the green salsa to the red. Make sure to pick up some radishes and limes to cut the grease.
