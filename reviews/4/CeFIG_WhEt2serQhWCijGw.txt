I come here every single Tuesday. The have $1 tacos and burritos. The red and green sauce is amazing. I have never tried anything other than the tacos (shredded beef, chicken, ground beef) or the burrito (I went with shredded beef). The burrito is large and filling. The tacos are excellent. This place has a drive thru as well and is always busy.

If it's Tuesday and you have a few bucks, stop here.
