I can't believe the reviews are so bad for this place! As far as airport food/prices/service go, this place is great!!

The burrito was big and all the condiments looked fresh. Okay, not the most AMAZING burrito ever, but let me reiterate... For airport food it was excellent!

p.s. And this is just a little quirk of my own, but I don't like when one item gets all bunched up in one position of my burrito... I like things to be evenly spread out. They need to work on that here.
