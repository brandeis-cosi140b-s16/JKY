I was in town visiting and my friends brought me here for brunch.  It has a very fun, trendy vibe going.  We started with some fun drinks.  I got the chocolate fudge and vanilla ice cream shake.  I couldn't really taste the chocolate but it was still yummy.  My friend got the strawberry shake (no ice cream) and we didn't really like it unfortunately.  We started off with chips and salsa and guacamole.  I really enjoyed the various types of salsa and enjoyed trying them all.  I got the chicken chilaquiles verdes. It was chicken with layer tortillas and cheese and salsa with an egg (cooked however you like it) on top.  I got this on the recommendation of my friend.  It was delicious!  I would definitely get it again.  

My only gripe was that the service was very slow at times.  It took a while for the waiter to come back to check on us and for us to get our check.  I didn't mind so much but my friend was annoyed.
