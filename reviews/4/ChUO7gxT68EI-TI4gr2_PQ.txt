I've been frequenting this Q'Doba for years as I work next door so maybe I'm biased...but I think it's great. The service/attitude of the staff has improved tremendously and they often remember my order (which I always enjoy). Plus I appreciated being able to get a (mostly) healthy meal for under 10 bucks. You can build your meal to be gluten/dairy/meat free; whatever your belly desires. I rarely eat in but when I do the tables are usually pretty clean. Deducting a star because their guac is not made fresh but shipped frozen; why?!?!?
