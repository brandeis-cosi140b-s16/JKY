Yup, I like what I see and what I like seeing is real homemade corn tortillas on a parilla! Parilla Suiza keep it goin' you're doing something right! I haven't been disappointed yet.  I enjoy the tacos with carne asada, the parillada was huge and that arroz & beans... mmm... rico.  So the only thing I noted changed on my last trip was a re-vamp o the menu... Originally I was a bit disappointed that they now have a burger and ribs on their menu... nothing about that is Mexican but HEY we are in AMERICA baby and in America we enjoy a good burger or ribs now and then, so... why not!? Although I haven't given them a whirl... nor will I because my trip to La Parilla is strictly about the Comida Mexicana!  Thumbs up Parilla keep those corn tortillas coming!
