Went here yesterday 7-7-15 around 6pm through the drive-thru. Drive thru lady was friendly.  I got a half chicken combo with black beans, rice, an extra side salad, and....drumroll please....tres leches cake.  I've never had tres leches cake before and it's one of the best things I've ever had in my mouth. There's only two things that taste better than that cake.
