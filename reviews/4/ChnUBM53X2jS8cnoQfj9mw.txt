Having just moved to Madison from Los Angeles, CA, I have been fiending for some legit tacos. I just tried La Bambas Tacos Al Pastor, and while they aren't what you'll get at a taco truck in East L.A., they are pretty darn good. My friends and I consider ourselves Taco Aficionados, and I will say that the 5 tacos and large horchata has me full and thoroughly satisfied. Definitely a must-try for some pretty-darn-close-to-110% authentic tacos.
