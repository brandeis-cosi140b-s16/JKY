The first thing, the place smells really good.  Food was awesome, salads and tacos, chicken and vegetarian, there's a little something for everyone.  Homemade chips and an excellent salsa keep you going til the main entrees are served.  We ordered a Blood Orange margarita and regular house blend both were`a bit weak for our taste.  The dessert of a fried ice cream went well and the server was pleasant.
