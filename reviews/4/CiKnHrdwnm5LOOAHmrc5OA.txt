On our recent trip to Vegas we were looking for something reasonably priced that was open a little later (dinner around 9:30pm.) We also decided to include the idea of going off the strip, and after a random search of restaurants not too far from our hotel selected Tacos  Beer.

We were pleasantly surprised to have discovered this hidden gem.  It was dead when we arrived (only 2 other people inside) which we were a little worried about at first, but any worries we had quickly went away once we got the food.  The guacamole was delicious and the tacos were some of the tastier ones I've had in quite a while (my favorite was the baja fish taco.)  The cilantro-lime rice (side) was also very delicious.  Staff were very friendly and attentive.

Overall a great value, tacos were an average of $3 a piece.  For dinner for 4 of us with two rounds of beer the bill came to a very reasonable $100...and it was definitely worth exploring slightly off the beaten path of the strip.
