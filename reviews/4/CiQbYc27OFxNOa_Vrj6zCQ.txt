Disagree with previous reviewer.  Robertos's is as good and solid chain/over-the-counter Mexican food restaurant as you're likely to find in town.  It's fresh, they prepare the food with real ingredients after you order it, it's open 24 hours, what's not to like?

This particular location seemed cleaner and nicer than a few others I've been in around town.  

If you're a carnivore, I highly recommend the Carne Asada burrito.. great flavor, and not at all lacking anything in terms of how much steak you get!
