1998 was a great year for me because I had graduated high school. That summer I experienced good food, good company and a fun atmosphere!

Why am I talking about my glory days like an fat old football player wearing his letterman jacket in a dark room in front of a laptop? (I swear I'm not).

The Spotted Donkey brought back memories of all the things I loved about that summer: good food, good company and a fun atmosphere.

I had the tacos, and they were cooked to perfection. Portions were just the right size. They are small, but they will you up. Service was a tad spotty, but it was busy, and the guy was friendly.

My partner in crime ordered the fajitas which were incredible. So incredible that later that night, we decided that we were inspired to make our own. Ok, we didn't ACTUALLY make them later that night...but the decision had been made.

Next time I go, I want to check out the Late Night Happy Hour. Looked like a great option for a night when you just want to kick back and ride out a smooth evening.
