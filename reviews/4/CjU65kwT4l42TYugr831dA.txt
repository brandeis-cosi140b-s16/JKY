Thank you Yelp. Not for introducing me to another good restaurant, but for introducing me to new friends who introduced me to a good restaurant. I tend to not be the most available individual, but Robyn and Kevin L. have been very patient with me. After a few failed get together attempts, we finally met at Frank and Fina's for dinner. 

I have had this on my bookmarks for a few months and was happy to try something new. Of course I fell victim to the infamous Sweet Potato Enchiladas ($10.25) and a Margarita on the rocks with salt ($5.75). Two nice size tortilla rolls filled with mashed sweet potatoes caught me off guard with the natural candy like flavor. After a few more bites, I adjusted, and they were delicious. I was also able to taste Robyn's Guacamole and Kevin's Queso Fundido. Both were good. The first might be bland for some, but I could eat a whole guacamole with nothing else, so that did not bother me. The cheese dip was fantastic. Served with soft flour tortillas, you will need more to get all of the melty goodness. It would be a sin to waste any,

If a good meal is not enough, bring some friends along because it is a chill atmosphere. Throughout dinner, we were checked upon, but it did not interfere with conversation. The quiet setting is perfect for dates or catching up.
