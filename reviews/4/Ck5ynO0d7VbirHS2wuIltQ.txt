Mention The Burrito Co. to anyone who is from or lives in Ahwatukee and they know exactly what you are referring to. Now that's name recognition. 

Centrally situated between Tempe and the beginning of Ahwatukee, B-Co, as I like to call it, is a stone throw from the Elliot exit on I-10. 

I'm very accustomed to eating at Amados, so I'm very much an enthusiast of the cheap burrito. B-Co knows how to make a good burrito and charge just a hair more than the Mexican all-night quick stops like Amados.

It's justifiable though considering you can eat on their private outdoor patio or inside where one has the luxury of a television and staff is okay if you change the channel to what you want to see. There are even customer bathrooms outside. 

The downside to B-Co is the hours of the restaurant. It does not open on Sundays and if you plan on grabbing a late night snack after the club, the restaurant will be closed.

The Burrito Co. is also pretty skimpy on the amount of chips it gives out, which are by the way never greasy. Meals also take longer to cook than at Amados so you find yourself waiting around with your little number slip in hand moving strategically around the seating area trying not to get in people's way as they navigate the salsa bar or the fountain drink machine. 

Still, service always seems to be friendly and having a punch card means that your hundredth or so burrito is free. And free is good, even in Ahwatukee.
