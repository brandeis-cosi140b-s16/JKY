No reviews for this place?!! We have had the breakfast burrito and the carne asada burrito which were both amazing. I've had plenty of Mexican food and so-called Mexican food (mostly on the East Coast) and this place definitely is among the best. Don't be fooled by the low key location and simple menu. Give it a shot and trust me you won't be disappointed.
