I always like going to this Chipotle.  It is always fast.  I went there today at about 11:30 am for lunch, but about 20 people in front of me.  It took less than ten minutes for me to order and get my food.  The workers are all so friendly and efficient.  This Chipotle has it down to a science on getting people in and out FAST.  The only complaint I have is my steak burrito had 4 pieces of meat that was either just fat or some other beef part that was chewy and inedible.  Next time I'll stick with the chicken or carnitas, what I usually get.  Other than this it was a very good burrito.
