Stopped in here one night with a friend, it seemed like a good place to grab a late-night bite, as long as you don't mind sharing a small space with some seriously trashed college students. It wasn't too crowded when we went (around 10 on a Saturday night), but the realllllyyyyy loud drunk girl made up for it. They ended up cranking the music after half an our or so and that forced us out. 

The food was good (i had beer-battered fish tacos... really filling and spicy) and the bartender was extremely friendly and easygoing.
