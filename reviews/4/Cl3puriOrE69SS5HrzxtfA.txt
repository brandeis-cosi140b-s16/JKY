I eat here every Friday at happy hour.  The house margaritas are very good.  They have had some management changes in the last couple months and they have a great new cook. I love the Machaca beef anything and the steak or chicken avacado salads are great! I don't know about these reviews that are not so good. I think they might have had a unique experience.  It is loud, it's not a quiet romantic type place anyway.   I've been coming here regularly for 4 years.  Would recommend.
