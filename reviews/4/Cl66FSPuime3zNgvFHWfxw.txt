Cute and quaint mexican restaurant. Very upscale and modern in a new development close to the JW resort. 

Prices were great, bean dip delicious and tasty food. Tacos and steak tostada were my fav! Delicious home made chips and spectacular decor.

If I was lived around here, I would be back for more. Very sweet staff, manager on hand asking how everything was .  Most importantly, I thought the price was right!
