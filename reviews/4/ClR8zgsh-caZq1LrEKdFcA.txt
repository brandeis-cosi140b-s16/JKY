I kept hearing about this place from some good friends of mine.  They would frequently mention their visits and their food and the friendly personal service from Guedo himself.  
Well I finally got to try this place out for myself.  Weaving our way in from the parking lot through a couple of sandy patio seating areas.  Immediately I felt like I was on vacation in Mexico at a beachside cantina.  

We picked up drinks and sat outside under an umbrella.  I scanned over the menu trying to decide what to order while we chatted and chilled.  The rest of the regulars already knew what they wanted and they talked me into Guedo's fish tacos.  
Two of us went back inside and placed our order at the register with Guedo.  I ordered 2 fish tacos and a side of beans. We went outside and within about 15ish min they were calling us to pick up our order.  We went inside loaded up our baskets with goodies from the salsa bar.  
My personal favorite was the red salsa, spicy and flavorful.

While we were there, a group hosting a going away party was there too.  Perfect location especially there on the back bar/patio area.  This would also be a nice place to do a little day drinking.  *Dangerous...*
