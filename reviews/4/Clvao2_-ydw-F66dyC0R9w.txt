This is a relatively new addition to the area and it is quite welcome. We stopped by on a Saturday evening for a quick bite and the place was popping. The drive thru line was extremely busy, but I could not be deterred. I wanted healthy food on the cheap. 

The line went pretty quickly and they gave me no troubles when I used a coupon I had. The service was fast and efficient and they were very courteous and apologetic about the line. I'll be back. So glad we have another fast food option around the area that isn't fried food oriented.
