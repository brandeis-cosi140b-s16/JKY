If Vitamin T is any indication of what's to come for the DT PHX dining scene, I think we're in good shape, kids.  Dropped in on T for a quick work-day lunch and had two tacos for $5.  The barbacoa is very flavorful and the pork has a perfect kick of spicy heat.  The tacos are small but they don't skimp on the ingredients and give you plenty of meat resulting in a great combo of flavors.  The space is small but they were efficient and moved quickly to serve meals.  The staff was friendly and they seem to pay attention bc my meal was handed to me and they didn't call my number.  I recommend grabbing food to go bc I am sure it gets very crowded over lunch time.  I hope to visit again and sit outside. Hooray for tasty outside dining options in DT.  Thanks Vitamin T, you make me feel healthy.  Sign up on their website for deals. http://eatmoretacos.com/
