Came here with my husband last week -- awesome classic mexican food...excellent bean dip and red sauce. We will be back!

For the person who complained about the dirt road to the parking area, we actually liked the local character that added to the experience...if you want a posh place with 5x the price and trendy food, go to Scottsdale, they have plenty of concrete parking lots.

The classic white stucco building and rustic arches give this place a nice mission feel.

TIP: dont sit in the back of the restaurant...request either the diing area to the right as you walk in or the patio.

Great experience!
