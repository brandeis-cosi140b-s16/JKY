OK, when I've had a little too much fun ... wink, wink. I know the only thing that will prevent me from having a hangover is the same thing that will cure a hangover: Cheap, greasy food.

And nobody does it better that Chico's. Come on, five tacos for $5?

The food is great, the service is friendly and fast and the price is right.

Let's grab a six pack, six shots of Cuervo and then head to Chico's so we will be ready to do it again tomorrow. What do you say?
