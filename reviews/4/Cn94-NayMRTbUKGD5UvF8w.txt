I have driven by this location numerous times and would try to remind myself to go there when out with friends, but just never seemed to get around to it...until last week!  This location serves up the same great food as the other locations, but isn't as busy.  I will definitely come back.  

If you are looking for the atmosphere of the one on Central, you won't find it.  It's more like the one in Mesa, but even toned down a bit compared to that one.

Go for the food!!!  The service was great and everyone is just as friendly so what are you waiting for?  Get in there and eat some food!
