I was eating at this location today, and was pretty impressed. The store had plenty of parking spots around the building. I believe there were 2 entrances into the diner, maybe even three. The place was clean during Lunch time rush! The employees were friendly, and easy to understand. The service was very fast, and accurate. I will be dining at this Taco Bell again!
