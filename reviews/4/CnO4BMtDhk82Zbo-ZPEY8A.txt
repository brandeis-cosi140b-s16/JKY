Absolutely delicious tacos!! Being native from Mexico, I am extremely selective with Mexican Restaurants and won't eat at most. But this one happened to be down the street and I decided to check it out. It truly felt like I was back home. Be careful with the salsa they put on the tacos! On a scale from 1-10 it was an 11 in the level of spicy. If you can't handle spicy I would recommend to ask for no salsa or ask for it on the side. The green one tends to be more spicy than the red one. The only reason I don't give it a 5star was the restrooms weren't very well maintained. Other than that I'd recommend this place to anyone!
