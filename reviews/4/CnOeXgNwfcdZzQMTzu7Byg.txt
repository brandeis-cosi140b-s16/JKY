Great Salsa!

While driving down Cactus we had a sudden craving for Mexican food and stopped at the first place we found. 

We were seated immediately and had wonderful service, I saved the receipt so I could remember to put her name in my review but I can't find it. Once I do...I'll let ya know!

We had a slew of folks that helped bring drinks, chips, salsa and everything else that we needed. I was pretty impressed with the level of service we received. 

The ONLY downfall is not having an Italian dressing that's not creamy. No one likes creamy dressing. Please get a true vinaigrette  on your menu. I loved your taco salad but didn't have a good dressing to put on it. I promise to add this to my roatation if you do.
