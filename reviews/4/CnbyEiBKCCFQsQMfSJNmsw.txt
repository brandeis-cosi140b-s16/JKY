Co-worker brought me here for dinner on my last night in Tempe.  A Wednesday night and it was still busy, most likely because of their happy hour.  One small gripe is that their beer selection could use improvement.  They did have a couple Four Peaks available (good IPA), but they could stand to have a couple more local or micro options.  We skipped appetizers, and went straight to an entree with the exception of chips and salsa.  The chips were fresh and the salsa was above average.  I had the Santa Fe Smoked Chicken Enchilada with beans and rice.  The enchilada was really good, with the sauce having a good amount of spice.  The cornbread that was included with the meal was worth mentioning as well.  Overall a good meal and I would return when back in the area.
