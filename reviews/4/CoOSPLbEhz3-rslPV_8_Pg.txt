I love Mexico City, and good tacos are hard to come by here in the states. The al pastor was really good, and I will definitely be coming back for the tacos! 

They had some of the best horchata I've had in Phoenix, make sure you try it. I ordered the huarache, but was not too impressed. It was a little bland for being a specialty item. If you've ever eaten a huarache in DF, you might be disappointed in that dish. Overall, this place was great and I will be back again.
