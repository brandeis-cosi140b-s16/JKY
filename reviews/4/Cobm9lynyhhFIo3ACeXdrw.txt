Good food, good service, good price, shitty location.

I had the carne asada plate which came with guac, beans, and corn tortillas.  The tortillas were amazing, the carne asada was above average, as were the beans.  Unfortunately, as good as it was, it's still Mexican food.  Not that I have anything against Mexican food, it just, for the most part, all tastes similar.  Nothing really stood out as AMAZING.  If I'm in the area (god forbid), I'll def. eat there again, but I'm not going to drive from the E. Valley to go here.  Bonus points for having 7-Up in a bottle, made with sugar.
