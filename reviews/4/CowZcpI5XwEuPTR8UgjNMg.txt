Mannys alcohol beverage tasted like flu medicine. I would stick with regular domestic beer next time. Didn't like the crunchy Quesadilla, soft one might be better. Carne Asada dinner was really good. Lot of good meat. Service was good, but check up on you every minute literally. 

I might come back if I'm in this area of town
