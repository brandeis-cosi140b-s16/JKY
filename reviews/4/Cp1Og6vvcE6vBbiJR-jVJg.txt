If you're a big fan of chipotle consider this chain an upgrade from the usual menu Chipotle has. The meat is heated up through a rolling microwave device, which melts the cheese and crunches any chip. My favorite dish to get is the Carne Asada nachos! I always stack my nachos with the most toppings I can get, that's just how I roll. I've tried their salads, which too is bomb! I usually stick to the steak, but I hear that the other meats are good. The only downside to this place is that they're hella greedy with their toppings. They try to give you as little as possible, and end up charging you for another scoop. I never pay anything less than $15.00. 

But the place is worth a try, there nachos are hella better than Roberto's regardless of the price.
