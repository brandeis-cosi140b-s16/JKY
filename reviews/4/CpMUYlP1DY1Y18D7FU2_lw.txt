Great place to watch an Iowa Hawkeye game!  There is a HUGE Iowa following in the Phoenix area that meetup regularly at the Sandbar on Saturdays during football time.  And it gets crazy!  They turn all of the TVs to the Iowa game.  Everyone is drunk by lunch because the games start at 9.  

Drinks are pricy, and there is a high DB count in this place, but the scenery is nice.  

Be careful about parking, though.
