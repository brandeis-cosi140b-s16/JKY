A fellow teacher recommended I try this place and he really hit the nail on the head, it's mouthwatering delicious. I highly suggest their pig wings on their starters menu, that chipotle glaze is to die for. I'm a HUGE fan of tacos so it only made sense for me to try a few of them and they exceeded my expectations. If you want a nice little date night that won't break the bank, then dine here!
