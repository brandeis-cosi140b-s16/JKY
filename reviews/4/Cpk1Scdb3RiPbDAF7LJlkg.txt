Soft. Chicken. Tacos.
I swear that stuff is so addictive. Just the right amount of blandness (which you can spice up with the mild or hot sauce packets).
Some days there are sales on where you can buy 10 soft chicken tacos for $10.
That stuff is usually gone really fast when I buy all 10..
Also great as hangover food, and for lining your belly before a party.
Even breakfast!
