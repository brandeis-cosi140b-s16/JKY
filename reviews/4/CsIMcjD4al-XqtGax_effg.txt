I have to say I was really impressed with the overall look and feel of La Casa Blanca. When it gets cooler outside I am definitely going to sit on the patio. The service was good, food was good, margarita was a little weak, but overall I will definitely return. Next time I might ask them to not seat me in a room where literally every single table has a screaming child. Oh well!
