I will admit, my first visit here probably biased me rather severely towards this place.  I had just moved to Glendale, AZ from NY.  It had been a rough trip, it was late, and I had just finished unpacking.  I wanted food like nothing else.

So, right down the street, my brother and I come across the happily lit sign saying "3 Margaritas".  Not a chain or a place we'd ever heard of, and that was good enough.  We went in and were greeted warmly by their very friendly server.  As soon as we were settled chips, salsa, and refried beans appeared before us.  Some wonderful organic margaritas showed up soon thereafter.

The food itself was excellent.  I had one of their specials made of chorizo, which I remember being quite impressed by.  I've been back many times since, and everything I've tried has been delicious.  The service has always been excellent.  And the portions are generous, but not overwhelmingly so.  With the exception of the burrito loco.  That is one giant(and crazy) burrito.
