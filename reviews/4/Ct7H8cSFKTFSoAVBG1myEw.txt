Sometimes I just get a hankerin' for some chips and salsa and margaritas.  Chevy's to the rescue!  I love their seasonal flavored margaritas; tonight I had the cranberry margarita... mmmmm!

No, it's not "authentic Mexican"... it's fresh mex as specified by the name, so there shouldn't be any surprise that this doesn't taste like your neighborhood Mexican joint.  If you go in knowing what to expect, you'll enjoy your meal.

The thing that really surprises me about this location is how empty it is.  Maybe Chevy's just isn't that popular in Arizona?  Been here twice and both times, we were one of just a few tables.  That's all right; made for good service and fresh food.
