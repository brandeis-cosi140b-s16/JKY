This place just opened up in the Bermuda Triangle that is Sahara Pavilion(sahara/decatur)

Grand Opening is May 8th in the old Spirit of Cuba location. 

Today they had a fundraiser to benefit Caring 4 Kids Foundation from 5-8 pm. $5 donation you can get ANY & Everything you want off the menu & a drink!

My son & I each got a burrito & chips/salsa-we got a barbacoa & chicken. They were huge with rice & choice of beans plus pico,guac & more. The meats were fantastic-real spicy.

The service was outstanding , the place was clean & inviting with music pumped in.

There are about 10 4 person tables and a few 2 person tables. Probably under 40 people seating indoors, but they have outdoor patio seating too.

The only missing is a salsa bar.

I'd rather go here anytime over Roberto's & Baja Fresh in this neighborhood.
