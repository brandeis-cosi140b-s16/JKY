I love Roberto's! This one especially! Service could be more welcoming but their food is on point! I usually get one of 3 things for myself...carne asada fries, carne asada burrito or a chicken chimichanga. Their salsa bar is always stocked with fresh cucumbers and hot carrots every time I've made a stop here. This place is kept clean, plenty of seats of you want to dine-in and averagely priced for a taco shop. I will always come back to this place...weekly. lol! The only thing I really don't like about this place is how inconvenient it is getting into the little parking lot coming from the south on Ft Apache.
