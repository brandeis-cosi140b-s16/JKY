Love love love, Chipotle... Did I mention that I love Chipotle? I would have given it a 5 star rating but the employees there have a hard time deviating from the normal. If you ask for something like extra items or leave off ingredients, they have a difficult time and really slows down the line. The line staff here sometimes have an attitude that is not normally seen at usual other locations. Just my personal opinion but I think it's just poor management. There is a particular manager there who seems overwhelmed and not on point. Several times they are short of items on the beverage line, ie lids, forks and such. I asked why one day and they told me that they forgot to order. Come on people, really?  I don't want to use a bathroom hand towel for a napkin. Just a personal preference. But the food is consistently good like other locations.
