At first I was a little confused with how the place was set up, where to order what I wanted. The staff was okay, chatting with each other while I looked around. Finally a cook explained the set up. I had the vegetarian tacos and my boyfriend had chicken tacos. Flavors were good. salsa bar was overwhelming, I wish they would label the 8 different salsa. Mexican corn was beyond good. Dj playing in the corner on Saturday night was a great surprise.  Planning on coming back again.
