It was my third visit and finally had the chance to stay for a bit and have more than a margarita. Love the ambiance and the food, service was a little slow but 6 of us moving from bar to tables with different tabs to close can take a bit.  So all in all I will definitely return and the friends we met loved it as well. Great happy hour menu and the guys loved all the tvs.
