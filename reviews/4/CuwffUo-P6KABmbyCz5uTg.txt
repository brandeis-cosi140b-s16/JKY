I love this place. The food is delicious. The Papa Loco is amazing. Great idea. The tacos are excellent. The salsas and marinated vegetables are awesome. I love that they gave me a grilled jalapeno. I would love to see rice and beans added to the very small menu. The seating is wonderful, plenty of tables and chairs for a small place. Truly a class act. Thank you.
