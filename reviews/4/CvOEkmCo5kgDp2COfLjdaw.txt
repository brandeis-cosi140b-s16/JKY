Chipotle is always delicious, but the amount of food you get varies by worker. This annoys me because sometimes I get an adequate amount of rice/beans/mean and other times I get a tiny amount of each. They really need to to figure out a strategy to remedy this issue. Also, a few employees were covered in hickeys. Sorry this is really unprofessional and kinda gross. I hope the manager has a talk with them.
