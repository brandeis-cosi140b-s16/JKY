Talk about a hidden gem! This place fits that description to a T! I'm a sucker for Mexican food and when Jessie suggested this place for dinner I was all in. 

Maribel's is located inside Doc Holliday's. It has a very simple decor, but they don't need it cause their food is that good. Their menu is simple, but has all the authentic Mexican food you'd want. Plus, they have an awesome $5 daily specials. They also serve their breakfast items all day. 

Jessie and I ordered the chips and guacamole which was only $3.99. Wow! The bowl of guacamole was huge and perfectly flavored. The salsa had the perfect kick. We  both choose the steak chimichangas,wet with everything on it. While we were chatting and enjoying our chips and guacamole all of a sudden a homeless lady was beside me handing me a note written on a small cocktail napkin. In the note she was asking for money. I was so thrown off and felt incredibly awkward. I don't think our young waitress noticed that this was happening because the homeless woman scurried away before our waitress appeared again. Finally our food came out. They look so tasty and it was! It also was way hot temperature wise. The crispy shell was filled with steak and cheese. Plus it was piled with more guacamole, sour cream and pico. Also, the enchilada sauce pulled it all together. Yummy!!! 

We left with full tummies! The service is pretty good here and the food is wonderful. I love random hole in the wall places like this. If you love authentic Mexican food check out Maribels!
