We received complimentary house made tortilla chips with two delicious salsas and a black bean dip plus small bowls containing cumin seeds and coriander that have been roasted.  We started off sharing a nopales salad (not so crispy cactus with diced tomatoes, sweet corn, pearl onions and cilantro that was dressed in light vinaigrette and finished with queso fresca and pine nuts).  Ann chose the Quajillo scallops as an entrée; scallops with a spicy quajillo chili rub that were sautéed and finished with sweet corn, caramelized onions and sundried tomatoes.  Not to be outdone, I ordered Mole Negro Oaxaqueno (a large portion of grilled chicken covered in Mom's, actually his mother-in-law's, deep brown mole and fried plantains).   We concluded this bountiful feast by sharing a flan Napolitano with homemade caramel and whipped cream.
