The food I give three stars, the service four. The chips, salsa, & bean dip is great. The nachos were good too, though the cheese could have been melted a little more & not clumpy. I didn't try anything else after that, and my friends said their plates were just okay. I really would love to count the food in my four star rating since they practically have everything for a cheap price (fried ice cream, pancakes, and a breakfast menu at a mexican restaurant?!), but the quality is just okay.

Our server however was amazing. It did take a minute for us to be seated and get drinks, but our server was nothing but friendly and made us laugh. Drinks are awesome here! They definitely pack a punch, I would watch out for the mango margarita since they definitely load that up with plenty rum for you! Beers are dirt cheap, and the place was virtually empty when we went after hours. The bar seems to be the lively place to go when the restaurant is slow, and if you have a birthday, they'll come over with a guitar and sing happy birthday mexican style! ;)
