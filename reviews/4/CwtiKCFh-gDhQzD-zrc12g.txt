This restaurant appears to be well known to the locals but hidden to tourists. We just happened to find it when visiting and were pleasantly surprised. 

The waiter and others on staff were very friendly. I had the spinach con papas (potatoes) enchilada with rice and black beans and my husband had the veggie fajitas. Both dishes were delicious and plentiful. We were served 2 salsas, both homemade and delicious. The chips were good. I had a frozen margarita that was just average. I wouldn't order it again, but would try on the rocks. The flavor was ok, but I had lots of shaved ice left over. 

We made special dietary requests (vegan) and they were happy to accommodate us. 

We ate in the bar and it was fun. They had a jukebox with every type of music that you can imagine and TVs. It's not a fancy place, but very homey, comfortable, and affordable.
