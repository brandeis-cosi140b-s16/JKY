It was a trek out to this side of town for me, but there are definitely some awesome hole-in-the-wall Mexican places in this neighborhood. La Playita is no exception, though I will note that they seem to specialize in seafood options.

CHIPS & SALSA: Thick and salty chips, fresh and mild red salsa, it's good but don't fill up on this.
EMPANADAS ($8): start with an appetizer of these, cooked perfectly with a flakey exterior and a good portion of filling. Order of 4 is available with chorizo and cheese or shrimp.
SHRIMP TACO ($3): available fried or "not fried", which comes in a warm tomato sauce almost like a seafood stew. Small in size but packed with flavor.
TOSTADA DE DEVICHE MIXTO ($5): generous portion of fresh ceviche, heavy on the octopus, topped with avocado. Simple and bright, not too acidic.

Interior is clean, small, and homey, decorated with a nautical motif. Service was friendly and fluently bilingual. Glad that this place is NOT a cash-only establishment!
