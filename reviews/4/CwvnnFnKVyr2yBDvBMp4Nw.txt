After a horrible attempt of our group of 10 trying to eat at Maggiano's (see my review - not customer friendly!), we decided to check out El Segundo Sol which was right below Maggiano's.  The hostess was making conversation with us and after my husband mentioned to her what had happened at Maggiano's, the hostess was in shock.  She said that they will take care of us and they sure did. 

We sat in the "Tequila Room" a private room with a long table and had the best service.  When the server brought us two huge bowls of fresh, tableside made guacamole and two huge platters of chips and salsa, I was confused and asked who ordered all this.  The server said it was on the house! 

Our server was friendly, on top of it and made sure our glasses were never empty.  The busboy made sure our table was clear of any dirty dishes and the manager came by a couple to times to check on us.  Everyone was happy with their food.  They had a special that included a cheese enchilada, chicken tostada and fish taco with rice and beans.  Even though we were originally craving some pasta, this was a true blessing in disguise.  We felt like VIPs and will definitely go there again!
