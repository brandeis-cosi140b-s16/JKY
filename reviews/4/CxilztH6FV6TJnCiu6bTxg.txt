I give this place four stars because sadly, this is the best Mexican place within 20 minutes of our house. The food is actually pretty good. It is the type of restaurant where you order at a counter and get your own drinks, they even have a drive-thru, so I find the prices a bit steep for what you get. If the prices were lower, I would give it 5 stars. Overall, I would recommend it.
