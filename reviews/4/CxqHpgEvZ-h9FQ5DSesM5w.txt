First time at a Chipotle. Line was crazy long! I almost turned around but decided to tough it out. The system moves people through quickly,  and the wait is definitely worth the wait. 

Got myself a barbacoa burrito. The thing was as big big as my forearm. 

Two of these bad boys and two beer for $22! What the!!!? Smoking deal! 

Check it out fo' sho'!
