Though not much has survived long in this location (going way back to La Bamba and continuing through the fruit and veggie stand), the Taqueria Express has managed to eke out an existence for some time.

Please note: When they say "express", it does not necessarily mean what you think it means. While service isn't really slow, it's not fast food - it's more like "sparse" or "simple" than "fast".

That doesn't mean that it's bad - quite the contrary, in fact. What you get isn't bad at all, just be prepared for what you're getting (and perhaps brush up on some Spanglish, because there isn't a lot of English spoken in these parts).

What they really need to do is open a quick-serve window to the park and ride and I suspect they would do really well.
