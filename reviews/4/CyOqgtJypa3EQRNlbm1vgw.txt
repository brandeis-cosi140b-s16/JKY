I went here with my mother.  It was our first visit.

I was not prepared for the buffet dining style.  It took me by surprise.

The place was fairly small and there was a heavy crab leg/seafood aroma in the air.

I ordered the all-you-can-eat hotdog option for $8.99 and my mom order a single specialty dog for about $1.90.  Why is this place so cheap!?

I tried a Nathan's hotdog, followed by a Hebrew National, and then a jalapeno brat.  I was also provided with a side of onion rings and tater tots.  For dessert, we dined on some soft serve ice cream.

I ate WAY too much.

The food wasn't bad.  I don't really have anything to complain about, but something about the place made me nervous.

I think it was because there is an extreme amount of disarray.  My mind needs order and I was trying to make sense of the chaos around me.

I am also not accustomed to buffet restaurants.

All-in-all, not a bad little place.

Try it at least once.
