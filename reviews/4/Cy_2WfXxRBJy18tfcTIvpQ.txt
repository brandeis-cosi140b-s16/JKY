Crazy how much their menu prices have increased throughout the years but even with that said, I continue to come back. In the north side of town, sketchy corner of Pecos and Washinton but this place is worth every penny! 

This place has earned bragging rights I must say. Their shrimp ceviche is BOMB-BAY! Fish Tacos-BOMB, Fried Fish Fillet-BOMB, Everything-BOMB! 

Need to say more?.....

Atmosphere: Here's the kicker....the live band/mariachi guys are ANNOYING! It is SO flipping loud to the point where you cannot hear the person sitting next to you. These guys are part of a soliciting army that goes in there while you are looking through the menu and waiting on food. You have the custom made jewelry lady, the deaf/blind guy asking for donations, the bootleg CD guy, the charity chocolate kid, and the flower girl all at the same time trying to sell you goods...it's like waiting to cross the border into San Diego. 

Then you have the Paisas who want to eat you/undress you with one look. Very uncomfortable. 

But I promise the meal will be all worth it! ;-)
