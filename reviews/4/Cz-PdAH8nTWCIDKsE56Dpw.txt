This was my first time a Don Pedro's.  Let me just say if you are hungry they will defiantly take care of you!  The portion size are HUGE! I was not a fan of the salsa but we ordered the cheese dip.  Our food came out just as ordered and we all had plenty to take home for lunch the next day.  Our waitress was very good and even took the time to talk to my daughter as she is taking Spanish in school.  Very good experience and will go back.
