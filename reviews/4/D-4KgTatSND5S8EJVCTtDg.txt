Since learning about Hussong's Cantina while in Ensenada, MX a month ago and visiting the Original location opened in 1892 I have been a fan of this place as a bar establishment. 
Finding out that there was another location (Mandala Bay) here in Vegas was very exciting but driving through Boca Park and seeing Hussong's in an old restaurant location I had previously visited I was more than EXCITED!! 

Walking up to Hussong's there is a visible outside covered Patio location with Bar Tops and a few 2-4 seating tables, patio is not super big and on this day when we arrived it was somewhat empty but filled very quickly. 

Walking into the restaurant we were quickly greeted by a hostess/server that asked us if we had been here before. I said no only the one in Mexico. She then proceeded to tell us how to order food/drinks from the walk up counter and we would be given a table # Flag, then we could sit anywhere we like and the food/drinks would be brought out. 

*TIP: Be sure to tell the staff when ordering you would like to keep your tap open if you want more drinks. 

We did not order food but certainly ordered The Original Margarita to see if it lived up to its Standard in Mexico! Drinks were on Happy Hour Special 3-6pm M-F. 

As we sat on patio the drinks were quickly severed and they were certainly strong and tasty! Not quite as strong as the Mexico drinks, however, in there defense, that was Mexico :-)

The food looked good and will certainly be back to try that! There is a center bar located inside the restaurant along with a few TV's which has sports playing at the time. 

Again, I am fan overall and happy this place is near by at Boca Park, next to Pink Berry and Total Wine and Spirits.
