Came here with a large group after a day of tubing on the Salt. The bartender did a great job of accommodating any request we had and the happy hour prices were great!

For dinner I had the Camarones Verdes, a delicious shrimp and poblano chile dish that was not only pleasing to the tongue but also to the eye. Every part of the dish was perfect - the green rice was beautifully plated and deliciously spiced with the poblanos. Every piece of shrimp was cooked just right and so flavorful.

We were admittedly a large and rowdy crowd but were treated nicely and our service was great. Thankfully there was another large group (baby shower??) in the same room as us so we weren't the only loud ones in the place. Our young and obviously new server told me it was the first time he'd ever served such a large party and I can say he was GREAT! He honored all requests and kept his wits and sense of humor about the whole thing and our crazy group!

Los Gringos Locos was a welcome spot for us after a long day in the sun and a place I'd be happy to come back and visit.
