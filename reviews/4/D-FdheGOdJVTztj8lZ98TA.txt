What an adorable little gem off the beaten path! I recently moved to the area and have driven by many times. I saw the sign but had no idea this place was a restaurant! 

Situated between a mini-farm and a small business, it took me a few drive-bys to discover this was indeed a restaurant. My mom and I are pretty particular about Sonoran Style Mexican food and this place passed the test! I only gave 4 stars though, because it took a few minutes for a server to come to our table--not a big deal because I understand they were busy. And though the food was as my son says, "super-licious" it was pretty heavy on the salt.

Chips, salsa, and bean dip were so yummy! 

 I can't wait until the weather gets just a little bit cooler to sit out on the patio with my hubby and sip margaritas under the stars by the fireplace. Ahhh, sounds pretty romantical!
