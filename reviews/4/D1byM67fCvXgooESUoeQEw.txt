TQLA welcome to the Valley; glad you are in the SE Valley.   I went there today; much to my delight it  is a great place.   Had their TQLA Combo lunch @ $9.95.  Great tasting food.   Their chips and salsa [both dark & light green] are wonderful.  Bet you can not eat just one chip.    Also had their Flan; out of this world.       I will be going back.    Great to have this caliber of restaurant in the area.   A great addition.    It is a winner and looking forward to my next visit.   Have been back several times since my first visit.   Have not been disappointed with their service or food.   Especially like their salsa's.  Hush puppies and their desserts are fabulous.
