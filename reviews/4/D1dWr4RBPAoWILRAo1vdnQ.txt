I'm sure there have been plenty of reviews for Macayo's Mexican food.  It's a very popular and reasonably priced place to get a good meal.  They have a nice atmosphere for large groups as well.  There have been many many evenings after bike riding in circles for about 2 hours when the bike bunch went for tacos and chimis to refuel..... but the BEST thing on the menu after a long hot ride for my money is the frozen Raspberry Margarita.

Macayo's sells the first jumbo margarita in large politically inappropriate mugs that look like ethnic stereotype effigies.  These can be brought back for refills of the frozen salty sweet drink each visit.  In my opinion, they are well worth it....
