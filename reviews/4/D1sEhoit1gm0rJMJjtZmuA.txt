I can't complain.  My new favorite Mexican food restaurant!  Everything is delicious!  Carne Asada, chicken and al pastor meats are delicious.  Price to add guacamole is stupid, $2+ & they are shady with the guacamole.   Its a thin layer, for $2 it should be a hefty scoop.  
Anyways, whatever you get...its good.  

I worked in the tip industry and when I didn't get a tip I would be quick to dish out a sarcastic thank you.  The cooks do the same...LOL!   

Salsa bar is awesome!  

They should give out some chips like they do at Pepes when you order in.

The owner is pleasant on the eyes.
