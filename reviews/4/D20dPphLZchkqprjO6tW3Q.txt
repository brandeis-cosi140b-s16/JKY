so I went here earlier today and I just loved the food. it really tastes like my grandmother made it. my one complaint would be that the soda machine is broken and only spat out that gross soda water.  how are you gonna have great Mexican food and not wash it down with a nice cold soda? so there ya go. do I recommend this place? hell yes but go and pick up a drink before.
