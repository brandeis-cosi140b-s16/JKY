We visited for the first time today and really enjoyed it! Great chipotle hot sauce, green tomatillo hot sauce & plenty of chips. I had very good shrimp quesadillas & the hubs had ground beef nachos that we may have finished if we hadn't eaten so many chips!
I had the skinny margarita & the hubs had the house. We'll definitely go back. Have absolutely paid more for less elsewhere! Oh, and good service!
