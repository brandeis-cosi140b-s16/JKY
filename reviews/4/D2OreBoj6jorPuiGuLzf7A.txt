This hole in the wall joint serves up some serious Mexican Seafood.  If you are missing your last Rocky Point vacation come here and you will be reminded about how great Mexican seafood tastes.  

The shrimp cocktail and fish dishes all taste good.  This is the best place for Mex Seafood in the Phoenix area, which isn't saying much but hey beggars can't be choosers.  I'm just happy that I live close this gem :)
