Awesome mom and pop shop. Recommend to me by my very favorite hotel concierge Angelica. 
Wonderful food. Not just because of the large portions but because the food is spectacular. I had the verde pork with the homemade tortillas beans and rice. Enough for two meals by the way. 
Great place for lunch or dinner if you are a true Foodie !!!
