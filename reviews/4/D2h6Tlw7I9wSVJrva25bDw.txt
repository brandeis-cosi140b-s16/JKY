We had dinner here last Saturday with our son and grandson.  My husband and I each had one of the Quesadillas de Maiz which is on the appetizer menu.  This is made with a huge and thick corn tortilla, filled with meat and sauce, topped with more sauce and crema and it's very tasty. We took half of it home for lunch the next day.  It cost only $5.50.  Our son had the Torta Norteno.  We learned that Tortas are basically sandwiches served on Hogie type bun.  The bun is very tasty. The grandson had the Torta del Rey which has a crazy list of things in it like ham, pork sirloin, beef, an omelet---and on and on.  These sandwiches are so big that half of them went home for the next day.
We ordered the Tres Leches cake for dessert.  The presentation on that rivaled any fancy place you might eat at.  And it was delicious!
The service was excellent.  If only all restaurants had this quality of service.
     They serve only non-alcoholic beverages but they have Margaritas and Pina Coladas.  You just have to bring your own bottle.  
     When you walk in you will see TV monitors on Spanish speaking channels and hear lots of Spanish but don't be put off by this, our waitress spoke perfect English.
    We'll go there again soon.
