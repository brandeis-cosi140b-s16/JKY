The ambience akin to sports bar doesn't quite go together with this place being a Mexican restaurant. The food however, is exceptionally authentic and marvelously delicious.  Starting out with chips and salsa, but here's the unique twist. The chips are comprised of conventional corn chips, but also green chips that are made from flour. The green chips do taste as though they were made in-house, fresh out of the chef's domain.

The drinks are large enough for 2 if not 3. They are mixed superbly with just the right amount of alcohol balanced with fruit juice.

I had their street tacos and the taste reminded me of this restaurant in Texas with all the unique flavours of street tacos should. Another person in our party ordered their empanada dish and that too was excellent. 

The portions were not too large but enough to satisfy the pallet in more ways than one. Throughout the dish, I could not see any grease that is considered as the norm in Mexican dish. The dishes were well presented and well placed.

As I stated earlier, had the restaurant resembled less of a sports bar and more of Mexican casa, I would have given 5 stars.
