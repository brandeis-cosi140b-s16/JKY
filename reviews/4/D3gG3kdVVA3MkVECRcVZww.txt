This place is a whole lot better than you would think. Although it is a chain restaurant the stewed meat they use seems homemade and they give you a giant amount on their tacos. If you want some great cheap Mexican food in a hurry you could do a lot worse. The burritos are beyond huge and everything is very tasty. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Also, choice of a free cookie or small ice cream for dessert.
