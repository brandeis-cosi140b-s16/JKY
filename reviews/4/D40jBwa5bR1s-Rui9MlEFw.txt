i don't know if i would have to do a review for chiptole because everyone already knows how delicious chipotle is.  

i think this particular location is pretty good though.  they are normally generous with the portions and the food is always fresh.  i will forever try to avoid the location by the lv outlet mall on lv blvd - we both found hairs in our food last time we went and they somehow got our burrito bowls soupy.

anyways, yeah - compared to some of the other locations we've tried in vegas, this one is pretty solid!
