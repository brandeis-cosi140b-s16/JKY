I'm a flight attendant and was in PHX on a layover this week.  A local friend recommended Macayo's.  After reading the reviews here I was skeptical of trying it.  I have to say I was really pleased with it.  I received great customer service.  The food was really good and who can complain with $2 beers and a nice patio?  I ordered the fried green tamale appetizer and it was really good.  I liked the chips and salsa.  The table next to me ordered the poblano chicken and the baja burrito and they looked really good from my vantage point.  I would def. go back.
