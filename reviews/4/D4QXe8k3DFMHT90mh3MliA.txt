I also prefer this place to Taco Bell any day. 

This specific location is open 24 hours a day. As far as I know, there is not a 24 hour Taco Bell in town (again, as far as I know). So if I preferred Taco Bell, I couldn't access it whenever I wanted, thumbs down. 

The #5 is an excellent choice. Two big fat chicken tacos, fries, and a drink. Or, you could go with a #4, two chicken tacos, fries, and a drink. Yes I like their chicken tacos. Both combos are satisfying to my tummy. Even their hot sauce is hotter and tastier! 

I will continue to go to Del Taco when that late night craving takes over.
