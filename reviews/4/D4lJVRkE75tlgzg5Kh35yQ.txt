We had a big group of people that ended up at Vida last night for drinks & dinner.  We were a pretty wild bunch, but the servers took care of us and kept the food & drinks flowing for us.  After having a couple of margaritas, I ended up having a chicken taco with a side of black beans. Kudos to Vida for keeping up with a demanding (& probably obnoxious) group!
