Visited this Filiberto's sports grill twice, once during the first week of opening and the other probably a month after. 

The do own up to the sports grill name they have tv's on almost ever inch of their walls and have all sorts of sport memberbilia. The space inside is fairly small so during the weekend it can get pretty busy and packed, and might not be ok for kids. The reason I say this is because of the way some women are dressed during the later times of the night. 

They do offer some of the menu items that you can get at a Filiberto's, burritos, carne asada fries, and super nachos. As well as your typical bar food. 

Over all it's a good place to go grab a beer and hang out.
