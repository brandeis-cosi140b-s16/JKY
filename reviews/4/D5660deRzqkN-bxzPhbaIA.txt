I'm a little embarrassed to say it, but the quesadilla was so delicious that I'm thinking about eating another as I write this review. We ordered the shrimp ceviche, which was a little light on shrimp and flavor. But we also got some street tacos that were good and the chips and salsa were flavorful too.
