The food gets a solid five. Service a 3-3 1/2. Service wasn't bad, it was just busier than I think they expected. It's small, and a bit crowded, but worth it.

This was my second visit. This time I had the mol√© quesa.  OH MY GOODNESS! Amazing.  It was so big I had to take half home. 

The salsa are great. Love the creamy cilantro salsa and the strawberry salsa. Try the guacamole with mangoes.
