This is the closest Roberto's to my office and it's fairly similar to every other Roberto's in town. It's not the nicest one in terms of decor, but I doubt you go to Roberto's for the interior decorating. The menu and pricing is exactly the same as every Roberto's in Vegas. The one thing to note is that there is no bathroom available to customers. For a dine in restaurant, that's quite odd. You may need to wash your hands before eating, but you won't be able to here. And considering this is Mexican food, you may need to hit up the bathroom immediately after eating, but you won't be able to here.
