Wish it was a little closer to home but still close enough for a dinner night here and there. Nothing that will blow you away, but just the simple things done well.  I had a carnitas plate, normally you get maybe 3 tacos out if a plate style dish, but I was able to get 5 tacos out of the food on the plate!!! Their horchata is good, not too sweet or milky or too much cinnamon. The carnitas were well flavored, had a nice crisp, and not dry . My girlfriends carne asada was good too. Definitely coming back.
