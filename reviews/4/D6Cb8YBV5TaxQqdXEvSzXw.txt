Not my first trip into the Rio world, but despite a pretty inexperienced and fresh faced staff, the food was still solid as usual. At $7.99 for a burrito that can last two meals it is well worth the price. I always get my salsa on the side and I like the pico, the hot green sauce (better in the frig) and the medium cold salsa. They throw cheese on top now for free so that was an easy addition and the silverware and napkin area is a great place to stock your own kitchen. They have daily specials, but apparently the only thing special is you get a free soda, but no price cut. I used to upgrade to the grilled chicken, but the stewed version is better most of the times. Tortillas are still made fresh too, so this is a good chain.
