OMG I loved this place! I wish I could have tried more food on the menu, but I guess that will be next time I visit Old Town Scottsdale :).

The happy hour specials are every day, $3.50 margaritas.  Aye carumba!  They were big too.  I was hungry and they have 1/2 price apps.  I didn't order any but got a fajita salad which comes in this ginormous taco shell.  It was SO GOOD and I had the best dressing, creamy jalapeno.  It even had hockey playoffs on - Pittsburgh vs Philly.  I'm in love, I'm all shook up.
