This is a great roasted chicken meal.  If you don't have time to do it yourself, then coming in to pick up one the meals combos is  not a bad idea.  The prices are reasonable and the sides are not so bad.  But the best part of the meal is the tortillas, they are unbelievable.  My husband and I often eat low carb and so buying a meal allows us to eat the chicken, but smelling the tortillas will often be too tempting, so we always ask they do not include them, thus eliminating the temptation.
