Headed here because of other positive Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. As a home-grown, small town white chick, I can't verify the authenticity of the food, but it sure tasted good!

We have been there for lunch and for a quick dinner and both times it was not at all busy and we got our food right away. The atmosphere is super casual. If you are looking for someone to smile warmly and seat you upon entering you should pass on by, but if all you want is some cheap, quick, tasty food, you've found your place.
