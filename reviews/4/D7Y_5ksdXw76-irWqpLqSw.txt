I come here a couple times a week for lunch or dinner, and I've never had a bad experience. The food is good, and the service is great.

I'm not sure of his name, but there is one guy, who appears to be the owner or manager, who is always very friendly and welcoming who occasionally works the line. The other workers don't go out of their way to be very friendly, but it's not like they are rude.

It's probably one of the better Chipotles I've been to, in terms of service and food, and I've been to plenty (even out of state).
