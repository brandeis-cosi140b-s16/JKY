We had a lot things to get done in Downtown on a Saturday - and ended up starving at about 3 PM.  As usual, our conversation about where to go eat was taking place in a decision-making void.  "What do you want?" "I don't know", "Dona Maria's?", "um", "Chicago Joe's?", "eh"...we had just about given up and were headed back to the 'burbs when we passed Main.  "El Sombrero?"

YES!

We had first tried El Sombrero when we first moved to Vegas from LA about 9 years ago.  At the time, although I LOVED the building and the history, I found the food didn't live up to my LA-grown Mexican food snobbery. Nine years later, I think I've changed my mind.  

As we poured over the menu, the waitress (pretty sure the owner) graciously said we could still order off of the lunch menu, even though we were late for it.  Nice.  She also suggested a whole bunch of combos when she found out that we don't eat pork or beef as a rule.  They don't have much (or any?) vegan dishes, so I broke my 7 month moratorium on meat and splurged on a chicken taco / cheese enchilada combination.  

The taco, although served in a hard shell, tasted great.  The beans were top notch too. The enchilada sauce had almost a cinnamon flavoring to it I couldn't quite place. Pretty different to any other enchilada sauce I have had - and after reading other Yelp reviews I think I know why.  My palate was an LA palate that hadn't been exposed to much New Mexico style food, so I initially judged it harshly due to my inexperience. (tsk, tsk)  Lesson learned.

The service was kind and welcoming, the ancient building kept immaculately clean on the interior.  Loved everything about this place.
