Not healthy or remotely good for you, but still... it's really yummy.  Nothing special in regards to a dining experience and they kind of treat you like cattle, but that's just their style.  They get food out to lots of people fast.  This is a good place for a quick lunch.

They close early on Sunday- which is really annoying!
