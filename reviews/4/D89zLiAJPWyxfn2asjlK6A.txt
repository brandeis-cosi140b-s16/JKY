La Tolteca is owned by the same people who own Aranda's in De Forest, one of our favorite places to eat when we lived there.

We haven't dined in at La Tolteca yet, but we ordered our favorites from the menu for take-out and were not disappointed! The food was good, service was friendly, and the price is right.

La Tolteca is the place to beat for Mexican fare in Sun Prairie!
