After having spent a few years in SoCal, I got very used to little hole in the wall Mexican places.  They don't look like much, but do they ever have it where it counts when it comes to food.

I've eaten a fair share of Roberto's over here, but that's the biggest (only?) 'Bertos in town.  Sometimes, you need a change, and that's where Molcasalsa comes in.

This is good, whether you've had a few side libations, or are in need of a late night snack.

Everything is fresh and excellent.  The portions are plentiful.  The sides well compliment the numerous main entree options, the staff is super friendly, and the prices are great.  Everything I'll ever need from a hole in the wall taco shack.  I've been here a few times, and tried a few of their options, and nothing has disappointed.  And the service is always incredibly nice.

That said, don't be surprised if you pass by this place a few times.  It has a very unassuming sign and dark lighting from the street, and I've had to do some weird navigating to get there at times, even knowing where the place was.  So if you miss, it, just do a U-Turn.  It's at the forefront of that shopping center place.

But make no mistake.  This is good, cheap Mexican food, and it's great either dine in or take out.

It's nice to have some alternatives, and this fits the bill for that.
