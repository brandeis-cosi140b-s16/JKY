As a concert venue - 4 stars - easy to get to, friendly staff, affordable drinks, good sound and a stream of good acts.  A welcome addition to downtown PHX.

As a restaurant - 2 stars - and here's why:

The Good: the guacamole appetizer - holy deliciousness.  The best I've had in a long time.  Try it.

The Bad: The Ensalada Cortado - a salad with a variety of greens and corn nuts - sounds delicious but was doused in so much dressing it was almost like a soup.  Strangely sweet while at the same time void of flavor.  Who knew?

The Ugly: The Al Pastor Pork Burrito - where to begin...  Mostly just beans, and more beans, surrounding a few slabs of fat-laden, hard to chew pork.  Not to be crass but this little beauty forced me to hit the restroom 4 times before noon the next day.  So I guess what I'm saying is, you have been warned.

Summary: I'd go back to see a show any time however I'll be eating elsewhere first.
