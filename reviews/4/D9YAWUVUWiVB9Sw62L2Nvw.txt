If you are looking for a place that is affordable, clean, and pleasant - with no surprises - this is it. 

The parking lot was full on a Sunday evening, which we took as a good sign. Jon (my bf) and I were greeted by a looks-to-be-13-year-old hostess (not judging, just saying) who asked us if we wanted restaurant, bar, or patio.....we chose bar, which turned out to be a great choice.

The atmosphere was one of a traditional American sports bar. It was comfortable and open. Several tvs were on, and the background radio was country. A friendly blonde waitress had chips/salsa in front of us within 30 seconds of sitting down, and Jon had his High Roller margarita in front of him within 3 minutes.  I ordered the mahi mahi tacos on corn tortillas (which the waitress enthusiastically assured me are "very popular") and Jon got the shredded beef chimichanga combo meal.

I guess the perk of sitting in the bar section is that the staff is VERY attentive with the drinks. Our food came out pretty quickly, but not before Jon was able to finish a second High Roller margarita and order an "SOS - strawberry" for dessert. He's not even a margarita or "girly drink" person, but he said that this place was really impressive.

The food was served fresh on hot plates. I order fish frequently, and I can say that the mahi mahi in my tacos was pure happiness - light, refreshing, and humbling - kind of like when you see the ocean for the first time in years.  My only comment was that I wish there were something that could breathe more spice into the meal. Jon's chimichanga was also tender and flavorful, but it could have used more Mexican charm.

I'm not a connoisseur of Mexican cuisine, and I am the first to admit this. But it's hard to beat the following: good food, moderate price, wonderful service, clean and wholesome atmosphere.

I will definitely be back.
