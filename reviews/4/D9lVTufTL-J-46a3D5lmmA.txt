When I crave Mexican food but don't want something smothered in cheese and grease, I come to La Parilla Suiza.  I have been here several times, and everything I have had has been great. Most recently, I had a cup of the chicken and rice soup, and a fajita taco a la carte. My husband has the bistec (sp?) tacos. He really liked them.  This place is not too filling and yet you feel very satisfied. Its pretty cool too because you get to watch the guys making everything through one of those glass windows.
