I really like Chipotle. I like how its just simple and fast. My favorite meat here is the Barbacoa. I was quite surprised that it was so tasty and tender. This is my choice of meat here. Everything on the line is pretty good from the rice and beans to the salsa and chips. Rice at this location is perfectly cooked not to hard and not too mushy. you can taste the cilantro and a hint of lime. I have heard at other locations from a friend that they have overcooked it or maybe put too much water in it and that sucks. But anyway what you do is just walk along the counter and tell them what you want and they put it in a burrito or bowl for you. Easy. So they ask you if you want chips at the end. The chips are so good they are lightly salted with I believe sea salt and they have the right crunch to them. I only go to Chipotle for Chipotle food. Once in a while I say hmmm I feel like Chipotle. When I want Mexican food then I go to real Mexican food place or my mother in law or any of my friends house. I do have a white friend that cooks like a Mexican too. Well anyway Chipotle is nice for fast tasty food on your lunch break or happen to be out and about. Yes I am a fan :)
