I stopped by earlier to satisfy my craving for some tacos. The cashier suggested I order the Asada Plate instead, since it was only $1 more. I took his advice and was not disappointed. 

The beef was seasoned and cooked perfectly. It came with tortillas, rice and beans. The cost was $8.99 +tax. 

I will mos def come back to try their Tripe Tacos.
