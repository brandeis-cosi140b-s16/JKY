Back in the day when I was 'straight' my wife and I used to frequent this place regularly. The thing is when we lived in Surprise there wasn't much else besides chains and even then I had a good sense to avoid them.  So now that she and I are apart and still the best of friends, when I visit we still go here. It has to be one of the most consistent places Ive been too. 

They are more of a Mexican seafood place but don't be fooled.. they make a great carne asada quesadilla and the queso fundido con chorizo with fresh home made flour tortillas... so yummy it makes my chest hurt thinking about it! Also have a 99 cent margarita and daily beer specials.. be sure to try the refrieds, they have to make them with full on lard cause they are good and full of flavor!

Even though I'm a bit lighter in the loafers these days I still look upon the good times me and the Mrs had here.
