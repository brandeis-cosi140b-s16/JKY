Although I've never experienced it first hand, you always hear about the legendary Hispanic "kitchens" where you just drop in and for a small handful of dollars, they serve you meal of the day and it's always fantastic.  That's kind of what I envision when I think about La Loma Mexican Grille.
The Princess and I were invited to join a small gathering to attend Handel's Messiah concert in Litchfield Park and it would include dinner at the Hostesses favorite Mexican restaurant (she herself of Mexican descent).   Eight of us descended on the Grille to make sure we had enough sustenance to make it through a couple of hours of Holiday music.  We were not disappointed.
It's truly like going into someone's home. Very clean, the owners welcoming and gracious and the food is terrific.  Chip and Salsa come with the meal. I had the smothered "hot" burrito which was carne asada cooked with onions and jalapenos- excellent flavor!  Meal came with beans and rice which to my surprise were hot (temperature)-seems like the rice and beans at most Mexican restaurants are always half-cold.
The Princess had two tostados and they were monster sized!  Generous portions, very tasty, and well put together.  You can tell all of the ingredients are fresh here.
Yes, they serve on paper plates and plastic utensils-get over it as the food is well worth it.  This is genuinely another one of Phoenix's strip mall gems.  Looking forward to going back!
