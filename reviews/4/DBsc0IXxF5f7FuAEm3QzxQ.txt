Mole, Vicente Fernandez, and Walls Full of Tavo Barrios paintings. It will be Volver for Me! 

My boss made me eat here today. And it was good. 

Mole in Phoenix Mexican restaurants is not common. I'm sure a true foodie could tear up the mole chicken enchiladas at Rosita's Place. I rarely order enchiladas but had to try the mole. I found it slightly sweet, neither chile hot or ingredient/cooking bitter and I found my choice for lunch very good. The chips were light, unsalted, fresh and good. The red and green salsa served with them hot, but not too hot. Would I have a Canadian Phoenix newcomer eat Rosita's salsa and chips? It would depend on the Canadian. The beans and rice were good with no points to down them. I was offered a to-go cup for my ice tea as we left. Nice touch. 

Background music was Vicente Fernandez. That might have been the juke box choice. It gave a classic touch to lunch and wasn't too loud. We had company with us, and got a lot of talking and future cooperative efforts put together. 

Be careful of the fountain!  We heard stories of three unfortuante souls who weren't, two of them sober!  And that was during the minute it took to pay our tab and get out.  No split tabs by the way.  

Yes, I'll be back.
