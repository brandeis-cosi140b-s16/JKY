This is one of our go to places for Mexican food.  The food is pretty fast, and always tasty.  We have had the Carnitas plates and thought that was the best it would get.  But tonight we tried the Abodabo plate, and hands down, it is a new favorite.
Watch out for the green salsa, it sneaks up on you.  Tasty, but HOT.
