One of the last family owned and operated restaurants left in Las Vegas! I love the food and the service. 
Pros= home made tortillas, yummy beans and salsa and the sweet servers!
Cons=closed on Sunday, dinner salad is just shredded iceberg lettuce like what you would top tacos with, fried ice cream bland and blah.
