I ordered 4 hard shell tacos for 6.99. The meat, sauces, and toppings are set up like a chipotle. Everything is on display and I got to pick what I wanted on each taco. I was overwhelmed with all the options. There were 3 different seasoned chicken, beef, and pork options. It took me forever to decide and I was given samples to make it easier on me. I recommend the chicken mole meat. Seasoned perfectly.
