The food is good and the price is decent. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered myself a strawberry margarita and a plate of the habanero hot wings ($8) because I was curious about the dry rub.

The hot wings were hot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm a fan of hot hot wings so I was satisfied, but no one else at the table wanted to touch them. If you've ever ordered atomic hot wings from Wing Stop, they're not quite as spicy but they definitely compare. But enough about hot wings from a Mexican restaurant...

The margarita was really good. Wish I had one right now... I had bites of chicken nachos, a carne asada plate, and beef fajitas--delicious as well. The fresh guacamole is great, too, although I heard complaints about the endless chips being too salty.

I don't know if I would come back to Yolos since there are so many other places to try in Vegas, but I would recommend it to a first-timer looking for fairly-priced Mexican food on the strip.
