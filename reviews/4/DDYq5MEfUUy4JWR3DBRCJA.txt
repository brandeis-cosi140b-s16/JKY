Went to Filiberto's while visiting family over Thanksgiving. This was right down the road form the house so it was a great place to stop in and grab some food. It's unassuming in that is a in a strip mall and menu is plastered to the front entry but it's worth the trip in. 

I ordered a #7- Tostada and Taco Plate ($6.39). When it was ready I was shocked at how generous the portion was, esp for the price! The side of the rice and refried beans was so large, and those were just the sides. The tostada was really simple with beans and cheese and topped with lettuce but was really good with some added vegetables. The beef taco was really good but not like I had ever had before. It seemed that they assembled a soft taco with a spicy, cooked ground beef and cheese prior to frying the whole thing crispy.

BF and his dad had the #13 Chimichanga Plate ($7.09) and #17- Two Chili Rellenos Plate ($7.09), respectively. Both were large portions of food as well, enough for 2 people to share each one, which is why we had leftovers. BF has a side of guac with his plate, which was good, but a smooth texture (I prefer chunky)

Tons of food for great prices.
