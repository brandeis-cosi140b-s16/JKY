Every time I come here, I plan to order something new.....really....but I always end up with the original fish tacos. They're so good. Just a simple soft taco with shredded lettuce and a battered piece of fish. They give you a nice mild salsa and their yummy white sauce. They have a salsa bar if you want to add more spice .You can get just the tacos or a taco plate with two tacos and a choice of sides--rice, beans, chips. The plate and a drink come to under $10. Great for a quick lunch or dinner.
