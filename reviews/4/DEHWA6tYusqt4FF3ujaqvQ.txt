Another great breakfast at Cafe Tranquilo.  Try the Chorizo, Egg and Cheese Burrito with  a glass of hand squeezed OJ.  Then just before you leave, get a fresh lemonade, sweetend with sweet syrup to go. That will give you a charge for the morning!

Updates to staff have not affected the high quality of the breakfast service. The menu has achieved a great level of quality and consistency.
