I moved to Las Vegas from Phoenix where excellent Mexican food is very common. Which surprisingly, is not the case for Las Vegas. But alas, after almost 3 years in sin city and my search for a great Mexican spot has finally ended........and although i cant pronounce the name of this joint, it is delicious! and not over priced! Make sure to get the guacamole! (SP?)  Hand made to your taste, right at your table, just how it is suppose to be made! I have only been there on one occasion and it was packed, which is understandable, however i don't enjoy eating in overly crowded restaurants (which is the only thing holding back from a 5 star rating)
