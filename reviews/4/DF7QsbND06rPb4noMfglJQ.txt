My wife and I went there after a long day.  We showed up around 9:20PM and they close at 10:00PM.  The place was still busy and the welcome upon entering was warm.  My wife and I sat in an area that we felt was cramp, but it was adequate.  The chips and salsa were amazing.  The chips are homemade and you can tell which ones were on the bottom and top of the fryer basket by color and taste.  My wife ordered two ground beef tacos with rice and beans as she is a no non-sense woman.  The tacos were a bit greasy, and the flavor was lacking.  I ordered the Chimi A La Rellana which is a chimichanga topped with a chile cheese relleno.  I was asked if I wanted white, green, or red chili sauce and ground beef, shredded beef, or chicken.  I opted for the green chili sauce with the shredded beef.  I'm not much for presentation, but the chili was the same size as the burrito.  The flavor was blissful and warming.  You take a bite at first and all you get is a bit of sauce, deep fried tortilla, cheese, and green chili.  That is all you need, but no you have to move forwards and taste the beef.  The shredded beef must be stewed for many hours as it is very tender, moist, and flavorful.  I shall now wrap up this review with this last statement:  I will order the Chimi A La Rellana again with two eggs over easy on top next time or as a breakfast plate if possible.
