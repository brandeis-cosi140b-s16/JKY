This place continues to be tasty.  This time we had a Restaurant.com coupon for $25.  The problem with it you had to buy $50 worth of food in order to use it.  Well, for two of us that was a lot of food.  

We ordered a pitcher of margaritas.  That was $45 and it alcohol is not included in the coupon.  The margaritas were good but way too sugary.  So, I kind of felt sick after drinking them.  

The food was tasty as always and the chips and salsa good again just as described in my prior review.

We ended up getting an appetizer and dessert to round out the entree for the $50 charges.  We took the dessert back to the room and had it later.  I guess this was totally worth it as this was all we had for lunch and dinner was this meal.  So, all in all it was worth it.  However, next time I would recommend if you have one of those coupons take more people with you.

I'll be back again.
