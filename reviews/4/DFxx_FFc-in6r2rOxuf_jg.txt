Great food and a great value. Shrimp burrito and fish tacos are amazing. My wife had a chicken quesidilla and it looked awesome. Salsa bar is all fantastic and chips are crispy and not greasy.

Service is friendly and prompt. Really great healthy alternative to traditional Mexican food. 


The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the tables were not cleaned and I think there is some confusion in whether or not you are to clean your own plates off your table or not. 

Will definetly be b back.
