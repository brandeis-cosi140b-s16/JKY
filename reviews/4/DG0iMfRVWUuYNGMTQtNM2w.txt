We tried out T&T after catching a special on the Travel Channel and were not disappointed! I had the shrimp tacos and they were LOADED with shrimp. I posted  the pic of them on Facebook and everyone commented on how much shrimp there was!

I am pregnant and requested the server ask the bartender for a mocktail of some sort, and I was brought a huge glass of sweet and sour mix, which was a little disappointing. 

The artwork within the restaurant is just beautiful and inspiring. Our friends and my husband LOVED their grown up cocktails (they had ones featuring white peach and tequila).

We'd definitely recommend T&T and will go back in the future!
