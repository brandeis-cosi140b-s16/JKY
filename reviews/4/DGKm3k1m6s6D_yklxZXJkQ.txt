I love this place. The food and service has always been outstanding. I've been coming here for 2 years now. The table-side guacamole is the best! I think if you order the same simple stuff you can get anywhere (chimichangas, burritos...), there is not much difference. But if you order something a little different, like carne asada tacos, you will be pleasantly surprised.

I'm not much of a drinker, so I can't comment on the mixed drinks but they have Modelo on tap!
