Decent lunch spot in DTLV. 

Restaurant itself is always clean and the cashier and cook are always very friendly and courteous. 

So far, I've tried the chicken, steak, carnitas, and barbacoa tacos, they're all equally delicious, but beware, barbacoa tends to make the tortillas soggy so if you order an assortment of different meats like I do, eat the barbacoa first.

I always go with the taco special they have, which is a great deal. 4 tacos with beans, rice, and a drink for $8.99, service is always fast so I never have to wait long to receive my food, which is always a plus considering I only have a one hour lunch break. So if you're in the hood, definitely give Taco Rico a chance.
