Okay, you either hate the chips or you love them.  I love them!  We were pleased to see the new menu at Aunt Chilada's... finally some vegetarian options!  The patio is awesome, you can chill in the sun, enjoy cold beers, and play bocce.  Is it the best Mexican food?  No.  But it's tasty, and that combined with the patio makes Aunt Chilada's a great choice.
