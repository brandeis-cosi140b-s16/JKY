Like many eateries in the area, Tortas el Rey is found in a nondescript and definitely not-upscale commercial area. But the volume of the business witnessed by our lunch group (Rand H., Mike C., Robyn N., Arlin B., and me) is a testament to its popularity. With very good quality food and great prices, no wonder it is so popular. Make sure you're hungry when you come here because you get a lot of food, whether you order the tortas or the platters. And even if you're not hungry the wonderful aromas and great flavors will probably stimulate your appetite enough to make you finish what you are served. Los Reyes de la Torta, this similarly-named restaurant gives you some serious competition.
