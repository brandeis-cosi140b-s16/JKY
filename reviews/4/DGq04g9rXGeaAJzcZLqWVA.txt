Love Moe's, and this one is in a great location. Nothing beats the Moe Monday special with a side of queso. 

My only complaint is that the soda fountains aren't maintained well at all. They have two of the Freestyle Coke machines (the type with 3849384 drink combinations) but they're always out of half of their soda types and flavor syrups. Frustrating when I'm craving a Diet cherry vanilla Coke and the machine is out of one or all of the things that make that combination. Not to mention it makes the line even longer to get a drink, because people are slow enough as it is to decide what they want! 

Also, one time I submitted a customer service complaint because the woman at the cash register was very rude and wouldn't accept my Foursquare check-in coupon (she no longer works there, the girl who is always at the register now is super nice) and a manager called and was very apologetic and offered to mail me some Moe Bucks. It was a nice gesture in theory, but then the Moe Bucks never came. Lame. I love Moe's to much too stop going there, though, and this location is so convenient to my office!
