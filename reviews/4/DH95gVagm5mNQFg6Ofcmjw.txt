Hubs got the asada tacos I got the pozole. Tacos we're greAt but pozole tasted like they forgot to put seasoning in it. No flavor. I added green Chile from the salsa bar and it was great after that! I've had the pozole here before and it was delicious. Wish they had some specials on tacos. We got the 4 tacos, pozole and a drink snd it came to 17.00 A little pricy for a little hole in the wall Mexican place. We'll be back here.
