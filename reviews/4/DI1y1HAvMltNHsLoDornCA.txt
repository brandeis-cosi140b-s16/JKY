Grabbed some "fatty" carnitas tacos to-go with extra cilantro, lime, onion, and tomato.  I have to say they were pretty delicious with a bit of gristle (in my mind, that's a good thing).  The fact that you can get them in the wee hours of the morning bumps this place up on The List.  

What amused was that we went around 10:30am the day of the first home ASU game of the year and people were already getting drunk before the the kitchen opened.  Regardless I'll definitely keep this in mind the next time I'm around.
