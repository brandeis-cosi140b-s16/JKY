After hearing about the unique menu here, I decided to drag my friends to try it out. The four of us were pretty impressed with our first visit. 

The restaurant is on the smaller size, but cozy with inviting decor. 

I ordered the Hibiscus Margarita which was a nice variation from the traditional margarita I always order. My only complaint is that this particular margarita is served in a martini glass, where as the other margaritas are served in larger margarita glasses. They were all the same price, not sure why they varied on size. 

The tacos were amazing. There are also so many vegetarian options to pick  from! Between the four of us, we had the Santa Cruz, Calamari, Salmon, Cuban, Mushroom and Trout tacos. The fact that there is a glossary in the back of the menu to explain certain ingredients really shows how unique the flavorful combinations really are. We are always looking for new foods to try, so this was perfect for broadening our horizons. Picky eaters may not be a fan, however. There is nothing plain on this menu!

Our bill was almost $140.00 between the four of us, so this is definitely not a place you go to frequently if you can't afford to spend $30+/person on one meal. It is much better for a treat every once in a while.
