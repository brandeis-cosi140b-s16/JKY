Rubio's is my go to food court choice. Chicken taco platter for me, with beans. The tacos are good, not the best in town but good. The beans are good and their chips are good. It's good. They have several salsas to choice from, a picante, a regular red salsa, a tomatillo salsa and a hotter salsa that I've never paid attention to. All are good but their regular red salsa is a little on the sweet side, which is not what I want my salsa to taste like. But again over all a decent taco.
