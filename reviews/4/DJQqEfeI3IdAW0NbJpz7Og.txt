My first time!  Your first time is always a little scary, but when it makes the hair stand up on your arms (and elsewhere) you are truly hoping you have found a love to be savored. 

That's how I felt about my first time with Rubio. Rubio's is a new love (fast food) that is better than just about every other choice within a five mile radius. Some have been ok, some have been good . . . and others have been downright unsatisfying! 

Rubio is fresh and, oh so savory! My first time was quick and very satisfying. Boot scooting boogie good!
