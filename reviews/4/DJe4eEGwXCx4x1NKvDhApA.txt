I've been eating here since I was a little girl and not much has changed. The food is really good for the price. Sometimes they have their bad days, chips are stale, salsa taste like straight tomato sauce, but overall the food is yummy. 

Some of my favorite dishes include the beef tacos, borracho burro, and the tamale especial. You can't go wrong with those picks. I also have to mention that their michaldas are so good but a bit on the spicy side. 

Fridays and Saturday nights get busy so don't be surprised to wait 15-20 minutes for a seat. Ponchos is on the top of my list for favorite restaurants!
