When I lived in Scottsdale, I used to hit up Los Betos about 3-4 times a month.  I always ordered a Carne Asada Quesadilla, with sour cream. After a while, they got used to me ordering it, and would wave to me through the drive thru window. Apparently, I was the only one who ordered this.

Anyways, I got to know the staff, even though I couldn't really communicate with them but through broken English and gestures.  Friendly crew.  Plus, they alway accomodated me with extra hot sauce containers, and I always threw them an extra few bucks.

That quesadilla is heaven on earth.  Someone else posted about 'being in love,' and I can relate.  I seriously cannot go more than a month without one, as I live in Chandler now.  But I make it to Scottsdale once in a while, and every time I do, EVERY time, I stop at Los Betos.  

You put a spell on me.
