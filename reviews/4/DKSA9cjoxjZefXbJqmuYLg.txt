Having a rough day?  Cheese dip cures most ills.

I have been an Azteca semi-regular for many, many years.  I work close to the Woodlawn location and me and co-workers head over for cheese dip and a quick, yummy lunch at least once a month (sometimes at least once a week if work is particularly stressful).  

Located on Woodlawn, near the 77 exits, the parking in front can be a little difficult during peak lunch times, but there is parking all way around the hotel that is adjacent.  Typical decor for a mexican restaurant and includes booths and wooden chairs at tables.  They can accommodate large parties if the tables are slid together.  

Lunch portions are a good size and a good price.  I think everything is under $7 and for the most part the lunch specials are served with refried beans and rice.  I have had the burritos (chicken, beef and shredded beef), chimichangas (chicken and beef), flautas (chicken and shredded beef), fajitas (usually steak), quesadillas, etc.  Everything is standard fare, nothing spectacular, but very consistent.  We can always get in and out in under an hour.  The wait staff is friendly and quick with refills on drinks and chips.  

Good beer and margarita selections.  They have a full bar, although usually the folks I go with stick to beer.  

If you go for dinner, it is slightly more expensive (naturally), but the portions are RIDICULOUSLY big.  My food looked like it came on a serving tray instead of a plate.  I ate maybe half of what was served, and I am a big ole girl that likes to eat.  A lot. 

As an occasional treat, we split an order of churros for dessert.  Several cinnamon sugar coated deep fried sticks served with ice cream and syrup.  YUM!  Super sweet, and cures the bad habit craving if you can't have booze for lunch to salvage an otherwise craptastic day.  

This is a great place for a quick, dependable, inexpensive lunch.  And if you are starving, it's a great  place for dinner too.
