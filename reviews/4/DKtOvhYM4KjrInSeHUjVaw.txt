So I would normally rate this place as wonderful, always have great service. Except today I came in like I always do to get a quesorito. (Quesadilla/burrito) 
And this young kid proceeds to TELL ME that next time he would prefer I come in before their rush house so HE doesn't have to take time making my quesorito! 
UMM EXCUSE ME? What I do in my personal time is nome of your business and YOU are supposed to ACCOMODATE To the customer...not the other way around. I was so furious with this rude comment that I just had to leave a review; it completely upset me the whole time will eating my food. If you are the manager and see this review make sure you talk to your employee about Customer Service and Respect!

*but as we were leaving another worker came up and said he would fix that problem. So I still give this place 4 stars.
