Chips and salsa was good... bummer they ran out of chips.. the three item combo is best value in the valley.. possibly the state.. can't find this quality of food west of the new mexico border. The relleno rivaled some of the better ones I have had at home. The taco was filled with genuine shredded roast that was tender and hot. A tiny point off for the premade taco shell. The enchilada sauce lacked some zip but was hot and filled with cheese and onion. 

The chimichangas were loaded with quality shredded  beef or delicious chicken either was great.. the green sauce on the chicken was tomatillo based.. I would opt out of the sauce and let the gucamole shine. 

This place is a ridiculous value... I will be back sooner than later.
