I was stuck in Phoenix on business and had a late night craving.
Nothing was open except Fast Food after 10pm.  I did not want Fast Food Chain Fast Food... bleh...

Then I yelped, and Yelped pointed me and my rental car in this direction...

Could it be? Could it be Arizona's loosely semi chained fast cheap greasy mexican food like Alertos and Albertos and Los Primos of the OC?! COULD IT?! ANSWER ME!!!

Well I tried it out, and was not disappointed.

I tried the Patron's Burrito... SO GOOD and BESTEST combo burritto I've ever eaten anywhere!
I tried the Carnita's Burrito... It was ok, have had better.
I tried the Egg and Chorizo burrito... It was good.
(Yes, this was all in one trip, in one night, for one person... I was hungry...)

All in all It wasn't comparable to my memories of Alertos in FV during the HS years, but it was as good as it gets in the middle of the Arizona desert @ 1am.  And that is all I needed.
