Ah burrito bowls. You can pick your meat, your salsa, your veggies and your cheese. Load it up how you want it.
Is it authentic Mexican? No, but who cares. It's good and possibly healthy. But the main point is it's good.
The line always moves pretty good. Although it can get loud in there so you might have to yell your choices. It is a little pricey but so much better the dollar burritos from some other place so it is worth it.
Good for lunch or dinner. So get some steak or carnitas and enjoy.
Extra point because they have Coke Zero on tap. Every place gets an extra point if they have Coke Zero on tap.
Also if you order on line you just walk in, skip the line, pay and you are on your way.
