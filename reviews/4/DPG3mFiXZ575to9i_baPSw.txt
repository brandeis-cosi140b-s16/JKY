This is now the closest location (since the DC Ranch location closed) :( 
Stopped in to meet some friends for happy hour and good to know that this location is happenin too!! Although I really dont enjoy the parking situation at Desert Ridge - it tool me 20 minutes to find a space on a friday night....and then another 10 minutes to walk.
There seem to be some angry drivers there!....or really thirsty :)

I recall the days at the DC Ranch location....watching the civilized lunch/stroller crowd turn into the counter-top dancing /drinking kind!! Good to know that it has toned down some - or maybe that comes later.
