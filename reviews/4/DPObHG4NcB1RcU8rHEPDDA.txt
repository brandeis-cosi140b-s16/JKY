MY FAVE MEXICAN FOOD IN CHARLOTTE!!!

I'm a huge Mexican food lover, and I grew up eating the good ol' cheap stuff. You know tex mex, not baja style.  When I moved to Charlotte, I started looking for a place that offered GREAT food for a cheap price.

I find most of the Mexican restaurants in Charlotte to be average at best, nothing close to the rich, spicy, melt in your mouth flavors I'm used to.  When my husband and I walked into Fiesta Maya, we were immediately transported to Mexico by the decor. 

Let's face it, how many places around here really authentic in terms of Mexican? You rarely find a hand made tortilla anywhere in the Q.C., besides the occasional taco cart that accompanies a soccer match.  This place is the best food for your money around in my opinion .  

The restuarant is always clean and the service has always been excellent.  

This is a MUST try if you like Mexican food.  Order the combos. The chili rellanos are fantastic, and the burritos are pretty tasty too.  Salsa, cheese dip, and guac are standard here, and are much better than the runny stuff that Azteca serves you and calls salsa.  

The portions are large, and we always have leftovers.

I will say that I agree that the margaritas are sub- par.  If you're a foodie though- it's for you! And they have good deals on cervesa too.

Go try it! I think you'll be pleased.
