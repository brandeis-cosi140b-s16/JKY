I brought my sister from Pennsylvania here because of yelp and it was definitely a great decision! The lady working suggested we try a bombero burrito since we enjoy spicy foods and it was delicious. We also shared a street taco meal (asada, marinated pork and green Chile chicken). All three were delicious. I am most definitely going to be coming back. :D
