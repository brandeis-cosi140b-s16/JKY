this place is fantastic. Minutes away from the University of Pittsburgh, this Mex Joint is across the street from a Qdoba and down the block from a Chipotle. I'd definitely choose this one over the others. Ambience is awesome and the food is better. They have spanish television on and lots of interesting people coming through all the time.

I love their guacamole. 
I dislike their lack of a bathroom.

This place is packed around noon.

Check it out!
