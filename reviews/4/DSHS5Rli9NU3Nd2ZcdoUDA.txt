Solid burritos, especially the carnitas burrito. Didn't try the tacos, but they have a large menu, will definitely be back. A good alternative when I don't want to drive 15 miles to my favorite burrito shop. Very reasonable prices (less than $5 for a good sized burrito), my main concern is that I have always been the only customer. Come on and give it a try, I don't want to see them go under!
