One of the better taco/burrito places in the Southwest that is open 24 hours, yes 24 hours, so when you have the late night munchies and want something better than fast food (that may not even be open), Amigos is open. Everything I've ordered is really good - from the carne asada tacos and burritos, the carnitas plate, and the nachos. I still have to try the Grande Burrito that people talk about, but I think that is enough for 2 people or at least 2 meals.
