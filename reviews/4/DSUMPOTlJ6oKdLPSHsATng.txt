PROS: Fun, romantic environment, very intimate and cozy (great place for a third date or special occasion). Very helpful and attentive service. AMAZZZZZING PUMPKIN BREAD PUDDING!!! I don't know if it's just seasonal, but anytime of the year it would be a treat! We had the MAHI MAHI TACOS and the SHORT RIB TACOS. Both were savory, but much smaller than we expected (think medallion size), and the short ribs could have been more tender. They were a bit dry, but still tasty. 

CONS: TABLE-SIDE GUACAMOLE. If you have a low tolerance for spicy flavors, definitely get mild or not spicy at all. We ordered the medium, and it was wayyyy to spicy, practically inedible for us. The PORTION sizes were far too small and the food was expensive for what was on the plate. Also, the MIMOSA was ok, but was a bit strong. I was expecting more orange juice with a splash of champagne and maybe a strawberry, but this was champagne with a splash of orange juice.
