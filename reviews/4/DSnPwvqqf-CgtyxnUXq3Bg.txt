Unfortunate that this place closed (per other Yelpers posts, and the fact MGM removed Diego from the list of restaurants)  I really was a fan.

Table side guacamole was always really good.
Dinners were always good to great, depending on which dish.
The selection of tequila was always diverse and quality.

The wait staff was always knowledgeable - particularly Saul - my favorite waiter who I asked for on every trip for the last 5-6 years & multiple times per year.

Now, I have to find a new source for tequila tasting in Vegas!
