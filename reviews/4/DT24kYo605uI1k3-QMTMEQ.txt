Early lunch on Saturday, ordered huaraches azteca al pastor. Very pleased with the plate.  Skirt steak, lettuce, tomato avocado over a thick tortilla.  Served with 4 salsas and chips.  Spanish speaking customers seem to get a fifth salsa that is orange, just like a habanero.  The Mexican guy across the aisle from me definitely broke a sweat during lunch - don't know if it was the orange mystery salsa, but guessing it was.  I'll be back but note the booths are a tight fit and there's only 20 - 30 seats, so carry out might be a consideration.
