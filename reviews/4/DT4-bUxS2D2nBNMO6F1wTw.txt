Usually when you roll something this good, it's illegal. While I wouldn't consider it authentic Mexican (more like Mexican style), It's the best thing to get for the price. I get so excited moving along in the line, watching as they scoop the delectable ingredients onto the warm tortilla. There are few things better than seeing a middle aged Mexican woman muscle the burrito into its final shape. When they hand me that baby sized burrito I feel like a little kid on Christmas morning. It's the perfect amount of food and always leaves me satisfied.
