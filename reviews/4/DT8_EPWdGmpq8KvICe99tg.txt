My "Pretend Boyfriend" (real person, long story) took me down to Fremont Street on a "Pretend Date-Night" and asked me if I like Mexican food, as soon as I said yes we headed straight for Mamita's. 

When I walked in I was hit in the face with over the top Mexican decor and a video dj mixing music videos from the 70s and 80s with each other and I was slightly surprised it would start off so cool. 

Won't lie, the service could be better but the Mexican/Cuban menu items help keep you wondering what yummy nibble you want to try. I picked what the waitress said was a "sample" plate of Cuban food and I was so happy I ordered it!  Chips and or salsa come free to get your mouth watering.

Think outside your comfort zone and try this little hidden jem!
