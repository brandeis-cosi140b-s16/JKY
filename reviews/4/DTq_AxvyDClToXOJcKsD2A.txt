i've had the cognac chicken, fajitas and enchiladas here. it's not completely authentic, which I think is a good things... or, rather, this pace is more new-age Mexican fusion than your nina's Mexican cooking w/ ingredients they use in their specialties.

The (fresh) tortillas are amazing and-my favorite quality of this joint-the food is always perfectly balance in portions. You'll never leave with puddles of extra-whatever on your plate staring up at you, all alone! Dinner usually runs $15-20ish, sans drinks. Only good mexican i've tasted in vegas.
