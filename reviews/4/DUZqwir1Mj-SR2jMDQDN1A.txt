I really enjoyed my food here it was great  I wish it was a little cheaper it's kinda pricey especially the tacos,I didn't like the beans either, I will be coming back sometime agian to try something else I tried the enchiladas they're amazing really good flavors and fresh made horchata I want some just thinking about it , it was so delicious it actually tasted home made
