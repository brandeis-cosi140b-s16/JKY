From a propane range, served in a tent on the sidewalk of the Courthouse Square, I unwrapped from foil and wax paper a "golden ticket" .... actually a "golden" Green Corn Tamale. The last GC Tamale they had or i would have bought a dozen. then my Green Chile Chicken Burrito (Burro to those from AZ.) was practically perfect. I paid Molly's husband, sat in the grass and waited once again for the Mariachi band to appear.... but they never do ....?!? 
Real (good) Mexican Food- Yes
Service- traditional Matriarchal Business, she cooks, he keeps his mouth shut
Atmosphere- It's a tent...... but where you find the tent can be fun.
