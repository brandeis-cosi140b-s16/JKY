Yum yum! I created my own burrito here which consisted of chicken and every other ingredient there is possibly to add and I have to say, this place is pretty damn good. The vegetables were fresh and the chicken was nice and moist. Also when biting into my burrito, I could taste all of the ingredients together, yum! However, it is kind of expensive, I mean not more than your average Chipotle or Qdoba though... I don't like that I had to pay to get veggies in my burrito, kinda seemed odd. Other than that, this place is awesome....will be back.
