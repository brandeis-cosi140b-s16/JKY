I enjoy Qdoba. I frequent this location often. I switched to it from Chipotle because I like the extra options I can get with my food. The staff is always friendly and fast. Perhaps it's because I come in enough for them to just start my food when they see me. It is the only Mexican food I eat with any regularity and I will continue going to it in the future.
