i like this restaurant for their lunch prices and atmosphere. the restaurant is decorated nicely, but i love the bar area. the bar area is separate and has alot of tables and booths and 2 walls of plasmas. it is not just a bar. it's a great place to sit and watch sports and have drinks and food. the full menu is offered in the bar area. so, if you want a full meal and/or drinks during any kind of sports game, the bar area is the place to sit. they offer an inexpensive lunch menu. i think it's around $6.50 for a large lunch. there's different options. you can also use the buy one get one free coupons that are in the entertainment book for the lunch specials making it really cheap. if you just want drinks, you can still get chips and salsa for free. i think the food is a good quality and is similar to macayos or garcias. good all around place. they are also building a large smokers patio with outdoor dining. it should be close to completion.
