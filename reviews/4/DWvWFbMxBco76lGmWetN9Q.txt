I love this place. We go here a lot, and would do so even if they weren't basically around the corner from my house. $1 margarita Mondays are my favorite. The food, admittedly, isn't all outstanding (but I LOVE their breakfast burritos and that they serve them all day) but definitely is good. The best part is the service. The servers are super friendly, and you can really tell it's a family-owned place. Also, a great value for the money.
