Overall our dinner at Viva Michoacan was a pleasant experience. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the service is quick. Plus a mariachi band playing = bonus star.

We had a dinner of chicken tacos, a beef burrito, a beef tamale and a beef soft taco. The chicken tacos, according to my GF,  were "muy delicioso" which I think means she liked them. While hot, my beef tamale and burrito were good, but upon cooling the shredded beef became stringy and harder to chew. Even so, the general quality of the food felt good. I'll just avoid the shredded beef next time.
