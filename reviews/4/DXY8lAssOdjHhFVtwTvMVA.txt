Stopped in for drinks and snacks to check it out.   Had a standard margarita (tequila choices including home infused were overwhelming) and my wife had a sangria (good - not soda pop). For snacks got the potato wedges with aioli and a veggie quesidilla.  Both were spiced but more savory not overwhelmingly hot.   Were a few pangs of infant restaurant problems (credit card machine operation was spotty).  All in all pleasant place for a drink and food was interesting.  It is quite small so if it gets popular, it might be a hard table.
