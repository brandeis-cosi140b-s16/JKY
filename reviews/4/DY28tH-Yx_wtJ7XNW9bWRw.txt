OK so I was in AZ for work and my friend from AZ took me here....I give The Mission 4 stars as it relates to the drinks and appetizers. We had the sangria which was super refreshing, the patio was awesome (minus the bugs) and the music was FANTASTIC! The guacamole was AWESOME, the server was a kick in the pants when he was making it at the table (love that kind of guac) and the almejas were SUUUUUUUPER delicious, they weren't kidding when they said to soak up the juice yummmmmmmm!! We also had the swordfish i think it was, but there you go, underwhelmed on the main course situation. I would say, if they had a happy hour other than Sundays it would get loads more visits! But in the meantime its got a good vibe and excellent after work hang out, just invest in the appetizers and drinks!
