Went for dinner and catching up with my bff.  The chips were hot and fresh and the salsa was flavorful without burning.  Our dinners were good.  I liked the guac that came with my beef flatuas.  The beans were good and the rice was super good after I put some salsa on it.  A very solid dinner spot for sure.
