It is what it is: a slightly upscale Americanized Mexican restaurant chain. If you're expecting "interior" food or another form of truly authentic Mexican food, you will be disappointed.

However, if you're a fan of the Americanized versions of the chimichanga, burrito, quesadilla, or enchilada, you'll probably enjoy Abuelos. They have wonderful chips and salsa: the chips are light and thin, the salsa is mild but offers a little kick toward the end.

The entrees are large but do carry a slightly ambitious price; most plates run between $9 and $14. Drinks tend to be pricey across the board... $2.50 for a soda?

Service is prompt and professional, and the interior is large, open, airy, and clean. All in all, you're likely to have a very pleasant dining experience so long as you recognize you're frequenting a chain restaurant that is to "authentic" Mexican food as Olive Garden is to authentic/rustic Italian food.

I'm a fan. I'll go back - their seared tuna, chimichangas, and papas fritas are tasty.
