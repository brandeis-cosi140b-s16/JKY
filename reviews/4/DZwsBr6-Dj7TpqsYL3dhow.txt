My husband and I are usually somewhat hesitant about trying new places~ we have our favorites and pretty much stick to them. Jalisco Cantina has certainly become our Mexican food favorite. It's a quaint, casual restaurant with a separate bar area- traditionally decorated with booths & tables. Staff has always been attentive & courteous. 

When we initially started going there they had a small menu but with all the basics. Now they have a very extensive menu serving and abundance of options including breakfast. Since I am such a creature of habit I always get their shrimp & lobster ceviche along their fresh guacamole. I always intend to order other items but by the time I finish indulging in the ceviche I am stuffed! My hubby normally sticks to his beef & cheese enchiladas along with the shredded beef barbacoa taquitos. 

The portions are generous and pricing is very reasonable. We've never been disappointed or left hungry!
