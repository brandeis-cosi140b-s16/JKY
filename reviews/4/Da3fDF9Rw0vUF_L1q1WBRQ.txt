The selection process is a little different than other places,  as you get to sample the meats before you choose.  Me and my honey chose, carnitas and vinegar chicken on our 5 little taco plates ($7.70.) I got all of the toppings including corn and pickled onions.  He picked cabbage only.  The tacos were street sized and the meat was juicy and well seasoned. 

I loved the pickled onions!  And will try the horchata again. It was homemade,  unlike many other shops. My only qualm, was the price.  Horchata + tacos = 11.00

We will be back soon, when we recover from sticker shock.
