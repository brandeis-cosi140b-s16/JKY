Very delicious Mexican food with a hint of American.There is a wide selection of food and drink. Chunky salsa and crispy tortilla chips are served as you decide what food to order. The service is usually very quick and it's almost always possible to get a table right away. Seating is offered inside the restaurant and outside on the patio, misters are available during summer and heaters are available during winter. 
My family regularly enjoys Jalape√±o Inferno and I plan to go back for a long time.
