I love eating at los betos. My favorite is their chicken enchiladas which I get constantly. They fill my tummy up and taste delicious with their lettuce and chicken and red sauce.  When im not in the mood for enchiladas my second favorite item is the green chili burrito which has just enough kick before its overpowering. This place is definitely a hole in the wall but isn't that what makes a dingy little Mexican joint so awesome? The only reason im giving it 4 out of 5 stars is because their food isn't consistent some days their food is really good and other days its just alright.
