Wonderful garlicky hot sauce has been on those tables for decades.  You can buy that stuff by the pint or half pint and I have done that in the past as I'm leaving.  Back in the day they wouldn't serve sour cream because it was not authentic (I notice they do now).  Their fried ground beef tacos are slightly different than what most are used to-----in a good way.  I'm not a fan of their relleno, but their enchiladas and beans have that bad-for-you great taste that I look for in Mexican fare.  Big iced teas!
