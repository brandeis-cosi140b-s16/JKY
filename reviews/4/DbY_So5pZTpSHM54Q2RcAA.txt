A date picked this restaurant for me and I have to admit I was impressed!  Sitting outside on the patio under the gorgeous sparkling lights on the palm trees, with the sound of the running water in the fountains nearby, in the heart of Central Phoenix.  It didn't even matter at that point if the food was good!   

I've been back several times since and this place doesn't disappoint.  However, I would rank ambiance #1, alcohol #2 and food #3.  Drink choices are widely ranging so everyone will find something.   From your traditional margarita to a cocktail, the drinks are strong and well made.  As for the food, I've had a few dishes I liked - the black and bleu quesadilla and the fajitas tend to be my go-to.  I love the salsa too - it's a chipotle, smoky flavor - my favorite kind!   Best little treat is a white chocolate dessert served in a corn husk at the end of the meal.   Great little inclusion!   

This is located in the Arizona Center by the AMC movie theater, so makes it easy for a great dinner and movie night.   Then grab your date's arm and take a stroll through the courtyard, enjoy the twinkling lights and fountains.   There's no way you'll be able to resist the romance!  =)
