I would classify. Habenero's  set up as a Mexican Subway.  The burrito's are huge! and even larger if you like alot of ingredients. They have about five different options to start from,Mexican soda, a margarita machine and a fountain machine. Eat and drink for six to nine bucks! The margaritas come in a Styrofoam cup and look like an Icee, that being said I almost walked out the door with it, good thing because there we're two sherrif's  parked out side! I will stop in again, it was convenient,fast and filling.
