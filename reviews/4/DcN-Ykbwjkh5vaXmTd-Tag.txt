For someone who loves Chipotle and Pei Wei style places this is pretty similar in atmosphere and just like Chipotle and Pei Wei, it's just a step up from fast food but below sit-down restaurant. 

The food was pretty good. The guacamole on the burger was very fresh and it had green onion. 

I can't wait to go back to try a burrito or a Nogales dog!
