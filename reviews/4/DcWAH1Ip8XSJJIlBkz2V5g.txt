No one at a firing range complains that  even though their Smith & Wesson shoots straight, they don't like it because its Americanized and not an authentic Yangzhou fire lance. 

Likewise, no one save latent racists or separatists judge food based on some vague notion of "authenticity." 

That being said, Manuel's is tasty, low priced inauthentic Mexican food served in a comfortable environment with the most consistently friendly service of any restaurant I've been to in Phoenix.
