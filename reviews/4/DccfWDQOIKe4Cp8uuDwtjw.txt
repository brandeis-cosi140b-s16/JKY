It appears that the service kinks have been worked out as our server was very attentive and the food came out quickly. Guacamole was tasty and fun and tacos were innovative and delicious. I don't want to argue the point of whether Barrio Queen aspires to be authentic street food or Mexican fusion, consensus at our table was that it's a bit of both and the experience was so pleasant that honestly we don't care and we will return soon.  Of note, automatic chips and salsa at the beginning of the meal would be a nice touch and more opportunities to add serious heat (habanero, serrano, jalapeno) would have been a wonderful adjunct.
