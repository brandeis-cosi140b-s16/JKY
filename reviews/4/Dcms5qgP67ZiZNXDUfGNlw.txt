Place was happening on Friday night. Got an couple of Patron shots, each shots were $12. It wasn't your normal shot glass, so I was pleased about that.

Ordered some frozen Margaritas they were about $17. I know you could get them maybe little cheaper someone else, but was nearby and ready to party.

I would go to this spot again if I ever returned to Vegas. 

Bartender was super cool.
