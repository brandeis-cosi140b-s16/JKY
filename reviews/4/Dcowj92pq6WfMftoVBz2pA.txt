I LOVE this location! I love Chipotle to being with. But in regards to this particular location I felt the need to write a review simply because I drive out of my way to get here. I live near Norterra, and that location is less than desirable when it comes to staff & portions so I drive to this location. The staff are always SUPER nice & the portions are the BEST. They do not chince out like the one at Norterra. They give you a full scoop of rice and beans, not a half like other locations. They are usually always accommodating as well. I usually get a Carnitas Bowl, and had big chunks of fat instead of meat, and put it on a napkin and walked back in and said, "Could I perhaps have a little meat? I got some yucky fat chunks" They apologized and gave me actual meat. 
I wish Chipotle would have kept the yellow corn instead of the white because the flavor was WAY better but oh well. I still love Chipotle and love this location. I will go back time and time again. Love Love Love.
