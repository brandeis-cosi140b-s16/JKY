I thought this place had great food, the music was good especially for a Sunday night.  We went Saturday then went Sunday to hear the live music.  Waitress the first night was amazing, the server the second night was not good even though Sunday was less busy, so I guess service depends on which server you get but that is true most places.  The food both nights was great and it has a good atmosphere.
