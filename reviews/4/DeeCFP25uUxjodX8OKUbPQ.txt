Cool environment. We sat outside and it was nice and comfortable. It was really busy, but it didn't take long to get a table. The tacos were good. We ordered almost every taco on the menu. The al pastor, shrimp, and lengua were my favorites. The Margaritas were poured just right and the come with this cool foaming salt on top. On tuesdays they do Techno Taco Tuesday. They play Techno music and after eleven is happy hour. Seafood tacos are $3. All other tacos are $2. Select Craft beers are $3. Margaritas are $4 and really good. Check it out you'll definitely have a great time. Date night or pre-game.
