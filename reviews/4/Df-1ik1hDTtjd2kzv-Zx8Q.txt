I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the chilaquiles! I order my food to go because of the limited time before my connecting flight. When at the counter the cashier asked how I wanted my eggs...I was slightly confused because I thought they were always mixed in. Needless to say I just said scrambled. The taste was amazing! The cheese was phenomenal and taste was incredible! The chilaquiles were prepared perfectly, they reminded me of the ones i enjoyed while living in TJ. I would definitely go back.

Try it.
