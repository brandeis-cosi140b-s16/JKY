Excellent food here.  It's nice to be able to get your chile fix without having to take a trip to New Mexico.  I had their Carne Adovada and Eggs for brunch, which was fabulous.  The pork is first smoked before they simmer it in red chile until it is tender to the point where you barely even need to chew it.   Only complaint with the joint would be that they keep it a little on the dark side.  I felt like I was squinting to see everything despite the fact that it was in the middle of the day.
