Let me start off by saying they serve Menudo everyday which is amazing since its the only restaurant I know that does that!

I ordered the Albondigas soup for start and it was pretty good 3/5 stars . The broth had good flavor. You only get 2 meatballs which are pretty good size. 

I also tried the red menudo which was pretty damn good , again being able to get it everyday makes it better! Only Mexican restaurant I know to get it all day everyday. 3.5/5 stars for me! I would be back for sure to get it again. 

Next I will have to try the churros and red pork burrito !
