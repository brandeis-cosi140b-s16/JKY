Muy Bueno Mexican! Quick and tasty!!! 
This was my first visit to a BFMG, and I was impressed.

I selected their Baja Burrito with carnitas, served "Echilado Style" (topped with cheese and red sauce).  REALLY good!  What I loved about this burrito, is that they were generous with the carnitas (compared to most fast-food Mexican places), and did not bulk up my 'rito with the usual bland and boring rice.  Came with a side of chips, which were also Enchilado Style ... Ay Caramba!!  

NOM NOM NOM, Baja Fresh is DA BOMB!
