I literally live a block away from this place and this is the default place to take guests to eat when they're in town.  

They grow their vegetables fresh behind the restaurant and their fresh chips and salsa usually need 3-4 refills before the food comes. :D

Their outdoor seating area is very nice.  Perfect spot to take your dinner date.  Very romantic lighting and heaters when the air gets chilly.  During the daytime, it's a very nice atmosphere to catch up with old friends or have a business lunch with a client.  

I think it's better than Macayo's, Serrano's, and other 'chain/many location' Mexican food places.  The owners keep an eye out for the quality of food they serve here and the always packed parking lot speaks for itself.
