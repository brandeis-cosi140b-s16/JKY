Great place for some authentic Mexican food! Ordered the al pastor tacos and veggie enchiladas - both dishes were excellent! The tacos were seasoned perfectly and came with onions and cilantro with two slices of lime. My partner had the enchiladas and said that they were delicious! The enchiladas came with lettuce, beans, rice, and a couple of slices of avocado. The dish came with 5 enchiladas which was a lot for it being only 8 bucks, so it was a great deal! The place is connected with a convenience store which was a little weird, but hey..the food was great so I'm not complaining! Would definitely come here again, and I highly suggest you stop in for some tacos if you're searching for a good place right now!
