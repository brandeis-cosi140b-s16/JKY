This place is legit.  Fresh food, smiling faces, we left happy.  The stuffed Poblano was delicious.  I enjoyed the Torta as well, if you are looking for a good Torta come here.  You choose your meat on most of the dishes and again the ingredients were fresh, not common in a lot of Mexican Restaurants that we go to.  

Give Pablano a try, I hope you enjoy.
