Still the best mole sauce in town.  A little more pricey at its Village Square location but the food is still very good.  Menudo soup is wonderful.  Wide selection of dishes including a good Mexican vegetarian menu.  Dishes popular in Mexico that you don't normally see in the States.   Great ambiance and service.  Generous portions and nice bar.  My favorites are the enchilada poblano, burrito colorado and the chicken fajitas.
