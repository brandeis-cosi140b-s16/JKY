I usually never change my review...so this is a first.  After giving this place a very honest review (not favorable) I had been contacted by the owner to come back.  He had said he had made a bunch of changes.  I refused, and wished him luck.  As it turns out my friends go there A LOT and drug me in there one night.  Our service was amazing...and fast.  Everyone there was so wonderful, I felt bad about my previous review.  I wondered if the great experience was because my friends go all the time, and it was just them that were getting great service.  I went with my hubby a few days later.  Our server was beyond amazing.  I told him I have some food allergies, and he was so great about it.  Our food came very fast, and just how we had ordered it.  There were a lot of people in that night, but our server still took the time to chat with us for a second.   We went back a THIRD time...still waiting for the prior bad experience to rear it's ugly head.  We had a different server...much to my surprise, she was amazing as well.  Not only was she great, our server from the last time saw us and made sure he said good bye to us.  I give the owner a big congrats on turning this place around.  It is now one of my favorite mexican food places in the area.  Congrats Juan Jamie's...you changed this stubborn girls mind!!!!
