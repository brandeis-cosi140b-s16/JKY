I see a couple recent negative reviews and I'm surprised.  My family and I eat here quite a lot.  There is always a long but fast-moving line.  We worry about having an available table but there's always one available by the time our food is done.  The food is reliably good and our orders accurate.  The employees are always really friendly, yet fast - they work together like a well-oiled machine.  I have yet to have a bad experience.
