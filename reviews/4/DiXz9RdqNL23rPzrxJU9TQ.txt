I love the burritos at Zabas and actually prefer them over Chipotle becuase they offer more variety, such as wheat tortillas and sweet potato. The meats are always tender and well cooked. The only negative is that they charge for little things like extra cheese and sour cream, but overall a solid burrito. Inside is clean and never too crowded.
