What a great find!!  It is different than any of the other Tex-Mex place in town.  First things first though, if you've never been, make sure to look over the menu before you get to the register to order - it makes things better for everyone!  The portion sizes are generous, the prices are bank account-friendly and patio seating is available.  It may be a little awkward for folks who aren't used to their quick-casual style of service - you order at the register, get your drinks, find a table, they call your number, you go get your food.  

A pretty decent beer selection too.  I missed out on the Margarita-with-a-Corona-in-it creation but that's something I'll try on my next visit because I will be back.
