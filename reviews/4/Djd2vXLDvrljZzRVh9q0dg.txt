This is a great Rubio's, I don't know if there is new management but it seems so much nicer than a few years back.  I stopped by with the twins to see if they would eat here. There are so many happy meals I want to give them.  To my surprise, they loved the chicken taquitos.  They devoured them.  I am so happy I have another option when I am out with them.  The employees are very nice and keep the place very clean.
