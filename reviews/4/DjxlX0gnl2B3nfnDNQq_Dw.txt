As quick service Mexican food goes, Federico's hits the spot. What I find ironic is when this was a KFC, I would see cockroaches crawling all over the drive-through when I was nearby, and now that its a "hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint" its infinitely cleaner. 

Late night drunken carne asada fries? Check!

Tasty adobada burrito? Check! 

Rolled tacos smothered in guac and cheese? You know it!

Prices are reasonable, quality is consistent and good, and flavor is never lacking
