We came in on the 4th of July with a coupon for 'buy one, get one free' burrito. Can't pass that up! Make sure to sign up for their Rewards card. They frequently send out coupons, and when you buy so many burritos... you get one free! We have lucked into that little gem a few times :) 

We are pretty simple, we get the chicken burrito on a whole wheat tortilla, and brown rice. I love the black beans, my husband gets the pinto beans. He asks for about 3 ladles of the hottest salsa they have. Since we take these home, we ask for sour cream on the side so that we can microwave these to make sure they are really hot. 

We have always received great service with a smile here.
