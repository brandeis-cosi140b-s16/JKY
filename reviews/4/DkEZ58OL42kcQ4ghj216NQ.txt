Beautiful bountiful burger!

This mildly 1950s-themed diner is the one inexpensive eatery in Old Town, so I walked in with low expectations but left delighted (and very full). Trying the Texas Burger appears to be almost mandatory among Yelpers, and a very fine burger it is. The bun is toasted, the bacon is crisp, the onion ring is onion-y, the burger is juicy, the BBQ sauce has tang, and the cheese is... kinda there. The fries are fries. I ate them.

The service is service. It gets you fed.

On the whole, it's not quite on a par with a really top-notch Smashburger, but the relief of getting a nice, simple, affordable dinner in that section of Scottsdale lends savor to the meal.
