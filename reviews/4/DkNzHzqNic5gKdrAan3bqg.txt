The supreme breakfast burrito is the number one breakfast burro in chandler, a must try for all.  I am impressed with the meat portions in the taco/enchilada combos as well..the downers...they desperately need some spicy hot sauce.  I hope to see this place do well and stick around for a long time to come.  I would also like to see the owner be a little tougher on a few of his employees (dress code, on the phone while working, smoking out front, etc). Overall, great spot to fill the hunger void for less than $10.00..giant drinks as well.
