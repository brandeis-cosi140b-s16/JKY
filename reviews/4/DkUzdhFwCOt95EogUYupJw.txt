It was good, portions were big and I didnt finish everything. Chips and Salsa were were good too. My only complaint was it was cold and the fans were blasting down on us. We asked the waitress to turn it down and she said she didn't know how. omg really?!?!? It probably took about 20 mins to figure it out! Other than that my experience here was a good one.
