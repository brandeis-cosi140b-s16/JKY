Prior to today, which was my first visit, I had absolutely no expectations. I was aware that Salty Señorita locations exist (well, the existence of THIS location was a surprise...), but had never been to one and don't recall any reviews from friends, either positive or negative. My Bestie and I were headed to a certain Italian joint in the vicinity for lunch when she sez, "Hey, let's stop here..."

Good call, B! (For the record, she'd been here before, a long time ago...like, "it maybe wasn't even a Salty Señorita back then" long time). It was not at all crowded on a late Sunday afternoon in December, so we were able to take a self-guided tour through the premises before deciding where to land. We parked it outside within view of a televised Seahawks/49ers game, by coicidence rather than design. I was tempted to suggest to a boisterous young lady in a Seahawks jersey to "use her indoor voice," until I realized that we were, in fact, outdoors. Party on, Ma'am.

We tried nachos, fish tacos (both Estella's and Marco's), shrimp tacos, rice and beans. Jiminy Christmas, was that some tasty comida! I've had the good fortune to partake in this type of fare throughout Central America, and this compares very favorably. Upon requesting a side of jalapeños, we were brought a cup of fresh, already-diced goods - another unexpected surprise. Well played, SS, well played.

Thanks to Briana for very personable and prompt service. This is so my-kind-of-place that I cannot wait until the next visit.
