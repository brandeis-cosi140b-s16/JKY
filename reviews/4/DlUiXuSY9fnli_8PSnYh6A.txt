oh yum. My bf has been wanting good mexican food. So i saw this on yelp and decided to try it. 
I ordered two beef tacos and he order two beef burritos. The taco's were big and sooo yummy. And the rice. Some places you can tell it's been under a heat lamp for al ong time. But this rice was good. I'm not a bean eater but the bf says it was good. 
This is real good mexican food.  :)
