I love their carne asada quezadilla which I drench in their green sauce. They also have a great variety of aguas frescas(I personally am a fan of their fresa agua). I have also tried the tostadas de ceviche(they make their own tostada) and tortas ahogadas. I have to say that I live close by so have come to know the owner who makes sure we get what we want and already knows the way we like our food. I try to go when I know she is working.
