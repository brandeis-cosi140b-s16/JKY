Eat lunch here all the time.  Really love this place.  Quality is always good IMO but you  don't want to go here if you are in a hurry.  If you have 45 minutes for lunch you're good but less than that and it'll ruin your lunch.  

Fish Tacos, Lunch special Burro and the Burro special only in the bar are all great choices.  I keep meaning to try those stuffed peppers wrapped in bacon though.
