As a native Californian, I'm super picky about my Mexican food. At a bare minimum, I expect: actual salsa, not ketchup masquerading as salsa; guacamole that is something other than an avocado paste; beans that don't taste like they came from a can; margaritas that contain tequila; and my server must know the difference between carnitas and carne asada. (This last one is a new requirement based on visit to a different Mexican restaurant in North Carolina.)

Mexicasa hit all the marks. The beans, rice, guacamole and margaritas were great. The salsa could have been spicier, but was good nonetheless. The chicken in the chicken enchilada was a but dry, but still good. The beef in the beef enchilada was ground, not shredded, but still very tasty. They do offer shredded beef in the menu, so that maybe an option if requested. 

The boyfriend ordered Arroz con Pollo. It was delicious and a huge portion. 

They were very busy when we were there, so the service was a little slow, but not too bad, and the servers were very attentive. I will definitely eat here again!
