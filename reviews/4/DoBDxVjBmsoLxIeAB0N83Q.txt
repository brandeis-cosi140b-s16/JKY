This is the only delivery burrito I've ever found, but I sadly live too far now (they actually cover a pretty big radius). I love getting a bean burrito with lettuce, tomato, and guacamole inside, which I'd never even bother ordering at another Mexican food place. They use good quality guacamole, the beans are cheesy and perhaps a bit salty, but the tortillas are really the best part. Each burrito is huge, and you can get a combo for around 5 bucks (or less). People really love their breakfast burritos, my husband likes the potato, egg and cheese with guacamole. Perfect for hangovers. Opens earlyish, at 8!
