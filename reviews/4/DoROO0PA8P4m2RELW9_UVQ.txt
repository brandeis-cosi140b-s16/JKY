So I took a jaunt to Plaza Midwood for lunch with some clients and friends.  TA has been on my radar as authentic and delicious.  I actually drove right by the place and turned around.  It's a rather small place tucked in a cruddy shopping center with very little parking.  

Since I was runing late, my friends were already noshing on some beautifully green and tasty guac and tortilla chips.After ordering, I realized why it is considered so authentic. My tacos were small flour tortillas open-faced with cubed beef cheese and cilantro. A heaping side of rice and refried beans.  I did ask for sour cream but never got it.  The portions were hardy and topped with the guac and salsa from the table made them quite tasty.  My friends ordered the pork belly tacos, shrimp quesilda and burritos.  All the portions were huge and the burrito was gorgeous, deep friend and top with queso sauce, sour cream tomatos and lettuce.  Believe me when I tell you that I didn't eat another meal until breakfast the next morning!
