The reviews are all right-on.  The jade red chicken and carnitas with chinese fried rice and with black beans were really good.  And the savory snickerdoodle with every order is a sweet touch!

For first timers they walk you through the ordering process which can be a bit tricky with all of the particulars of filling out the sheet (sushi bar style, but with special letters and charts).  

One less star for the dank and gross dining area (cool panda vaquero mural, btw), but other than that this place is solid.  Sorry, don't feel comfortable giving 5 stars to a place with dirty floors and sinking ceilings. 

And for those curling their lips at the thought of combining the two cuisines, look at any Chinese restaurant in the area - it's most likely a Mexican cooking Chinese food anyways....
