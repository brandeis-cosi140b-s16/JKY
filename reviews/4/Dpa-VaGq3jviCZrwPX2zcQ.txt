We went here for the first time on a whim. So happy we did! Be prepared to walk out fat and happy. Being from Colorado, this is the kind of Mexican food I've been looking for. Cheesy, smothered everything.  The Happy Hour is killer - you can eat a feast for less than you could at Taco Bell and the food is 100% better than T-Bell. The cheese and onion enchiladas (Presidential Special) was really good. The combo plates were all good and that chili relleno - holy moly was that thing good. We got the one that is NOT battered in egg. The most surprising part of the meal? The chicken wings.  Yes, I said chicken wings.  Good ol fashioned Franks Red Hot style chicken wings - 6 for $3 and they were plump, amazingly cooked wings! Definitely dingy inside (made me slightly nervous) but once you sit down and start looking around you realize that everyone at the bar is a regular whose order the bartender knows when they sit down, the wait staff has probably been there forever and everyone in the place had a smile on their face.  I love Mexican food and I tend to have a soft spot for a good dive bar - if you're like me, do not walk, RUN to TeePee!
