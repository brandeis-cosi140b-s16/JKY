The breakfast is what I like about this place.  They have such an amazing breakfast that includes traditional American means and the traditional Mexican breakfast foods.  

Everything I have had - pancakes, hash browns, eggs etc, or the chorizo burrito and other Mexican breakfasts - It was all yummy.  

If you are tired of only having fast food options for breakfast in the un-incorporated Pinal county (they call Queen Creek) then try this place - you will not be let down.
