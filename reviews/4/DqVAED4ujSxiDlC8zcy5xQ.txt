My husband on I stopped in based on other yelp reviews and ordered a pitcher of margaritas. I am not typically a margarita fan, but these were delicious. My husband said that weren't too strong, but the flavor and price were excellent. I ordered the broiled mahi tacos and we shared the tri tip tacos. The flavor of the mahi was outstanding and the tri tip used in the tacos was tender and flavorful. The employees were also very friendly and attentive. We will definitely be visiting again.
