Went here for lunch today. It wasn't stellar and it wasn't poor. Just a "meh" kind of experience, so to speak. The lines weren't that long, so I guess I beat the lunch rush. The servers weren't that generous with the food, barely got any steak on my bowl at all. The steak was also over spiced. Lucky for me I like spicy foods, but for someone who is sensitive to spicy food this might not be such a good.  After all of this, the food was barely warm as well, making the already meh food poor.
