Fun vibe with great outdoor seating and bar area.  We tried three different tacos, chicken, pork & salmon and all were excellent.  If you don't like a sauce, they will leave it off and bring you eight more to choose from at your table, all homemade and delicious.  If you like salsa, don't skip the salsa & chips.  It isn't free like most Mexican restaurants, but it is far more tasty!  It too is made fresh daily and the heat can vary.  Last week it was milder, last night almost too hot for me, but my wife LOVED it.  Had to bring home an extra order!  We are going back.
