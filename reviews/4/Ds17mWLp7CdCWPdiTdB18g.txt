Del Taco. DEL TACO. Cheaper than taco hell and better. So this place is not in the nicest area but closest del taco to my location. The drive thru is tight squeeze but they're pretty quick. I asked for a quote on quote "a bag of medium sauce" and she literally gave me a bag of medium sauce. The food was fresh and I didn't have runs so that's great. I even ordered one of those 1/2 pound ban burrito and I was fine, not even too gassy. I was stoked. Chicken burritos, 59 cent tacos and deep fried cheesecake bites are worth your change.
