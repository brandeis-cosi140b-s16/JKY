Sofritas, black beans and pico, Oh my!

Seriously, love the chipotle concept, and love even more that they offer shredded, mouth watering, pepper infused, juicy tofu.

This location is great because they are quick and easy to get in and out of...(kinda wish this shopping center would take off a little more though).

The staff was really friendly and helpful and moved the long line  of customers quickly through the process and on to the every wonderful tasty chipotle goodness. I will be back soon!
