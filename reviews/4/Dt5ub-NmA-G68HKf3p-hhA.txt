OMG, this place is freakin awesome. I am here at least twice a week for lunch and generally order either the sopes or tostadas (with steak or chorizo as my protein). Place is just out of this world. every thing is home made (including the nachos and stuff) and their salsa is to die for. Highly reccomended!
