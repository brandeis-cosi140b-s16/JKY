Very prompt and friendly service.  I got there at 11:30 ish.  I ordered the chicken tortilla soup.  It was pretty good.  And a side of rice and black beans.  Also very good.  The black beans seemed spicier than I was expecting and the rice had a nice flavor and was moist.  Also, I love the salsa bar.  So many delicious choices.  I will have to visit more often.
