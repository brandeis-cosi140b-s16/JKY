Such a great deal for lunch! 

We stopped in the other afternoon after hitting up a weekday morning movie in Fitchburg. I had last been to La Hacienda over a decade ago, and after an aborted attempt to get a late dinner there a couple of weeks ago (the parking lot was jam packed and we couldn't get a big enough break in traffic on Park to get back across the street after seeking out other parking) we've had it on the brain. 

Upon entering we were quickly seated and served chips and salsa and had our drink orders taken. The salsa came in adorable tiny cups that allowed us each to dig in to our own. Our server was very sweet and attentive, and made for an even more pleasant experience than the delicious food would have on its own. 

They have several lunch deals that come with a soda, and both of us ended up ordering the chimichanga plate. I went with chicken, my boyfriend went with beef, and we were both really happy with our choices. The lunch portion is, from what I remember, exactly the same as the dinner portion. I had more food than I could take down in one sitting, so I was pumped to have dinner later with my second mini chimi (they opt to give you two smaller fried burritos instead of one massive one). 

I don't know if they've actually updated the interior a bit in the years that I haven't been, or if it just looked brighter and cheerier in the light of day, but either way it was a pleasant atmosphere for our lunchtime jaunt.
