Really good food. Had the lobster tacos, which comes with charro beans & rice. The beans were super yummy & the lobster was generous. The chicken sopes were awesome also. Service was also very good & decent value for the money- esp for Vegas. Definitely going to go back. The only weirdness was the music that was reggeton in Spanish. No traditional Mexican music. Decor was good.
