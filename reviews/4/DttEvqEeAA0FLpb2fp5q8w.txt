Not from the area and me and a buddy were in a mood for some burritos. My 1st impression of the establishment... all I'll say is that I wouldn't want to know their  practices and cleanliness. But what can you ask for, it's your typical Mexican burrito stand. We both loved the breakfast burritos and red/green salsas. I rate them in the 4-5 star category. If I lived in the area would I come back.... yup, I sure would!
