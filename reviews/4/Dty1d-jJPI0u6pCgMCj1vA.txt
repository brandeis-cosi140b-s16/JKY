The food, drinks and service were awesome. And this would have been a 5 star review had they not taken for-e-v-e-r in bringing us our food. But we did get a free dessert for the long wait. We really enjoyed the grilled street corn and the pumpkin bread pudding was to die for! Also, their french pressed coffee is so, so good. Great decor and ambiance too. We will definitely be back when we visit Scottsdale.
