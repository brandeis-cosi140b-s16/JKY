I had this on a great day, why was it a great day you ask, because I love tacos, and tacos make my day great.

I enjoyed their fish taco so much that I almost was going to get another one after I finished the one, and I was not even hungry.

This place is a Mexican food slash bar with lots of tattoo and day of the dead like art around the place.  I enjoyed both the food and the atmosphere, plus it is very affordable.  

Good for groups of 1-6 people or lovers of mexican food.

Recommendation: to anyone who lives near mill or goes to college in the area and want something mexican other then Chipotle and that is just as delicious.
