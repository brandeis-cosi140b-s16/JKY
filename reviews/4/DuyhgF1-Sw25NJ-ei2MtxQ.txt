Very basic, but very good!  They are best known for their pork, but since I don't eat pork, I tried their beef & chicken.  I preferred their chicken but my wife liked the carna asada best, can't go wrong with either.  Everything they make is fresh daily and all 3 salsa are wonderful!
Prices are low, service is fast & friendly, the owners are as nice as can be.  We'll worth the stop. We will definitely be back.
