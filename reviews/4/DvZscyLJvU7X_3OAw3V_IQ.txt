This was my 1st time getting food over here, and it was great!! I got the carne asada burrito and bean & cheese burrito, and even though I forgot to getthe condiments from the condiments bar, it really didn't need it. I love the atmosphere, its like home cooking with a wetbar. I I will be going back.
thank you
