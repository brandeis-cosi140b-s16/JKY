This place is by far the best place in the area.....not only is it "good for buckeye" it's a great place for anywhere......the decor is modern yet warm and inviting they have a couple dozen big screens a great sound system nice stone work and a hard wood floor....the  food is first rate if you know filibertos Mexican food....forget it .....the menu is completely different ...I had an amazing burger my wife had the cob salad that she loved....the app was steak skewers with mango salsa....very very good...it's bar food elevated...The place beat every expectation i had and i cant what to try everything on the menu. These  people have put a lot  of work into this place from the decor to the menu and it shows....I'm an instant regular...oh I have never commented on yelp before but I just had to for this place........
