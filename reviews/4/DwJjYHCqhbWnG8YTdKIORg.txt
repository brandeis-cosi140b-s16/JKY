Fast, cheap, fresh, great flavor and super close to home!
This is a perfect neighborhood place.  Decor sucks, menu on wall and handed out is only a fraction of what's available, based on all the hand written signs for other items they have.
We have better luck getting the order to-go from the counter instead of the drive-thru.  That way, we can pack our own salsas from the variety avaialbe - or risk getting none in the bag if we're too lazy to leave our car.
So far, I've been stuck on the carnitas and pollo asado mini tacos - I really want to explore more of the menu - but can't get away from the YUM I know!
Did share the roommate's quesadilla once - GREAT tortilla!  
So happy to have it close and open late!
