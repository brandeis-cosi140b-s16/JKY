It was minutes before a long flight, and I was quite mad at the airline, I figured what better way to get even than the aromas and after effects of a huge burrito!

I was surprised how busy this little store front was on a Saturday at 7. It is not fancy, it is a step above your average berto/beto experience. There is a large menu on the wall that takes a bit of time to get a handle on. there is indoor and a large patio for seating. 

I went with the fish burrito that some of my fan boyrito friends suggested.  less than $5

My burrito came the tortilla was soft yet had a nice crust from grilling, the burrito had a sufficient amount of fried fish, lettuce and the fresh taste from peppers and onions. It came with some nice thinker chips. There is a salsa bar with some great salsa to compliment the chips but to my chagrin no drinkable picante style sauces.

Also note they are moving soon to a remodeled KFC in the same complex so the patio arrangement may change.

There was quite a wait conciderign the natrue of this plaace,
