If you do not speak Spanish, you may want to brush up before you go.  This place is authentico, y tiene comida muy rica.  

I was outside using the water filling windmill machine when I smelled the irresistible smells of a bakery-- I had to check it out.  I floated inside and ordered the "especial" which was rice and beans with potatoes fried inside rolled tortillas, topped with avacado, tomato, mexican white cheese (queso fresco), and sour cream.  They have a salsa bar with 2 green salsas and one red, and plenty of diced onions and cilantro to round it all out.  

It was a fantastic breakfast at about noon on a Sunday.

Aside from the grill inside, the place is mostly a Mexican bakery.  All of the baked goods are on racks in the middle of the store, and you load up a tray of what you want, and they then bag it for you at the register.

I witnessed many people loading up on bolillos (the bread used for tortas), and a variety of cakes.  It did not occur to me to buy tortillas for the house, but I will be back to give them a special review.

Since it was a Sunday, there were people in line in their church clothes, and I got the impression that it was a weekly ritual for people to come in after church for lunch or to stock up on breads for the week ahead.

This is a good place, and appears to be a neighborhood staple.
