Love the atmosphere here. Chips, salsa, and guacamole (table side) were awesome and the server we had (Lasette) was wonderful. House margaritas were just ok (from the bar while we waited), and we had to ask for lime wedges. Had the spinach and mushroom quesadilla, and that was on point. It's .99 for extra sour cream, which seemed silly. My husband ordered the 3 Enchiladas and really loved it. The refried beans had a nice smokey flavor.

Overall, we'll definitely be back, and I'll probably order the quesadilla again!
