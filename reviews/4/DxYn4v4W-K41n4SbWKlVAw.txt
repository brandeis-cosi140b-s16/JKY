I was taken back by the crowd but our wait time for a table was fairly quick!   Not a restaurant with incredible ambience but still comfortable and clean. The staff had very personable interactions with the patrons which really added to the experience. Food was very good. Loved the guacamole appetizer with flour chips!  The house margaritas will not disappoint! I think we found our new favorite!  Thank you, Don Rubens!
