If you've never had a Raspados you need to go try it as it was very good. I was a newbie and hoped the owners could run me through how it works and what to get but they speak very little English so I was mostly on my own. They did try though. I guess I could blame my lack of Spanish instead of blaming their lack of English in a Mexican store. :)

Anyway, I had a medium Pineapple/Coconut with a little condensed milk and outside of the sugar coma afterwards it was really good. Look forward to trying different flavors in the future.

A Raspados is basically a snow cone made with sweetened real fruit. None of that colored syrup at this place.
