We met some friends here for dinner and were surprised at how hip downtown Gilbert has become! Barrio Queen was one of a few restaurants along this short stretch on Gilbert Road after the speed limit dropped to 25.

The place was busy on an early Sunday evening but our server was quick, patient (we had a lot of questions) and knowledgable. 

We all enjoyed the handmade at your table guacamole in all its chunky glory. I could see myself a regular here, but I cannot see myself visiting and not ordering the guacamole.

We each had different tacos and they were all delicious. I especially enjoyed the Huevo con Chorizo. Yup. An egg on the taco. I almost ordered two of these bad boys, but I'm glad I didn't. It was delicious and it is calling me to return even now, but it was also super filling. The spicy Barrio Pollo was an excellent balance, but there really wasn't a bad taco on the table. 

I debated between trying some tequila and the margarita and settled for the margarita. It was a fine margarita, but I kind of wish I'd gone with just tequila as they had a huge selection (though my wife would never allow me to have the $350 tequila...).

We will definitely be back, and Barrio Queen will be here a long time based on the quality and the crowd.
