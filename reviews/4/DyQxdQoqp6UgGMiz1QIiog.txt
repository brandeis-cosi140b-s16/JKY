Kind of weird to review Chipotle as they are probably all the same but seeing as how we eat here more than anywhere else in the area, I might as well. 

The people always give a friendly greeting when you walk in, the food is consistent, and the place is kept clean. 

The only thing I'd change is the time when found a little piece of plastic bag in my burrito bowl and was treated like I was crazy for thinking it was unacceptable. (?)  Their response when I showed them was "oh." 

Anyways, it's Chipotle and it is good. Even with little bits of plastic bag thrown in every once in a blue moon.
