Visit date 3/24/11:

I was really impressed with our visit. We brought our friends from France and the waitress was really accommodating with our goal of ordering lots to share family style. She even suggested their veggie tamale that was really good. I can't wait to go back and have another. My only qualm? A tiny bit too much cheese drenched on top. I know, I know... anyone who knows me knows I love me some cheese. But the food is so good that it doesn't need to hide under all that cheese!
