I really like this crazy mashup of a place. When I first heard of crossing Chinese food and Mexican I was a bit skeptical. In end the food actually comes out really good I'm huge fan of machaca and the red Jade chicken both of which a flavor packed, I had the spicy diablo chicken the other day which has heat and flavor. 

It's fun to try different mashups with burritos and quesadilla's and the different ingredients. So far I think the Diablo Chicken and Machaca in a quesadilla are the best and a red jade burrito is the way to go. You can always ask to try something before you order and the staff is happy to help you figure all the choices out.

I always get the black beans and jerk fried chicken since those are amazing the rice is probably the most flavorful rice I have had.

The combo deal is a great value too as it is a lot of food for a single sitting but works well for a meal and a snack especially if you do what i do and get 1 entree plain and the other in a burrito or quesadilla. Plus they give you a good cinnamon sugar cookie with everything.

This location is also much bigger than the phoenix one and seems like you get in and out faster but it is hard to find. If you are there and looking for it it's tucked back behind some trees sort of hidden from the rest of the shopping center.

If you like mexican and Chinese or trying sort of off the wall mixing of the two this place is for you.
