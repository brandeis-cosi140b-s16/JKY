First time at Mamita's today - even though we've walked by it a million times.  Yeah - they were recently shut down for Health Department violations, but seriously is there any better time to eat at place than right after getting their license reinstated?  At least you know it's now up to snuff! Besides, we're pretty fearless eaters...so onward!

The menu was surprisingly HUGE!  Cuban and Mexican and American dishes - oh my!  After looking it over for a few minutes, I initially felt that the prices were a little high.  It was the first hot day of the year at lunchtime and I wasn't in the mood for completely stuffing myself silly, so I ordered the Tostada with Camarones a la carte.  When it arrived, it was a nicely prepared fresh tostada consisting of a crispy corn tortilla topped with a MOUND of good sized shrimp with chopped onions and cilantro.  It was served with a slice of lemon, but I think I would have preferred lime.  The waitress offered a bottle of Tapatio which spiced it up nicely.

My husband companion got the chicken fajita tacos with rice and beans.  Definitely NOT what you're thinking.  The "tacos" were really 10" flour tortillas stuffed with a mixture of primarily spiced chicken with some onions and bell peppers tossed in.  The ratio of chicken to veggies was great, not mostly veggies like some local restaurants.  Chicken seemed of good quality as well.  

Service was a little, um, "relaxed", but so were we so we didn't find it annoying.  We chatted with the waitress (whom I assume is either one of the owners or someone who has worked there a long time) and she said they've been there for 14 years.  I definitely give them props for sticking it out on East Fremont through some down-trodden years.  I really hope they stick around to reap the benefits of being at the center of the new hipster haven the FEED has become.
