A while back I ate at Molcasalsa on rancho just north of bonanza in Las Vegas, Nevada

I had the rolled beef tacos which were decent, slathered with guacamole and cheese a little hard for my liking.

I also had the chorizo burrito which was not very spicy but had good flavor it was also made with eggs in it which leads me to believe it's a breakfast burrito(3.5/5).

Additionally I had the Carnitas Tostada, at least that is what I ordered, the meat didn't seem like pork it just seemed like chopped steak, it was piled high with lettuce and cheese, not much if any sauce(3/5).

They have a decent sauce bar pretty standard stuff for around here with the sauces and the carrot,onion, jalapeno mix which was a little spicy.

The best part about it was their prices, all of that was just under 9$ and I got to watch the soccer game for free!

BTW they also will give you a togo menu with a coupon for a free drink "free soda with this cupon"(the typo is on the coupon).
