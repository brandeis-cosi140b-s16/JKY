Food was great. I am new to Vegas and been to a few Mexican joints that were not good. This place had really good food. Chips, salsa, guach, bean dip to start. I had 2 enchiladas, chicken and cheese, and a chicken Taco. Too much food, but can't wait for my left overs at home. Ambiance needs help. If you didn't know the food was good you would swear it wasn't by looking at the yellow walls and wacky carpet. Will definately go back.
