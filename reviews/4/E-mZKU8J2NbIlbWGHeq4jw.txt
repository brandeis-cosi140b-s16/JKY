I love this place! I am from Chicago so I grew up with authentic Mexican food and it can be quite hard to find where I live in Florida . I was in Wisconsin and stayed next door to this restaurant and looked on yelp and it seems to be the real deal. Our bill did get a little higher than I expected but the food was wonderful. I tried steak, chorizo (greasy but tasty), and barbacoa tacos. We were the only patrons in there for a little while, and our server was wonderful to us. He was very attentive and very friendly and just great. I think the owner cooked the food and it was very quick. A few people came in later and judging from their accents I think they were Mexican, which makes me very happy because I know I was surrounded by people who appreciated the restaurant's food. Sadly, this restaurant is very far from me in Wisconsin but if I ever end up in the area again I will definitely be there as soon as I land
