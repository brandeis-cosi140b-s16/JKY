Carefree Station is becoming our go-to place when we hit that "I don't know...where do YOU want to go"  point.  We have had consistently good food every time we got here.  The menu is a bit...eclectic, I'll agree, but we have tried many of the items and have yet to be disappointed.  Yes it is a bit of an older crowd, but when you live north of the 101, that's generally what you get.

Some of our favorites include the fondue, roasted beet salad, asian short ribs and the prime rib tacos.  It is nice that you can order half or full portions depending on your appetite.

We also love the summer specials from the bar that include half price on their extensive beer menu, and also some wines (and not just the junk wines) and half off bottle or glass.  That alone would keep us coming back.

However the good food friendly service and nice atmosphere both inside and out are what make this restaurant a regular on our dining out rotation.
