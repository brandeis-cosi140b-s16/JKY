this is an update on the last review...again great service from the drive thru. I didnt have to ask for any extra stuff with my meal. Drive thru worker (host) Guillermo was on point and did a good job expediting my order...just want to give him proper recognition for insuring i had a good meal. my order was a dinner order and it took place on Nov 15th 2013 at 642pm. Once again del taco goes the job right and puts most drive thru fast food resturants to shame!
