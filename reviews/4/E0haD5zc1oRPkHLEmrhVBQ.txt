went here the morning after i woke up from staying in palace station.  did the deal for unlimited tacos for $7.99, which you don't have to check in to get, they will give it to you anyways.  we sat at the bar, and the 2 people there were nice and pretty helpful.  we got a few drinks which they comp'd since we were playing the little video machines at the bar, and then we ordered our tacos.  service was a little slow for the food, but we didn't care because we didn't have a place to be till later that night.  you can choose between shredded beef, shredded chicken, or ground beef.  my first plate i got all 3, and the shredded beef was by far the best.  the ground beef was decent, but didn't have much flavor, and the shredded chicken was just too dry.  they bring you 3 at a time and you get it on a large plate with lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream, and then rice and beans and you can put all of it in the tacos.  second order i got just shredded beef and they didn't bring more rice and beans, but they did offer them.  i just decided i would rather fill up on tacos than rice and beans.

overall, i probably won't be back just because i probably will not return to palace station, but if i am at palace station, ill probably stop by again
