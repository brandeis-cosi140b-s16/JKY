We were excited to try this place.  We planned it out for today.  We arrived about 11:45.  Perfect timing because right after we got there, it filled up.  When we pulled into the parking lot, quite frankly I was alarmed.  Not what I expected.  Total dive and not inviting at all from the outside.  But we decided to go in anyway.  The young man behind the counter was very welcoming and helpful.  Offered us tastes and answered all of our questions.  I decided on a combination plate of white rice, hengrenade chicken, black bean tostada and black beans, and my partner had chicken fried rice, jade chicken burrito, refried beans and teriyaki chicken.  

We went to get our drinks and plastic forks and packets of soy sauce and salt then sat down.  the food came our fairly fast and the employee was very nice.  The food was pretty good.  My chicken was very good, the tostadas were great and you can't go wrong with white rice.  The Cuban black beans were probably my favorite.  My partner fell in love with her jade chicken burrito.  The chicken fried rice was delicious and the refried beans were good too.  The teriyaki chicken was nice and moist, but the teriyaki sauce was not hot and it was poured over the top of a pile of chicken.  It was not bad, but had too much of a ginger flavor four our taste.  

The d√©cor is quite lacking, and nothing to write home about, but it was not dirty.  Just old and bland.  

We are excited to bring our daughters here to try it.  Over all, we are glad we found this place.  We will try many other things they have.
