My friend and I decided on Mexican food.  He took me here since he's been here before and he likes supporting the locals. 

Our server was an interesting one.   According the my receipt, his name is Andrew.  He likes to see how you're doing by walking by, asking how everything is without stopping.  It was hilarious to watch every time he did that. 

As for the food, my friend got the carnitas tacos and soup, which he liked.  I wanted something fatty and fulfilling so I went with the Mex bowl after looking at the pictures that people posted on Yelp.  My dish was a little on the big side.  I ate most of it and was stuffed.  I thought it was alright.  I don't think I'm a huge carnitas fan.  I just forgot how it tasted like. I should've went with the carne.  I'll remember that next time...
