I really like the food here.  Usually get the crispy beef tacos, rice and beans.  Tacos are a little small but really good.  Got a red tamale once, and it tasted good, but was a little hard and stale like it had been sitting around for awhile.  I want to say a little pricey but the only thing that's cheaper is like a filibertos type place and this is better food than those have.  Always have had good customer service.
