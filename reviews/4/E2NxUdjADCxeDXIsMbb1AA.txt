Wow! Really solid delightful brunch option. For $34.99 sample any and all of the nicely prepared small plates. The attention to detail in the presentation and the taste was wonderful. A bit slow on the service but overall awesome. 

Highlights include: 
Yucatan Eggs
Breakfast Tacos
A Unique Oyster
Salmon Slider
