Ok, Ok... I'm a total fan of the staff! Well yes, speaking spanish with mexicans can be fun, and it brings a plus when you order :).

Despite I'm a very picky person in terms of tacos or mexican food in general, I actually liked this place. Still this is a bit of Sinaloa's style and you still are missing the REAL flavor of tacos. Ooook! granted! I guess I'll never ever find the real mexican taco flavor in this land, but if you want to try something very close to it and can't afford to go to a Tianguis in any Mexican city (Mexico D.F., Guadalajara, Puebla, etc., etc....) this is a good way to start. 

The day I went their selection of beers was VERY limited. SKIP TECATE if you appreciate your taste buds please!. 

Their happy hour, sure can make you happy! Tip the personal and be a happy customer!!
