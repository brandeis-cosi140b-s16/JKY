Finally, my prays have been answered!

California spoiled me for twenty-two years, it only took me a couple months in Vegas for me to see, I bleed rice and beans. I searched the strip and the surrounding area for some quality Mexican food and a place to relax with a margarita after a long week. 

I walked in and immediately felt at home like I was in a San Jose taqueria.

Fresh chips, a whole page of salsa sections along with the house salsa and bean dip they bring out to you.

I ordered as followed:
Started out with yummy queso, fresh guacamole, and a big fat Cadillac margarita with don julio on the rocks. 
I loved the original taco and the green Chile burrito! Words cannot be put into sentences for this one, you just gotta' try it. The green Chile beef just melted in your mouth, covered with tons of cheese and fresh lettuce. 

Good portions. Great service. Lovely environment. No non sense Mexican place that you can head to on a hungover afternoon or midnight craving.

 A live mariachi band playing in the background. Low lights with a full tequila bar in one room and circular booths and tables fill a second. 
What a kick ass date place off the strip! I loved the feeling of Viva Mercados. Score, totally taking my girlfriend's here when they visit. Its affordable enough I can manage to take them there without thinking what Gucci clutch I could have gotten with the bill of dinner on the strip.
