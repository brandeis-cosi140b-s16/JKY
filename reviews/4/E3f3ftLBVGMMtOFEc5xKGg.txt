Dude -- awesome margaritas and Chips n Salsa!

We've been here a few times in our quest to find "the best" margarita and chips/salsa place. Last time we went it was a Sunday afternoon.  The crowd looked like they had been out drinking the night before and needed some mexican food to make their heads feel better.  

Love this place -- I'd like one near my house too!!

Peace Out
