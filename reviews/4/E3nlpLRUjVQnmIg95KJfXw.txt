Love taking out of town guests to this place-the ambiance-funky, different, huge space with a very old Mexican vibe. The food is just okay-but drinks and atmosphere are so great that it makes up for the difference. Huge pond with fish in the center of the restaurant, lots of old Mexican tiles, iron patio furniture and just a really nice atmosphere for a family gathering or celebration. Highly recommended if you are looking for a place with character and just a little bit different than the usual mall restaurant.
