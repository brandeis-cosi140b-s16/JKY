This is what I expect from a classic Mexican cafe. The atmosphere is great and the food superior. It's a rare occasion when I visit Las Vegas and don't eat at least once at the El Sombrero. Everything on the menu is good -- I especially like the chile verde -- and the people are always friendly and helpful. The downside -- its location, while once probably a plus, is not very convenient. Parking is difficult and there really isn't much of it, meaning it's usually full at lunch. But believe me, these are minor annoyances. If you've never been, don't miss out on this great place. I know I'll keep coming back as long as they keep serving up the great food.
