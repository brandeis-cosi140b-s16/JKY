totally scottsdale. i recommend taking ppl not from the area here to get a feel for the town-the atmosphere is incredible. the girls and bartenders are all models and the girls have to wear skimpy bikinis. there is a gorgeous pool and waterfall in the center with cabanas surrounding it and tons of flat screens. there are also two bars. the food is not so great but the drinks are reasonable priced for scottsdale.
