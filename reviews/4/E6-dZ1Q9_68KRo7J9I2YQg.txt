So delicious! Chicken soft tacos are great, lots of onion and cilantro. Chicken enchiladas are also great! Haven't tried the beef or pork yet. Only complaint is that it would be nice to have an option of rice or beans (mostly rice) to go with the tacos and burritos. But I'm impressed with the service, seems to be very clean and fast. Hope they stick around!
