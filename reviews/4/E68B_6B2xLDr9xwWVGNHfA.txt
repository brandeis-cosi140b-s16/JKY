Unbelievably inexpensive and pretty tasty! What more could you ask for if you're up playing poker online?! The fish tacos were delicious, ended up getting a combo. Unfortunately you'll need to add lime and salt to their guacamole it has very little flavor, and don't forget to ask for hot salsa - the house salsa is pretty mild.
