It was ladies night last night and it fell on Taco Tuesday. Loco Patron was a huge hit. The ladies and I filled up a booth with laughter and fun without breaking the bank. From 3pm-Midnight you can score great tasting food and margarita's for an affordable price. $1.00 Tacos, $4.00 Wings in various flavors, $4.00-$5.00 Margarita's and much more. The ladies at my table enjoyed the Strawberry Margarita's at $5.00 a piece. Freshly made and brought to your right away they helped wash down our $1.00 Tacos and upgraded Steak, Fish Taco's for $2.00 bucks. Even though we were given Chips and Salsa to start our food came so quick it was quite the surprise not having to wait long for our food. 

Service was great. We started at the bar and were served by a friendly bartender then we headed to a table near the DJ booth and was served by a server who was on the ball. I mentioned DJ because they have one from 7pm-Midnight. DJ Matt in the hat took our request and spin the night away. 

You don't have to be a starving student to enjoy Taco Tuesdays. We were a bunch of business woman who needed a night out and it was worth every penny. Will do it again!
