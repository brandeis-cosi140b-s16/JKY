If you like Chipotle and that type of Mexican food and want it just a little bit healthier, then Zaba's is the place!  Besides the normal Chipotle flare they add shrimp, whole wheat tortilla's and brown rice into the mix. Making it that much easier to make your food that much better for you.  Not to say that those choices alone make it healthy but it gives you more options to do so.  Overall it's a great place when your craving a big burrito!
