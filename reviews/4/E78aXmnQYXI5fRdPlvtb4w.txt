After leaving the Space Joint nearby still hungry, we ate here. I admit, I didn't like my beef enchiladas because they used shredded beef instead of ground beef and ultimately I didn't eat them. However, the service was great and the food quality was outstanding. Thankfully, my girlfriend shared half of her Ginormous Shrimp Burrito- it was delicious.
