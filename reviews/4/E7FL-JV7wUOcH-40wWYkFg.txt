I must say that this is the best taco place in all of Tempe.  I usually had to make a trek to the west side to get some decent tacos.  This involved considerable time, money, and having to be in the west side.

The flour tortillas, the meat, the drinks, and the fact that they put cabbage on the tacos were all outstanding.  The hot dogs were decent but I would hold out for the real deal bacon wrapped ones, if you can find them.  However please note the following:  The corn tortillas were below par (think mission brand).  To many a mexican food joint are ruined by there tortillas and I am making a stand!!

Overall it is a great place and I hope it sticks around.
