Simple, delicious tacos. I had their tacos the first time I ate there, and they are so tasty that I haven't tried anything else. Mexican style, just the way they should be, with two soft corn tortillas, meat, onions, a little cilantro, and one of their tasty sauces (I'm partial to the verde).  The chicken is flavorful and moist, which is sometimes hard to come by. The potato tacos are good, but a little spicy for my taste.  The chorizo is perfectly spiced and that little bit of drippy grease to let you feel just the right amount of indulgent. 

One complaint: they seem to have changed the carne asada from hunks of meat to ground meet. THAT WAS THE BEST ONE WHY DID YOU MESS WITH IT? The ground meat is fine, but before it was SPECTACULAR.
