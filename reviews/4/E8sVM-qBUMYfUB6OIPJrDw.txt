Being one of the million blank-oberto's in this town, this one is not all that bad.

I really don't like these places, but was at the bank across the street on a Saturday, had my 7 & 8 year olds with me running errands and it was getting to be around 1pm, needed lunch to be quick, easy and something they'd eat.

Between the three of us we had some pretty good quesadillas, a few tacos which were fully loaded and not 90% lettuce, and some carne asada.  

The food was all hot and the taco shells were really very good.   Was not asked to pay extra for the salsa bar OR for drink refills (even though the menu says there is a charge)

My only complaints are:
1.  How the reviewer concluded the food here is not greasy I will never understand..it was all greasy.  This is to be expected at this kind of place, but it was a bit over the top

2.  The blaring hispanic channel soap opera on the two tv's.  As much as I didn't want to eat inside we were a distance from home and I had no choice.  Again this is to be expected.

3.  60 cent charge to use my debit card?  On a $17 order?  Really??  Almost got them a 3-star for that one!
