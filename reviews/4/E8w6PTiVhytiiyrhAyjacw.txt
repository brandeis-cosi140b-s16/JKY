Two things you must have: the Cabo shrimp tacos, and the cilantro "salsa" (it's at the salsa bar, but it's dairy-based, creamy, and delicious). I went with a vegan and even they found something to eat that was reaaaaally good (vegetable burrito). Some of the salsas were really spicy, but all of them were awesome. Decor is great (chairs are a little heavy and make a crapton of noise if you move them, but I don't really think that's a dealbreaker, come on now), and yes, it's in a bad area (really guys, let's keep posting about locking our cars. Shouldn't you do that everywhere anyway? Most of the people I know who have had their cars stolen had them stolen from outside their houses, or at work, in BETTER neighborhoods than this. Get. Over. It), but overall it was fantastic, servers were attentive and very nice, and the food was YUM and at a good price.
