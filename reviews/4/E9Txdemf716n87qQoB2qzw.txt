How to tell a good hole in the wall mexican place: they have horchata, and it doesn't come from a fountain. This place has horchata, and while they don't have one of those horchata-mixer things on display, it tasted pretty fresh. They also have a menu completely full of things that sound tasty - in fact, they seemed to have run out of space for tastiness on their menu, cause there was a second overflow menu under it, also full of things that sounded tasty. Though they realized they were out of sopes after ringing one up, and had to give me a taco instead, but oh well. If you're staying at one of the hotels around here, and you want cheap food, this is the place to go. 

Service is pretty terrible (mostly because it's a tossup whether anyone will speak enough English to be useful), but do you really care at a place like this? 

Note: I came back the next year, I dunno what it was, the food wasn't as good this year as last year. Still good, though.
