I had to try this place it out since it falls under my Category of Cherse = Mexican Food! Plus these Yelp reviews lured me in here in no time!!

Not the nicest place nor the biggest but I'm here for the food, besides this is what typical real authentic mexican food shops look like in Los Angeles, so I guess I'm used to it. 

Carne Asada Burrito with everything: Not the Best I've tried but definitely one of the better Asadas I've had here in Vegas. The meat had distinct roasted red pepper flavor, had a spicy note to it and was outright Tasty! Pour over some green sauce with squeezes of lemon juice and a couple bites from their sliced radish time to time, seemed to amplify the experience!!

Carne Asada and Carnitas "Mulita" Tacos: I don't know what "Mulita" means but it costs like 50 cents more and they add cheese (that real white mex. cheese), slice of avocado, pico de gallo.. Whatever, it's damn good!! They place a tortilla on top, forming a sandwich then they lightly fry the tortilla on both sides, just until it gets some crunch and the cheese starts melting.. The Carnitas (pork) was juicy, tender and flavor was on bullseye!

And the Blue Ribbon goes to the Carne Asada & Carnitas Mulita Tacos!!
