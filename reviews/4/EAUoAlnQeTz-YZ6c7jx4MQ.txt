Went here for the second time and was impressed again.  My friend and I needed a quick grab before a show and I thought this was a regular mexican quick grab restaurant.  You can't really mess up burritos and tacos too bad.  

So I ordered the steak salad for $16.  A few bucks extra, I thought, but on the strip, so oh well.  The salad was huge and had a lot of moist, perfect temperature, marinated, real steak.

Move on to needing a quick bite again at PH and I take my mom and cousin.  We ordered the guac...only 1 and a 1/2 avocados for $11.  A little skimpy on the portion.  But they made it table side and it was good.  

Ordered the steak nachos...waiter does tell us it is only 7 nachos, not a pile...we say ok, well it was plated w 7 bites, but those bites had that same steak and about 2 1/2 bites of steak to each nacho.  I had to fork and knife the steak, but they were good and filling and we actually left one on the plate.

My mom ordered the steak burrito and again, it pretty much had a real, properly cooked medium rare, very pink, tender and marinated steak inside.  It was served with white beans and I prefer black, but otherwise a good choice.  

Wait staff was ok, happy hour at belly up bar only and we called ahead to see if we could use our Caesars comp, but then they said no and we had an ordeal using our points, but the host came and fixed it...they need to communicate with each other...still not sure the deal on that issue, but we had the phone number on our phone where we had called ahead two hours earlier to ask.  

This is my go to quick bite when at PH...just always say no to Blondies...beware...really bad.
