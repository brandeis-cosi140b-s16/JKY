Let me start by saying I've lived in AZ for about 8 months now and have been eating mexican food (burritos in particular) about 3 times a week since I've been out here.  I know Filiberto's is not exactly the classiest joint around, but it sure is delicious.  My first night out here I got drunk with a friend and ended up at a Fili b's late night. Which is another reason to love the place, they are open 24 hours.  Anyway it had to be one of the tastiest drunk meals I've ever had. I recommend the California burrito, not on the menu but it's carne asada, guacamole, cheese, french fries, and pico. Coming from NY we would normally get taco bell late night drunk eats, this is definitely a big step up in deliciousness and has a lot of great items on the menu all reasonably priced as well... give it a shot, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
