I actually like Brennan's, you wouldn't really think their food would be as good as it is.  I typically order Mexican type stuff and haven't been disappointed.  I went a few days ago for lunch with a couple friends after a golf game and everybody really enjoyed their meal.  I had fajitas and my friends had carnitas and grilled chicken salad, good portions, decent salsa and guacamole and BIG pop/tea glasses!!  I've never done 'real' drinks there, but I will say that football season does indeed bring a good share of rowdy fans so I agree that it's not a good place to bring the kids.
Their prices can be a little high, but there's always coupons from the Entertainment book or restaurant.com-our bill was less than $20 with a GC from the latter :)
