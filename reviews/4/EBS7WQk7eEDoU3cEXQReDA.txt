Pizza was good.  The sauce was acceptable.  Price was great.  

But the lady who took my order of an extra large pizza with onions, green peppers, sausage, and extra garlic forgot the sausage!  

So we ate a vegetarian pizza for the Stanley Cup.  

If it wasn't for the error in the order, it would have been 5 stars.  

But we will get them again for sure.  Probably tonight if they aren't closed.
