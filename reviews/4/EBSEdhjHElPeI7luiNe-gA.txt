I live right down the street from Julio's. I have been eating here for all most 3 years, and have been disappointed only once. Other than that though, the food is great for being "fast-food". I especially love the walk-up counter. If it wasn't for that counter, I would have never tried this place. I mean, where else walking distance, can you find this? McDonald's and Subway don't allow dogs in their establishments, however, when you have a walk-up counter, that rule doesn't apply. Great for when I am walking my dog in the early mornings or late evenings.
