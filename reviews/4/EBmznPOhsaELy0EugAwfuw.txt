One day several months ago I was trying to find a good taco shop close to work. With the courtesy of Yelp, I found the Tacos La Mexicana restaurant, so my friends and I decided to give it a try. Here's what I thought:

THE DECOR (3 out of 5)
Nothing too special here as you would expect from any other taco shop in a little strip center. There are a limited number of tables here, but it usually isn't too much of a problem finding a place to sit after you've placed your order. The good part is that they do keep the dining area clean, and they have a couple of flat screen TVs to watch to pass the time.

THE FOOD (4 out of 5)
Now, the food is the best part. I usually order the 4 taco lunch special which includes 4 tacos, beans, rice and a drink. With the tacos you just need to let them know what kind of meat that you want from Al Pastor, Chorizo, Carnitas, etc. The tacos taste fresh and are definitely delicious. The little salsa bar that they have setup on a small table may be a little lacking but at least they have the usual suspects with a couple of different salsas, carrots, jalape√±os, and radishes.

THE PRICE (5 out of 5)
So, the lunch special that I usually get is just $5.99 plus tax! So you won't be breaking the bank when eating at this restaurant. 

OVERALL (4 out of 5)
So, if you're on the west side of town and feel a hankering for some good but cheap eats, you should definitely give Tacos La Mexicana a try!
