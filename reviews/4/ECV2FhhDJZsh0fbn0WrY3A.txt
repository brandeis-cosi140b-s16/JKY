OK so its a dive....but its a dive in the good way meaning thats a fantastic food tucked away behind a pretty ugly storefront.  Still if you know the neighborhood then you know not to get too scared away by the exterior and the inside has always been clean.  The tacos are legit as are the fresh juices.  I can't comment on the mexican sushi, it just hasn't attracted me, but i'm sure I'll give it a go one day soon since everyone 
keeps commenting on how good it is.  If you want quality street tacos then this is about as good as they come.
