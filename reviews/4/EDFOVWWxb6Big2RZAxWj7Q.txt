After a late night of gigging and drinking, a stop at the nearest Roberto's to home is a must!  I've been on a fish tacos kick as of late - and I think the ones here are pretty solid. Roberto's is Roberto's - what can I say?  Not the most authentic mexican food (or the cheapest), but reliably edible and open 24-hours. 

It always seems like their training new kitchen staff in the early AM hours (which makes sense) - so the food and service isn't necessarily consistent visit to visit.  This night they were topping everything in a king's ransom worth of grated cheese!  Too much!
