I was here watching the Cardinals Texas 6th Game of the world series.  Great evening of good food and unique margaritas.  

Was there the Saturday afternoon before Halloween, just more of the same.  The tacos were great and the margaritas are fairly light so great for the afternoon.  

The service was great even in a fairly busy environment.  The beer taps on the table were a favorite of the males around while the late not music kept the place rocking.
