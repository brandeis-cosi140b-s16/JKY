This place is a keeper! Went early on a Saturday evening. The front bar was full, but not crowded. However, the deck was fully packed! I had two organic margaritas and an order of the Pescado(fish) tacos. The tacos were good (a little bland for my taste), and the drinks were strong! 

The music they played that night was amazing, 90s rap and R&B. I don't know if people dance there, but I was ready to bust a move! The women's bathroom is set up awkwardly... You enter into a very small room with one sink, then you enter into another small room with one toilet... I hope you're not claustrophobic! 

All in all it was a good time!
