Very pleased with the ceviche section.  Cute lil tostadas with great tasting toppings, some unconventional topping on the special ceviche tostada.  I don't really want to give away its secrets, try it yourself!

Less pleased with the marlin machaca.  Definitely not fresh tasting compared to everything else, but was surprised at how good the rice was, very lightly buttered and salted with some nice snap to the veggies.
