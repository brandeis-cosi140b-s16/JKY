First of all ihave to say i m Not a Fan of mexikan Food but the Pink Restaurant made me to Wanna try it

Host: nice blonde girl. Friendly 

Service: a Guy. Not vey Attentive. You want to get tipped so be nice & Helpful. 
Never asked for a refill. I had a Coke. Hubby had a Beer. ( Never asked for a Second)

Food: Steak fajitas ok meat was Salty& the meat cuts were tiny Looks like the Rests of the steaks were Cut Off. 

Restaurant: outside very nice seating

Menu: over all Good choices

Would try it again. Maybe Service gets better.
