Just stopped by for a quick drink and a snack.  We got the quesadillas, guacamole, and some margaritas. They have a good frozen house margarita, which was a great way to help beat the heat.  The food was decent and hit the spot.  El Encanto is a huge place with a massive patio.  The patio can only be good for a few months a year given how hot it is in AZ, but it looked very nice.
