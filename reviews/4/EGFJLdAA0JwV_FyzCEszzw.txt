I have taken away a star... I would give it 3 1/2 stars if that were an option.  Yep, my intense and abiding love of Chipotle has waned a bit.  It might be because I consider Chipotle's food to be somewhat bland compared to Baja Fresh (which I frequent now), but I'm just not that jazzed about Chipotle anymore.  It's partially this location too.  A while ago, I knew every person who worked there and could count on them putting a lot of detail into my food.  Now, it seems like every time I go in, there is a whole new line of people working behind the counter.  As a result (maybe they are in training??), it is SLOOOOOOOOOW, even during non-peak hours.  The people just don't seem as invested in their jobs or as friendly as they used to be.  I feel like I am hassling them to make my bowl.

Either way, I still like Chipotle because I consider it to be a "fresher" option than a lot of places.  Since I can customize my bowl, I can choose to lighten it up and not add a bunch of heavy stuff.  I try to eat well and in moderation, so Chipotle is still a good choice for me.
