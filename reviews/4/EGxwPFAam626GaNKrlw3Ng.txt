Ohhhhhh Chevy's how I love you. Their chicken fajita salad is one of my favorite salads anywhere. Crispy greens, grilled chicken, pepita seeds, avocado, salsa...yes please. Chevy's also likes to do a fruit of the month where they will make lemonades and margarita's using this fresh fruit puree. I had a cantalope lemonade, and let me say, one of the most refreshing delicious drinks EVER! I've also had their watermelon lemonade and mango lemonade, also great. Their chips and salsa are always great as well. The only so-so occasionally is the service.
