Been a fan of Pasqual's for almost 20 years. I last ate here when they were still across the street from Michael's up the way. It's nice to see the food hasn't lost a step and is still a lighter and fresher take on American Mexican fare. I miss the free parking, the slightly more cozy atmosphere, the ala carte options, and the more price-friendly counter service of the old place, but I'm glad the basics are still in place at the new location. Hopefully they'll continue to keep me as a fan for the next 20 years.
