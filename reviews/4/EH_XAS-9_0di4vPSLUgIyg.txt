We tried this spot for the first time last night.

I have to say, the food quality was pretty impressive. We ordered beef burritos, chips w/ cheese, and a cheese quesadilla.

We also ordered a chicken burrito. However, the cashier did not hear my wife order it. No charge and no chicken burrito. She decided to forego it & eat what we already ordered. 

I had a coupon for a free agua fresa, so I ordered the pineapple. If you want a refill, there is a dollar charge. So I received a spinach one the 2nd time. The Spinach drink is mixed with orange juice & lime. HIGHLY recommended. I also tried the chia lemonade, which was also amazing. If they ever had passion fruit agua fresa, I would stop there at least 2 or 3 times a week just for that!

The nachos w/ cheese - was just that. Chips with real cheese on top. I was hoping for someone a tad more elaborate, but I didn't argue about it. Maybe some pico de gallo on the side would have made it work?

The cheese quesdadilla was spot on. One of the best I had in Vegas.

The beef burrito was pretty tasty. Once again, I would hope for pico de gallo on the side, or a better choice of sauces. But, it was tasty in its own right.

The prices are not Del taco cheap, but it is comparable to Chipotle.

I will say, for a start up restaurant, I am impressed they have a good following already. I think Frijole's will be alright. We will go at least once a month - and maybe more if a few minor things are ironed out.
