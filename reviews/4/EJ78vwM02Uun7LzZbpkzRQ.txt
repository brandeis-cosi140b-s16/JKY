I was in Charlotte visiting some friends that brought me here to try the fish tacos on a Saturday morning. We walked in 30 minutes after they opened so wer were immediately sat at a table. I was told that they get super busy pretty early and it last most of the day.

They brough complimentary chips & salsa and the salsa was obviously homemade with lots of flavor. We ordered queso that was also good. I ordered 2 tuna tacos (1 Tavarua Taco & 1 BBQ Mahi Taco). Both were great but the Tavarua was just plain nuts. It has honey wasabi sauce and I'm a big fan of wasabi. I know they've gotten sub-par reviews but my visit was really good. I'll look to visit again the next time I'm in Charlotte.
