Rubio's is my favorite place to get some vegetarian tacos that I don't have to drive all the way downtown for. The grilled portabello and poblano gourmet tacos make me happy. They made me sad for awhile because for some reason they were taken off of the menu for a few months, and during that time I boycotted Rubio's. But as soon as I found out that they were back I came in to get my beloved tacos. Baby portabellos, poblano peppers, avocados, cheese, and some kind of spicy cream sauce all on a corn tortilla. Mmmmmm!

I also like their chips, they aren't like eating a salt lic like the chips at Chipotle. They are just the right amount of salty. The salsa that I like the best is the roasted chipotle salsa. Its got this really nice smokey flavor. I wish I could buy that at the store and eat it all of the time. I've had all of the other salsas at other times but I don't care too much for them. I also am not a fan of their beans that come with the meal. Most of the time they are really watery and I am just not a fan.

I come to this location the most often, and the only thing bad about it is they have this really strange guy who works there and who is mostly always there when we come in, who likes to get a little too personal for me. Tone it down, dude. But other than that, I can't complain about this place.
