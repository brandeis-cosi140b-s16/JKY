The name is brilliant, but I laugh every time I say "Some Berto's." But as a seasoned cook of 20 yrs, and a pallet that consumes hot sauces of 800,000 cu heat units, I can still say that there are still plenty of flavors in this Berto's locale. I get the Carne Asada Fries mostly, and I have tried Don Tortaco, Fausto's and of course Roberto's and there is something about Algo's that is a tad bit better. The salsa bar has more choices and is always clean whenever I visit.
If you are in the area, I recommend.
Be weary of people who don't have an affinity in the kitchen, and one's who don't understand that taste buds change every 7 yrs.
