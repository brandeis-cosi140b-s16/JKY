Simple, straighforward mexican food...with no frills !
I love the chicken tacos, the 3-way burro enchilada style,
the chees crisps, the Bean Tostada w/guacamole and the bean burro. Next time you go, notice that the salsa has just a 
slight hint of mint - love it !
I've been going there since the tacos were 25c each and
have never been disappointed...give it a try
