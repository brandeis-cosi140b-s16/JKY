At first I was turned away by the prices - $10 Mojitos, $10 chips and dips, meals hovering around $15.

But once I got the chicken fajita (with guac), my opinion began to change. The chicken meat was slightly above average - nothing special, but the vegetables were cooked very fresh and had that slight sweet grill flavor that I love.  

Guac was truly the best I've had, and went very well with the chips they provided before the meal.
