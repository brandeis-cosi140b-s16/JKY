We've had really good experiences here. On the last trip, my "enchiladas guadelajaras" were excellent, topped with fresh lettuce/tomatoes and guacamole. Very fresh and delicious. My wife's "enchilada poblano" was similarly excellent. The mole sauce was rich. We enjoyed the Laredo margarita and a dessert flan. The only mild criticism is that the dining room (like most other restaurants) can get really loud. But we'll be back.
