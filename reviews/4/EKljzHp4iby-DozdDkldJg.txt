For some reason, forgetting about the grease fill chicken taco and trip to the restroom late at night after eating this place, I LOVE IT!  The breakfast burrito is amazing. It's full of Cheese, Bacon, Eggs and Potatoes. Just how I like them!   

I always get chicken tacos. Although I don't consider them authentic, I prefer them over many Mexican restaurants in this area. The staff at this Roberto's are very nice. Another plus is its located in a gas station, which makes it perfect for getting the perfect beverage to go with the food.
