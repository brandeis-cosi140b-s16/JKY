I had some time to kill between planes and when this happens I like to kill that time with booze. Jose Cuervo Tequileria was right next to my gate and they have a full bar and corn chips... winner in my book. I ordered a mango margarita and decided to get the pork chimichanga.

The drink = TERRIBLE. I've had $3 happy hour margaritas that were better than this $13.49 slushy machine drink. Seriously a waste of money and time. Minimal flavor, minimal alcohol at a very UN-minimal price.

The food = GOOD. I ordered my chimichanga with shredded pork, rice, refried beans, roasted corn, crema, queso fresco and green chili salsa. It was a large portion and surprising very good. In fact I liked it so much that I had it boxed up and carried it back to San Diego with me to finish off when I got home. This place doesn't have the "authentic" Mexican food flavor but for airport Mexican or heck Vegas Mexican it's pretty dang good.

The Service = GREAT. My servers name was Laura and she was on point. You seat yourself at this place and Laura had my drink ordered and delivered within 5 min of my sitting down. She was attentive without hovering and so sweet without being irritating about it. And yes, you can be so sweet it's irritating. If I could rate her alone I'd give her 5 stars.

The Cost = Wow and nope. I'd say they could get away with charging $12.59 for my chimichanga and not piss me off but $13.49 for my drink...not at all. The cost of that horrible drink just set me off and I'm still irritated by it.
