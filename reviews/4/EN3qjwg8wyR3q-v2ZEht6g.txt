Was not bad. I was actually surprised. Menudo was really good and spicy. Their nachos were made for white people, chips smothered with nacho cheese/guac/refried beans topped with meat.

Their sauce station was on point, loved the pico de gallo and guac sauce.

When I come back for work I wouldn't mind going here again.
