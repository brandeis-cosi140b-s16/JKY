Well staffed location at the airport and they hustle but not distracting so. The server I have is doing an excellent job. Tracy is a rock star. 

I started with the guacamole and was recommended and definitely worth ordering. The chips came warm mounded in a bowl and accompanied by an excellent salsa. The guacamole and salsa together was a hit. 

For the "main" course I am trying the 3 cheese quesadilla with Machaca (shredded beef short ribs - nuff said) Oaxaca, Asadero and Manchego cheeses along with fresh pico de gallo. Ah man this beef rocks in a quesadilla. So order this this the next time I am in this airport. 

The classic on the rocks margarita with silver Patron and fresh squeezed lime juice is fabulous.
