Had the pleasure of having Sunday brunch with a friend here a few weeks ago! What a treat for my palette! To start off, they had chips with a few salsas to chose from, and the one that is served warm was so savory, love it!  We shared the guacamole, which was made fresh table side-guac lovers rejoice indeed! I had the crab cake eggs benedict, which was seductively wrapped in a unique chipotle wine hollandaise sauce, served with yummy potatoes, and fruit in a cinnamon and sugar hard shell tortilla bowl! Add a complimentary mimosa to boot, it was all awesome!  I look forward to a return visit to try some of their later day dining options for sure, and maybe a margarita!  

Overall, I give it a 4 start rating, which is still pretty good!  The food speaks for itself!
