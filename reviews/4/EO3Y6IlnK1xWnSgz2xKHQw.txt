We really like that the owners are so hands-on with the restaurant and reaching out to its customers.  They send out email updates, do special events in the community such as cooking classes, and don't come off as rock stars!

We have eaten here probably 10 times.  The Tortilla Soup is one of our favorites!!  We usually get the special they are offering.  Last time was Barracuda and it was so good.  We were just expecting to develop a severe underbite afterwards :)

Eat here whenever you are hitting up a concert at Mandalay Bay and need a great, close place to eat!!
