Solid 3.5/5 stars

Second dinner of the night! hahah I just finished my first dinner, and drove over here for my second dinner.

Overall, the ambiance is VERY loud on a Wednesday night. It was rather difficult to converse with my friend; there was a huge bday party next to us. We heard the staff sang happy birthday to at least 4 groups while we were there--must be the place to go for bday celebrations!

Ordered:
1) Guacamole: Hand made right in front of you: 3.5/5
2) Steak Ranchero: Medium; Cooked to perfection; Actually my expectation was low since it was not from a steakhouse, but overall impressed: 3.5/5

Overall, a nice venue to get away from the typical Vegas crowd--lots of locals here.
