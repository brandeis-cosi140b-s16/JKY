This is a hidden gem off 7th Street just North of Roosevelt. Ordered to go from them, and I will definitely be back. I had the machaca burrito, and it was superb. It had egg and jalapenos, which made for a most-delicious meal. The reason it didn't receive 5 stars is that my wife had the carne asada burrito, and it was just good. Not outstanding. As well, their red salsa, which we received a big to go cup of, tasted a little like pizza sauce. It wasn't very good to us as at all. The guacamole was also good. Lastly, we ordered rice and beans, but arrived at home to find there were none in the bags. I didn't get a receipt, so I don't know if we paid for them or not, but it was okay, because the chips (delicious) and guacamole with the burritos was plenty of food. The place itself is small, but nice, and I love the murals painted on the outside. As I said, I'll definitely be back, if only just for the machaca burrito. Happy eating!
