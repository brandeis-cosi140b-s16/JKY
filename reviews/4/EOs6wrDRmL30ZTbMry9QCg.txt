If you've read any of my reviews, it's no surprise that I take into account the fact that Valle Luna is what it is... it's not backed by some culinary genius mixing up roasted pepper foams to top off a taco. This is downright classic, fried, greasy goodness.

There is some history to my love of the Mexican food. I originally wanted to be a chef so at the young age of 12 I got my first prep cook job in a small town at Zapatas Mexican Restaurant. It wasn't long until I was 13 and running the kitchen at night. I'm sure this was illegal, but who cared in Page/Lake Powell, AZ?

Long story short - I ended up pursuing another career, the owner passed away and the new ownership screwed up the recipes and menu. Since then, I have been on an endless journey to find my 'Zapatas' here in the Valley. The closest I had found was El Minuto in Tucson. And then one day, my brilliant friend and co-worker invited me to lunch.

That's when...I met Valle Luna.

It's been a dirty love affair ever since. A time warp back to my youthful days at Zapatas. The chips are fried in-house. The shredded beef tacos are everything I remembered them to be. I finally have found a reincarnated Zapatas!!!!

This is true Sonoran Mexican food as it was meant to be.
