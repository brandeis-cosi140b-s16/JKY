This was my first time ever going to this restaurant. Being Hispanic I am used to authentic Mexican food so I was spectacle. I got the quesadilla kids meal. It came with a side of rice and beans. It was very good. The food was fresh and tasty. I also enjoyed the chips it comes with. I also had a taste of the bowls. I tried the steak and everything was good quality. I will definitely go again.
