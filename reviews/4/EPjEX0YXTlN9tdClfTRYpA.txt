I went for lunch on a Saturday with my 2 kids.  Place was bustling with people who knew where to get good, authentic Mexican foods.  The chips and the 3 salsa's were amazing......red salsa, salsa verde and an extremely HOT one that had smoked chilies in it.  

I had the Burrito La Unica which was LOADED with chicken, rice, beans, and topped with queso.  This burrito was the real deal, not like any other "number 15" on other Mexican restaurants menus.  I was stuffed when I left since I ate the entire thing.  My kids had the cheese and chicken quesadillas and enjoyed them.  

The service was excellent, they had plenty of waitresses who made sure the drinks and chips stayed full.

Every so often you fell like eating Mexican, you know?  This is my new go to place.  Highly recommended!
