I had the combo #1 which is a burrito, taco, rice and chips. It comes with beans too but I never get beans. I loved the taste of the soft taco it was tasty! I wasn't a big fan of the Carne Asada burrito because it was too salty for me and they put rice in the burrito . I do LOVE their Watermelon Juice with a capital "L" ! It's sweet but oh so perfect on a hot Las Vegas day! I can drink my weight in it ....that's a lot of juice!
