Faustos is perfect if you're looking for comfort Mexican food. Often greasy and loaded with cheese and fried in oil, this place isn't for those on a diet. 

That being said, Faustos is a favorite among the locals and is always busy because their food comes at a great price and is always consistently yummy! They get four stars because of their cleanliness, courtesy, and consistency. The reason they don't get five stars is their lack of a healthy option (they could easily do a taco or chicken salad here) and because of their sometimes long wait times.
