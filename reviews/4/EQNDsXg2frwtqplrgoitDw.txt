Ordering a late night spicy burrito can be risky business with my sometimes fickle stomach, but nothing can stop me on a mission with a HUGE craving at 2AM. I'm never on this part of the valley but I was visiting a friend and he told me this was down the street before the freeway. 
   Thankfully it's the REAL 'berto's and not a copy, so risk was reduced greatly. There's only one.
My adobada burrito was big and heavy and for $4.09 plus tax. I got extra red sauce. Often times the universal red sauce is runny and not very hot, this red sauce is perfect and just right on the hotness. I tend to drink from the container rather than pour on my food with this kind of sauce, and the combination was Fili-b's perfection. I moaned and groaned and sighed while I ate in the car in the parking lot. I saved one sauce and 1/4 the burrito for later.
 I got home in south Scottsdale and devoured the rest.
VERY satisfying.
I slept on my left side to prevent mid-sleep heartburn or other discomfort.
This afternoon I crave yet again.....
