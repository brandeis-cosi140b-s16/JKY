LOVE THE CEVICHE!!! Haven't had too much else but the tamarind margaritas and ceviche where GREAT! IT"S A MA AND PA type restaurant so stop your whining about the ambiance, it has character. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the size of my margarita....it was small:( If your in the area I'd say its worth stopping in before it gets too hot:)
