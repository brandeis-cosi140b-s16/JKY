Update: went in and got some chicken tacos but disappointed with the quality of chicken. It was very fatty. Other than that, it's still a great place for some good eats. 






17 years and this place is still standing strong! 

Don't judge a book by its cover! Mucho taco will knock your socks off with their food and their customer service. I came in and ordered a few tacos and a carne asada burrito. The food was great. It contained a lot of meat, which I like.

Five stars definitely goes to their customer service. Even though it was busy with only one person running the front, they were attentive to each person!While I waited, they offered me free chips and salsa along with a cup of iced horchata. I don't care about the "free" part, but I care about the gesture; it was unexpected.  The salsa was spicy (yum) and the horchata was refreshing. 


A must try place if you're ever nearby.
