One of the better Chipotle's I've been too. Food is always fresh and tasty :). My go to "fast food" place as I wouldn't call it a real restaurant. Chicken Burrito bowls with pinto beans and everything is so good! So happy that this place is so close to where I live now, because my previous location didn't have a Chipotle joint for over 10 miles :(.
