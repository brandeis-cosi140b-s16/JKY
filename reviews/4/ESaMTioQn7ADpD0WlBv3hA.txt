Every time I come here, the GM is super awesome. He introduced himself awhile back, and now we're on a first name basis. Not sure if that's a sign that I go too often or great customer service (maybe a little of both).

As for the food itself, It's definitely not, 'Authentic' Mexican food, but for Mexican Fast food fix, this sure does beat Taco Bell. It's always fresh, and I'm a huge fan of the HOT sauce and lime salt chips they have there. I'm literally in between two locations, one off of Shea and another off Frank Lloyd Wright and whenever I'm looking to feed my Chipotle fix, I make sure to migrate to this one.
