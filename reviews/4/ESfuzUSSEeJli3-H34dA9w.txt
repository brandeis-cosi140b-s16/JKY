If the Travel Channel did a special called "Best Kept Secrets of the West Valley" then Caramba's would make the cut hands down. Sure, sure the decor isn't the greatest and neither are the bathrooms. But that's not what matters when it comes to Mexican food, is it? 

What matters is the fish tacos (some would argue that fish tacos are all that matters). And oooohweee does Caramba's have some good fish tacos; possibly the "real" version of the imitation fish tacos that Rubios serves (Plato's Allegory of the Cave, anyone?). 

The chips and salsa are good if you can stomach the salsa bar. Personally, just seeing food that anyone can touch and kept in open air has me running for the bathroom. But in all fairness it still tastes pretty good. 

Now, we have arrived at the most important part of the review: the drink selection! Margarita's, mango and otherwise, and sangria rule the menu. They are cheap, delicious, strong, and most of all well worth the $3.00! 

This is a great lunch or early dinner spot. I prefer to ride my tandem bicycle here, so that my suitor and I can both drink and ride home without in-dangering anyone but our bike.
