The outside isn't impressive but it's pretty nice and clean inside. You get free chips and salsa which is a plus. Chips aren't good but the salsa makes up for it in a way. I tried the Pollo en Mole which is terrific! A little overpriced at $12 but those homemade corn tortillas are amazing. Big and fluffy. Overall it's a good hole in a wall. It is a sit down restaurant so bring that extra tip money. :)
