Yum, yum, yum ... Went here with a girlfriend for some afternoon munching and day drinking on a Saturday. Turns out they have $3 Dos Equis and $5 mimosas all day on Saturdays, and I was in the mood for beer.  Gotta tell ya, I judge a mexican food joint by two things: their chips & salsa, and their house margarita.  (Wait, is that three things?  Well I count it as two!) ... Anywho, Diego Pops has awesome chips & salsa and a delicious house margarita.  Score!  I stuck with beer, but tasted my friend's marg for quality control purposes.  We sat on the patio which is nicely shrouded from Scottsdale Rd.  I ordered the La Pina salad for my main course, sans goat cheese.  That jalapeno vinaigrette is awesome.  Balances nicely with the sweet pineapple, creamy avocado and crunchy cabbage.  My friend had a shrimp taco, but once she tasted my salad, she ordered one of those as well.  I would go back to Diego Pops just for these few things I've tried, but I will push myself to try something new next time too.  Bonus: A decent part of their menu is served for late night too, so we won't be relegated to the greasy pizza or nacho joints for 11pm munchies!
