Location is sketchy,but service is always GREAT! And so is the food!
 Dining in is a good idea so that your tortillas do not get soggy, but they wrap the food up well for take-out so it keeps warm! Their salsas are so delicious! I recommend the sopes with cabeza and the tacos with any type of meat! Don't be afraid! Try their entire selection of meats! njoy!
