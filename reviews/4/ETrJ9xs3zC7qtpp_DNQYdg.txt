I just ate at this place on Saturday.  Most of you (I'm willing to bet :)) don't spend a lot of time hanging out in the neighborhood of 31st Ave and Van Buren.  I teach at a school there and have been making it a point to track down any and all great little food places.  El Taquito is great.  It's bright yellow on the outside.  The inside is clean, with about 8 booths.  There was a guy singing and playing guitar (not sure if he was paid by the restaurant, or just doing his own thing).  I got the cherviche tostada, which was basically Pico de Gallo with shredded shrimp added to it on top of a fried corn tortilla.  Amazing!  It's the first time I've eaten Mexican and not felt all greasy afterwards.  Everyone else's food looked great too (the taquitos were so small!).  I'll be back for sure.
