Ate lunch here this weekend with a group.  We received excellent service.

I had the high desert  pasta and I plan to return as soon as possible and enjoy this dish again.   linguini, garlic, pine nuts, tomatoes, mushrooms, asiago cheese and cilantro, tossed with white wine and olive oil--I'm hooked, but now I'll never get to try all the other dishes.
