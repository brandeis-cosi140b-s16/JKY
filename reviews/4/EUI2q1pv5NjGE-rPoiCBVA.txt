So, for those reviewers that say the food is "meh" I kind of understand. Their standard fare is nothing to comment on yelp about, however their specialties are! My usual order is the Shrimp Tacos doused in the Vodka sauce and my other half has a really hard time not ordering the Las Conchas which consists of heaven on a plate. Their fish tacos are also delish and every time I have ordered the salmon it has been cooked to perfection. 

Their service can be hit or miss, it really just depends on who you get. When the owner is in she comes around and visits every customer and tries to get a feel for how they can improve and if you are enjoying your meal which is a really nice touch.

Happy Hour is great with a numer of decent beers to choose from and I have heard that their margaritas are good (they look pretty, but I have never actually tried one). 

Overall, a definite staple for my family (probably my 3 year olds favorite restaurant ever) and we think that it is the best in the 'Copa as long as you stick with their specialties.
