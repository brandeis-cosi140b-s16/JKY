Really good taco shop for Las Vegas standards (obviously not as good as a San Diego taco shop).  Open 24 hours.

I had a quesadilla and 5 rolled tacos.  Food was cooked up really really quick.  Tables inside are clean.

The quesadilla was very cheesy and very buttery.  Delicious.  Tortilla was a tad bit rubbery, but not nearly as bad as most taco shops around town.

The rolled tacos were great.  A bit big too.  They were crispy without being overcooked.  Guacamole was slightly above average.
