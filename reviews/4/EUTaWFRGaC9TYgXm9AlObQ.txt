I believe this place is by the same owner of the two restaurants next door. It has a nice patio and a relaxed atmosphere. 

The food ranged from good to excellent. The cocktails were not, but the bartender was so obnoxiously cute I would've probably choked down whatever she could wring out of the bar towel. I'm lucky my gf doesn't mind if I'm a creepy ogler once in awhile - she thought she was hot as well. 

The drinks we tried had either too much alcohol or were too sweet. They were really accommodating and sweet to us, so we felt bad saying we didn't like them. 

Anyway, regardless - the mac and cheese stood out, and we liked the salsas and guacamole. We will definitely go back.
