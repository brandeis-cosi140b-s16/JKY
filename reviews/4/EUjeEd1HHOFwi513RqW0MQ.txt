Great restaurant, great food and service.  Always treated extremely well, good suggestions on menu items.  Close by favorite.for me.  And, they have great specials during the summer to get you in there on the weekend....have to love that part. 

I have never had a bad meal there, the service has been great and if you ask the server for a recommendation, you get some good ones!
