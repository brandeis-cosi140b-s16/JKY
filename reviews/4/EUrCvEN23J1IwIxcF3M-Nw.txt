After class, I was picked up and taken away.  Surprise surprise.. They brought me to get a log.

I have driven pass this place multiple times and never took the time to stop by.  My first thought, 20% off for UNLV Students.. Score!

We came in for lunch, not too packed.  Very decent crowd for a weekday of course.  Place was very open ended.  Lots of tables and booths available.  We grabbed a booth and of course a bowl of chips and salsa arrived on cue.  Tasty chips, less salt, salsa was a little weak for me.  I need that hot stuff!  

Lots of options for lunch of course with a special lunch price.  We all got different items.  I got the lunch burro (log).. Our server was very kind enough to have the cook put cheese on top so it was more appealing and looked more like a chimichanga.  At first sight.. I didn't think I would finish.. But, after a several bites and hot sauce.. I cleaned up pretty well.  No togo box necessary.  Shredded beef was delicious and the oozing cheese was wonderful.  Served on a hot plate of course.  I took a peek at what my friends had, very nice picks.  Plates look delicious as well.  May be a little less than what I was having of course.  They went with the 2 item options where they could pick up a taco, enchilada, tamale, etc.  But if you are an eater like me, better stick with the burro.  

Service was on top.. I truly mean it because my water cup was constantly being refilled.  She offered to add syrup flavors to my friends lemonades.  Very nice of her and the fact that she offered to redo it if it doesn't turn out good.  

Overall, I would come back to try out the other items.  Place had some slot machines and video poker.  Fire place was a nice touch.  I also noticed a bar area on the way out.  Parking is decent, doesn't look like it will be a problem..
