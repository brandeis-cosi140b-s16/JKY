Good mexican food, rice and beans taste very traditional. 
I ordered the fish tacos, a little afraid that the fish would taste like freezer but it didnt, it was very fresh and delicious!! 
Service is always good, they refill your drinks at the right time and bring more chips before the basket is empty. 
THE ONLY THING I DONT LIKE is that the salsa is HORRIBLE, worst salsa I have ever had!!!! Out of a can, mixed with old salsa and who knows what else!!
I had to tell the lady to change the salsa for a different one because I was not enjoying my chips. 
Other than that, food is delicious!!!! 
Enjoy!!!
