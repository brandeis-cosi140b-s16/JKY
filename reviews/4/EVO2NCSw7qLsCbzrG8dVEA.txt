This place has good shrimp tacos! Their salsa is pretty good and spicy.

Maria gives great customer service. If you're new to the restaurant, she'll go over the menu and explain everything. 

I had the beef gordita and sope. Both were good, but the shrimp taco was my favoite. 

I'm used to the SoCal Mexican food and its hard to find authentic mexican food and Charlotte. This one is one of the better Mexican restaurants i've had in Charlotte.
