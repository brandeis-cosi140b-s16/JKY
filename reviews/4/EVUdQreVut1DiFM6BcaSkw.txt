Some co-workers and I were looking for some good Mexican near our hotel while on a business trip in Scottsdale. Yelp led us here. The chips and salsa were very good, and bottomless. The quesadillas were very good and the meal quite filling. The place has nice unique decor too, which is always a bonus. On the odd side, they have a strict policy against separate checks. You can pay one check with 4 different credit cards, but you can't get 4 checks instead. Whatever, it didn't cause any problems.
