pros... great place for the tired and hungry.  went here right after my first flightlining trip.  since we were staying at the monte carlo, this was the best spot to eat and then run up to the hotel room to rest a bit before going out again.

the place wasn't completely packed but it was getting there.  we got a table very quickly no waiting at all.  our table was nice and big and our server was great.  he was quick with the orders and very on it.  we never had an empty cup around and empty plates and dishes were removed quickly.  

food was quite good, i had the carne asada steak plate, cook medium rare.  it was slightly over cooked, but nothing too bad.  it had some beans, rice, some salsa, and 4 flour tortillas as well.  good.  my wife had the nachos, pretty much the same plate as mine but in nacho format, also good.  

i must say that i did have some alcohol to drink while i was there.  i think i just had to, seeing as i just got back from the flight lines.  i was feeling great, so the whole table ordered the Paloma Blanca which was awesome, so fresh tasting.  order by the pitcher it's cheaper.  

cons... don't order the empanadas, unless you like the taste of taco bell meat with some raisins.  eww!  oh have the t.v.'s on and have some closed captioning on it too.  just in case you really want to know what's going on.
