Three trips has not disappointed yet.

the interior atmosphere is spot on to a number of places I have been to in Central America.  The decor, the service, the atmosphere.  I have had very attentive waitresses each time.  

The chips and salsas are very nice(ok one humid weekend I thought the chips were a bit stale).  One dip is a darker red salsa (smoked chillis?)  the second one is my favorite it is green cilantro and avocado dip.  It is so good I have purchased some to take home for later (ask the waitress - even comes iwth chips).

The first two times I ordered a whole fried fish ajillo, covered in sauteed garlic, peppers and onions.  It was very authentic just as I had eaten many times down south.

The rice and beans are as expected, not fantastic not dry and tasteless like other places.  Note - I did not come for rice and beans ;-).

Once my wife ordered the Camarones Culichi Shrimps In A Green Sauce, Tomatill & Cilantro, which was excellent.  The waitress recommended it and she was right.  The sauce seems to have some cheese mixed/melted in that made it sinfully savory.

Another time I ordered tacos al pastor.  OK, I know it is a seafood shop but after the nice ceviche I was ready for some flesh.  The tacos were very good. I liked how their al pastor was crispier than some.  Maybe a personal preference, but they were good.

Key note for me - they offer a variety of margaritas.  I prefer the upcharged one where they mix it themselve, not the premix bottled one. (they sell both)  for me it is less sweet and has a cleaner appeal.  

I am planning on going back again next week when more family come to visit.

Last note:  The neighborhood is not the greatest.  I come from a tougher city so it was no big deal to me, but some others might appreciate being warned.
