Don't really eat Mexican food out much.  Usually prefer the homemade stuff.  In Vegas though I don't get much of that either so I decided to venture and try this place based on the great reviews.  We tried the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, mini-molletes, and a quesadilla arabe.  I got the chipotle sauce from the quesadilla on the side, just in case.  It wasn't too spicy but had delicious smoky flavor.  If you're a bit shy with spicy food, ask them to try the sauce before you order, they're happy to comply.  Great place, and I will most definitely be back!
