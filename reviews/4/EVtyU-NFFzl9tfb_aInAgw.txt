Camilo O does a great job of summing up Salazar Brothers, it just doesn't exemplify how much better the food is than F-B's.  The food here is unbelievably cheap, and is made very quickly.  More importantly it tastes great as well.  I usually go with the Chicken Tostada when I go here.  I used to always grab a taco or two to go along with it (also quite good), but after having leftovers every time I've found that unless I'm starving, the ridulously-cheap $2.15 tostada is totally sufficient.  Two bucks for a huge heaping pile of lettuce, salsa, chicken, and beans!

The environment is just like any other quick-stop Mexican shop, not quite as clean cut as Los Taquitos but not bad by any means.

If you're in the area it's probably the best spot around to grab a bite and run!
