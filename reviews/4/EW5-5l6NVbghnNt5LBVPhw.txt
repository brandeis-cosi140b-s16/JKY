This was our "splurge" dinner while on vacation over the holidays.  We picked The Mission after visiting the sister restaurant (House Brasserie) on the Scottsdale food tour earlier in the week.  The restaurant is beautiful, but the seating is a bit tight.  We enjoyed talking to the couple seated next to us, however, if you're looking for a more private dining experience this might not be the place for you. 

We started with the guacamole, prepared table side.  It was okay but the salsa was actually much better.  Dinner choices include typical meat/seafood entree dishes or tacos (3 small tacos).  My husband had the Malbec braised short ribs.  It was a very generous portion of meat served on a very minimal portion of a vegetable.  The menu indicated they were "crispy potatoes" but they looked and tasted more like a plantain. The tacos I ordered came as described - three small steak tacos.   As a side dish we had a ridiculously large order of mixed regular and sweet potato fries with two dipping sauces.  We ate less than 1/3 of them, in part because there were just too many and also because they were not as tasty as the rest of the food.  

I can't comment on the drinks, but the menu looked interesting.  The service was great.  Our waitress was very nice and helpful.  Our water and ice tea glasses were filled constantly.  Because of the proximity of tables I could not help but overhear the party next to us and their constant questions and demands of our server.  She handled them all politely and as patiently as she possibly could.  

Overall, I think this is a very solid choice and we would return to try some other dishes.  The service is outstanding
