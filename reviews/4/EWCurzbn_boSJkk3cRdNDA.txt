Probably the best red chile burro I've had here in the Valley.  

Every time I come here I either get the special with a red burro, rice and beans or I order a red burro enchilada style.  The chile is spicy, the sauce is thick and the beef is cubed and not shredded.  It's great.

La Fonda is an older joint.  If I was ever not with my full family of five people, I'd probably enjoy sitting in one of those smaller booths.  They're intimate while still crowded next to each other.

Occasionally the waitresses are hit or miss.  For the most part, they are courteous and speedy. 

I love the chips and salsa.
