Don't let the exterior fool you. This shop had amazing Philly Cheesesteaks! The owners and managers are top notch and truly care about their customers. We had an issue with a Grub Hub order and the manager was on top of it immediately with a lot of grace and class. She made a big effort to make it right, and I was very appreciative. 

The sandwiches were delicious, by the way. The cheese melted to perfection around tender meat, and a hearty roll that tasted fresh baked. The fries were nicely cooked and both my picky kids loved their hot dogs. 

Easily the best Phillys in the West Valley and their hot dogs are quite good as well!
