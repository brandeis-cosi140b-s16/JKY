Given the price, I really wasn't expecting much but was very pleasantly surprised by the service, food and drinks. The margaritas were really great and the food was excellent. Portion sizes are huge, I felt bad about leaving so much behind, especially given how much I enjoyed it. It's a great place to relax and have a fun meal with friends, I'd definitely come again.
