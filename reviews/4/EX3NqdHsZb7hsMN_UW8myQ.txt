Z'Tejas = awesome margaritas, delicious salsa and guacamole, ruby trout salad, and not to mention the often overlooked and missed bananas foster french toast of the weekend brunch. They also have many delicious other entrees, some of which I have sampled, but I must say I stick with the favorite standbys. Also a great place for a happy hour bite. Try the Millionaire margarita on the rocks!
