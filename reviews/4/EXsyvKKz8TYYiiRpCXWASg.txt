This review is for Pollo Mobile 2. At the intersection of Rainbow and Smoke Ranch
All I can say is "well done - bravo!" The chicken is grilled over chunk mesquite, and
These guys know what they're doing. The chicken is tasty and moist, the tortillas excellent, rice and beans,flavorful. An excellent choice if you're looking for a place
To swing by and grab some good food for dinner. I like these guys, they work hard
So you don't have to. Oh, they grill ribs too, but i've always been too late to get those. I'm calling it in the next time. 4 stars.
