Loved this cute, modern, minimalist cafe. Very reasonable prices and just a hop skip and a jump from Fremont street. It's a little quite on this side since it's so new not to many people know about it but the staff was very friendly even though we had our rowdy two year old with us. The manager was nice and friendly and even came to talk to us. The food was nice portions especially for the price. Definitely recommend for a quick nicely priced place to eat!
