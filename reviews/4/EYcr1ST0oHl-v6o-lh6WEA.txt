This is definitely the cleanest Roberto's I've been in. The food is good of course and they're pretty quick about completing your order. I'm born and raised in San Diego so of course I don't think this Mexican food is as good as places I've eaten at in SD, but this place is still satisfying enough to keep me coming back. I would definitely recommend this Roberto's location.
