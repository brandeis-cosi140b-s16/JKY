Wow.....there are some seriously less than glowing reviews here.  

I'll go against the crowd on this one....

I thought the decor was incredible.  This is coming from someone who has Mexican blood flowing through his veins and who knows Mexican culture, art, etc.   The place is like a museum.   Whoever designed this place should get mad, mad props.  It's beautiful.  From the crosses, the paintings, Dia de los Muertos (Oaxacan art) stuff....go see for yourself. 

We stopped for a quick bite here.  We ordered the vegetarian salad (served in a tostada) and nachos (w/o meat).  I thought the salad was actually fairly tasty.  It had a consortium of stuff (peppers, pinto beans, salad, etc)........I dunno, maybe I was really hungry.  

The nachos--were not as good --but not all that bad.......

The service was standard.  I can see how some yelpers might construe it as horrible -- those beautiful waitresses do look like they have a bit of a tude.......

Anyways, go here for a drink to admire the decor.   It's awesome.
