First, the "medium" margaritas are HUGE! And delicious!! Next, they have lunch specials  from 10 to 3 everyday; $6.99 for a wide variety of plates. Then there's happy hour from 2 to 5 where you can get their "medium" margaritas for $7.99; you'd be doing good if you can put back two. Last, the food. It was amazing!! I got crispy chile rellenos and they made me moan with pleasure; I like that in a food. Will return to El Mezcal.
