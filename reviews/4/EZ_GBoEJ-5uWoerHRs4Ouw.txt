I love creative, authentic Mexican food. I don't like many Mexican restaurants. But this one is a good one I think! 

First trip here, but  I like the ambience, and the New Mexico Green Chili Stew was very good.  Got the smaller portion, and made two great meals out of it. A tad on the spicy side, but just within my spice level limitations.  (I would have preferred a tad less spice-truth be known). 

The chips and salsa were great...that's important!
Service was great too. Friendly and attentive.

The menu looked creative and delicious, and I will return again!
