Love the queso here! The Stack is awesome but it's huge. They take two round crunchy shells fill it with what you want and than put a soft burrito shell around it! The burritos are great as well but be careful they can get large. I also like that they have white or wheat shells for everything! They have great ingredients to choose from that are fresh! They also have some bottles if beer as well.
