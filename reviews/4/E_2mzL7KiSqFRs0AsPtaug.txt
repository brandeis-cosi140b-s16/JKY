This is a great place to get a filling and tasty meal. The place is full of junky or as people like to say these days "distressed" decorations... gives the place a laid back charm, I suppose. 

I have been here twice, and both occasions were after doing some hardcore housework. It was so great to have a big yummy lunch after all the hard work I did. The combo plates are super -  good portions and everything is served hot and fresh! I love the grilled whitefish! It is so tender and well seasoned!

They also have a well stocked bar and great drink and beer specials. 

Too bad I won't ever be able to go here again... I live in LA and I probably won't ever end up in Phoenix again. Oh well.
