After reading other reviews from other restaurants  nearby, we chose El Valle Mexican. I'm glad we did, I typically order the same thing at every Mexican restaurant, this place didn't have it on the menu, but I told the waiter and he made it the way I order everywhere else. My husband ordered the ACP, with chicken an cheese and rice. The wait staff was very nice, and helpful. Prices aren't crazy high, they are average. Sweet tea is good(southern style), as well as the chips and salsa( which wasn't very hot). However, it is chilly in the restaurant, if you get cold easy, bring a sweater.

Otherwise, I recommend this restaurant for your Mexican food fix.
