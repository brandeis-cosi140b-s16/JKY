I have always checked reviews on a place prior to going there, so when I looked up the google reviews on this place I was a little shocked at the negativity, so I'm gonna do this T-Bell justice! First I will start off by saying the Customer Service here is nothing less then phenomenal! Anybody who says otherwise might want to reevaluate themselves because they are probably the ones who are A**holes. The employees and management here have my respect! I've never had food here that was upsetting to me which is saying something since usually taco bell has me on the porcelain begging for mercy. Inside was a little dirty but maybe I just came at a bad time because usually its pretty clean. Thank You Taco Bell!
