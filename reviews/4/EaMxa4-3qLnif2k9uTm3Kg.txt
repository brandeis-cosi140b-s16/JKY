Went for lunch during work with some of my ladies, after we had seen they won Best Tacos in the Best of Las Vegas competition. We see why! Ordered about 1/2 of the tacos on the menu and each was delish. My favorite was the pork belly taco. My coworker got the Cali Burrito which they are pretty well known for and LOVED it. Ran in to a colleague while we were there (he's a regular) and he highly recommended the Tostada. So next time, that's what we're going to try. Also ordered the guac and chips. VERY good. Fresh, and the chips were great all by themselves. Seemed to be baked? Not sure. Also, even the sides of beans and rice were noticeably different-full of flavor. Only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star for me was the lack of staff/wait time. If you are on a time crunch, go somewhere else. The cook was VERY friendly. I would recommend, and I will be returning. :)
