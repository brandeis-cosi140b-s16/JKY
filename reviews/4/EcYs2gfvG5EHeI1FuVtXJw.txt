We just got home from our 2nd visit to Pure Taqueria in Matthews, NC. So nice to have a good Tex Mex restaurant close to home. Mexican food is one of my favorites and we normally get our best tex-mex food when we visit family in Houston, San Antonio and Austin. This comes closest to what we can get in TX. 

The chips are thin and just the right amount of salt with a fresh tasting, simple salsa. Just the right amount of spice. 

I started off with a very good margarita - the Skinny Margarita - just simple tequila with lime juice - an entire lime! and some Agave nectar; so not too sour - it was very good! 

The server was great, very friendly, helpful and quick! Once we ordered, the food came very quick, which was a nice touch. During our dinner, he checked back several times as well as another staff member stopped to be sure we were satisfied. 

Fish tacos are one of my favorite so ordered the grilled mahi mahi which came with some sliced fresh avocado, charred salsa, corn tortillas, tomatillo sauce, rice and charros beans. It came with plenty of fish;  enough to make 3 good size tacos. I ate 2 at the restaurant and brought the leftovers home for lunch tomorrow. 

My husband ordered the Pork Tacos (al Pastor) which were also excellent; a nice amount of spice countered by the fresh pineapple; he also had plenty - 3 good size tacos. Ate 2 and one brought home to enjoy tomorrow. 

Charros beans are not offered everywhere at Mexican restaurants but are always a staple on the menus we see in TX. And so a pleasant surprise to have the option at Pure. They were quite tasty with some bacon (I think) and a nice tasting sauce with the beans. 

All in all, it was a great meal; felt like it was a fairly healthy meal. Not sure about the other reviews; maybe they are used to the tex mex that we generally get here in NC. This is a more authentic, fresh and wholesome type of meal that it's refreshing to get here in NC.
