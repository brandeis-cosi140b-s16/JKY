I dont know how willing i am to come back to this establishment and pay for it next time.  I was taken to a late lunch and we ordered two different appetizers 1 was amazing the other not so much. I expected so much more out of the queso dip that tasted like straight SALT they were really trying to make me sick.  The potato soup with spicy  bacon cheese sour cream and green onions was out of this world! that is why this place gets 4 stars merely for that and their grilled chicken chimi! I was kind of hoping for a side of guac and not sliced avocado pico mix type ordeal.  
Queso dip- D-
Potato spicy bacon soup- A++
Chimichanga with grilled chicken-B
The place itself was pretty dead maybe 3 tables of people full not including ours so a total of about 4-5 tops.  Now that said, A waitress should have all the time in the world to wait on all tables with flying colors making sure everyones drinks are full and what not.  It was not til the end of our dishes and appetizers that she asked if I wanted a refill and i desperately wanted one when i was eating my food and after eating a couple bites of the queso dip I thought i would love but hated.

The guy I am a caregiver for liked her more than I did but you know how lots of older single men are...

I hope to god that this place doesn't get packed because could you imagine a waitress serving more tables than that and having very agitated men and women over drinks she was lucky i am patient.
