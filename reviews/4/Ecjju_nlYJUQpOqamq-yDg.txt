This Mexican food restaurant is one of the best Mexican food restaurants in the Valley of the Sun it's been open for over 50 years serving delicious food freshly made daily and they stay true to the roots!! I highly recommend taking your family and friends for a good old fashioned Mexican dinner or lunch the chips and salsa are fresh brought hot to your table!! Treat yourself or a loved one I've been going there for years and I don't plan on stopping!!
