For you Seinfeld fans "it's not fast food Jerry, it's good food quickly".  Rubios has some really good things going for it. First off I love the salsa verde shrimp tacos. I get the plate which comes with 2 tacos and chips and bean dip or you can sub rice or black beans. The also offer mahi, salmon and tilapia....many seafood options which is nice. 

The shrimp tacos are served on a flour tortilla with sliced avocado and a creamy chipotle sauce, absolutely delicious.  Rubios also has a great salsa bar with several different salsas, peppers and fresh lemon and lime slices. For under $9 it is a budget friendly lunch or dinner option. 

The service has always been friendly and quick.
