This is my favorite taco shop.  It has all the same menu items you'd expect at the prices you'd expect.  There are a million taco stands in the Phoenix area, but this one stands out to me.  
Why you ask?
#1 -  Their carne asada is the best I've ever had.  I'm a Phoenix native, therefore I've had A LOT of carne asada from taco stands in my life.  Hands down... the best!
#2 - I've never gotten sick from this place.  I can list off numerous taco shops where I have.
#3 - Kinda goes along with #2, the ingredients all seem to be fresh.  If you get sour cream, it's not curdly.  The bacon in the breakfast burritos are crispy, not chewy.  The tortillas taste like they make them there.
#4 - You can call ahead and order to pick up.
#5 - They have pollo asada dishes.
Their food reminds me of meals I've had in Rocky Point.  Very delicious and affordable.
