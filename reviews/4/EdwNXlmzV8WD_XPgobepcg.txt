I was waiting to review this place until I'd broken into the giant bag of tamales we brought home and put in our freezer, and I'm glad I did, because now I can tell you to run, don't walk, to El Bolillo and get yourself some authentic and delicious mexican food.

We visited El Bolillo for a late lunch on a Sunday, and were the only people in the place when we got there. We gazed at the menu for a bit, but both ended up ordering chicken enchiladas, since my companion had had them before and raved about them.

 Before the enchiladas came, the owner came out and asked us if we wanted to try a new sandwich he's been working on. Well, we both love free food and experiments, so of course we said yes. What we got we a fresh sesame bun stuffed with carnitas, cilantro, and green salsa, and boy was it delicious. We sort of wanted to forgo our enchiladas and just eat another one of those! Anyway, we got to have a really nice conversation with the owner, who seems to be a super friendly and enterprising guy, since his goal is apparently to have everyone in Madison eating these new sandwiches. I'm with him, and will be rushing back for another. 

The enchiladas were very tasty. It was a massive plate, piled high with enchiladas, lettuce, avocado, and queso fresco. I'd recommend them, but it'll be hard for me to order anything but the carnitas sandwich when I go back. 

We took home a dozen tamales for the freezer, since they're pretty much the best possible quick lunch, and they were some insanely cheap price like $5 for a dozen. Tamales are not easy to make right. All too often the masa turns out tough and rubbery or too soft, or just not flavorful. El Bolillo's masa was awesome. It was tender, but substantial and had a lot of good corny flavor. I thought the proportion of filling to masa was about right, but I wasn't totally crazy about the flavor of the filling (we had the chile-stuffed ones). I think next time I would choose a different flavor that was more to my taste.
