Wow... The food here is delicious! The decor is not the best and the styrofoam plates and cups and plastic forks and seat your self is Linda Twilight Zoney... But once you get passed that this place is a gold mine! The tamales are SO good! The chicken tacos are all white meat and I love the rice.... And I usually don't eat the rice!! We both love it here as so does my mother now that we took her! The only thing that keeps me from a 5 star rating is that I like to be waited on and real plates and glasses and forks made of metal!
