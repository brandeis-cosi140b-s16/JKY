The Mayan Cochinita Pibil tacos are AMAZING. These tacos have really impressed me. The horchata is also a great treat. They add strawberry, melon and nuts. I'm not vegetarian but i try not to eat so much meat and their veggie tacos are sooo good. Cheese, peppers, onions and mushrooms. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. I took away 1 star because sometimes the service is very slow, although i will say the last time i went they seemed to be working on it.
