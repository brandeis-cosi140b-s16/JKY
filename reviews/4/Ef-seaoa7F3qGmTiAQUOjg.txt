Roberto's was definitely a winner in my book. I'm from San Diego where I grew up on Mexican food. 

The facilities inside were very clean and that's always a plus.

I ordered the carne asada fries and 5 rolled tacos. I would recommend both and come back to order both.

I'm a fan and would come back when I need my authentic Mexican food fix.
