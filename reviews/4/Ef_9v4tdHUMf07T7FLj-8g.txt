I forget about this place but when I end up there I always enjoy it and have a great meal. Went there with a friend last week. Service was good and refills flowed. They also regressed the salsas which is always appreciated. Had the combo with tamale and enchilada. Tasty for sure. Took some take home for the rest of the family and the server also made sure we packed up the leftovers. I will remember that I want to return. Nice family place.
