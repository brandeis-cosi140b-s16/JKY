Definitely a fan.  I've had their carne asada burrito and the pollo asada burrito.  Excellent.  They have 2 different salsa for spicy and extra spicy.  Each burrito is equal to a meal.  Delicious and cheap.  A hole in the wall type place, but the ingredients are fresh.  They are quick on service too.  They have a wide selection of other entrees and soft drinks.  No alcohol.
