When I want a Michelada this is the place I come to!! There are times I just crave it especially from here. I love the salsa also, I usually order one to go and take home to snack on (get my salsa fix). I get 3 enchiladas with green sauce. I love the their green sauce, rice, beans, pretty much everything. The service however can be hit or miss. Sometimes they're very attentive and other times not so much. One time I got my food and had to remind them we ordered beers. But I can look past that for my good Mexican food and Michelada.
