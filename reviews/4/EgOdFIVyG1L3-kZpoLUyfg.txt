Solid food and very good breakfast burritos.  The sausage and egg with Green sauce does it for me every Sunday.  Quality is always the same and the place seems clean and is very well run.  Everything is made to order and I have never had bad food there.

This place is best for take out or a quick meal but do not expect any atmosphere.  It is more cafeteria style feel for a quick in and out.  

The drinks/juice they have there is not to my liking.  They are overly sweet for my taste and even my kids.  That is about the only thing I would stay away from.

Go for the food and you will be happy!
