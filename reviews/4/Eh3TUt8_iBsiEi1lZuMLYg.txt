After some Hobby Lobby shopping with my dtr., sis, and mom, we headed to this place. First of all I was shocked there was this type of restaurant in AJ. Friendly greeting right away is always a plus. Chips and salsa came right away and were yummy.My daughter asked for hot sauce and it wasn't very good, so we stuck to the salsa. Our waitress came, took our drink orders and left us to peruse the menu which had a very nice selection of food. Our drinks came, dtr. and sis had a beer, mom had a margarita on the rocks with ice, and I ordered a frozen strawberry margarita. Egads, I should have stayed with my usual" on the rocks" as my margarita was the only bad thing of my experience here. It got a 1 out of 10 limes. I was encouraged to send it back but decided just to drink it...should have sent it back. It tasted like the bartender used a really bad margarita mix, and the strawberry did not seem fresh at all. Yuck Yuck.
On to the food-with all the choices I still stuck with my favorite item to order, a chile relleno plate. It was very good. It arrived hot and cheesy. Sometimes at mexican restaurants the food arrives semi-hot and the cheese has already started to "harden". My dtr. had a bean chimichanga and said it was good. My mom had cheese enchiladas and said they were ok.  My sis had a chimichanga and beer...she said the chimi was good but the beer was kind of warm. The restaurant is cute, and our waitress was very nice. If my margarita had been good I could have given 5 stars easy.
