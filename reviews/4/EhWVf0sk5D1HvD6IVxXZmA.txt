The bartender was tasked with the bar, mixing drinks and the patio area.  There were bored servers that didn't volunteer to help out.  The patio was packed.  He did a great job though.  He even stepped up and supervised some of the bored wait staff to lend a hand.  Restaurant was not busy.  Hostess was doing her due diligence as well, helping out.

The salsa wasn't to my palette, but the mixed drink was good.  The food was different, but the service was courteous.  

There was some trash on the outside near the entrance.  

Minus a star for having servers/waitresses complain in front of customers.
