Zabas has a great menu. Think of the freshness of Baja Fresh combined with the made to order style of Chipotle and you have Zabas. The burritos, bowls, and quesadillas are made to order right in front of you and have a authentic Mexican taste. The salsa is fresh and tasty. My only complaint is I wish they had an open salsa bar, instead I have to beg for extra salsa which they keep guarded behind the counter.

Overall this place is great and everyone is pretty friendly. This is a favorite spot for lunch in our office.
