This is one of those places friends have recommended for years.  I go to the gym on this corner, I eat breakfast next door, but I am just not in that area of town when I go out to lunch or dinner.  Recently I met up for lunch with a friend who works out of his house just up the street.  Thursday lunch was packed shortly after opening.  The whole time we were there there was no more than 2 or 3 open tables.  Service was attentive.  Chips and salsa came out quick, as did the food order.  I preferred the hotter of the two salsas.  I had a chicken taco and cheese enchilada with rice and beans. It was one of their lunch specials and pretty reasonably priced.  There were some more exciting things on the menu but what I had was well executed.  It may not be a full 4 but it is worthy of more than a 3-1/2 rounded down.  I would definitely go back.
