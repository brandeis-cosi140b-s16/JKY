My favorite Garcia's used to be the one on 35th Ave and Peoria I believe on the West side but we recently moved to East mesa and found that there was one just about a mile from us on the corner of University and Gilbert Rd. We have eaten there on at least six occasions and have found it to be very reasonably priced and really pretty decent Mexican food. The service is quick, the food is good, and the atmosphere is inviting...and I love that they serve bean dip with the chips as well as the salsa. I will visit this restaurant many times! The chimichangas are awesome! I see some of the reviews are not as good as I think they should be. I say this because I have been there many times and have not had a bad meal yet...this restaurant is very consistent and good Mexican food in my opinion!
