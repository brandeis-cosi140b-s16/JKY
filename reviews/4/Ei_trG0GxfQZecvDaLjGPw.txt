We decided to have this for dinner on a whim last night - and called to place a To-Go order about 30 minutes before they were closing.  We felt a little bad, but hey we were hungry and we didn't want fast food.  There were 3 of us, so we all ordered the same thing - Pollo Fundido.  It came with a side of beans and rice and some shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes.  We also got a bag of tortilla chips and salsa (spicy and mild).  The guy who answered the phone didn't seem too thrilled to be taking an order before closing.  But when we went there to pick up the food they were actually friendly and gave us extra salsa for our chips without even asking.  That was cool.  We were able to place our order and pick up our food even before the restaurant closed.  The pollo fundido's were absolutely delicious and hit the spot!!  We were mmm'ing and awwww'ing almost every bite.  I would definitely order this dish again and again.  They served a lot of Mexican rice, which I wasn't too excited about, but I'm not a big fan of Mexican rice anyway...but the refried beans were great.  I'm officially a fan of this place!
