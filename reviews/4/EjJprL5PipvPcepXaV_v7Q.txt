I went for the first time today. The building was small, but bright and fairly clean. The staff was knowledgable and friendly. I ordered the steak burrito Mexicano and it was good. 

All the food came out hot and tasted good. Their red rice was a bit mushy and salsa was a tiny bit hot for my taste, but overall I had a good experience. The best part was their lunch specials.

 I got my burrito (which was large), rice and beans, and a soda cup (with one bowl of chips and salsa) for $5.50. There is also a 50 cent credit card charge-if this bothers you, bring cash! So after tax my total was $6.50. I still consider it a great value!

I enjoyed my food, that doesn't mean everyone will. I would recommend this place because it was a good value. Solid 4/5.
