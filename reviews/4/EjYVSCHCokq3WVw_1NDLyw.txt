A solid 4 stars.  See my tip also posted below.

Chicken chimi, enchilada style - 4 1/2 stars...full of chicken, crispy, tasty.  Oh, and be warned, it is BIG!  I had to ask for the shredded lettuce though.

Beans - the refried beans were pretty good.  A bit salty though.

Rice - see beans comment.

I really liked the chimi.  Best I've had since I lived in Tucson.  I'll be back to try other items.
