The place is beautifully decorated and the food was AMAZING. I would totally go back for more of their delicious nachos. Loved the fresh salsa and the presentation was gorgeous. Will definitely leave room to try dessert next time. 

The server, Daniel? was wonderful! He did a great job.

I would love to give them 5 stars but there are some kinks they have to work out - what new business doesn't? 

They would hands down have 5 or more stars if they had:

* A sign - people need to know if they are in the right place.
* Clear hours online and on the door and adhere to them. Every minute counts when it is insanely hot and people are on very limited lunch breaks.
* Open/closed sign. 
* Cross-trained staff so even if the server is not there yet people can be served.
* Decreased wait time between being seated and receiving water/menus.
* A bell or something at the door so they hear customers coming.
