I was invited in by a regular of Nacho Mamas. I was surprised that once you pass through the doors of the VERY PLAIN building, it was a great little sports bar. There were more then 5 tv's, two NEW pool tables (with talks of darts and shuffle board on the way). Plenty of beer and cocktails to choose from and the menu had good choices. 
I ordered a carne Assad burrito, being from California, I think I'm a pro at picking out a good one. It was great, the meat was tasty (good seasoning) and the rice and beans inside were just the way I liked it. 
In my opinion you should check this place out. Good drink choices, good food, fun bartenders and great place to hang out.
