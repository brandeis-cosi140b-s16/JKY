Great Food and Atmosphere!!
Located in a very eclected neighborhood with lots of interest.

We only had a 20 minute wait on a mid day Saturday afternoon for a table for four in what appeared to a crowded fan favored restaurant. My nephew who lives in Charlotte had been there once before. He thought it was a good place to try as one of my Food Network featured Charlotte restaurant locations.

Cabo Fish Taco didn't disappoint! The server was very pleasant and steered us in the right food direction with our food choices. We had the Crab & Shrimp Dip, BBQ Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos, Lemon Grilled Shrimp Tacos, Chicken Quesadillas and Southside Chicken Wrap Burrito. We ordered the "Bannas Foster Cheescake (just okay) and Peanut Butter Chocolate Mousse Cake" (a better choice) desserts to go, but ended up eating them there!

We all were pleased with our selections, especially the warm "Crab & Shrimp Dip" appeitizer (featured on the FN episode) freshly made pita toast points. The "BBQ Mahi Mahi" Fish Tacos (also featured on the FN episode) was our favorite entree of them all. The free salas (Chopped Tomato, Corn and Cilantro) was a refreshing change compare to other table side Mexican salas.

If ever in Charlotte, NC again, I would make a track over to this place no doubt!!
