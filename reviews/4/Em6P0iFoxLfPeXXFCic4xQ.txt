This is my favorite Salsaritas location in South Charlotte because of its location and parking.  I find myself making regular stops for takeout on my way home from work, especially on Saturdays.  I think that Salsaritas beats similar competitors by leaps and bounds.  

The food is always fresh and colorful and flour tortillas are always steamy and soft, never dry and hard.  They have the best seasoned corn chips, the perfect companion to the best guac and pico de gallo. Portions are always generous without being too much.

Have fun custom blending Coca-Cola products from the new beverage dispensers that I have found in the stores!  I am partial to raspberry lemonade!
