Delicious sangria & soft tacos......service however left a lot to be desired!  I  have a serious pet peeve about going into a restaurant (especially one as sleek and contemporary  as this one) where all of the staff (hostess, busboy, servers, etc) all look like they are about 16.  This tells me some 25 year old guy is doing the hiring based on chicks he thinks are hot & not experience or professionalism!

Our server Ashley tried to be as pleasant as she knew how, but clearly should be working at Chili's or something & not here.  We got our drinks & my friend spilled a bit of her margarita on taking a sip.  Since we only had our cloth napkins (no coasters or drink napkins were given to us) we asked Ashley for help with the spill.  She came back with a few paper napkins, set them down on the table & walked away.  Did not offer to help clean the spill or anything...just bailed.  She then proceeded to get our order wrong when it was brought out (had to be re-made) & then tried to butter us up hard at the end saying"  I'm so glad we got that problem fixed for you in a matter of time"  What???  My advice to Barrio...upgrade the quality of your servers & I will definitely be back for more of your delicious food.
