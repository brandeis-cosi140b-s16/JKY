Wow. What a major difference from when I visited three months ago.

We were seated, with practically no wait. The hostess was kind enough to put us in tables more towards the back of the restaurant, so we could have room for our daughter's stroller. 

We of course got the chips and salsa. Mango margarita, prickly pear margarita and a beer. Our friend with the mango margarita has a fresh slice of mango in his, which he devoured along with the drink. My prickly pear was almost too perfectly delicious.

Our waitress was so kind. Complete 180 of most of the servers that we have had when eating here. She went through the specials, with great description, and was patient and kind enough to re-explain things when we couldn't hear or didn't understand. 

My guy ordered the enchilada special, that came with one chicken and one beef enchilada. Our friend and I both ordered the mahi mahi tacos. We asked for more green and red salsa, because they kind of skimp when they fill up their little black bowls. The pico was a little lack luster, but our 18 month old gladly ate the tomatoes and snacked on the chips....The man that dropped off our food quickly returned with generous amounts of the green and red salsa..

Our food came out, and to tell you the truth, we were all kind of shocked....in a good way.

Usually, when I have ordered their fish tacos, the fish has came out already sectioned out in individual tacos...and the flavor of the fish has been lack luster. 

This time, a grilled filet of fish comes out, with about 4 or 5 tortillas to section and make your own. We were blown away how wonderful everything tasted. Everything, was just perfect....even the black beans and rice. All three of us were clean platers. 

We ordered another round of drinks...which did take a while to come out. 

After asking for the check, that did take a while too.... Like at least 15 minutes for her to come back with out change.
