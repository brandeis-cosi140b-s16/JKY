Who doesn't like a Torta once in awhile? The inside at this location has a giant eating area for families and then some and is decorated with lots of fun colors. There are several TV's that you can stare at while zoning out to your special occasion. Interestingly festive music envelopes the room. I think I even saw a small stage with speakers. Hmmm?

Giant menu with lots of different items and pictures to choose from if you are not in the mood for a Torta. I'm hungry already!

Free salsa and chips arrive at the table instantly and are very tasty. I did the Man vs Food last time and it took me over the edge. This time ordered the Nortena de Res which is steak with onions & jalapenos with chipotle sauce, melted cheese, refried beans, tomato, avocado, & chipotle dressing. I always enjoy the fresh radishes and cucumbers served as a garnishment.

Service was quick and friendly. I liked the way the inside was so clean. Even saw someone doing some touch ups on the front window which is always good. Just need a pinata to whack full of candy as you leave for giggles. They are so much fun. Enjoy!
