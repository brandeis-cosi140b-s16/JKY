Authentic is the one word I would use to describe Faustos. With it being so close to my school, I stop by from time to time. I absolutely love the food here. True Mexican food and it comes at such an amazing price. I, most often, purchase a breakfast burrito that is only $3.95. I love this place and the food is extremely tasty. I would highly recommend Faustos if you want real Mexican food for such a spectacular price.
