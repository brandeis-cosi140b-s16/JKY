Their hours are not the same as what's listed. 11am -9pm. But the service was excellent. In addition to chips and salsa, we received complementary soup and the flavoured water tasters. Try the horchata. The portions for our meal were huge. The chimichanga feeds two at least. Chicken mole was very flavorful as well. I wish there was more flavor in the salsa and the beans and rice. Maybe some sauce on top the chimichanga.
