Been craving Mexican food and this place popped up on Yelp.  So, I found it tucked away in a strip mall.  It's a small location, but nice motif and clean.  The waitress/owner was very friendly.  I was served chips with beans & cotija cheese on top.  The salsa was a plastic bottle; but WOW, their basic salsa was nice and spicy and full of flavor.  I could have been fine with that; however, I had to try their more spicy version, which was nice and hot and equally full of flavor.  I decided to try their 3 enchilada combo (I opted for chicken, beef & cheese) that came with rice and beans.  I'm very picky when it comes to refried beans, and the were perfect and well seasoned.  I will definitely return.
