Muy Aut√©ntico!

Big menu, with TONS of stuff in many categories - tacos, combination plates, quesadillas, tortas, etc.

I had a "corn smut" quesadilla, and the barbacoa taco.  It was the first time I had ever tried corn smut, and I did enjoy it.  Very tasty.

The barbacoa was good, but did not have a lot of seasoning....it was on the line between "too dry and barely not too dry."  Would not order it again, and that's the only reason this little place is not a 5-star from me.

They brought a tub of cilantro, one of onions, and one of limes with my food for doctoring - nice touch you don't get from most places....

They have a little jalapeno cream salsa served with the chips and a red salsa.  When I asked the server what was in the cream sauce, she said they would not tell her - "Grandma's secret recipe."  It was DELICIOUS.  I had two tubs of it and wanted to strap a pump directly into my mouth and have it 24x7.  Great stuff.

I was the only white boy in the place, and it was packed.  Locals must love it.  I'm definitely going back.
