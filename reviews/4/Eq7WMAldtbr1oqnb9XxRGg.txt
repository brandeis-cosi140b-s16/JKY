Authentic Mexican & the best chimichanga in the West Valley!  Always fresh, and everything we've ever tried has been GREAT and very well priced. Dining area is reminiscent of Subway-style with some Mexican artwork flair, but if you're into great food with a casual atmosphere (or call ahead/take out), definitely a hidden gem worth checking out!
