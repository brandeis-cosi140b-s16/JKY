The Big Burrito is definitely filling and all the ingredients are super fresh. You get a wide variety of salsas to coat your food with, including a jalape√±o and chipotle ranch. The al pastor tacos on Taco Tuesday are something few should ever pass up, especially when they're 2-for-1.

Even at a pretty busy lunchtime the food came out quick and piping hot.  Definitely a place to visit most days, especially every Tuesday.
