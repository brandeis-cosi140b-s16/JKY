My boyfriend keeps bugging me to right and updated review because we really do love Pasquals and come here or order carry out about once a week....

Delicious things that we always order:
-Margs (I think their house margs are still 1/2 price on Mon/Tuesday but we usually come on a different night and there's always a monthly special that is less expensive)
-Chips and Pico
-Flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel (although we do miss their scotcheroos)

The only complaint is that they now have a steep up-charge (like $5) for steak, and it had been free in the past. Everything else is great. Service has improved too.
