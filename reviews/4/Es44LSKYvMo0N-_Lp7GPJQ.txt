Surprised I had forgotten to write a review before now. Las Pupusas has become a favorite lunch spot. Can't beat $1.75 Pupusas and tacos. I prefer those delicous pancake like treats filled with queso. Made even better with fresh slaw and tomato sauce. Calling in orders often means mystery items, rarely is the order accurate, but nothing has ever been bad. Dining in has avoided any problems.
