Like every other Chipotle I've been to, the food was good. The service here was pretty good, all server's had smiles on their faces, but the location, the location. I almost missed it. The parking isn't very good as its shared with numerous other "mall like" eateries and shops, and the signage seems poor as well. 

I wanted so bad to give this Chipotle 5 stars for the great service but I just couldn't overlook the poor location. Eat here if you can find it (and parking).
