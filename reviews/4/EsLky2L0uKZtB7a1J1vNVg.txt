Sorry Roberto's but there is a new taco shop in my life.  Dimas is close to home for me.  I have been in a couple of times now and it is never as busy as Roberto's.  I think it is because people don't really know where it is.  I drove right by the first time I stopped in.  I had to make a u-turn and come back around.  Service has been good each of the times I have eaten here.  And the food has always come up quick.  I have been getting my same order each time.  Two chicken tacos and one order of three rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese.  It is the same order I get when I go to Roberto's.  In fact, this place has a menu that looks very much like Roberto's.  It is like they are sister restaurants.  The pictures, the prices, the style of food.  It is all the same.  But there is always one prettier sister.  That is Dimas for one specific reason in my book.  They offer the chicken tacos at $0.99 all day every day.  Roberto's only has that special on Wednesday.  Now that I have Dimas to go to I can get my taco fix any time.
