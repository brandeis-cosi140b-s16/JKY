I'm reviewing the late night club/party scene (didn't try any food yet). Came here with friends after the ASU football game and after already getting our drink on at Cue. The line is definitely long for most parts of the night but it's still worth it. DJ plays the best hits and the dancing was off the chain. My only gripe is that they close at 2 while Moonshine's open another hour. Stay open to compete for business and keep the party going!

The only people I don't recommend this place to are those that are easily claustrophobic.
