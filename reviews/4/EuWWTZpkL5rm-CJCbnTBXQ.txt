In a city that's awash in over-priced "authentic" sit-down Mexican restaurants, Tacos Jalisco is a welcome respite. This is some legit-ass taqueria food that I'll take any day over the fancier, less delicious variety. In particular, as others have mentioned, the al pastor is fantastic. The care asada and carnitas were bland by comparison. 

I had three tacos when I came to try a sample of the different meats.. I'll definitely be trying their highly praised breakfast burrito next time I'm here.
