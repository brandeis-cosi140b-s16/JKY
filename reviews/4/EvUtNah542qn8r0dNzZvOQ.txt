Above par food and drink for a Vegas Mexican restaurant. We always visit this place when traveling to Las Vegas, in fact we stay at Venetian so we can go even more. This place has a great stone bar wrapping around into the restaurant area where you can sit next to the Venetian canals and shops. Food is excellent quality and prepared fresh and it shows in the taste. The drinks are amazing, I never knew you could have a margarita so many ways. Highly recommend this to someone looking to get their margarita or Mexican food fix while in Las Vegas.
