Ok... So it's in a strip mall and it resembles a hospital cafeteria...the food however does not reflect the surroundings! It's delicious! Seriously! The biggest burrito in the U.S. and one of the most delicious. The ingredients are fresh and authentically prepared. This isn't your Americanized version, this is the authentic Mexican version. Go here... Eat mas!
