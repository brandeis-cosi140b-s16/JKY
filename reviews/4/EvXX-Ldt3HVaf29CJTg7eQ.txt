Well I decided to check out this new place that just opened.  I pulled up and from outside it doesn't look like much and even though the open sign was on I wasn't sure if anyone was in there. I went in around 345 and was told there were only a couple kinds left so I got the spicy pork and spicy chicken tamales. I have to say they are VERY good, I definitely love the chicken ones better but they are both worth it. I really have to say the are stuffed with filling and WORTH the money. I will definitely go back when I'm  craving some tamales.
