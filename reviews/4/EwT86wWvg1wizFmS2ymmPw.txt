VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY!

Finally a burrito place in Charlotte that makes tofu burritos. Their staff is super friendly, they make the burrito as you like it and then have salsa that is great. The staff even gave me some special hot sauce that blew my mindhole. 

Highly recommend this place! And its right across from the common market!
