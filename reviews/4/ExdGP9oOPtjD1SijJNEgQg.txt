Zaba's is awesome... I love there huge burritos and those fish tacos, yummy !!! My children loves there quesadillas and black bean burritos.... They can be a little pricey though so we go on Sundays where the kiddos eat free... Oh yeah!!! (: Also, Gary Waddell from news 8 I think lol is a fan as well.. I've seen him eating here... Cool..
