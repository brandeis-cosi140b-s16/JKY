I don't really eat that much Mexican Food but wanted something different & new place to eat so we tried this place out & it's close by I lived!! I was a lil overwhelmed by the menu cause there's so much to choose from! But I was very satisfied w/ my order, surprisingly tasty & didn't expect to get that much food! Servers were great & very clean & nice place to eat! I also got a surprised bday song from the servers & enjoyed my dessert!
