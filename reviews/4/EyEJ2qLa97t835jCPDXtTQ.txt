This is a nice little place. I enjoyed my taco salad. The food is good, but what one would expect at this price point. The people that work there are what makes this a place I'll return to. Very friendly and attentive. They are chipper, and they smile and look happy. They make you feel happy and welcome. We sat on the "outside" patio. It was nice and fresh and open, but really noisy. So I recommend this area for the kids and boisterous friends. First dates and intimate conversations would be better inside.
