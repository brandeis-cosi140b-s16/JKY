I've been looking for a casual, but quality Mexican food restaurant to order takeout from that is as good as the Carambas I used to live by. And I think I found it!

The other night, we ordered dinner to go from here and I was pleasantly surprised.

The Mini Chimis with Jalapeno cream cheese were just what I was hoping for.

Can't wait to try more things here!
