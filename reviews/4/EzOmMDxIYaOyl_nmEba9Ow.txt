Here are the LUNCH things we loved: My TORTILLA SOUP was absolutely perfect. Best ever, with the perfect spice level, ingredients and presentation. My wife's chicken CHIMICHANGA was the best she has every had anywhere! The thin fresh TORTILLA chips with salsas (2) was mild enough that we didn't have to order an appetizer. Her CHIMICHANGA can with another fabulous salsa and we finished off the chips going from 1 salsa to the next. I talked my wife into trying some of my TORTILLA SOUP on her CHIMICHANGA just for a taste treat because it didn't need any salsa and she loved it. Yes I was able to try it too and I see why we had NO take homes containers.
Why not a 5? Well we wanted to try a SOPAPILLA and I can truthfully tell you "Don't even think about it!" Flat 4 cornered thing that was doughy, heavy and way under cooked. Next time (Yes we are going back) we will try the FRIED ICE CREAM, WARM APPLE FLAUTAS or CHOCOLATE MINI CHIMIS. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Garcia's are all over the southwest. Now we have a new place to stop on our adventure trips.
