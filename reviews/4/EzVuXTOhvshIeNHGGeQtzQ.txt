I love the Loco. I really do. We come here several times a month. It's so yummy. 

The chicken is always hot, and it's so tasty. I swear I could swim in the green salsa. It's sooooooo good.

The chicken is very flavorful and you always see it cooking on the back grill. It's not "cheap" fast food, but you get what you pay for. It's moderate in price, but I think it's well worth it. 

The churros (2 for 99 cents) are like sticks of heaven.

I'm loca for the Loco. :)
