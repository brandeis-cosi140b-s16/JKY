I had wanted to stop by after reading the reviews and finding out it is 2 minutes away from the hotel i am staying out.

The place is not fancy, but it looks clean and has a nice salsa/condiment bar.  The employees were super friendly and patient with me.  I had the torta ahogada and said yes to very spicy.  I sat down and she surprised me by bringing me some sauce to try and it was quite spicy but fine for me.  Then a lady dropped off a free fried taco like dish which was good and then brought my torta a few minutes later.  And then she came back and brought me some limes and pickled onions.  Anyway, the sandwich was good and i had fun.  Next time i'd try a regular torta.  And the tacos there are very good.
