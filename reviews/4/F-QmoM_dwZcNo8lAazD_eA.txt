My boyfriend took me here, on not the nicest part of town nor in the nicest building and I skeptically stared at the mariachi/wild-west panda statue that stood in the corner (if nothing else this statue is picture worthy). I then skeptically tried orange chicken in a quesidilla (the expected meal from the statue) and was socked by how much i actually like it! It was so much food too that my bf and I could split a meal and the workers are so kind- they gave us an extra cookie so we could each have our own! (:
