I came here last night after a late night of drinking and gambling. My boyfriend and I had a great time. We got the queso and chips appetizer, and it was quite good. It wasn't anything to write home about, but it was a decent starter. For our main courses, I had the braised beef with corn cakes and he had the chicken sandwich. Both of our meals were amazing. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because I question how much alcohol played a part in my enjoyment of out meal.
