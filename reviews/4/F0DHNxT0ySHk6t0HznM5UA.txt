This place is delicious and cheap!

We don't live in Tempe, so we don't get to come here often, but when we do it is a treat!

We always get the marylou (which is a quesadilla type appetizer) with a side of sour cream and share! It's plenty of food for a meal and it all comes out to less than $15!

Yea, the interior design isn't unique and the place isn't spotless...but it's been around for at least 10+ years! What can you expect from an old building?

I'm just sayin'... if you're looking for some good, cheap and authentic Mexican food, La Fonda is where it is at.
