I went there for an anniversary dinner, just my wife and I. It is a dark restaurant with tight seating. Very busy when we were there. Great service. Honestly some of the best guacamole I've ever had and I eat it a lot. Delicious desserts. Expect smaller portions though, it's part of the fancy vibe they have. I'm not going to be eating there often, but every time will be great.
