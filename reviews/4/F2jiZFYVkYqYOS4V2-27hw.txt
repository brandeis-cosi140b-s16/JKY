Guacamole tableside ... perfect!  Salsa bar ... loved the habenero salsa (if you like it hot, try it)!!  Had a drink and a couple appetizers (the quesadillas were great).  Will be back to try more items.  Pleasantly surprised by the good service, decent ambiance, good prices and great food ... and as you know, good mexican food in Vegas is hard to come by.
