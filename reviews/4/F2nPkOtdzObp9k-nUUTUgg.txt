Husband and I just moved to Fountain Hills from Chandler a couple of months ago...youngish professionals.

LOVE El Encanto!!! Here's the scoop:

1. The...no, I mean THE best bean dip we've ever had...and If you've been to Chandler then you know the high caliber of Mexican food in that area so we have high expectations
2. Rustic festive decor...raw wood ceilings, leather Mexican chairs, new patio, fun bar area
3. Friendly service
4. Great Sonoran style Mexican food..awesome shredded beef tacos, yummy queso, love the red chili enchiladas, asada great too...and 4 different types of salsas...fajitas are delicious
5. And their organic margaritas are so so good

For the reviewers who didn't like this place because of the pollo fundido, I judge them and not the restaurant...unless you really really love creamy dishes, I wounldnt order that..they have to have some items on the menu for the gringos :-)
