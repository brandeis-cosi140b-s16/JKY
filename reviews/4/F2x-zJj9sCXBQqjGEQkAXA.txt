I was driving on the way back from a My Brother's Keeper event and was hoping to stumble upon a locally owned place to grab some grub around 10:30am. I initially drove past this place, but I was intrigued by the signage on the outside and had to turn around half a mile later just because the exterior touted everything from spicy burritos to famous BBQ. 

This place is the definition of a hole-in-the-wall; it's not the fanciest establishment by any means, but it definitely has its charm. You walk in and you'll notice a picnic table to your right, bar-style seating on the close wall, and a handful of arcade games and pinball machines. I walked in and it immediately reminded me of some of my favorite BBQ places that I visited in Texas, and I was sold.

With it being so early, I ended up buying a breakfast burrito stuffed with egg, chorizo, cheese and potatoes. For the price, the burrito was HUGE! It was easily over a foot long and, while it wasn't very wide, it was tasty and very filling. I got it accompanied with a cup of lemon sweet tea and it all came out to five dollars and some change. I'm kicking myself for not trying something a little more sophisticated, but I will definitely try to swing by and try some of the BBQ if I ever wander into that side of Phoenix again.
