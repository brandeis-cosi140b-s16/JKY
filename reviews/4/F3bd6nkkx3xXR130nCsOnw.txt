I would give them a 5, but there's the one thing - I'll bring that up later.
First of all, they gave us WAY too much food for our dollar. Not complaining, but man, a lot of food. The carnitas were the best we've had in a very, very long time. The carnitas were crisp in places, spiced just right, with a perfect texture. Last time I had carnitas that good was about 8 years ago in Mexico. The tortilla was so hot and fresh. That, alone, would warrant 5 stars. The service was friendly and fast. And, they're open 24 hours. These guys are walking distance from my hotel. Perfect!
My one and only complaint is that the taco shell of my taco was overcooked and too hard. But, everything, everything else was perfecto!
