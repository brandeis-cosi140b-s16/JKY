I think Rubios deserves a shout out! Especially because I ate there three times in a row and ordered the same exact thing every time. What was so delicious that had me addicted three days in a row...the Gourmet Shrimp Tacos! They were so good and it was even topped with bacon. The tacos had a sweet smokey flavor to them. They were cheap but didn't taste like it!
