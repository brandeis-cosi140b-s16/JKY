A star has been added for OUTSTANDING customer service!!!  After writing my original review, I was contacted by "Stephanie" with FS Food Group (Big Daddy's Burger Bar, Mama Ricotta's, Plate Perfect Catering, Cantina 1511, and Paco's Tacos & Tequila).  She apologized for the error with  the $8 split plate fee and asked for a copy of our receipt to clear up the mistake.  To make a long story short, we were charged only $2 for the split plate but they did inadvertently charge us for the dinner portion vs. the lunch portion of fajitas.  Next thing you know, I open my mailbox and guess what's there???  A gift certificate with a handwritten thank you note appreciating my help!  I love a business that "gets" customer service!  Nice job FS Food Group.  I'm a fan.
