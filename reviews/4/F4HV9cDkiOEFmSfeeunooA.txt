I think I have a little girl on girl crush going with Yo Rita's, not sure if its the yummy Watermelon margarita, impossibly cute decor or the Chorizo tacos but I like what they have done with this place. 

This is not a Mexican restaurant really,  or late night bar full of tatted beauties to meet your after party beer goggle cravings. So don't get the wrong idea, its really a boutique bar that offers small plates and starters and fancy tequilas. They have other alcohol too, but if you're seeking that huge full plate of Mexican food.... nah it ain't here. 

Their tacos though are creative, and cheap at 5 a plate you can get two plates easily, I recommend the Ginger lime margarita and Watermelon Margarita. But they can just as easily make you any other stiff drink. 

One of my favorite happy hour spots, it goes so nicely with the Pale horse and that Shepard fairy mural :)
