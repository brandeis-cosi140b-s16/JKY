Fantastic hole in the wall, very clean!! Nothing fancy and you order and pick up at the front counter! The food is outstanding - Carne Asada was super flavorful and tender!! Prices are very reasonable!! Fantastic food and don't be put off by the lack of ambiance but a good sign that it's authentic is the TV is playing in Spanish!I if the salsa was a little bit better and there was no Styrofoam plates I might give it five stars!
