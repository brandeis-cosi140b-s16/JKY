I love authentic Mexican food. It is usually found in real dives. This place is hardly a "dive".  It is a clean family restaurant. The food is fabulous and among the very best I had had and I have had a lot of great Mexican food. Slow service cost one star but the locals deserve more attention than a touristy gringo. My only regret is this place is not in my home town. I will definitely be back any time I am in the area.
