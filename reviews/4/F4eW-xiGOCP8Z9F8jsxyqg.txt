**NOT A DRUNK REVIEW** LOL.

Yes, this place is next to a bar. I come to eat here first AND THEN get hammered. So I seriously remember what I've eaten here before. LOL.

I've ordered a bunch of food here before. Carne asada tacos, chicken nachos, carnitas burritos, burgers & fries, and chicken tenders. Yup, they're all good.

Service is excellent. If you tell the guy that you're at the bar, they will bring your food to you. 

Would come back here...hammered. LOL
