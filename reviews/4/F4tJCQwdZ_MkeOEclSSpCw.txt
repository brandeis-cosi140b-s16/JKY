Went here on a whim with regular Friday lunch crew.  It did not disappoint despite it being able to be missed with the blink of an eye.

Food was good portioned, priced EXTREMELY well and good.  

I opted for a chorizo, egg and bean burrito and a soda.  $7 for lunch and I was full.  Chips/salsa at our table as well (free).  The burrito was amazingly good.  Every bite filled with exactly what I ordered (instead of 'zones' in the burrito like other places I've been -- gee, I must have hit the bean area now).

Jim's burros was a great place for lunch and quaint.  Very small area for seating, but seemed to be mostly a take-out place.  I recommend eating there and enjoying the personality and chips/salsa.  

Definitely recommend for those in The QC and those not.  I will return.
