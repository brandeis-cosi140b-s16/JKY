Stopped here for a quick bite before the club. We ate at the bar and the bartender was nice and accommodating. 

Food was pretty good but portions were small. I got the lobster tacos and although the menu stated that it was 3 tacos,  the amount of lobster I received only fit 2 tacos. The lobster was definitely fresh and delicious though. 

I'd go back, but probably order something more like a Burrito,  where portion size would be standard.
