My teenage son and I met my mom there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  We sat at the bar outside and enjoyed the very casual, laid back sandbar area.  We ordered the Carne Asada tacos, the Veggie tacos and the Mexican Cob Salad.  

The great:
The Veggie Tacos were phenomenal!!  I'm not even a huge veggie taco fan but they were crazy good.  Perfectly grilled and seasoned portobello shrooms, grilled peppers and onions, fresh guac and some sprouts on top - but the kicker was the "tortilla".  At first we thought it was a rice paper tortilla but then figured it out that it was simply an ultra thin slice of jicama!  How freakin' cool is that??

The salsa!  It was the best.... after our own homemade salsa.  Tasted fresh, had a smooth kick at the end with a great roasted flavor to it.  and the chips that came with it were crisp and thick.

The good:
My salad!  Yummy mixed greens (real lettuce, not romaine or iceburg), roasted corn, jicama, tomatoes, paper thin shredded carrots, black beans....i had them hold the bacon.  But it was a great combo, good size and filling.

The OK:  The carne asado tacos were ok.  Nothing special.  There were 3 small flour tortillas with ok seasoned, ok cuts of steak.  If you wanted rice & beans it was an extra $3.  meh.

Overall - I would come back.  The food was an the upside of good and the ambiance is pretty cool.
