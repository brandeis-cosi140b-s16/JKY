SumoMaya's happy hour is a great way to sample some of their dishes and flavors. They have $3, $5 and $7 dollar food choices, including the tacos. Beer, wine and specialty cocktails are all discounted. And I love the fact that they have their happy hour on the weekends too! 
It's a really fun space, we sat at the bar, but would like to go back and sit on the patio when it isn't 115 degrees out. The staff were friendly and efficient.  
We had the:
- togarashi spiced popcorn, so good! slightly citrusy and also buttery, I could have eaten a giant bowl of it.
- salmon avocado roll, good, very nicely presented. A basic sushi roll, the salmon was good quality.
- crispy calamari, really good! tender squid, not greasy. Tossed in a sweet chili garlic sauce with sesame seeds. The also threw some cherry tomato halves and peas into the mix. 
- tacos - we tried 3, the sesame ginger chicken, Korean beef and pork al pastor. The pork was definitely the best, the fresh pineapple really went nicely with the pork. The chicken was our next favorite, but you could mainly taste the ginger slaw. The Korean beef was disappointing, we thought it would have the most flavor, but it had the least, very boring. 
The Jalapeno Monk margarita was great, spicy and sweet, it also had cucumber, which was refreshing. 
Overall we would definitely go back, especially for happy hour!
