A Mexican buffet place. Genius. 

Great place for lunch. You can get in and out very quickly and the food is fresh and you can control the portion.   I am always hesitant to go to a Mexican place because the portion is always too much. And who needs lunch coma?

If you are in the area and want some mexican food, you should come here. Plenty to choose from the buffet line and it does not dissapoint.
