I've only had margaritas and appetizers here, but I think this place is great!  Fun, outdoor patio complete with sand, a pool, and cabanas.

First time there we sat outside.  Second time we went there because we wanted to sit outside, but the patio was closed for a private party.  Bummer.  Was nice inside too though.  Third time we went at night with friends and I couldn't believe how crowded it was!  It's definitely a party place.  Our waitress that night was great!  Never kept us waiting, despite how crazy it was in there.

Margaritas are good.  Chips and salsa are good too....even though they charge for them.  The red salsa has a kind of strange taste, but the green is fabulous!  Guac is decent....nothing special though.

Overall, this is a fun place to hang out and have a couple drinks.
