Just finished my first round of street tacos at Backyard.
Normal price 1.89
Taco tuesday special 1.49
I must say the fresh made grilled flour tortillas are the bomb with the carne asada !! Wow!
The smokey flavored salsa is great as well from the salsa bar.
The only problem i see so far is that the cost can add up. 
I can eat 8 street tacos @1.49 and a small drink.... About 14.50
So it does add up!

.....just the smell out in the parking lot will make u nutz!!
