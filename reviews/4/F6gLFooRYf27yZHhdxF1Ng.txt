Not quite understanding the low reviews here! I recently tried Chipotle for the very first time ever and you better believe I gobbled that burrito up like nobodies business. It was huge, delicious, and cheap. Sure, the guacamole is a bit on the steep side, but they served me tons and it was delicious, so I can manage. I can't believe i avoided this place so many times, I will definitely go back...like, tomorrow.
