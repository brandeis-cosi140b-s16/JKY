My wife and I have been eating at Penascos since we moved to Maricopa in 2006. Lately I have been going in for lunch once or twice a month and we might eat there for dinner once a month. The menu has changed within the last year to make it a bit healthier overall. My wife noticed that right way and likes it better than before. 

My menu favorites are the seven seas soup, the ceviche, an occasional hard shell chicken taco, and the chicken fajitas. However, the go-to for me is certainly the chicken fajitas. I get them with the refried beans, which incidentally are made without lard, no cheese, extra salsa, and a side of their green and red enchilada sauces. Those sauces are both great and if I do not finish any sides I always take them home and eat them later. 

There are a lot of restaurants in Maricopa that have come and gone. I personally am very glad that Penascos has stuck around and hope that they will be around for a long time.
