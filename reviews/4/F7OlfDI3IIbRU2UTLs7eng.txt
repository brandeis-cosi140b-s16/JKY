Last weekend, Lil Man And I came here with a friend and her son. This was our first time. The line was long to get to the counter so that we could order our food, but when we got up to it, we had the chance to order whatever we wanted. My son asked for a salad and said to add whatever I felt like adding to it. So I asked the workers to add the pinto beans, corn, Pico de Gallo salsa, chicken, and bunch of other ingredients. He LOVED it. He was shocked that there were beans in it, but loved it. I had a chicken bowl. I had them make it the same way as my son's salad, but I had them add guacamole on top it it. My friend had a chicken burrito with everything in it. For her son, she ordered him a couple of quesadillas. We had a nice time eating and chatting. The environment was great busy but pleasant.
