Ok so let me start by saying the food in very good and to be honest I'm surprised, I figured it would just be another mexican food place that had...well... Mexican food! But at Bonitas they really know how to make it for sure! The only bad thing is they seem to be really slow...at any hour you go in... So be patient and wait and you'll love the food!!
