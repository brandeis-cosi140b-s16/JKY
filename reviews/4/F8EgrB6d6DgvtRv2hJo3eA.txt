For what it's worth, I go to this location about once a week for those sweet little chicken rolled tacos and I've never smelled the sewer smell.  This place is consistently great, quick and friendly.  I don't know what kind of shredded cheese they use, but I'm pretty sure they put crack in it.  Try the carne asada french fries if you're in the mood for an awesome treat!
