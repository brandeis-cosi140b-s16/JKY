My most recent experience with new Mexican Grill is a blend of good food and good customer service due to the manager Sydney addressing my concerns.

The food at new Mexican Grill is generally very good. We decided to go there on Friday night. My husband ordered a carne Asada burrito, but they forgot to put the carne inside the burrito. I called the next morning and spoke to the manager about my concern. She was very nice and promptly addressed the mistake. 

I would recommend going here as their food is good, they offer free chip with your meal, and clearly are also committed to good customer service which I much appreciate.

If you do go, try the green chili Ground beef enchiladas. They are very good, some of the best I had and they carry a spicy kick
