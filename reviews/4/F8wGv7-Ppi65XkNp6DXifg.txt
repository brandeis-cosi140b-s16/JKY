I've been to Camarones several times and keep coming back. From my house, it's a good 30 minute drive, but it's well worth it.
I personally don't enjoy restaurants that have such a noisy atmosphere that you have to practically yell at the person sitting across from you just to have a conversation. Camaromes is NOT like that at all. This place has a very upscale vibe to it. Granted, the outside cantina will appease those who would like their blaring music, but I'm more of an "enjoy my dinner" type of person.
The variety of the menu is fantastic! From tacos to pasta. And I have yet to try something that I didn't enjoy. I was also extremely impressed with the numerous vegetarian options on the menu. Generally you don't find that at other Mexican restaurants whose main ingredient is lard.
I recently went there with a party of 8 people. The service was impeccable!
I'll continue to frequent this place!
