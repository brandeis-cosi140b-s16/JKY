Been here numerous times for lunch or dinner and it has always been thoroughly enjoyable.  This is good, authentic Mexican food-- a bit "fancier" than the other good authentic places (Los Gemelos, etc) but by no means a fancy place.  I usually go with whatever the special is at lunch, and it has always been good.  Service has always been friendly and efficient.  Only disappointment I had was with one of the shrimp entrees at dinner, which came with only four (four!) shrimp.  Other than that one-off, no complaints!
