This is like one of the only restaurants who's dining hall is open 24 hours. By the time I get there, it's already mid morning hours and inside is basically empty except maybe people that are from the clubs and bars. The place is clean and the police are always there lately night at the nearby Subway sandwich shop and QT next door. 

The wait staff are easy going. I've gotten take out and eaten inside. I've been pretty pleased with both. The bathrooms are clean. The food comes out relatively fast. The food is pretty good. Their salsa is very spicy which, is one of the best things I like about the food here. The pricing is decent. I would definitely come here again.
