We will be coming back here soon! Service is great considering how busy they were. I like the self-serve area for salsa, lemons, cucumber, and pickled carrots. The hubby and I shared the menudo (very good) and two of 5 different tacos. The menudo was served with hot corn tortillas and a small generous bowl of chopped onion and cilantro. It was tasty and it wasn't greasy like others we've tried. The cabeza and lengua tacos were our favorite! The pork carnitas, carne asada, and pastor were a bit dry, but still flavorful. We hardly used any salsa with our tacos because they were so good! Our agua frescas were delicious as well. I had the horchata and hubs had tamarindo.

Overall, this place is above average for service, quality, taste, cleanliness, and decor. The bathroom is lacking big time due to the size as well as lack of toilet paper, and hand paper towels. When I walked in there, a large trash bin was on top of the toilet seat, giving the impression that the toilet was out of order.
