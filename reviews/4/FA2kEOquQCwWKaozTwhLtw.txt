Probably my favorite mexican style restaurant in Vegas.  Hot fresh chips and good salsa really sets the tone for me and theirs is great!  I have to stop myself from getting full before the real food comes.   Seafood Enchiladas are the best!  everything else has been good too.  Fajitas are great and Margaritas are huge and delicious!  The only negative was the table side guacamole which was very very bland.  It's possible that it was just a new person making it and they didn't do a very good job.  But love going here!
