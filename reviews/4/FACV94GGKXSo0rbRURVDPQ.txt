Well... don't come here expecting a fancy seafood restaurant, they have plastic silverware. However, I really enjoy the seafood from there and I hope it's clean. I always order the shrimp tostadas (they have a good selection of bottled salsas) and the camaron al aguachile.  Every time I go there I have to drink a Pacifico preparada (similar to a bloody mary but replace the vodka with beer). In my opinion, they have the best preparadas in town. 

There are three different locations, most are in the Northern side of town. I would definitely go more often if they had a location that was closer. They also have a band play or guitarists that will sing you a song.
