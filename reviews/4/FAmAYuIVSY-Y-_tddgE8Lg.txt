Tried the Carne asada quesadilla and chicken burrito along with a pineapple juice. Place is a hidden gem in Vegas. The juices are really good and you get free refills. My friend took me here during EDC Week this year and I was really glad he did. It's like CA taco shops - family ran, good portions, prices and service.
