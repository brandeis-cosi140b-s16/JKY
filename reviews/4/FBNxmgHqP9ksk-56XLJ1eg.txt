I've never been to Dos Gringos in Tempe & I have to say I was rather impressed! not a huge fan of Corona but I became one when they're only $2! At first when I walked in, I was thinking "wow where is the band playing?" but then there was an even BIGGER area! I would for sure go back. It was a good atmosphere & the staff also will ask if you need a ride to get to your destination after you leave Dos Gringos! I was very impressed!
