Northern Mexico food, at its best. Beans are homemade and good, have not got sick yet, so its been fresh. You do know, 9/10 times its bad beans, when you get sick, lol.
They throw in some chips and salsa's to spoil your meal, buy hey, its up to you. Service is good and football (soccer in america) is always on, yeah.
I do breakfast here sometimes and its the spot when I am hungry after work, so its a no miss for me. Posole and menudo too, not just on every other full moon when a democrat is president ;)
They also have small bar in the back, but alcohol is not my thing so, who knows.
Check it out, don't be scared.
