First timer? It'll get a little confusing ... There are separate lines for the different types of meat and for the fries. Pick the line for which meat you want most (it'll be a problem if you want different types of meat unless someone in your party is already waiting in that line). Tell them what you want for that meat (taco, mulas, quesadilla, etc). Grab your order and go to the register to the right and pay for what you ordered.

Thankfully I came with two people who had already been here and showed us the ropes! I ordered the adobada (spicy pork) quesadilla ($4). I'm pretty sure what I got was not a quesadilla. Not sure if the guy knew what he was doing? It was a taco with a small piece of crispy circular tortilla on top.. not pressed together or anything just thrown on top. We asked him what that was and he had to tell us it was the quesadilla. Very confused.. The flavors were good though. Ask for grilled onions (they give you green onions) and chili. 

Parking can be somewhat of a behind depending on when you come. Many of the parking spots in front of the other tenants have parking just for their store. We came during random hours at 2:30pm and the place was still pretty crowded.
