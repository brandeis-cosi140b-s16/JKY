It sounded like Bastard Noise or Merzbow was blasting through the speakers of the drive thru menu.  Same menu as you'd find at any other 24 hour Mexican joint.  I only look at the burro section.  No 'Can i help you?' or 'Can I take your order?'.  Nothing like that.

I just go for it.  "I'll have two breakfast burros; egg, potato and cheese.  And a bean and cheese burrito."

Noise distorts out through the speaker.  I get the hint that it's rhythmically broken up into syllables.  

"Hello?".

More noise.  Fuck it.  I pull forward.

The lady comes to the drive-thru window and repeats my order back to me.  She's basically got everything right.  The tip jar is a styrofoam cup taped rather shoddily to the drive-thru window.  She's not really sexy or young or anything but she's pretty.  I put a quarter in the tip jar cup thingy.  Our burros were $10.11.

It takes about three to four minutes for the burros to be wrapped, bagged and given to us.  My kids are pretty stoked.  The red salsa is pretty great as well.  

Then it's on to Greyhound Park as we cruise Van Buren and sight see on our way to the flea market.  Saturday is beautiful.

Note:  If you're at the drive thru window, don't look down.  It's full of old gum, straw wrappers, cigarette butts, gross spilled milk.  Trust me.  Eyes forward.  You're good.
