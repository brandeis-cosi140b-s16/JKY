On the plus side:  service was over the top and the place is very cool (has an upstairs seating area).  Chips and salsa were fantastic.  Prices were reasonable.  On the minus side:  my chile relleno was mostly dough - not at all what I expected.  I would go back, but I would definitely try another dish the next time.
