Tried this place late one night after a long day at work.  I wanted a burger, but did not want fast food.  I remembered the The Stand (and remembered reading good reviews on Yelp) had just opened, so I went through the drive thru.  Ordered burger, fries, chick taco and short rib taco, and a drink.  I pulled around to the window, got my soda, and waited.... and then one of the workers came up and asked if I wanted a drink while I was waiting.  I thanked him, said I had a drink... and then 2 minutes later, I was offered by another worker a free lemonade to try!  Awesome!  They were so friendly, which made the little bit of the wait not so bad.  It did take about 8-10 minutes, which is long for a drive thru, but it is good food and it was clear that it was made fresh.

The burger was good, I'd recommend this burger.  Fries were definitely the end-of-the-day fries but it was 9pm, so it's understandable and they were not too bad.  My mom liked her tacos, I tried them, and they were good quality.

Overall, I would recommend, and I would go back for sit down.
