So far so good:: it's kinda slow/ the salsa lacks something?? But it's salsa non the less, they have tv and a projector for parties:: I live where there hardly is no food:: so something in a corner like this sometimes can be surprising:: I had a cheese quesadilla :: hmmm:: and SURPRISE :: it was great:: came out hot, had all my cheese melted:: best of all a quality cheese taste.. Also the Chicken Shredded Enchilada passed go as well! Red sauce was good.. Again a huge surprise and a Happy Yay:: cause I live near this resturant:: 
The only down side is the bar next door and the smell leaks over :: bummer:: 
Service was at first non existent but then it turned into being cute! Mom and pops shop!
