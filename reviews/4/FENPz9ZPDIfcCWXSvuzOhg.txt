I would actually give this a 4.5 if that was possible. They have very delicious authentic Mexican food. I love the Carnitas in the Carne asana is pretty good too. Sure some of the other reviews have mentioned the wait which isn't bad but it takes a little while to cook everything well, this is not fast food. I highly recommend habaneros. Please stop by and give them a try. Salsa is good and guacamole is excellent.
