I just finished having lunch here and I liked everything just fine. I had the #5 combo which is a taco and an enchilada, both chicken, with a medium Tamarindo drink. Good flavor, friendly staff. If you want to get the same meal and pay an extra five bucks for a schmoozy atmosphere, go somewhere else. But I would go here again any day.
