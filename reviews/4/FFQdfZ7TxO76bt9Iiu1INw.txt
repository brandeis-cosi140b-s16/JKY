It's great for being a chain restaurant.  Food is good but not the freshest. They just started brunch at this location. Brunch is soooo worth it. Mexican food + breakfast = many smiles. They start at 10 am so it's not a early breakfast place. It's a little spendy for breakfast that's why only 4 stars.  I based the review on the fact it's a chain restaurant.
