Well, after recently moving into the area, I decided to venture into Old Pueblo and see what it was all about for myself.  I ended up having a very pleasant experience.  The chips and salsa were just ok, but their shredded beef tacos were cooked to order, and they were great.  I also had a cheese enchilada, which was ok, but not spectacular.  Overall, I was happy with the food, but the service was outstanding!  Ivan was my waiter, and he was very polite, prompt, and just seemed like a genuinely nice guy.  Also, they have a nice breakfast menu, which they serve all day, so I will definitely be back.  I think this place offers what you would want in a small town Arizona cafe, nothing fancy, with a combination of Mexican food, and American food on the menu, an understated decor, and really nice people.  If you haven't given them a try, I recommend that you do when you are in town.
