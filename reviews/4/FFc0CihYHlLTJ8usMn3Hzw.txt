One of our FAVORITE joints to eat at.  BEST chips in salsa in the Valley in my opinion.  Casual eatery, GREAT food (I only like Manuel's better...all other casual Mexican food restaurants don't compare).

Their frozen strawberry margaritas are DEEEE-LISH.

We used to live in south Scottsdale & frequented "the" Julio G's down there and the Julio's Too for takeout, and although this location isn't as unique in decor & ambience, it definitely is the same wonderful food & friendly staff.
