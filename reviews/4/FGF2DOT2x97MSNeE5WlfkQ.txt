Why is it that little run down places always serve the most amazing Mexican food? Some obscure psychological effect is at play I'm sure... Anyway the chicken enchiladas were over-stuffed with perfectly cooked white chicken meat and served with a bold red sauce rather than the standard green (per my request). Every item I saw hit the surrounding tables looked even better - I must return to try more of Espo's. FYI - this is right down the road from the Chandler Fashion Center and well worth the long drive from North Scottsdale.
