This was very close to traditional Mexican from Mexico. I had Tripe, tongue, chicarones, and pastor tacos. The toppings were fresh, as was the three salsas that came with my to-go order. Staff was very nice . The decor is what you would expect. I would trade decor over quality of food any day. I would eat there again.
