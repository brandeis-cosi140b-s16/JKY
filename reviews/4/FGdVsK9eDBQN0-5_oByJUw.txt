We were sad when the previous restaurant in this spot (America Latina) closed after only 3 months, but were happy to have another authentic Mexican place take its place! Two barbacoa tacos for only $5.50 is a steal - "real Mexican street taco style" with just cilantro and onions. The Quesadilla Nortena with shrimp, mushrooms and onions was really good too. You have to purchase the chips and salsa, but the salsa is sooo worth it. They also have a good hot sauce and a yummy mild tomatillo sauce.

On our second visit I had shrimp tacos - not on the menu, but since they had other shrimp options, I asked them to make them as tacos, and they quickly agreed. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, and seasoned soooo well. Street taco style again, but I got the platter that came with pico de gallo, guacamole, rice and beans. Rice and beans were average...I'm not usually a fan anyway, so I'm not a good judge. Hubby got the chicken burrito special - smothered in sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo and enchilada sauce. He loved it. On both visits, the super nice lady who works there gave us a free appetizer sample of their home made chicken and rice soup. Very tasty and definitely tastes home made, traditional chicken soup. Tonight they also had cilantro soup on special, which was creamy and delicious!! The home made horchata is also very yummy. They have flan and other desserts, but so far we have been too full to try them.

There are no other authentic Mexican restaurants on this side of town, so El Burrito Loco is a very welcome addition! We will definitely be back! Please go and visit them, we want them to last longer than the previous tenant!!! We learned that they have applied for their liquor license, so will have beer options soon.
