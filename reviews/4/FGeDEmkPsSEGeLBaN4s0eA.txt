I have only had the chicken tacos and they are pretty good. Very Wet meat however, and after one to-go order I have learned to eat-in to avoid soggy shells. They have pollo asada tacos too which I have not tried. 

Meat is tender and tasty and in a light tomato broth which I like despite the fact I am a chicken taco purest and like the chicken to be plain old shredded chicken usually.

I ask for no lettuce, and a side of cut cilantro and onions.There is always alot of cheese which looks to be freshly shredded on site-that is good.  Bonus is that you get a squeeze bottle of green sauce when you eat-in versus to-go you have to beg for extra salsa and I am a green salsa freak and put alot on when I find it at restaurants. I can pile it on here. 

Because the tacos are so wet, almost ahogado style, I use my fork and crunch all the tacos into a big pile and eat with a fork.
