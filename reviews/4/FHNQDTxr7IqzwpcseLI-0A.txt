Don't really understand all the 5 star ratings as this food does not really taste better than a lot of the Mexican food I've had in California. Don't get me wrong, the food is good, just not good enough to justify the prices they are charging, I had the carne asada burrito and it was good but definitely not better than the carne asada burrito I get for half that price at the local Alberto's behind my house! Also thought the location of this place was a bit quirky as it shares its walls with the largest strip club in America. We had to pull over and ask a parking lot attendant where the restaurant was because the strip club was pretty much covering it up. Service is good and at the end of the meal the chef came out and spoke to our party for a minute which was nice.
