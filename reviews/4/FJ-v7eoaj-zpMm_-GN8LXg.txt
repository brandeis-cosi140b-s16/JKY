I've waited for some good Mexican for 5-months, boy was it worth it! I missed tasty Mexican food and Arizona is one place to find it. My sister took me here; I wanted some place with that, hole-in-the-wall feel, nothing too fancy and affordable. 

I ordered the Veggie Burrito enchilada style with Red Sauce. It was yummy! Also, I did mention to my sister, "it's a little salty," but I didn't mind it. We also ordered the guac and salsa chips. Guac was creamy and exquisite! 

I would definitely come back here again!
