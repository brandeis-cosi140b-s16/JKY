I love that Chipotle is openly promoting a NON-GMO way of eating! I also love their big fat burritos and feel that $7-$8 is a good value. I decided to try the quesa-rito which I've been told is a 'secret menu' item. Was it huge, yes! Was it good, of course! Was it worth the price...not really. Instead of charging you for an extra tortilla (because that's really the only extra product ordered) they literally charge you for a quesadilla and a burrito. This means you pay nearly $12 for a burrito that has cheese on the outside, as opposed to getting it on the inside. Worth the try but I'll never do it again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else. Now, please excuse me while I take a nap...zZzZz
