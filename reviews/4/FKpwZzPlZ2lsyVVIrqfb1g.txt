Why come here? Because they spit roast and carve their pork tacos to order

strolled thru lunchtime last saturday and the line was going out the front door, so many ppl gotta make sure your standing in the right line, I came here for the Adobada (pork) and luckily I stood in the right line, the middle, the left is for Carne Asada and the far right is for everything else, Brains, Guts, and Quesadillas etc....

ordered 3 of the pork tacos at $2 a piece, everything includes cilantro, onions, and two house made sauces, hot sauce and crema, extra fixings you gotta hit the side bar yourself if you want radish and any other sauces

the tacos were all the hype, freshly grilled, crusted edges, juices running into the tortilla which by the way were heated simultaneously under the spit and picked up when your order is carved, to top it off, you get a slice of the that pineapple roasting on the top of mt. meat, all good, btw if you want roasted onions and peppers I think you gotta ask for it

inside/outside seating, open 10am to 5am daily, parking is hit or miss (on the strip), park in the lot around the corner

a must try if your into cheap eats, especially in Vegas
