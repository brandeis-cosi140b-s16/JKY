I have always loved Manuel's but never reviewed it before. We have always had a great time with excellent margaritas. The food is good I have probably tried most everything on the menu and would recommend ... The Pollo Especial, the spinach enchiladas and the cheese crisps are great with chips and salsa when you just want to drink, chat and munch.
