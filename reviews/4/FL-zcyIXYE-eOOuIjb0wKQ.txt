I was waiting in a long line for a concert and was feeling antsy. I wandered into Julio's Too looking for a bathroom, but I was distracted by all the delicious smells. I couldn't resist so I ordered one soft beef taco. It was only $3 and they also gave me a free bag of fresh piping hot chips and asked me what type of salsa I wanted. They loaded my bag with 3 cups of mild salsa, chips, and the beef taco. I lived in San Diego for 4 years and found the quality to be pretty authentic. It also helped make the line go faster as I munched away on my feastings.
