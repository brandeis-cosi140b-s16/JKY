Holy frijoles, Los Taquitos is like a lunchtime fiesta! I raced over on my work break to meet my Yelpmigos, the place was packed with wall to wall people. Crunched for time & it being my first visit I didn't order much, quesadilla con jalapenos & a diet coke. The cashier tried to warn me they'd be hot, they must have grown them in the pits of hell because I think they scorched my tongue! My quesadilla was good, hot yes but the peppers were tasty & fresh so I'd order them again! My food came out fast, and everyone's food disappeared just as quick as it appeared! I'll definitely be back, the food is good, the service is friendly and fast, it's also been Guy Ferrari tested and yelper approved!
