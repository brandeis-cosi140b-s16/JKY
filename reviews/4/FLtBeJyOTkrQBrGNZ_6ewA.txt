So my brother is a fireman near this place & has been telling me him & his crew eat here all the time because its so good, fresh, cheap & big portions.   So I finally tried it.   It's Across from fitness works hidden in corner (no sign).  I ordered 2 fish tacos with beans & rice $6 and chicken burrito with green sauce $6.  Free chips & salsa bar with amazingly fresh salsa. Chips were a little thick & hard & dry but salsa makes up for it.  Fish tacos were amazballs.  Fresh pico de gallo & avocado on top & even a lemon to squeeze.   Skip getting beans & rice-nothing spectacular.   The green sauce chicken burrito was ginormous & the chicken was cut small & peppery- just the way I like it.   I had one happy husband when I got home with it.  They also gave us chips & salsa to go.  You could easily feed a family of 4 for under $15 here.  My only complaint is the salads only have iceberg lettuce.  I also felt bad for the waitress running around.   I think they were understaffed & she looked stressed.   She was trying to manage 6 tables plus to-go orders.  So food took a little bit but it was nice to sit & eat free chips & dip & catch up with my 6-year-old daughter.  We will definitely be back!
