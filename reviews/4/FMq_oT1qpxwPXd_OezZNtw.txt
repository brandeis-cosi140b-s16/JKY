Really like this little place.  Good food, friendly service, cute ambiance.  We live in a nearby neighborhood and visit once or twice a month.  We've tried a variety of menu items and all are good.  Especially like the cheese sauce with the chips.  Cheap margarita's too.  Not the best you've ever had but they are cheap!
