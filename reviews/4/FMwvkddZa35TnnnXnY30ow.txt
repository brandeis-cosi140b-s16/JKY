Two things that I'm a big fan of here are the delicious salsa which they serve with fresh warm tortilla chips and the desserts. You can't go wrong with any dessert you choose. The churros are warm and have a delicious cinnamon filling, and come with ice cream. The fried ice cream is just as good. 

The service is good. They always play good spanish music too. 

The food, in my opinion is alright. Good but not amazing. I've tried different things. The mole was not good at all, I'm sorry. I wouldn't order it again. But perhaps my taste buds just don't like mole. 

The burritos are decent. I've had the giant burrito. It is indeed... giant. They serve their burritos enchilada style, meaning smothered in sauce. 

The chips and salsa, convenient location and friendly staff keep me coming. I plan to try more on their menu and hopefully I find something I love, cos I really want to love this place.
