People always tell you about "their favorite Mexican food spot" and good for them, but what most people don't realize is the best fast food Mexican food west of the Las Vegas strip is in fact Tacos El Compita. This place is clean, fresh and absolutely delicious. Best thing on the menu is their Mulitas, with many choices of meat you're bound to find the one for you, the price is simply amazing as well!! Only down fall is they close at 9pm, most of us like the burritos and tacos after midnight, so be sure to come here for lunch and enjoy the friendly staff as they prepare you some of the greatest Mexican Meals.
