Really cute little place.  Hubby and I shared a green chili chimi, (Delicious beef green chili.  I always base how well I like a place based on the green chili. ) saffron rice and refried beans (just like from my childhood). We didn't take anything home and we were both satisfactorily full without being stuffed.  I liked the heat of the salsa. The only downside was the chips were slightly over cooked (just kept me from stuffing myself before the meal came which wasn't such a bad thing :).
