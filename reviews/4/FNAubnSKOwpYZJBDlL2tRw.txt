This Mexican joint sprung up out of nowhere in my neighborhood and it took me this long to find it?!  I'm glad it's here though, they have some great food.

The portions are huge and taste great.  They also have Mexican Pepsi and Jarritos Orange soda....that seals the deal, this place is legit.

The only thing lacking is that they offer 2 Salsas, green or red....wish they had a "super spicy" option, but they don't.

The restaurant is very clean and spacious.  There's also a drive thru if you're on the go.
