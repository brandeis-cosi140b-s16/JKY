Sometimes I like being a lazy eater and Chino Bandido definitely helps.

When you walk in, the menu is on the left and you order from one of the register people. You have the option of really customizing everything so don't get too overwhelmed.

I usually order #1, the carnitas, with jerk fried rice. I then pour two containers of their hot sauce over it. I then mix it all together and I have this delicious combination of spicy pork fried rice. Yum!

This will usually keep me full for almost the whole day. 

They also include a very good snicker-doodle cookie with your order that is soft and melts wonderfully in your mouth.
