They have a veggie quesadilla that's loaded with cheese - a little wet, but very tasty. I love the margaritas! Service can be hit or miss in terms of order accuracy. Chips and salsa are served at all tables. The salsa is delicious. I've never seen the location by 201 Central have more than a few patrons.
