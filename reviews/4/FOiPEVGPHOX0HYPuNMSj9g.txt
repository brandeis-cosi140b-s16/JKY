My husband, my friend and I were craving for pupusas. We found these and checked them out. 
The servers were really friendly, though they spoke chopped English. 
The pupusas themselves were good-sized and almost tastes like my friends moms. 
The only reason why it's a four star, is because our table was kind of sticky.
