So far one of my favorite Chipotle locations in Arizona, the other being on 67th ave and Thomas rd. For the most part the staff is wonderful. I always end up having very funny people help me at check out. 

It does matter what time you make it at. Usually,  right around 7-8 at night they start getting pretty busy. So their might be some delay. I did wait almost 10-15 in line before being helped, but I left the restaurant super happy. Thanks to their wonderful customer service. 

The food is very consistent with what Chipotle should be and taste like. I always have their bowls and ask for extra beans or rice (at no extra charge), and have tried all the meats. I especially like the chicken, barbacoa, and Carnitas. The steak is not for me I like mine well done. The chips are never stale as I have bought stale chips from other locations. The amounts given are very good for the price you are paying. If not you can always ask them to put a little more and I am sure they won't charge you extra. You're able to ask for either "double meat" and pay extra (you get two types of meats) or you could ask for "half and half" so you get the portions you would pay for one type of meat at no extra charge. 

I hope they never change.
