My wife and I ate at the restaurant with two friends.  We all had good times eating and talking.  We were there for almost three hours.  The food was good.  The prices was very reasonable.  We were there to celebrate my Birthday.  The only thing is that the waitress was not happy to be there and to serve us.  She looked grumpy.  I think that the restaurant needs to educate their waitresses and waiters about the Joy of Serving the Customers.  I would recommend this restaurant as long as the waitress is happy, and everything would be fine.
