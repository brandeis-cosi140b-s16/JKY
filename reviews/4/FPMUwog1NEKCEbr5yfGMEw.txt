Oh my goodness is this a stellar pie place! It was hard to choose off the menu, but my friend and I decided to split the veg starter plate and the fig pizza. We were in love with every bite. 

Will definitely be back. Lovely outside seating for the summer, and that shop would be cozy in the winter months!
