I've stopped by two different locations now.  One off 7th st which is in an old run down house.  And his location which looks like a commercial cookie cutter version. So far I've only had the large breakfast burrito with carne Assad. Not sure why this location only has 2 stars but I've enjoyed the burrito with scratch tortillas and salsa. There has to be a reason. The burrito is pretty dang good and came out in less than 4min. I don't know about the other items yet but I'll def give them a shot soon.  Maybe it's the name? Lol
