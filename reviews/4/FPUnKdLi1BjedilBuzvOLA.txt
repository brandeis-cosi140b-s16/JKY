I gave it 4 starts ONLY because of the food, NOTHING else. If the service, restaurant decor etc was good too, it would have 5 starts. 5 Starts for food, 2 stars for service, and 2 for restaurant overall. I never been here until some co workers told me about it. I went the 1st time with some co workers. a good party of 8 people. I read other review, it looks like an italian restaurant. You could tell they did nothing well at all to open it. Lobby is TINY. Decor sucks. dining room too quiet and full with no music, TV or anything. Silence. Food was GREAT! Warning though, everything is really spicy!! but it is so good. LOVE the salsa. i had a red chile burrito with chicken, AMAZING. i wish I had more rice on the plate, but good. Still have their weird "temp" menu, but still good choices. 

I just went again last night with my partner. The waiter who was also the bartender, I believe ignored us because he went to a table of 4 before us and we were way before. the bus boy took care of us, beginning to finish. the bartender, waiter guy came over once to see if we were doing okay and we said yes so thats how I could tell he was supposed to take care of us. He asked if the other guy helped us. a few younger "servers" walk around there with shorts, toms and side way hats. I like the casual atmosphere of staff, but when you have no personality and no interest in helping, it doesnt make it more fun. 

Come here for the food, NOT the service. it lacks really quite a bit. No one was rude, just are bland as a robot. 

Looking forward to going back. I may try the PHX or Alma School one to compare.
