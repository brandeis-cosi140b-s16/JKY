This is one of the very few places that I actually crave. You can't go wrong with anything here but my favorite is the double enchilada plate with grilled chicken. The medium salsa is one of the best salsas I've had in a while. If you like guacamole, this place has you covered. Try it with salsa and cheese on top and you can thank me later! Besides the wait to order, I love this place!
