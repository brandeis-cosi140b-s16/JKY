I've been to five Cafe Rio locations and I've decided that they all equally deserve my Yelp love. Yes it is a chain. But, in my humble opinion at least, their food is spectacular. I usually order a burrito with enchilada sauce. It never disappoints.

My friends and I particularly like this location after a hike at Mt Charleston.
