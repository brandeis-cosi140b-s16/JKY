I'm not sure why this place has bad reviews. My husband and I thought it was good for Mexican food. I had Steak and chicken fajitas and he had the chicken enchiladas with red sauce.  Steak was good and not chewy/fatty (typical for most places like this). Chicken was cooked perfectly and the tortillas were really good too. Enchiladas were great, simple red sauce with cheese and not greasy. We both had Jalape√±o Margaritas, which were a complete win. Overall, we liked it for a night where cooking was not an option.
