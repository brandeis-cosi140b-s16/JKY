So, went back to ATS last weekend with the GF BF and really really enjoyed everything we had! So glad they added the additional seating out front so it isn't such a "Survival of the Fittest" situation and the horchata....seriously! I could have drank the entire jug she poured it from!

We also had the carne asada tacos, a vampiro each and yes, a piece of heaven sent corn! We will definitely be back!!
