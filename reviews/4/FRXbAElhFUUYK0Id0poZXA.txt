A favourite stop of my best AZ friend. The Pollo Fundido is amazing! I have had this dish both visits. The blend of cheese is heavenly! The other menu items are equally as apetizing such as fajitas and machaca. Pricing is incredibly reasonable for the portion served. Service is friendly and quick! Worth the drive past the prisons - short trip from Queen Creek area!
