O.K. I went to Bueno Burger again last night for the first time in a few months.  I was all set to get my sonoran dog fix.  Then noticed they had added an item to their menu; a Pulled Pork Sandwich.  Being a huge fan of pulled pork I had to try one.  So I ordered both. The Sonoran Dog was easily the best I've had at Bueno Burger.  The dog was cooked perfectly and they got all the toppings right.  It's really amazing how well the mustard and mayo work with the other ingredients.  Now to the pulled pork.  All I can say is WOW!  This is the best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had.  The pork was nice and tender and the BBQ sauce, while nothing special was solid.  What puts it over the top is the off-the-hook cilantro coleslaw.  It was so unique and just added that perfect mix to the bbq sauce. 

Until they use a balillo bun for their sonoran dog they won't get a 5 from me though.
