We have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this  new restaurant.  We went on the second night it was open and we were very pleased!  Service, chips and salsa, food, and drinks were very good!  They have done a wonderful job with the remodel of the interior.  Nice to have another choice in  this area to enjoy - a nice complement to our other excellent Mexican restaurants!
