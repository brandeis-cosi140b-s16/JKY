Baja Fresh is one of those places that is neither memorable nor forgettable--it just is what it is. Situated in the courtyard of the office tower in which I work, BF is a convenient lunch option when I've forgotten my lunch in the fridge at home. I enjoy the freshness of their food and that it's made to order, and that the workers seem to be constantly cleaning. The salsa bar is always well-stocked and offers a good selection. Today I ordered the Nacho Burrito, enchilada style, and found it quite tasty. 

It won't knock your socks off, but it's a fairly-priced meal downtown that remains consistent. If you go, stop by my office and we'll dine together.
