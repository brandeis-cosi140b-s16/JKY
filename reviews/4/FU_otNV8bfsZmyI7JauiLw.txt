Gadzooks is to enchiladas and street tacos what Chipotle is to burritos! 

Ambiance: It has a similar industrial, minimalist design with a trademark orange accent color. There is a "assembly line" format to ordering, similar to Chipotle. I chose to street tacos over enchiladas, but they have the same basic ingredients. 

Food: I ordered two street tacos with chicken, uncle rico's pico, asadero cheese, and guacamole (extra $1.60 charge). I skipped the red/green sauce, because I can only handle mild spiciness. (My friend ordered the habanero lava and said it was almost too spicy for her.) The food was very fresh and flavorful, and overall very delicious. Apparently they also sell soups, but since I had just come in from walking in the 110 degree heat, I passed.

Some cons: the ratio of indoor to outdoor seating is a little too low for my taste and during the lunch rush, it was difficult to find indoor seating. I also saw flies around the serving area and I even saw one land in the cheese. I know it's not always possible keep flies out of the kitchen, but still, it's not the most sanitary thing to look at.

Overall, I do recommend this place, despite the downsides.
