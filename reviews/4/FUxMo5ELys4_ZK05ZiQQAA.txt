I am always skeptical of fusion places because I feel instead of being really good at one thing, you can end up messing up on two. There are very few places that can strike the balance. Sumo maya, fortunately got it right, atleast on my first visit here. I had the passion fruit sangria, bacon wrapped dates, fish taco and spicy corn. I liked the food and the drink was refreshing. I am a little confused on the use of the word fusion though, because to me the menu looked like there were mexican and asian dishes listed separately, not like I feared - i.e ceviche dumplings! 

This place is really busy but the service is attentive and friendly. There is a giant tree in the middle of the room which gives it an outdoorsy feel. Great location. Parking is a little hard . 

I did not get to try lots of things on the menu since I came with people who didn't eat as they had dinner plans later. So I will certainly be back with foodies to give this tapas place the attention it deserves.
