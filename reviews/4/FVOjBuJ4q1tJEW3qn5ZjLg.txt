Everytime my sister gets out of school she wants to go to Taco Bell and finally I gave in a took her. As we walked in you can see how nicely kept the building was and automatically got a great vibe from the employees. our cashier was funny and even cute (single ladiessssss :)). 
The was not very hot but still warm enough to where it tasted good. The only thing i ever really complain about is that everytime I eat tacos I have a horrible after taste left in my mouth , next time I'll buy gum before I go! 
Its a great place for on the go , just got off work or put of school type place.
Can you say " quiero Taco Bell ?"
