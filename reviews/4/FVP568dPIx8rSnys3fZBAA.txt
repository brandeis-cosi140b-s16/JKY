Just across the train tracks on the strip mall. Friendly staff. Nice dining area. Bathroom is all jacked up from vandals. Hot sauce ain't gonna destroy your mouth. Chorizo tacos were acceptable. Overall satisfied with my 10 o clock dinner. Will rate burritos in the future because they look mad decent.
