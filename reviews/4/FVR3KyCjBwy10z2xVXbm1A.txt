I'm not sure about the rest of the comments but my whole table was colored and we got in just fine and got good deals on bottle service 2 nights this week(Thursday and Saturday). The DJ was good and our service was great both nights. They had to move our table on Thursday night but actually comped us another bottle so no big deal. Can't comment on the food though cause all we had was drinks.
