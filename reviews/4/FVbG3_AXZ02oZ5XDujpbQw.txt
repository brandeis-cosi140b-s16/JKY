Food = great. Great selection of classic favorites, beans and salsa while you wait, fast service. 

Our waitress was helpful in suggesting her favorite dishes, patient and it was a great experience overall. Lots of room for big parties, or intimate booths for small parties.

Booths are a little squeeze and the only thing I truly don't like is that in the bar, you can smoke. I will say it doesn't travel much and take over the restaurant, but I just prefer to be farther away from it.
