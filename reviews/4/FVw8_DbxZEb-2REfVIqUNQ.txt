This place is pretty good for an $8 plate of 2 tacos with rice and beans. The meat was a little too salty, as was the rice...but the refried beans were home made, and not out of a can or out of a package. The avocado was fresh in the guacamole--however it was only smashed avocado: no seasoning, no jalapeno, no garlic, onion or tomato. Chips were fresh and hot. My daughter had Maria's special which was a taco, chalupa (tostada), enchilada, tamale and relleno (just some deep fried ground beef and cheese). The sauce on the tamale was cloaento hot dog chili....but the mole on the enchilada was home made. The tostada was perfect. 

The service was great...our waitress was very personable and helped me find their hottest sauce--the Diablo sauce. It had a little spice to it. :-)

For someone who comes from New Mexico, this was as close to "home" as I have seen yet! Now they just need some red and green chile!!
