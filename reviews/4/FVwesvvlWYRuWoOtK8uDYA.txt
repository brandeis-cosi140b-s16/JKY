Ordered fish tacos, #13? It was absolutely delicious! The staff was pretty friendly, and the wait wasn't too long..it was about 2 hours after lunch, so that's probably why. I'm a big fish taco foodie and the one from here was pretty good! Also, the salsa bar was great! Great tasting red and green sauces, and I loved how it was covered to keep it's freshness. Definitely got my monies worth with this place! There is also a drive thru!
