Hmm Komex is still awesome, but they have changed up a few things which really put the place over the top since I last stopped by.

Came by a few days ago with Pratik W. and noticed that the whole place looked different. They eliminated some booths and opened the place up which is good!.

But sadly they have eliminated the Yelp check in offer for the free wontons. Really bummed me out - show love to your Yelp fans!

Also, one of things which I loved which was the free bottled water has now been replaced by tap water. They used to serve water in a glass straight from one of those small Costco water bottles, now its tap. I understand that it may have been costly but tap water sucks and they could have at least gotten a Brita as some people do expect this.

But of course the food is still awesome. Great fusion you can't get anywhere else!
