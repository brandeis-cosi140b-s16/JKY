If you want cheap, authentic, well seasoned mexican food this place is great.

I have been twice (dine in once, take out once) and yes the previous reviewers are not exagerating about the broken english.  I have had the enchiladas verde, enchiladas rojas and the enchiladas covered in mole.  Of those three the ehchiladas verde are by far my favorite.
