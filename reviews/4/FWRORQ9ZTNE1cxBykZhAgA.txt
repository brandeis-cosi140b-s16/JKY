Alright, finally ate here.   I had the carne asada burrito, with green rice, black beans, salsa, guacamole, lettuce....and I think that's it.  It was quite good.
What I liked about it, is that it was all very light and fresh and not greasy and gross.  I liked the salsa and even the chips quite a bit too.  
My aunt just had one taco, which was actually rather substantial.  The cousin had the two tacos, which he took down like he hadn't eaten in a week.  
Their food is tasty, fresh and of decent quality.  You get a choice of either green rice or the typical red rice.  The people there are very very nice, and the owner was there, eating some menudo as she fiddled on her laptop.  
All in all, pretty tasty and very very inexpensive.
