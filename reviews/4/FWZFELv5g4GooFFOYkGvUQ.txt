I went here the other day for the first time and I have to say I thought it was way above places like Robertos and Faustos.  I got the breakfast burrito which was so yummy I wanted to go back for more.  Not greasy at all.  I also got a tamale, that the waitress says is made by the owners sister, very very good and also not greasy at all.  The salsas are also good from the bar they have, with nice pepper flavor and not vinegar like the other places.  Overall a wonderful experience, so I plan to go there for dinner tonight.
