I went in Tuesday for the first time to try some tacos.  I ordered 4 chicken to go. The line situation is kind of confusing. They don't have someone at each station.  

The tacos did taste good so that's why they get a four star.  I like the salsa bar and taco toppings.  I think next time I will have to eat there.  When I paid I thought it was pricey.  I did not not notice until I left I was charged for six tacos.  I called and returned for a refund for the extra charge. 

I do not eat pork so I thought it was so disgusting seeing the cooked pig intestines at the next station. 

I will definitely try them again and hopefully it will be a better experience.
