Saw this place as we bumbled through the Cosmopolitan and we knew we had to have lunch here. I felt bad for the waitress, we had loaded up on one too many free mojitos at the slot machines, and were being extremely obnoxious. At one point, while laughing my face off, I called over a random busboy and told him that it was JLs birthday (it was not). The things I do for free cake. Then, while laughing my face off, JL said, "no, it's your birthday" (it was not). Let's just say that we did not get any free cake during our stay. The food was definitely not fusion. They had random items like guacamole, tacos, and dim sum. It all tasted pretty authentic, but the portions were small. I think about four tacos and a noodle bowl cost us about 40 bucks.
