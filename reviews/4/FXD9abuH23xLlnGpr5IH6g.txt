Moe's is consistently good.  The people are fast and friendly... Welcome to Moes!.  And the food is great.  Love the Burrito and Queso!  

My only complaint is that they nickel and dime you, ie if you want Queso in the burrito it's "a little extra" and if you buy the side of Queso, it's not very big for what they charge.  But other than that, the food is great.
