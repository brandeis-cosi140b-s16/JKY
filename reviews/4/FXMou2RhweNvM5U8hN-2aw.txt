I came in for my birthday free meal. The cashier (Bryson) was particularly helpful. A meal is always just a bit better when the employees seem to be enjoying their job. 
I ordered the Baja Combo plate. A burrito, a fish taco and beans/chips side. This location seems to be a notch better at the size of the burrito. I generally substitute black beans for both the side and on the burrito. It was as tasty as always, but I find I need to add some of their salsa to add to the general flavor.
As a side note, Rubios picante salsa is terrible, however all of the other fresh made salad are enjoyable. 
I came with a friend, and the food was more than enough to split for lunch. Its location is convenient for parking, but it is busy and can take a few minutes to get the fresh made food.
