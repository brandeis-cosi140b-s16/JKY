There was a time when Baja Fresh was a sure bet for a 5-star rating from me -- and I know several other people who would agree.  Unfortunately, since it was bought out by Wendy's several years ago, the quality has deteriorated.  The upside is that now you can find Baja Fresh all over the country.  The downside is that it's only like it used to be about 1/3 of the time.

Recommendations:  Baja burrito w/ steak, pronto guacamole, and salsa baja.
