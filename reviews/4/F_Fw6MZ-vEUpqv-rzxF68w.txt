Service:
I absolutely love Chipolte and I almost never have a problem with them or their service. They are very fast and efficient and obviously have been trained well. Also they will cater to you. I always get an extra burrito and both beans and fajitas.

Food:
I am super glad they are now offering sofritias (tofu) for us veg heads! Before it was either meat or get a burrito with just veggies. They food always taste spot on. The only problem I have is when you bite into the burrito sometimes it's just a gob of sour cream, others it's just a dry rice bed. 

Location: I am particularly fond of this location due to the elevated entrance, which allows for outside seating. The parking is somewhat funky as its on a slanted hill, but there's always room.
