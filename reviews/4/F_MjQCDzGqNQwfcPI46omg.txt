The food is great here particularly the pork carnita tacos. The taste is oh so good. I had noticed they were real skimpy on the meat our last visit. The man in front of me obviously it was his 1st time there. Wasn't too sure what was what and staff was not very helpful or friendly. The girl helping us was in training she also didn't know much about the menu. His burrito was unbelievable small almost all rice. They had to throw stuff away because they didn't quit explain the pico was the only form of tomatoes they had. The cashier should have probably been helping out the line which was backed up. Ran out of green sauce it was 2:30 in the afternoon on a Friday... Were they making more? I say work on your customer service more, clean up the tables so people can sit and eat. I've been there 3 times 3 Fridays in a row same kid is on break every time while tables are not wiped down for customers. Like I said I love the food I just hope the service gets better.
