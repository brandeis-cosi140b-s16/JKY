We looked around for a bit in Scottsdale, and finally stopped in here. The outdoor seating is lovely, and we couldn't have been happier with the food. I highly recommend the enchilada!! It is great with either green or red sauce! The only down side was that the pico de gallo in my tostada was a bit moldy, but they made another one, and took it off the bill! Great experience.
