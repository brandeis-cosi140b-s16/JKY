First Impression:
Ordering a burrito involves deciding between two different sizes of burros? Reg and XL. I went with the regular on account of my personal mission to fight the obesity epidemic, one bite, one burrito at a time. Turns out I was siding with the models on this one, and not those Dove approves. The burrito regular is on the small side, and costs $5.99. I suppose it is intended to lighten my figure and my wallet, simultaneously. Regarding carne asada -- it is indeed legit, there is a lot of flavor packed into the tiny tortilla. Lots of flavor, just the right amount of juice, some fresh onions lightly grilled (also inside), and a side of salsa. The hot salsa, is not spicy, but it has good flavor.

On my second visit I came by on a Sunday morning to try the breakfast burrito. There was a daily special and the XL size cost only $4.50. Filled with chorizo, eggs, beans and cheese and accompanied with a side of salsa, it turned out to be 3/5 stars. The chorizo was mild, not the kind that would show up at your Grandma's house for breakfast if you were from Douglas, AZ. I found out that the XL size is really a normal people size burrito. I wonder if this taco shop is catering to ASU sorority girls. 

They get get 4 stars for dynamite flavor on the carne.
