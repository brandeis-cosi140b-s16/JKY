Best tortas in the area, period.  Miles better (and cheaper) than the much-fanfared El Guero, which is super overrated anyhow.  Tasty, chewy rolls, freshly grilled ingredients.  For filings, there's a pretty extensive selection - somewhere around 15, if memory serves - from simple staples to stacked monstrosities of delicious goodness.

 My favorite is the Ranchera Especial - carne asada with a simple chipotle sauce.  The bigger guys are pretty good, too, and are no joke.  I come here at least 2-3 times a month for work lunches, and nobody has ever been disappointed.

Never ordered anything non-torta related, but they do have a full menu, including huaraches and various other non-standard but good Mexican items.

Atmosphere-wise, the place is nice.  Clean, bring colors, friendly-but-not-overbearing staff.  There's usually a soccer game or Spanish-language day-time talk shows on whenever I'm in.
