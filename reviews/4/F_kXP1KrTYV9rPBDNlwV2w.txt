Finally got to try Costa Vida tonight and glad we did!  Fresh and flavorful meats and options.  Not a Filibertos but not a real sit-down either.  Some interesting menu items make it different enough to fill the gap and be another good Mexican option in the area!  The Honey Habenero salsa is really quite good too!
