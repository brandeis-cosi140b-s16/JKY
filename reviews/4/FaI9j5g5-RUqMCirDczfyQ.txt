If you love Mexican baked goods, you NEED to check this place out! The only non-spectacular thing was waiting a couple of minutes to be helped. However, once I was helped, the man was friendly and extremely helpful. I bought some pan de huevo and apple empanadas. Fresh and made right in front of you! The price and baked goods cannot be beat!
