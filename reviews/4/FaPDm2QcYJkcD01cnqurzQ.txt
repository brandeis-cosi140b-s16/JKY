Pretty darn tasty tacos....
I like that the tortilla is fried on one side so the inside has a light crispy butter covering.... Fattening but a yummy added element to your taco experience.
The creamy sauce they put on the shrimp taco is Yummers and the steak is soft and tender. I really liked the shrimp and steak tacos!!!
The chips & beans are pretty standard.
There is a salsa bar but none of the salsa's are really outstanding to me...
The food however was yummy....
