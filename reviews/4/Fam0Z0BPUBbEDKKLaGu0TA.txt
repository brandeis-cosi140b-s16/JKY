The salsa here is so flavorful. 

I say order a burrito or anything that comes with red or green chili. Neither is too spicy, both are delicious.

-Gollo Burro: flour tortilla filled with green chili, whole pinto beans, onions, cheese topped, melted butter. I usually order it without butter just to spare the extra calories and it's just as delicious.

-Charro Completo: flour tortilla filled with red chili, green chili, refried beans, onions and cheese. 

-bean and cheese burrito enchilada style, yum!!

Everyone here is friendly. Four stars because sometimes the service is a little bit on the slower side. But the food makes it worth the wait!
