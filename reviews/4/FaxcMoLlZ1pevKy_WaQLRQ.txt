The Valley of the Sun has it's prevalance of *Bertos taco joints--Filebertos, Humbertos, Rolibertos, etc. Way out in FH, the open late (til 3 am on weekends) and thought it's slipped over the years, there is no better deal in FH. Generally good to go with the Shrimp Burrito (even better enchilada style if you can handle that). Most of the rest of the menu is good, thought I was disappointed to find ham rather than chorizo  on a breakfast burrito.
