First off there place was very nice from the outside and looked upscale. The booth seemed a little tight but it was manageable. Def the first time I ordered in English in a Mexican restaurant so that was an experience. Both my gf and I got fajitas and it was pretty good and reasonably priced. I ordered the horchata and it was very good. I have had more authentic experiences but I'd recommend this place for someone trying something different.
