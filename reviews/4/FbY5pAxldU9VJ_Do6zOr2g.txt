Always been a fan of On the Border!  Their chips and salsa are like crack... it's hard to stop once you start snacking on them while waiting on your main order.

Some of my co-workers used to frequent this location a lot since its close to the office, but I have started to bring my lunch more.  We do our large group get-together lunches here and it's fairly reasonable in price.

I'm a big sucker for tex-mex food anyways so On the Border is always in my list of options when considering going out to eat for lunch (when I don't bring my lunch).  Their lunch pick 2 combo is a favorite of mine.  Get a ton of food for a decent price and you can mix it up so it's hard not to get bored with this restaurant!

The only drawback to this location is during big races, it's really hard to get in and out of the Concord Mills/Speedway Blvd area.  One time we were there for lunch and our server said to "stay away" for the race that coming weekend.  I thought it was funny, but she was just trying to save us from the hair-ripping, frustrating traffic jam situations that the races cause in the area.
