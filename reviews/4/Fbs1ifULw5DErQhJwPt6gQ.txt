Gringo mexican at its' finest. 85 bucks fed six people with leftovers. My mom and I got takeout (so we could eat at our hotel- we're bad tourists), and when our food came out, the bartender carried our food out (!!). I've never had anyone offert that in Seattle. Maybe if more restaurants offered to carry out super large orders like that, I would love them more (or I'm just eating @ the wrong places). I didn't know it was a chain. Pretty predictable in terms of what you get- beans, rice, cheese, sour cream- but it still tasted better than Seattle Mexican.
