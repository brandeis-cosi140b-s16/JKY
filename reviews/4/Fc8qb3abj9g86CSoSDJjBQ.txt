Been here three times. Owner has been there each time and was very nice. The food was pretty good and very inexpensive. The place is a combo of counter ordering or they will take your order at the table [maybe depending upon how busy they are - but there has only been few people when I have been there]. If you are looking for a sit-down mexican food place, this won't really serve your needs. But if you don't care and just want some good inexpensive food, you can do worse.
