If only this place wasn't on the wrong side of security, I'd consider going over to the airport for dinner more often.  That's how good this place is.  Carnitas tacos are delicious, staff is friendly and prompt, and they have conveniently provided outlets all over the place for charging your devices while you wait for your flight.
