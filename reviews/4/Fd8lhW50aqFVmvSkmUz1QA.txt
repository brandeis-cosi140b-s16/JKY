Good solid  nouveau Mexican food with a Sonoran / Baja bend.. The prices are on the high end for the quality of food... This is Mexican food and Arizona.. The price point ought to be $10.00 per person plus Drinks and extras. My advice.. You'll love this place.. But only as well as a really authentic Mexican food Downtown or on Central.. You'll get more bang for your buck at some place like Los Dos Molinos.. I like their South Central Location
