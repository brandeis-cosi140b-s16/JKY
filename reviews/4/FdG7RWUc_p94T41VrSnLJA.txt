Don't let the long lines discourage you from coming to Chipotle. The staff works fast and the food is plentiful and served at the right temperature. The staff is also nice and you don't have to repeat yourself when placing your order. 

On this particular day, I had chicken tacos. They were absolutely yum. Everything is made to your specifications so if something isn't right, it's probably your fault! :) My husband loves the burritos. Now while the girl making his over did it with the salsa, it was still pretty darn yum...and why was it yum? Because it was made the way he likes it. :) 

The one thing I like a lot at Chipotle is the guacamole. It is so flavorful and I love chunky guacamole. They do it just right here at Chipotle.
