We were in the area after shopping at Lowe's and ordered take out. 
We ordered 2 breakfast burritos, 3 taco plate, and a taco salad for the family and it was delicious! All the food was fresh, hot, and very authentic.

The place is very causal and I think very reasonably priced. You shouldn't come here to expect fine dining, but you definitely visit for the food.

This is our go-to place in SE Gilbert area for Mexican take-out... keep up the great work!
