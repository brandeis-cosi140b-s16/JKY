Delicious tacos and burritos horrible service and atmosphere about sums up this establishment. If the big scary guy is there watch how you order and how you remark about the food or you'll be barred for life like most of my family have been over the years. We have been going to the original house Ritos downtown for the past 25+ years. 

The crunchy hardshell shredded beef taco is probably the best you can get in the Phoenix area. All in all this place is worth. Even though the prices are kind of high considering what you get.
