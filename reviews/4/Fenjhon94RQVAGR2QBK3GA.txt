I love Chipotle! We don't have any here in Canada and I always make a point of eating here when in Vegas. They have a great location in between Harrahs and Casino Royale. I love it when you can order fast food with somewhat healthy choices. I always have the chicken bowl with brown rice, black beans, peppers, onions, lettuce, and medium salsa...yummy. it's usually pretty busy and the seating sucks, but its fast food!
