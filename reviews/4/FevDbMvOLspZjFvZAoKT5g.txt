I have a stomachache, for GOOD reasons, not bad.  I was enjoying myself so much here that I overate.  Did I catch Pancho's at a good time, or are my standards just different that those of the other people who have been to this place?

Check my review of Valle Luna for my list of the five types of Mexican Restaurant.  This one classifies as a Type D: Chain-type sit-down restaurant.  Poncho's is more unusual because it's a buffet.

They were almost empty when we visited on Sunday night.  Service was very friendly, and the food tasted great.  No, it wasn't gourmet by any standard, but I went there expecting a Mexican buffet and was quite pleased.  I never saw a cheese enchilada with cheese both outside and inside before--it was almost a mac 'n' cheese-style enchilada.  Rice and beans were actually better than a lot of places I've visited.  Pretty authentic style.  Chips and salsa were so good I ate WAY to many of them, and the sopapillas were primo.

The price was rock-bottom, and just incredible for all you can eat food.  Great for kids (and the price is lower for them too).  Sorry, but I can't connect with the plethora of one and two-star reviews that dominate Pancho's board here on Yelp.  Yes, I think that if this place were crowded and packed to the gills with kids, it would have been a less pleasurable experience, but as it was, I enjoyed every bite.

Thanks Pancho's--I raise my cup and the flag to you.  Some appear to despise you, but I do not count in that number.  We'll be back.
