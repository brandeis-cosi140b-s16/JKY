I need to get here more often. They've added some things to the menu but I keep ordering the same thing because I don't go here enough. My go-to is the Tacos Marco Polo with shrimp, jalapeno, and bacon. The table-side guacamole is delish. Next time I'll try the guac sampler. They've also added a family style option for at least two people that we will try next time around.
