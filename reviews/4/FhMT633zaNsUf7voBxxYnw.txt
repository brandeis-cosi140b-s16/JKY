Sometimes you just don't want to cook something so you skip the fuss and go out. Cabo is on our short list of places to go for such occasions. Last night we went back and were treated to more of the same great service and great food that we've become accustomed to. Our server, Daniel flat knows how to move things along and once again he took great care of us. I didn't have to ask for refills on my drink, and the other server helping him had an extra bowl of chips on the table before I even started to get up to head to the salsa bar for more. It's the little things. They make a huge difference. And with a 2 year old along when making the tableside guacamole he didn't just assume what ingredients should be left out. He asked. That was appreciated. 

In short, another solid 4 star experience. It's not 5 stars, but sometimes you don't want 5 stars, you want consistent 4 star, rock solid food and a hassle free experience. Cabo delivers that for us. 

One tip: On the AYCE tacos, be aware of the restrictions. No sharing, no doggie bags, batteries not included. Oops, scratch the last one. Still we ordered the non AYCE tacos. Only was able to eat 2 anyway. Just thought I'd share that unless listening to a lengthy disclaimer is something you enjoy. In that case order away. It just means I have time to get to the salsa bar before you do! 

One last thing: The mobile app should show more check-ins, not sure what is up with that.
