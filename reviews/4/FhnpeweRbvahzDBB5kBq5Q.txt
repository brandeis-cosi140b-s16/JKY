I work nearby and didn't even know this place existed until a co-worker pointed it out to me yesterday and asked if I had been there. I'm glad he did because this place is a pretty nice lunch spot. Service is fast here and were continuously receiving refills on water, chips and salsa during our meal. I wasn't sure what to get and opted for a supreme carnitas burrito w/ green sauce. It was a ton larger than what I was expecting and was very filling, as they were generous with the meat, beans and rice inside the burrito. The carnitas pork was chopped and moist, which I liked...some places do carnitas shredded or fried, which I don't like as much. Will definitely be keeping this place in mind in the future when going out to lunch near the office.
