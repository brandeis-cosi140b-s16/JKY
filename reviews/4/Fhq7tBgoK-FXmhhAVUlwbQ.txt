I came here for lunch with some coworkers. The service was good, as my drink was always refilled timely. The chips and salsa likewise. However, the salsa was a bit bland. It lacked flavor and heat. For my meal, I ordered the tamales (one beef and one pork). It came with a side of rice and beans, which is standard for any sit down Mexican restaurant. The tamales were extra cheesy on top. A definite plus in my book. The meats were tender and delicious. The portion size was ample. Overall, a solid restaurant.
