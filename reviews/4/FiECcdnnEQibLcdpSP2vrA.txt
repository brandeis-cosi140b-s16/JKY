My husband found this place and liked it so much he ate here 4 times in one week.  I ate there twice with him.

Chips and salsa are good.

Iced tea is not fresh brewed so the second time I just stuck with water.

First trip I ate the cheese enchiladas.  They were not that good but the refried beans were the best I have ever had.  YUM!  I like the way the cheese was under the beans so it stayed hot and melted.

Second trip I got a bean and cheese burrito.  The BEST!  I also got a side of guacamole that was really good!

My husband enjoys the carne asada tacos and the shrimp tacos.  He also likes the rice.

Stuff yourself and leave for less than $10 per person.
