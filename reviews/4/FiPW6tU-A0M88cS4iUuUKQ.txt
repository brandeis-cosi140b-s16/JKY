In the past I have oscillated between a "chicken tostada" and "chicken fajitas".  One time desiring a chicken salad with guacamole and another time pipping hot chicken and fixings to stuff in the tiny tortillas. Not exactly thinking out of the box but for the first time I spotted the table side "chicken fajita salad".  The decision combines my preferred ingredients with presumably  fewer calories - hot chicken and tossed salad with a mild dressing.  

Good choice I must say plus the "necessary" Dos XX lager & water...
