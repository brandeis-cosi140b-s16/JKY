My review is solely for the nightlife/dancing.  I haven't had any of the food or mixed drinks, just beer and dancing. Living in Cave Creek, Old Town seems way too far away in general and certainly way too expensive of a cab ride away. Going out and dancing to music that isn't country music seems to be limited to either the Blue Martini or here (if I'm wrong, some one please tell me!). Sure the dance floor isn't big and sure not a ton of people get out and dance, but the DJs have always been good enough and I've always had a good time. I'm from California so I like the bar vibe (wannabe beach bar). The parking lot is giant so it's nice to not have an issue with that too.
