Honestly I wasn't really expecting to find anything special in Las Vegas but was taken here at the recommendation of a friend who lived here. Let me just say that the flour tortillas I had were some of the best I have ever had and that's also compared to when I lived in Tucson. They hand make their tortillas in the restaurant and I definitely could taste the freshness. The chips and salsa were okay but on the plus side they made the guacamole from scratch at the table.  However, be warned, the hot salsa is HOT. I think they may use habanero peppers because it had a  really slow intense burn that just lasted and had me tearing up a bit.. 

For my meal I got the pollo patron which had an unique flavor being that it was marinated in a variety of chiles and other spices. The portion was huge and definitely worth the price. When I do return to Las Vegas and want good Mexican food, I'll make sure to stop here. One caveat my friend shared with me. If you're looking for "Americanized" Mexican food, there are other places that are better but this is the place to go to for the more authentic plates that you can't get at Chile's or some other place like that.
