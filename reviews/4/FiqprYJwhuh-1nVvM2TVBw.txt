We were staying at a hotel in the area and for some reason we were told that Z'Tejas was not the best. I am so glad that we did not follow that recommendation, we ended up eating here and the food was absolutely incredible. The blackened catfish tacos were amazing and the shrimp and guac bites were absolutely incredible, those two were my favorites but honestly everything that we ordered was fantastic. The hard time margaritas were great and the ambience of the place was good with water fountains and misters on the patio that made dining on a hot evening comfortable. The wait staff was good except for our actual server who was too busy holding up the walls to take care of my family. Luckily the other servers carried her and the food more than made up for it. The only thing that kept me from 5 stars was the server, but the food is really worth 6 stars.
