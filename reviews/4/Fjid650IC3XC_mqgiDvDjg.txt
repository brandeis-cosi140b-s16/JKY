OK...I know this is a chain.  I try to steer away from chains most of the time.  In this case we had an appointment nearby, and it was incredibly convenient.  Plus sometimes you want simple food.  OK...enough justification...

We find this better than KFC.  The marinade they use is subtle but flavorful.  The chicken at this location was no exception. The beans are ordinary pinto beans.  At least they aren't that refried muck.  The rice is very lightly seasoned, not what I would call Mexican rice despite its color.  However, adding a bit of pico de gallo to both makes them better.

We ordered a "three course meal".  This included soup and a dessert.  The soup was fine (again, add some salsa to jazz it up a bit).  The dessert was supposed to be chocolate churros.  But the manager was very accommodating. She let us swap out the churros for a brownie.  That's good customer service.  The brownie was pretty dry (so I wouldn't recommend it), but I give credit for the customer service.  I have to round UP my rating instead of rounding down.  So instead of 3.5 stars I have to go to four.  

Understand that is for the sort of place this is.  I'm not comparing to Kona Grill.  This is a fast food chicken place.  It's not fair to rate them against Vintage 95.  

Also, the place was clean (dining room...I didn't check the restroom).
