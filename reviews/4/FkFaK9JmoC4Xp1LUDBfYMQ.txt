This place is surprisingly good. It is not cheap nasty tummy ache diarrhea hard meat Mexican food. The food is clean and tasty. Also authentic.

I get the same thing every time mostly. Soft Asada taco. Now I'm starting to get the hard Asada tacos, THEY ARE SOO GOOD! The taco shells are delicious! I never get guacamole, never. I always ask for lemons. I also get the quesadilla with light cheese. They are also surprisingly good! This restaurant is a hidden secret and the employees are nice for the most part. 

And don't forget to get a Jarritos Tamarind to drink!!!!!!!!
