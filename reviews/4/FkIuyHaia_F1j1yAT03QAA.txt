There's some caveats to this 4 star review so let's air them out. I'm a californian and burritos are an incredibly vital part of my diet. Johnny burrito does not make burritos that would compare to any actual taquerias at home, or in charlotte for that matter.

Still as a workday lunch that doesn't allow for a drive up N Tryon to to Plaza Midwood, Johnny Burrito can still hit the spot. The staff is also super nice and it's great they don't nickel and dime you for guac and the like. 

Authentic, no. Good workday lunch? Sure.
