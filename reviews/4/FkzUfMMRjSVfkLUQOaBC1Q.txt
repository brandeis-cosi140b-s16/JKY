I have been coming to tacos el compita for about 7 years, most of the time my husband runs into order our food. I absolutely LOVE this place. No other place has the flavor in there food like el compita. I've never had a problem coming here. They also always have peppers limes and sauce  out makes me happy, I don't have to ask for it. The decor needs work. But the food is so yummy.
