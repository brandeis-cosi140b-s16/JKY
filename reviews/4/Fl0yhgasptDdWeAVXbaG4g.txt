It's a small place but this little blue and white seafood eatery is easy to spot. Because of the space limitation, the dining area is a tad cramped. But the staff is friendly and the seafood is really, really fresh! I consider the prices to be moderate because, while not exactly inexpensive, they're pretty good considering the quality, flavor, and freshness of the seafood.
