I like this place for a few reasons. First and foremost are the Margaritas and Sangria. They are fan-flippin-tastic! I have my priorities people. 
Next, the salmon and Gaucho steak dish are perfection. They serve the salmon with an asparagus slaw(cold). If you are sitting near me I will eat it right off your plate, good stuff! Watch out. 
And last but not least is that it so close to my house. Easy to go out for happy hour drinks during the busy weekdays. They have a patio that is a nice size but I think it could use some more decor and maybe better seating. When I say better, I mean more comfortable. Once you sit in any of the bar area(indoors) tables you will know what I'm talking about. They often have a live music as well. 
I have also had the chicken tortilla soup, no bueno. Served in a red broth made it.......weird. Sorry I don't have a better word right now. 

The only reason I didn't go all out on the stars is because it is such a new place. In it's delicate infancy, I don't want to put the stamp of greatness too soon. It would be like saying that your baby is a genius before giving it and IQ test. Let the testing begin!!!!!
