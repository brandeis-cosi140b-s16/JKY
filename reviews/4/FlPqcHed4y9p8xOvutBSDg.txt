This place is better, the beans are made with oil and are just delicious. The rice was moist and flavorful, not to mention the awesome salsa bar they have going on inside. The specials are marked on a board by the counter as you come in. I remember when we used to sneak in burritos in the Harkins Theater just across the way. This is one of the better fast food Mexican restaurants to get you late night fix and they are open 24 hours...
