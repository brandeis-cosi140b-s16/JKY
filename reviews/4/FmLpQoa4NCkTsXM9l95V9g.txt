This place is worth it for their Mexican-style Friday fish fry special. I usually don't like very bready batter, so I thought I was taking a bit of a risk when the menu said "beer battered." But, I was really in the mood for fish and Casa de Lara pulled through. Crispy, fragrant, fresh, under $12, and lasted me two meals. Also came with fresh avocado, tots (?!), and well-seasoned rice and black beans.

To round it all up, their salsa and chip basket was fresh and refillable. Their Jose Cuervo 32 oz margarita pitcher special for $14.50 was strong enough for three people to responsibly enjoy and two people to less-responsibly enjoy. 

I'm almost glad I have to be on State St. every Friday now that I know this option exists. Al menos los viernes, la Casa de Lara es mi casa.
