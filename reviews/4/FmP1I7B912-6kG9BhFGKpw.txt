I am a huge fan of mole sauce and Maria Bonita did not disappoint. The chips and salsa were above average, and the guacamole was great. The food portion was generous, but the quality of food was superb. The staircase in the middle of the restaurant is definitely awkward, and the bar seems to be more like the management business/paperwork area, making it undesirable to sit there. The waitress was very good and on point. I will definitely be going back!
