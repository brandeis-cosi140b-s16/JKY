Erika and Nikki were such great hosts. Tijuana flats held a yelp event for us tonight and it turned out great! The food was so fresh and yummy. Chicken flautas were my favorite. They have the biggest selection of hot sauces I've ever seen!!!!! This place is brand new and right across from the hospital in the university area! Great for college students, reasonably priced and super fun and clean atmosphere! Take 85 to Harris blvd, it's tucked down in a shopping center! If you like Mexican it's a step above moes  little patio if the weather isn't as hot as it's been! Ahhh just wait for fall!  get your booty into Tijuana's you'll be happy you came. It's quick and tasty and the staff is sook friendly
