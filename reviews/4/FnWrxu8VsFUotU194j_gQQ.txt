We have visited the Border Grill every time we have come to Vegas.  It's a great spot with great food. 

On this trip we had carne asada tacos and Yucatan pork tacos.  

The carne asada was well marinated. It's not a small meal. 

The Yucatan pork tacos were sweet and the tortillas were stuffed with black beans and added a good balance to the sweet meat. 

Definitely going back in our next trip.
