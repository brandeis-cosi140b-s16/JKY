Canteen is a great place for happy hour and to meet up with a large group of friends! They have an awesome large patio with a bar outside that makes it great to enjoy the weather at night. You can't go wrong with their margaritas, guacamole, and chips! You can come here for a happy hour on a Friday night, end up staying way later than you thought, and dance on the dance floor. They have an awesome dj that plays top 40 music! It's a great place to enjoy your friends and many drinks!
