Very unique Mexican joint. I have really fallen in love with the veggie fajitas but even more so the atmosphere. Great drink specials all day long and I've never had to wait for a table even though they can sometimes get packed. I also rate the chips and salsa at all Mexican restaurants and this place is bomb diggity.
