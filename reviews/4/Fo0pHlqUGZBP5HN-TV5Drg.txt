If my fiance were writing this review, she'd automatically give it 5 stars bc she's obsessed with their carne asada burro (i will admit it's damn decent)! We come here mostly for breakfast because I wake up every monday craving the macheca and egg burro! Two burros, chips and salsa, and a large pepsi comes out to about $10... which you really can't beat for how big they are!

This place isn't fancy, but their food speaks for itself. It gets really busy right around lunch hour because they're very popular with the downtown work crowd!
