Seeing as how I was staying at PH it was only right I came here. Granted I didn't dine here, but I sure did use the walk up bar to get some yummy drinks. I got a mix, of what I really dont remember because I drank so much out there, lol, but it was strawberry and reg margaritas i think mixed in the tall 12 dollar glass. With an extra shot of course. Yes. I know. 12 bucks. for a drink. + a few more bucks for a shot. How stupid, right? Wrong. I'm an out of towner, typical tourist, taking in the sights and Cabo Wabo was actually one of my fav places to drink on the strip. Prob because of the convenience of coming downstairs in the middle of the night getting an alcoholic beverage. Either way, by the time my week long vegas trip was over I brought home about a good 4 Cabo Wabo cups. Looking forward to doing it all over again when I come back in October. I'll give a better review then since my Vegas cherry has been popped.
