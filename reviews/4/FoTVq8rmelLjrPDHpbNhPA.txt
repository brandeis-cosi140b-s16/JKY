WHERE: Charleston & a little passed Maryland (toward the East).

WHEN: I believe it's open until 3 or 4am. If you land there within that time frame, be sure to call them and ask beforehand! Please and thanks =).

WHY: Tacos, tacos, and more TACOS!

WHAT: While at work, my co-workers and I were talking about how hungry we were! One of my co's mentioned that she went with another co to a Mexican spot the other night, and also mentioned how delicious it was! I automatically hopped on that conversation and asked what this wonderful place could be!

Then and there, I felt like I was deprived of life because I haven't really tried a real Mexican spot besides Roberto's Tacos (don't get me wrong, I love late night cravings and journeys to Roberto's, but I have found another spot to satisfy these random cravings). So, after all this talking, we decided to take ACTION and eat there after our shifts!

This was a really different environment!! When I walked in with my co's, it was packed! There is an Order station where you order the types of taco's you would like. Tacos are 2 bucks each- totally worth it!

I tried:
Cabeza taco (beef head): First timer, but it was way good!
Adobada taco (marinated pork): I have never had adobada anything, and I have come to find that adobada should be in EVERYTHING! lol.
Asada taco (steak): I love carne asada, so this is a no-brainer! DELICIOUS!
Adobada fries: I ordered a box to take to-go for my family! I had to take a bite out of it too, and it made me fall in love with Mexican food!

I'd love to try other things! This taco shop is way FLAVORFUL, FUN, AND OPEN UNTIL 4AM! Ch ch check it out!
