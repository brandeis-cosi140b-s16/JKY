I've been to Padre's several times with local friends and have always enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  This time my table mates included my brother and sister-in-law who were visiting from the east coast.  And who do they always count on for recommending awesome places to eat while in town?  Yup...me.  The pressure was on.  From the opening appetizers of guacamole, salsa, chips, and margaritas to our main dishes, the food was great.  The staff was extremely friendly, including our waiter Chico who kept us laughing.  I am normally a Salmon Spinach Enchiladas guy but decided to go out of my comfort zone with the West Coast Burrito.  Strange combination but it really works well together.  And what did my out-of-town guests think about Padre's?  Loved it.
