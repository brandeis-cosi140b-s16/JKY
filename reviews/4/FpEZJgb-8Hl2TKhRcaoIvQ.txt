Tonight we visited El Burrito with my husband and another couple. It looked really dark and empty from the outside, but inside was bright and the booths on the parameter were full. Decor is simple and restaurant is smallish. We got seated in a clean roomy booth by the kitchen.

The chips served are warm and thick and crunchy, and the salsa fresh and full of chopped tomatoes, and of a medium heat. Very tasty!

Ordered the soup- friends agree while very good, it was rather strange. It's beef based macaroni soup with cilantro and they add a whole pile of cheese on the bottom. Watching them eat it was like watching them eat pizza- cheese strings!

I ordered huevos rancheros, and they were pretty good, a bit watery somehow but the flavor was there with the beans so I'd get them again. Friends got the fajita salad and the beef chimichanga and the portions were  huge! The chimichanga beef was perfect, medium rare and tender. She asked for some pico de gallo and the waitress said they didn't have any but would be happy to make some. It came out fresh, spicy and full of cilantro. The salad was stuffed to the brim with veggies and the marinated chicken was tender. Husband asked for a pork tamale/taco combo not on the menu and they made it without hesitation. He says it was amazeballs... And the tamale was awesome and not dry. Getting a description from him is like puling teeth, so husband, one star.

Overall the service was a fast and friendly and the food was all enjoyable. It seems like a place you can frequent and they will get to know you. A quality locals joint for an easy and tasty weeknight meal out at a reasonable price.

Group consensus was 3.5 stars, but I rounded up because of the friendly local atmosphere. If you come here with the right expectations you will leave here with a full belly and a smile.
