Always great... always fast... beware the hispanic woman with longer brown hair... she looks like she has an attitude before you even talk to her. She "forgot" to put my phone order in and I had to sit for 15 minutes while I watched walk in customers get their food before me... upset?? YOU BETCHA!!! Besides her the rest of the employees are amazing and friendly.

Try that bacon shrimp burrito... HEAVEN!!!
