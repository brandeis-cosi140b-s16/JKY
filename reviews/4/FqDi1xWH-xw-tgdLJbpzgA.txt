-The staff is really nice. 
-The facilities are clean. There's free wifi! And it's open 24 hours!
-The food is standard Wahoo's fare, so take that for what you want. I'm personally not the biggest fan of Wahoo's because hailing from SoCal, there are many other joints I'd rather go to for fish tacos. But this Wahoo's is fine for what it's supposed to be. 

I ordered a green enchilada with shrimp and a red enchilada with carne asada ($2.99 each) and onion rings (~$4-5). The enchiladas were really good, especially the shrimp with the green sauce. I wouldn't order the onion rings again. They're greasy, and the batter isn't good. 

I'd come back because 24 hr + wifi + clean + nice staff = win win.
