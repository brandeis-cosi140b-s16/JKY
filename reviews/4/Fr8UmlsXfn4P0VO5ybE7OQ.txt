Good tofu burritos are hard to come by in Champaign-Urbana. In fact, the Cactus Grill offers the only one I know of at a restaurant in town ... with some nicely grilled veggies. It's an independent, tasty burrito joint in Champaign, IL, so of course it's not quite what you might find in Arizona or California or whatever -- but the food is good and the folks behind the counter know how to use a tortilla.
