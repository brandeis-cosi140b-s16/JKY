Love the decor at the Monroe St location. The fish tacos are amazing, so much so that that's all I've ever gotten there so I can't speak to any other entrees. The queso dip was meh, chips and salsa are great but they charge you for those, which I have never ever seen at a Mexican place. Margaritas are great there but as someone already mentioned, they are really strong. Will go (and have gone) back.
