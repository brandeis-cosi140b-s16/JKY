Sabor is unique and delicious! I would highly recommend the scallops and anything with mole. I don't care for mole sauce but this chef's mole is amazing. They have a good happy hour from 4-7. The margaritas are great because their sweet n sour is tasty without the abundance of sugary syrup. Plus, the service is always friendly:)
