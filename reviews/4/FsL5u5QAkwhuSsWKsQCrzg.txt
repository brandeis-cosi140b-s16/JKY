I've being going to Serrano's for years and I've never had a problem with their food. They serve all of the traditional Mexican dishes that you would find at any Mexican restaurant. I've tried a lot of their menu items but I'd have to say my favorite go to plate is the shredded beef or "machaca" chimichanga. It is especially good when you get it enchilada style which is smothered in red sauce. It comes with a helpful serving of rice and beans too. 
What I really like about Serrano's is that they are one of the few Mexican restaurants in the valley that still serves free chips with not only salsa but bean dip as well.
