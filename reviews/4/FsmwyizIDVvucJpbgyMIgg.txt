Got lucky coming here, It was just before the rush of tourist.  This place really does make you feel like a tourist though, whether that is a good thing or bad thing is your choice.  I will have to say the quality of food was better than expected, I got the chili and cheese crisp.  I hear the chili can go either way of agreeing or disagreeing with your stomach, but I got lucky here.  The sarsaparilla was especially refreshing I must say.

All in all, good place when you are in the mountains, but if you hate tourist, run away.
