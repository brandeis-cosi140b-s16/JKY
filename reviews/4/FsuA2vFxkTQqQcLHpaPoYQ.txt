I've been going to this Rubio's for about 4 years now and it's a great place to get lunch. They are quick and really nice. I do wish they wouldn't have gotten rid of the sliced jalapenos though, it a huge pain to use their forks and knifes and cut up the whole ones and they don't fit in the to-go containers.
