Hadn't eaten at a Top Shelf for several years. Happened upon this one and I'm glad I did.

Starting with the chips and salsa, they were both fresh and tasty. My waiter, Dave, was very helpful and quick. The food (chicken tacos with beans and rice) were also fresh and very good.

Maybe not the best ever place for Mexican food, but it certainly is well above average. Good prices for the portions, too.
