Tasty burritos on the way back to my apartment? Yes please! I always go with the carnitas burrito because it's made just the way I prefer it: tender, braised pork with a seared/crispy outside. Friendly service and decent prices (~$8 for a fairly sized burrito that fills me up) in addition to a consistently tasty burrito are what keep me coming back for more. And more. And more.
