Of course, my boyfriend and I wanted the lava bowl.  Nothing sounded more delicious than fresh-tasting octopus, shrimp, fish, and mussels in a cheesy, creamy sauce.  In a lava bowl.

Our molcajete arrived hot and bubbling, and after a few bites, kicked in with a burn-your-lips-off hot spice that I couldn't love more.  It's more than enough to split, so keep that in mind when looking at the (somewhat-higher-than-typical-Mexican-fare) prices.

Tortillas tasted fresh, the guac was solid, and chips were the crispy, oily, delicious kind I adore.  The on-table salsa is kickin' and delicious.  What San Diego Bay lacks in ambiance, they more than make up for with flavor.

And really, what more do you want from a Mexican restaurant?  A bucket of Coronas for $12??

San Diego Bay's got you covered all around.
