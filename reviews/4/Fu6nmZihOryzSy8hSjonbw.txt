What a cute little place in Old Town!  We went on a Sunday during football season, so there were a bunch of food and drink specials.  Their margaritas were good as well as the food.  The servers were friendly and attentive.  We don't get into Scottsdale all too often, but we'll definitely stop back in this place!
