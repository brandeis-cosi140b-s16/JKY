I always just do a veggie burrito and it's great. They have a large selection of meats as well but their black beans are really good. 

All of their veggies and add ins are fresh and plentiful. You can also get a "burrito" salad if you don't want the tortilla. 

Also don't be scared if you see a long line. They move everybody along pretty quickly and you'll be out of there fast. 

Finally be sure to check out their selection of bottled colas and drinks. Try the Uncle Scott's root beer if they have it. 

When they have tamales they are worth a try as well. Not the best I've ever had but there aren't many places to get tamales in Charlotte much less uptown Charlotte.
