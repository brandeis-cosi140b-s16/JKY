So Sat. night rolls around and this mom wanted to go out to eat instead of cooking and doing dishes. We decided to give Super Mex (the South Durango location) a try and we were kinda delighted and surprised all at the same time. The food and margarita quality is what pleased us the most. The food was tasty. I tried an item from their "Lite" menu, a soft chicken taco with green rice and beans, not refried, but a healthier version, and it was delish. My guy had the chicken enchilda, also from the "Lite" menu and he enjoyed his plate also. Actually he cleaned his plate and their was nothing left. The margaritas where good, and at $5.50/$5.75 each, who can complain. We even ordered a second round because they were that well priced. Overall we will be returning to Super Mex when we are craving Mexican food. Service was good, but not great. Give them a try if u can. Great for families, as we took our 16 month old with us and he enjoyed the complimentary bean dip and chips :)
