What they lack in seating and credit card acceptance they make up for in flavors and textures.

Thursdays are Chile rellno special days, for $5.45 you get a chillie rellno, beans, rice, tortilla  and a small drink. A real steal but the value goes way up when you try the food as the flavors are great, rich thick red sauce, a firm texture to the rellno and rice that goes very well with their hot sauce.

Note in summer it may not be great as there is ONLY outdoor seating and waiting, and they are Cash only.
