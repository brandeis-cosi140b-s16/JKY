If you haven't been to Robertos, you must live on mars!  lol  Yes, I love this place, I love there Taquitos....Thats what we use to call them back in the day, but they call them rolled tacos!  What ever!  I love them!  Robertos have stepped up there game as well, with there beans, these beans are off the chain, they have so much flavor!  

Ok....Sooooooo We were getting ready to order...you know how you go over to there veggie bar, and get your onions and peppers?  Ok, check this out, this family's order came up,and they had a plate of grilled green onions and peppers!  Did ya'll hear me!  I had to ask, where is that on the menu, and what is it called!  She said something in spanish, I can't tell ya'll what she said!  I did understand that she said it was free! SAY WHAT!  OMG,  I wanted that asap! I wanted to sink my teeth into that pepper in the car, but I held back until I got home!  If you love Robertos, get the grilled green onions and peppers!
