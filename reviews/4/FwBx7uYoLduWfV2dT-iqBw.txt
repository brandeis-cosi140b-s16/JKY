I think I'm addicted!  Their chicken is bomb and made fresh to order!  This place is like my go-to place for a healthy dinner after a good workout.  I like to order a 2 pc. leg and thigh meal with corn tortilla, a corn on the cob side, and some pinto or black beans.  Everything is good, including their hot sides. Everything tastes fresh and they have all kinds of sauces. But my favorites are the pico di gallo, and the avocado green sauce.  Yum!
