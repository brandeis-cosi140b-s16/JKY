Love Pasqual's! We go here at least once a week. The margs are great but pricey and the food is always amazing. One of my favorite things is that we never wait for a seat, even when other restaurants tell us it's going to be an hour, we get seated right away at Pasqual's. The wait staff is great too - I am so sick of getting terrible service in Madison at other places, but the staff at Pasqual's is always prompt and attentive. The food is good, typical Tex-Mex, but it is always consistent and that's super important to me. I get cravings for this place whenever I'm in the Midvale vicinity! :)

My only complaint - I wish you were serving dinner until 10 p.m..... we went just after 9 one time and only the bar was open. I just wish we still had you as an option on those nights I have to stay at work late.
