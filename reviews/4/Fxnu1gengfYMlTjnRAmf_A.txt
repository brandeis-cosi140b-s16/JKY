The sandbar is a pretty nice bar, overall.  It's huge, with great music and good people!  I went here for my birthday and had a blast.  The location is kind of weird; it's in a shopping center.  Being from CA, I'm not used to this!  The ONE thing is, don't rub up against the wall of the dance floor...  it cut my back and I was bleeding for 4 days!  But maybe that was more alcohol induced than anything else.   I agree with  the other reviews: don't wear heels - there is actual sand here people! I would totally recommend this place to anyone looking for some good dancing and atmosphere!
