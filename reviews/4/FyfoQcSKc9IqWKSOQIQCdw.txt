My mom and I have frequented this place for a few years now. Their lunch specials M-F are totally worth it. (Mainly Enchilada Monday and Chimichanga Thursday). If you're ordering for dinner, most of their items are a tad pricy in my opinion, but not to the ridiculous end. Their margaritas are HUGE and delicious (especially if you splurge for the Cabo wabo one) and their bean dip is to die for! I definitely recommend this place and if you're going to get something enchilada style, go with the green sauce!
