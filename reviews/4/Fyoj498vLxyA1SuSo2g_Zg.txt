Good food for the price you pay, in my opinion! The chips and salsa are slightly spicy which makes it oh so good.  The spicy cheese curds are decent, and I've never had enchiladas there that I didn't scarf down happily.  The chile relleno is delicious too.  The rice as a side is a little dry, but nothing some sour cream or salsa can't fix. 

Also, restaurant.com always has discounts that will save you a few bucks here!
