I found this place on Restaurants.com while I was pre-planning my trip to Phoenix. The food was great! I had the chicken tacos (chicken was slightly under seasoned but sauce made up for it), and the empanadas.  I washed them down with a drink called Latin Lover. The food was very filling, the drink was very refreshing, the price was right, and the staff showed their Phoenix friendliness.
