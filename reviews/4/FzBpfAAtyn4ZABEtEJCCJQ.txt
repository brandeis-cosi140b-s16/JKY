Long time fan of Valle Luna.  I love feeding the ducks chips!  Oops, ur not supposed to feed the ducks....  Anyways.  The Happy hour is prolly in my top 5 for the entire valley.  I especially love "Cardinal" home games on Sunday.  Happy hour is all day and they always have drink specials.  Unlike alot of so called Happy hours in the valley, you actually leave here "HAPPY".  The Fundido is a for sure hit with the newbies and I really like the Chimis.  Give them a try.  I go to the one on Dobson and Ray in Chandler. :)
