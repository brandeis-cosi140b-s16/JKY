Have been meaning to try this place for awhile and finally went tonight.  Best Tortilla Soup I've had outside of Mexico, it was truly AMAZING.  I will go back just for that.  
Ordered the Seafood Enchiladas, the shrimp was overcooked and tough, reminded me of a leftover reheated, so that won't be on my menu again.  Rice was average and the 'vegetables' were onions and green and red peppers, which I don't usually eat.  Next time I will try the Chimichanga or a Torta, the folks at the next table had the Torta and it looked very good and they were happy with it.  For dessert I had the Sopapillas, which were delicious but had a LOT of sugar on them, so if you're diabetic, don't even think about it. 
Service was attentive, it was a slow night.  One noisy child ruined the first 45 minutes for me but what can you do with ignorant parents who think their pain in the ass child is wonderful?  I hate children in restaurants late at night - they should be HOME.  I know the parents want to go out - but please, it's called A BABYSITTER - GET ONE!!  And if you can't afford one, then STAY HOME or get TAKE OUT.
