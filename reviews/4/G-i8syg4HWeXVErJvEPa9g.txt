What can I say.  MI Patio is a pretty good place to eat.  The food is good!  The real reason I return to the place is for the Margarita's    $2.25 for about a 20 oz Margarita!!  Sweet!!! That is the price all day, it is not a happy hour special.  They are not top shelf Margarita's but they are refreshing after a long day of work.  They also have $2.00 specials for beer all day as well.

As I said before the food is good, but it isn't the main reason I go there.  I have had several dishes and they have been tastey.  The only thing I would avoid is anything with their red enchilada sauce because it taste like it is from a can.  Just watch out their dishes come out really hot!  They always put out chips and change them when you are getting low, as well they have someone walking around with a jug of salsa to keep you swimming in salsa.  

The decor is a little weird they have parrots everywhere and the chairs look like they came from a 70's fast food restaurant.  The service of the waiters has been 50/50.  

I would have given it 3 stars if it wasn't for the cheap alcoholic drinks and the reasonable pricing.  It is not trying to be more than it is, which is cheap eats, cheap drinks and cheap prices.  Unlike other Mexican restaurants (see my other reviews of Mexican restaurants) which I tend to bash because the pricing isn't reflective of the quality.
