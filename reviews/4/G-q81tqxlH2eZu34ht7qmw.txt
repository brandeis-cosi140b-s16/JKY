We really like this place. They have a small menu, so that is really nice. We always get a family pack of tacos that is half steak and half chicken with flour tortillas.( It comes with one pound of cooked meat, sixteen tortillas and the toppings so you assemble them at home or wherever.) If you ask they will give you bigger containers to fill up at their salsa bar, instead of the small ones that they have out. ( Useful if you are getting a family pack.) 
I am giving them four stars instead of five because it is hit or miss if they will actually be open.  Several times over the past year we have gotten there just to find out they are closed for something or another ( Water heater breaking, owners being on vacation, or just closing early and not giving an excuse.) We have learned to call in advance, it has saved a lot of trips out there when they are closed during their normal business hours. They also aren't open on Sundays, so that sucks.
