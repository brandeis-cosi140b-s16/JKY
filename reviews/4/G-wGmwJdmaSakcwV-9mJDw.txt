Service and food is excellent.  $3.99 for a good sized burrito served with rice and beans on the side is a great deal.  Or 99 cent tacos (these are the Mexico "street" style ones served on a soft flat corn tortilla).  All their food is very authentic.

The Al Pastor (seasoned grilled pork and onions) is my favorite and is the best I've ever had.  Whether it's in a burrito, taco or torta, I absolutely love it.  The sodas are the kind you'd get in Mexico.. they import them in the glass bottles.  I've always liked these better than the plastic bottle type you get in the states. The Mexican ones are sweeter and less carbonated.

Great place, and they have beer too.
