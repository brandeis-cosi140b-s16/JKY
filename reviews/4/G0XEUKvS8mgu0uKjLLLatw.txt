This is THE place to go for green chili burritos in the Valley.  Easily the best I have ever experienced.  I haven't had anything else (why stray when you have the best?), but everyone I have taken there has fallen in love with the food.

The restaurant itself is a little nondescript, but easy to find if you remember that it's across from Chandler High and next to a fortune teller.  The prices are extremely reasonable and the atmosphere is definitely very laid back.
