Food was ok but not the best in town. I got 2 tacos, one pastor and one barbacoa. Barbacoa was good but the pastor was rather chewy and greasy. My kids had cheese quesadilla with rice and beans, those were good, especially because of hand made tortillas they do. Aguas frescas were good too, we had horchata and guayaba.
