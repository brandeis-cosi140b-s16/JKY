These large national chains don't really need Yelp reviews to help their business, like small mom and pop shops, and most people coming to one for the first time aren't driven here by these reviews. People come here because of the known quality and huge national tv and other ad campaigns but people should still know about this specific location and ones personal experience had here. 
I come here quite regularly for lunch and have always had good quality food and service. The facilities are well keep and clean and you're usually in and out in no time no matter how busy they are. 
Definitely a good choice, although maybe not a healthy one, for lunch or dinner. My suggestion is a chicken burrito, bag of chips and Diet Coke. The Diet Coke makes it a healthy meal. Right?
