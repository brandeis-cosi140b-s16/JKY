Oh, Chuy's, as a transplanted Texan, how I have missed you! I'm willing to drive the hour+ from Winston-Salem to eat here. Queso that isn't watery white slop, enchiladas the way they're supposed to be, light delicious chips, oh and the margaritas!!! And the decor is even better than other locations I've been to... But still over the top and delightfully tacky fun. We'll keep coming back!
