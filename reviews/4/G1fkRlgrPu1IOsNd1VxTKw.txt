This here is some good Mexican food.  It's interesting and surprising; not your average taco shop.  Some examples of the pleasantries experienced here:

- Pozole Rojo...Very tasty and the surprise here is that I'm pretty damn sure there is organ meat up in this soup.  Like maybe some kidneys or liver?  My only complaint is that it wasn't hot enough temperature wise.  However, we did come right after they opened, so maybe it just wasn't heated through yet.

- Cali burrito...ohhh, how I miss these from my San Diego days.  And no one in Vegas seems to get them quite right.  Desnudo is no exception, unfortunately.  A good Cali burrito has French fries in it, not potatoes!  But the carne is deliciously seasoned.

- Hongos Taco...mushroom are my love.  And the mushrooms in this taco were meaty and hearty and tasty.  A little spicy sauce wraps it all up into one hell of a taco.

- Chivo Taco...it's freaking goat meat.  I've never had goat meat, but it ended up being my favorite thing of all.  It tastes very similar to lamb, and boy is it tasty on this taco.  Add a little of their smoky red sauce and you got the winner winner chicken dinner (or should I say goat dinner) here!

Most definitely visiting this place again.  There were many more items on their menu that I wanted to try, but was too full to do so!
