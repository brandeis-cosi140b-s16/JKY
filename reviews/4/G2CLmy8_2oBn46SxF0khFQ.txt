This is one of those places I've driven by a thousand times, yet have never been to. We went here after dinner and my date told me that they have a nice patio for drinks. From the road, it looks like any establishment, but as soon as you get to the entrance, it's like you're walking on the set of Pirates of the Carribean! It was really cool. The outside patio was designed to look like a beach front dock with a lagoon. There are two fireplaces on the lower patio with a bar in the middle. And then seating on a deck on the outside of the bar. Inside there is a bar and also high backed booths to fit two or four people. The ambiance of this place is unlike any place I've been to before. (note...I'm new to the valley!). The service was fast and courteous and the drinks strong! There's room for large groups outside and it's a very festive crowd. I'm going back there this Saturday for drinks with friends and encourage you to go too. 

I haven't eaten there yet, so I can only give the place four stars, but I loved this place. If I had friends visiting from out of town, this is the kind of place I'd take them too.
