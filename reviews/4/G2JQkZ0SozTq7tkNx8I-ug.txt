Tortas are not the only Mexican fare served up here but are the reason I return! I tend to keep it safe with the ham and cheese torta (part sub/panini). The bread is so airy and has the right amountof sweetnes to make you just forget about the ham and just nosh on the bread. They bake it daily and bread is not for individual sale. Boo! Their fruit drinks are yummy; dining area just got expanded with a side bakery. TV's are kinda loud; needs more ventilation; parking is limited and next to tire shop but well worth the visit. Oh yeah; it's in the da hood too! But so far so safely good!
