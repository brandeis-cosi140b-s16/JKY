Leticia's...one of the best places that you can eat in the Northwest!

I've tried a little bit of everything here...but my favorites are probably the Burritos and tacos!

You can essentially customize your own food here, from the salsa to the ingredients, and of course, the meat! My particular burrito was made with Al Pastor and Red Guajillo, Black Beans, and House Blend Cheese. This was a BEAST...had to take the other half to go! Really loved the salsa...it was actually a bit spicy!

I also liked the Queso Fundido : Chorizo, Gouda, and Menonita Cheese. Super cheesy mix, with tons of oil and fat...just like chorizo should be! It was almost too cheesy actually, with it being super stringy and a little difficult pulling apart! But that's what friends are for...to help you with your cheese!

Even the complimentary salsa and chips are great, and bottomless if you enjoy them as much as us! 

Prices seem a bit steep at first, but the quality of ingredients, taste, and portions make it worth it.  Wish the portions were smaller with more reasonable prices to reflect that...ie a burrito at half the size, but around the $10 mark vs $15.
