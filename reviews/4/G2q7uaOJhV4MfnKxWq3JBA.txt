Me and my husband frequent this particular Chipotle branch whenever we are in the area.  It can definitely be busy and you have to wait awhile to get your food, but we are rarely disappointed in the quality and freshness of the food.  I would order online if you are unable to wait in line and order before rush hour, so that you will get your order in time.
