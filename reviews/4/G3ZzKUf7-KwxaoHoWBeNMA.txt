My food was extremely spicy so I couldn't tell you if it was delicious or not. It was just extremely spicy! But that's my preference, of course. I understand some people love the spice. Before that, our server brought out chips, salsa and a bean dip. That was really good and unique since most restaurants usually just serve salsa. We ordered a round of margaritas too. Which were basically all tequila. WIN. 

This place is definitely your standard mall Mexican restaurant. Really great prices! Be sure to go during happy hour, even greater prices! It's a really good family restaurant too. So if you're at Arizona Mills and looking for a place you and you're family can sit and eat, away from the standard food court, try this place. The servers are nice and super helpful despite the fact that it seemed like they were a little under staffed the day I went. Good place! I'd try it again!
