Okay, it's vegas and this is basically a chain.  That said it's a great place to people watch, as they stoll about the Miricle Mile Shops.  We've been here a few times the food is good, although not ground-breaking, as are the margaritas.  if you go off peak hours, esp weekdays, we've typically been able to get a table along the railing.
