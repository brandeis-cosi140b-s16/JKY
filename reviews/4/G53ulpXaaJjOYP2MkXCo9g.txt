The Sheh-meh-neh burrito is the best thing to eat at Burrito Drive.  It has big pieces of bacon and sweet potato puree, which make a great combination.  And I don't even like sweet potatoes.  All of the other burritos I've tried here are good too, but I keep going back to the Sheh-meh-neh.  Other than burritos I've had the wings and chips and salsa, all good but not anything too special.  

I know they deliver, but I usually go in person to get my fix.  You just walk up to the counter to get service.  The people who work there are friendly, but sometimes you might have to ring the bell to get their attention.  

Their prices are fair, a little higher than what you might pay at another burrito place, but I think it's worth it.
