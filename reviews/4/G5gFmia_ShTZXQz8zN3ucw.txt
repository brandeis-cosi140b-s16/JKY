I like this bar. It always has a hopping outdoor tropical bar-vibe. It has decent energy but not overly high energy like a happy medium between a corner dive bar and a crazy college bar. My coworkers always seem to pick this place for HH and the drinks are decent. The chambord margarita is a little better than average, kind of like the Z Tejas one.
