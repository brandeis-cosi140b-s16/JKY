I agree with the first review. I grew up in Arizona and this is by far the best Fillibertos. I guess some of the Filli B's in AZ charge for the extra condiments. At this location you can help yourself to free chips, salsas and other sides. 

This place is your best bet for late night authentic fast Mexican fast food.
