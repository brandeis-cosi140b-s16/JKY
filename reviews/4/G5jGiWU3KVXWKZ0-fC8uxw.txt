Catching up on a long overdue review: a Phoenix tradition for my dear friend Debbie and I - enjoyed our usual Baja sauce last Saturday (8/3) with frosty mugs of Corona and Pacifico, respectively.  Always plenty of food on the plate, never seem to be able to finish.  Service, adequate; Food, tasty.  Will always return, as stated, it has become a tradition for us!
