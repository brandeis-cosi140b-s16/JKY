I've adored the downstairs bar and fireplace here for years - and had always been happy with the food and service. Somehow, the place fell out of rotation and off my radar for years.
Until last week - when I was invited to join a small group for reverse happy hour.
$5 wine, draft, marg. 
$5 small plates.
And all well worth it!

Between the four of us, we ordered:
2 orders of prime rib sliders
1 order carne adovada sliders
2 order shrimp piri piri
2 orders smoked salmon
1 order grilled oysters
1 order rokerij oysters

And it was WAY too much! Lots of food went home with us.

The shrimp piri piri with toast points was amazing - will definitely be ordering it again.
The carne adovada sliders were the highlight of the night. GREAT flavor!
The prime rib sliders were okay - but as others have pointed out - quite skimpy.
The salmon was tasty - but we would have been fine with one order instead of 2.
Grilled oysters were OK. I got spoiled with grilled oysters in New Orleans - these didn't come close.
Rokerij oysters were fantastic and will be ordered again, for sure.

Happily - there's lots on the menu we didn't get to. Which means a great excuse to go back. Soon, and most likely often.

For me, the best part is the 10pm to close happy hour - even on Sunday. Not too many people going out for food and drink at 10 on a Sunday - gives me a guarantee of a spot at the bar and stellar service.

WIN!
