It was my time in the Phoenix area and Raul and Theresa's was recommended.  It definately didn't disappoint, service was excellent (staff was quick to fill up chips, salsa, and our drinks), food was pretty good, and the prices was great.  I'll definately be going back next time I'm down in the area.
