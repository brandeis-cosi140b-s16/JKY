Ajo Al's is pretty cool! The atmosphere is nice and the service was wonderful. Our food came out quickly and was really good. The portion sizes are enormous, far too big for any of us to finish! We all enjoyed our food, but I was told the beef is not worth getting again. I will definitely be back for the guacamole tacos!
