Been wanting to try the Javiers out by us but haven't had a chance.  Decided while we were here to try this one.  Got an early reservation but after shopping all day, we were plenty hungry.  Daughter ordered steak fajitas said they were the best she's ever had.  Hubby ordered the tres enchiladas and loved them.  I ordered the seafood plate with a  little of everything.  It had an enchilada, a fish taco & a chili relleno.  It was a lot of food, but we all managed to finish.  I also ordered one of the specialty martini's.  It was pretty good, but I hadn't realized it was $17!  That's the most I've ever paid for a drink, ever!  Usually expect to pay $12-13 for a specialty martini.

Service was great, ambiance is wonderful.  Love the decor!  Would definitely go back.
