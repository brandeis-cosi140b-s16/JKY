I've been to this location several times with my employer and the rest of our office staff. It's usually pretty crowded but the employees do the best they can to make sure you are served quickly. Today we were there for Friday lunch and I had a slight problem with my food. I brought it to the attention of an individual cleaning (he may have been a manager, but I'm not sure and I did not catch his name). He was WONDERFUL! He took care of the problem immediately, my food was re-made, I was given a refund and a giftcard (without my asking at all as I did not expect this - I was fine with just having my food re-made). I wish I had seen his name tag so I could recommend that everyone go to this location and be served by this individual, but in the midst of my issue, I failed to see his name tag. In any case, it was a great experience given the situation and I will definitely not be afraid to go back. The food was particularly fresh today too!
