I really like this place! I like it better than  Roberto's Got 4 astada Tacos, beans and lettuce with tomatoes.  I think they just threw the lettuce and tomatoes on my plate, because I was suppose to get rice (I love rice, any kind of rice)  She told me as soon as the rice is ready she will bring it to me.  I love the condiment table, ohhhhh the pickled jalapenos.  I really liked the tacos!  the beans.......Well they could have kept that.  The lettuce and tomatoes, not sure how all that was suppose to be tied in with the rest of the meal, but what ever.....My rice never came.  
So I decided when I get off work, I will come back here so I can bring a plate home to my husband.  So  I just told the cashier, that I will pick up my rice when I get off work.  

I go back after work.  They already knew what the deal is!  That's pretty good service.  I ordered the same thing for my husband that I go for myself for lunch.  Tthey also gave me a free soda for my troubles.   So when I got home, and opened his plate!  WTF, I didn't get chips!  And he didn't get lettuce and tomatoes!  The chips were so good!  And the rice was the BOMB.COM!  They gave me a pint  and I ate the whole thing!  Next time, they can keep the beans, give me chips and rice!
