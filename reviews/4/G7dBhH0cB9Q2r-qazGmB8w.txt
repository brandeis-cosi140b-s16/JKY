For those of us who are gluten-free, two of the simplest cuisines to opt for eating out are Sushi or Mexican/Tex-Mex.

Tex Tubbs serves the latter very well, and I think they currently win for my favorite taco place in Madison.

Service is pretty good, even when they get crazy-busy on the weekends, and if you're a margarita fan, you definitely need to give theirs a try.
