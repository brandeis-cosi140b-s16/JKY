Okay, right away, I have to agree with the consensus 3.5 stars for this place, as it rated when I wrote this. I'll give 'em four stars for the excellent service we had tonight.

My son and daughter and I ate here tonight. It was really good.

The place is a a "Honduran Mexican fusion" themed restaurant with a nice bar, nice patio, and large dining room with comfortable booths. 

They start you out with really good chips and salsa. They make their own salsa, in three flavors. We tried the red (fresh, medium), the green (tomatillo, avocado, serrano, cilantro, and hotter), and the brown (habanero, and something else). All were great. We also tried their home-made guacamole, which was really good.

My daughter had vegetarian fajitas, which were really good. She had plenty for lunch the next day. I had crab enchiladas with a verde salsa. They were spicy and tasty. My son had a beef enchilada, rice, and beans. He pigged out on a virgin pi√±a colada first, so he didn't finish it, but liked what he ate.

The highlight of the meal was their black bean side. They simmer those suckers all day in a mixture of exotic Honduran herbs and spices. Wow! I could have had a whole meal out of them. They were incredible.

Our waiter was very informative and helpful and attentive. When they put cheese and sour cream on my daughter's plate by mistake (she's lactose intolerant), the server dealt with it very promptly.

We will go back. This is just different enough from the other Mexican / Latino flavored restaurants in town that it's a nice change of pace. I would recommend you stop in if you haven't been in a while. They're trying very hard to do all the right things. The manager stopped by a couple of times to check on us, and asked again as we left. Nicely attentive.
