I have never been into this El Pollo Loco. It is near my work, so when I need to grab a quick lunch and I am burnt out on sandwiches I hit up the EPL drive thru for a fairly quick, fairly healthy meal.

I enjoy the grilled chicken salad, and when I am super hungry, the chicken avocado burrito is high in calories and flavor. I also appreciate that the drive thru menu lists calories for the different items. I have always been helped by really nice employees as well. 

The one area this El Pollo Loco falls short, as noted by another reviewer, is speed.  There have been times when it felt like a slightly excessive wait to get my food... Despite this, El Pollo Loco still remains one of my go to lunch spots because it is inexpensive and tasty.
