Went there on a coupon from dealchicken.com and enjoyed it very much.  We were there at lunch and  were seated in the bar area quickly which was fine with us as it was a booth.  The waiter was attentive and competent.  I think some may not be too interested in being attentive since we were there on a coupon but that was not the case here.  I had the machaca beef which was well seasoned and a huge portion that I was not able to finish (and I really skimped on the beans and rice because I could see how much beef there was!!).  The salsa and chips were very good that was a chunky type which is my favorite but they also brought a hotter version which was a thinner concoction that we added to the large bowl of salsa.  My wife had a lunch special combination which she also liked.  The finale was when the waiter asked if we wanted anything else to finish off the $30 coupon and we were at $28 and I opted for the sopapilla;s which is a favorite and I expected 4 or 5 with some honey but it was a huge bowl with 20+ in it!!!  We took almost all of them home and ate them for the next couple of days.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was just that I like to see things like barbacoa, adobada, etc on the menu also.
