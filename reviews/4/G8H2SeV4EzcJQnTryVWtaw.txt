This is the definition of a dive.  It does have some really nice artwork on the wall, and the decorations are quaint.  This isn't the kind of place you go to because it's novel or for any other gimmicky antics.  Nope.  You go here for the down and dirty cheap food that's rather delicious, and you don't mind coming back again and again for.

If Mexican food is your thing then leave your high-brow at home, throw on some low class and have some Los Taquitos, hot and spicy tacos on the cheap.  They don't serve beer but they won't stop you from bringing your own XD
