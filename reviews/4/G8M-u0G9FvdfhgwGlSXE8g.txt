Voted 2nd best Sangria in Phoenix.... well naturally you wonder who was crowned wiht the honor of first.  That is what we were left to ponder while we enjoyed the many varieties of soft tacos.

The waiter was friendly and recommended the 2nd best sangria in town (orange sangria made of oranges, mango and other tastey delights).  He unfortunately could not recall the first place winner.  He also recommended the tacos and naco torta.  We sampled all the soft tacos and the favorite was the cochinita and carne asada.  The one minor down fall was tacos are heavily loaded so it could use a second tortilla to better support the contents.  The naco torta was also delicious.  Nicely season and just a great combination of ingredients (steak, avacado, over easy eggs).

The prices are very reasonable and a great find.  There was no wait and just enough patrons to keep the food fresh but not become an overrated hot spot.
