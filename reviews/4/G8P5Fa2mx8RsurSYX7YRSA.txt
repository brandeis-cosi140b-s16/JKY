$2 tequila shots, margaritas, and tacos - all day, errday!

My brother and I were meandering around our hotel at Bally's and saw the $2 deals. It was past midnight, which was the perfect time to take in a buzz or two. We ordered some shots, margaritas and 4 tacos (2 beef and 2 chicken) to share. Both the beef and chicken tacos were not the greatest, kind of like Taco Bell. Oh well, 4 stars for the cheap deals!
