Four ate lunch, two combination plates, a taco plate and burrito a la carte, plus two soft drinks.  Enough English spoken to get the orders right.  $20.00.  Delicious food.  Two four star ratings, two five star ratings.  Ample portions, well prepared, simple little restaurant, country food.  I'm going back.
