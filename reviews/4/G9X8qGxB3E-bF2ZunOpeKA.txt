Great food!  We go here several times a month and don't have much bad to say.  My favorite is the carne asada quesadilla but like just about everything I've tried on the menu.  The only thing I'm not a big fan of is the taco (too bad it's in the name of the restaurant lol).  I've had better tacos at the Filiberto style restaurants.  The chicken is grilled white meat, good luck trying to find that at any other restaurant of this type.  Salsa bar is great, try the fresh jalape√±os for a real kick.  The staff is all very professional and courteous.  A small flat screen tv on the wall usually shows whatever popular sporting event is on.  I highly recommend the place.
