I dig Chronic Tacos, I'd eaten at Wee-Man's location in Redondo Beach prior to discovering the location here in Vegas.  The one here in Summerlin is nice...not as cool as Wee-Man's, but his is also 3 blocks away from the beach and has a full bar inside, plus he frequents his store so it's almost an unfair comparison.  

Anyways, the food here is very good!  I find it tastier than the other mexican grub joints like Roberto's, Chipotle, Qdoba, Rubio's, etc.  The daily homemade salsa here is awesome!  Their chips are always fresh and tasty too.  And however they cook and season their chicken...I'm definitely a fan.  Their steak is very tasty too.  I've personally never tried the pork, and I don't eat shrimp so I can't comment on their quality.  

I usually stick with the chicken burrito bowl which is stellar!  The way they finely dice up their onions and cilantro make for tasty toppings.  All three of their salsas are great too!  The salsa verda is hella bomb!  I'm a fan of their tacos too, I like how they offer both flour and corn tortillas.  They pack them out with meat and toppings.

I wish they offered more beverage options, and I wish it wasn't so far away.  Having to drive all the way up into Scummerlin for my Chronic fix can get annoying.  But the grub is so good that the drive isn't so horrible.
