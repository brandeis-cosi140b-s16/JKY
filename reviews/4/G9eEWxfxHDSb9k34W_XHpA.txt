I'v gone to this Chipotle a couple of times and everytime the workers have been polite and nice to me. This one usually isn't very busy so if you looking for a place to order a quick borrito this is the place to go. The design of the building is also very nice and has been clean everytime I have eaten their. In all I recommend this Chipotle over the other ones because of the great employees and quick making of the food.
