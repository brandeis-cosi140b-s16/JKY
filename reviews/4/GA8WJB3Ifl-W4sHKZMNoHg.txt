We were hankering for a new taco place.  We were super excited to see that there was a new two hippies.  
Upon arrival the place had zero customers.  I asked the owner how long she had been open and had some small talk with her.  She described some of the items on the menu and it all sounded super good.  She is very nice.  
I ordered a passion fruit lemonade.  The lemonade is definitely worth just stopping in.  Not too sweet, not too tart and it's blended!
I ordered carne asada taco which was "alright."  Sorta bland...
I also ordered a chicken taco which was better and finally the shredded pork taco.. Stick with the pork.. it has a great green chili sauce on it.  Overall great flavor.
I'm rating this place at 4 stars because it's low priced, decent food and the owner was a really sweet lady.
