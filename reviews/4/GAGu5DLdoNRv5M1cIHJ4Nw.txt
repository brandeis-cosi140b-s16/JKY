Made it too late for the dinner, but at prime time for the party!

Came here with a charming paisita for a night out in a new place. All the music was in Spanish, and I can get down on some Norteno when I'm downing $4 pints of Pacifico or Negra Modelo. The margaritas were pre-made, but totally worth it, on the rocks OR frozen.

The bartenders rocked, and were more than happy to concoct "something girly" to sip on. Also, personable, as was everyone else--not one patron was having a bad time. Dance floor was PACKED. But then a lit up corner in the back with some billiards if that's your style.

Will definitely be back for the food, but for a night club, La Perla was a small culture shock for me, but still kicked all sorts of ass.
