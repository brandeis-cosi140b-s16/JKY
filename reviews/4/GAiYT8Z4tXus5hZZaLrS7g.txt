It is a hole in a wall. I was impressed. I had their ribs, it came with a nice red sauce. The portions a big (as expected in a Mexican restaurant). Simple, authentic Mexican. 
I would agree w the Music comment. It is a little odd. They had music and a Mexican soap opera playing at the same time. Lol, 2 TV on. I needed to answer some important phone calls, they turned down the TV for me, so I would say they are accommodating.  The food is good, ambiance is odd but hey, my belly was happy and full. Next time I will try their mole.
