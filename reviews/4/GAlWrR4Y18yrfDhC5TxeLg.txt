I really like this place. The burritos are HUGE! Also, the mini tacos were really yummy. The cooks and the cashiers were super nice. They even brought me a free taco, it was great too. I want to go back again. The atmosphere is a little different, had to bus my own table (it's a Mexican fast food joint).  They also add guacamole to everything. My friend and wife got some tortas, they were so flavorful.
