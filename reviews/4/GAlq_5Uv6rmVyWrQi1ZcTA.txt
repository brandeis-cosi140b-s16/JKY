El Molino makes the chimichanga by which I rate all other chimichangas -- if another restaurant doesn't give it  just the right crispiness, with just the right accompaniments of cheese, guacamole and sour cream, then it just doesn't cut it. By the way, after almost 30 years in Phoenix I've eaten more chimichangas than I care to admit. Get El Molino's chicken or machaca chimi, which is often a nightly special for under $8, and you will be in sinus-clearing chimi heaven.
