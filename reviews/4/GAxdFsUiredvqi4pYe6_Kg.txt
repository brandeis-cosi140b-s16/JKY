Finally got to try this place after driving by them for the last year and a half. Not really a taco truck but more like a small trailer that you can tow. Judging by the size of it, makes you wonder how they can make whatever you decide to get tasty.

For my first visit, I got 3 tacos ($1.50 each). I got Al Pastor, Asada, and Carnitas. The Pastor was not your typical cut of pork off the spit. It was more like grilled after being sliced. The Carne Asada was your standard sliced seasoned beef. Was ok. The Carnitas were pretty good and not dry. All three had good flavor especially with the chopped up cilantro, onion, and radish. Also comes with a slice of lime and two different kinds of salsa. One is supposedly medium while the other is hot. To me both were good but both seemd to have the same spice level. I ended up mixing both up and which complemented the tacos well.

The second visit I wanted to get the Asada Fries ($8.00) but wanted it with Al Pastor instead. The nice lady said that was not a problem. If you refer to my pic, they have sour cream, pico de gallo, and cheddar cheese. It was really good.

Some random info. They take cash only. Since they are right next to a convenience mart, you can get more choices of drink from there. Make sure to take one of their flyers so that you know what the specials are for certain days.

All in all I thought what they serve here is pretty good. I just think that you should get just a little bit more meat for what you get.
