Good Mexican fast food with sustainable seafood tacos, enchiladas, and burritos.  The shrimp enchiladas and tacos are actually pretty good (the shrimp isn't over cooked).  Tuesdays, their fish tacos are half price for $1.50.  Pretty good deals and economical for those on a budget.  Highly recommend and hands down, much better than Taco Bell.
