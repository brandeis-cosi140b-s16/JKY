Ughhh why are the lines soo long???

Because they are that good. Yes. 

Really close to the Wynn, with a shared parking lot if you're driving, on the strip, open late, super cheap, and absolutely delicious after a day of drinking or not drinking whatever floats your boat.

My favorite is the adobada (spicy pork) and who could say no to a cup of horchata for $1.40. Nobody that's who! Don't forget to ask for the pineapple! Yum.

If you're going with a group of people, better split up and wait in different lines (there are 3) so you could order faster. Can't wait to visit the one in San Diego soon!
