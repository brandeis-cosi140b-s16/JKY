A nice way to start a quick (18 hour) visit to Pittsburgh, with what was probably the best queso fundido (with chorizo) we've ever had, prepared tableside. I had the California burrito, which was grilled before serving, a nice touch!  Friendly staff, good drinks, check it out if you're on the South Side!
