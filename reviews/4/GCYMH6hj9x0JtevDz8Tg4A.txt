What a great experience.


For my first night in Arizona I wanted something a little southern. ..and got it with the Rokerj.  

We started with a pizza (yeah  i know- southern what? Italy )  but the pizza was for the four year old.  

My meal was this amazing smoked pork dish with beans and rice.  It hit the spot. . .a unique and mildly spicey dish.  I so enjoyed it, I really want to go back and try the brunch everyone is talking about. . . sounds AMAZING

the place itself is odd - You can go down in the basement, you can go outside. . its almost as if there are three restaurant areas together.  We had this awesome booth seat next to a fireplace. It was quant and awesome.  

My brother got three enchiladas. . and man were they tasty.  Plus a lot of food for the amount (entrees cost around 14-18 bucks)

I would highly recommend this place - and it is a great thing to try when your in Phoenix area and want a taste of new mexico-arizona - etc


note:  there are more expensive fish and meat dishes., which cost almost twice as much.
