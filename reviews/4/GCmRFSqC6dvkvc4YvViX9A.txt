I'm going to put the caveat on this review that I am friends with a few of the family members who own Rosita's BUT, I got to know them by coming in to eat. 

The fried beef tacos are a fantastic indulgence. But I've discovered that I'm a fan of their carnitas too. Their fish tacos are great - marinated not battered and friend. And, if you're not a bean eater, try to sopa de fidello (noddle soup). 

From the bar, consider the house margarita or the matriarch's namesake cocktail - Rosita's Tea. 

Check your attitude at the door, sit back, relax, and enjoy.
