Grand opening for the New Chipotle out here near PV mall....and of course in walking distance of my house. I mean it simply doesn't get any better than this....so many food choices and more coming all within a stone's throw of my apartment complex. I was the 3rd person in line for this chipotle's grand opening after 3pm promotion. The first 100 people received a free burrito....burrito bowl....taco's or salad card to use on their visit.....and a biodegradable water bottle. 

I had the chicken burrito with a side of chips and guacamole....it cost me about 10 bucks. While the burrito was pretty good.....the chips and guac were very salty so beware of that if you have high blood pressure issues. The restaurant is located in great locale....right near the intersection of Cactus and Tatum. I am sure it will do well in this locale especially since again it sits right near the mall.

However with Oregano's which just opened a couple of weeks ago right across from it....and a new Culver's coming that will be just down the road....and of course the already popular In and Out burger.....I am sure there will be some stiff competition for business. I am just excited it is so close to my apt. so if I ever to want Mexican....I now have my very own NEIGHBORHOOD CHIPOTLE!!!! Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
