Located just off the 101, I drop in here for lunch and breakfast quite often.  The Queso Monterrey is awesome and addictive and when it comes to mind, I have to have it.  Below are a few menu items I've sampled.

Bean & Cheese Burrito, $2.50 or $1.98 with a coupon

They have a Salsa bar where you can select from a variety of different Salsa flavors....mild, med, spicy.  There's also freshly sliced Radish and Lemon avail as well.

There's plenty of seating in the restaurant, but it can get busy during the 12-1 pm lunch rush.  I usually go just before or after that time period.
