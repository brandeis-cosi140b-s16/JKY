Everything's really tasty here, especially the cocktails.  I would say everything's a little overpriced though.  But it's north Scottsdale, so what do you expect.
As mentioned in other reviews, the vampire taco is legit.  I also liked the blackberry ginger margarita.  Unless you like REALLY spicy food, you might avoid the viper taco.
