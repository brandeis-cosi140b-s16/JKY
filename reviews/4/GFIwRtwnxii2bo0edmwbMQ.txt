The service is amazing. Our server was super sweet and didn't make my fiance and me feel like complete idiots, even though it was quite obvious that we are some of the whitest people on earth and don't know a thing about what "authentic" Mexican food is supposed to taste like (we *just* moved to the valley).

That said, I do know good food, and this food is good (I can't yet speak to its authenticity). Our server recommended starting with a cold seafood cocktail with shrimp, octopus, and oysters. I don't normally like octopus, as I find the texture to be off-putting, but this was delicious. Not rubbery like I've had it at sushi restaurants. The cocktail was more of a soup, kind of like a gazpacho. Our server recommended that we doctor it with some ketchup and tapatio. Perfect. 

My fiance and I shared the Chipotle Shrimp, which came with enough food to split and more to take home. It was also pretty awesome. I like that they served the meal with both flour and corn tortillas. 

Besides our server being sweet and very helpful, I also appreciated that the kitchen split our appetizer and meal into separate bowls/plates at no extra charge. It was a nice gesture. 

Oh yeah! And super fine chips and salsa. 

We will be back for sure.
