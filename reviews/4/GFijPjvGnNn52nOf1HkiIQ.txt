First time going off the strip to go eat dinner. Very interesting mix of Korean food and Mexican food. I guess it works . I tried their fusion Flautas. First time every trying it but hey!~~~ it was pretty good. My friend told me its just usually just cheese and no meat but they added bul gogi meat in it. Pretty good~! 

Service was good. Everyone's really nice and helpful.
