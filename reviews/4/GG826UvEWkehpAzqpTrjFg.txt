Chose this place walking by at Caesar's on our last day before heading to the airport. Although service was a little slow, the food was really good.

The guacamole and chips with two salsas was a great deal for $9. More than two hungry people could eat. I got the chicken falautas. Some of the best I have had. Came with a side of guacamole, sour cream and queso fresca. 

Filling, could only eat half of my meal! Not a bad deal with a beer my tab was about $40, but two could have shared the falautas.  I will remember this place next time I am in LV.
