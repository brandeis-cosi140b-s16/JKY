I've been wanting to visit this place for some time. Always pass by it and finally did today and it was sooo worth it. I know these Mexican food places are hit & miss in the north valley. There salsa bar was great. The hot salsa is very flavorful impressive. I knew this place would if been pretty good when I saw a grandma in the back cooking. I had two tacos rice a beans. There tacos were shredded beef tacos and the beef was pretty good and the rice was true Mexican rice. The beans were a little salty but still pretty good stuff the cashier guy was supper friendly and the restaurant was very clean and authentic for being in a strip mall. Go check it out! I'm picky about my Mexican food and this place was pretty good. I like to see them around long term so go visit!
