I'm a big Chipotle (strictly burrito bowl) fan and found Picante to be pleasantly similar.

The portions and options are almost identical and it's great knowing you are supporting local business.

Here's the break down: 

A toasted tortilla at the bottom of your burrito bowl at Picante will set you back an extra 50 cents. Chipotle will not. -1

Picante offers more chicken flavor selections (herb and buffalo). +1

Chipotle's guacamole is chunkier and more flavorful. +1

Picante has $5.00 burritos or burrito bowls on Tuesdays. Tip: Go during off hours to avoid lines. +50

I'm summary, so what? I save the money and carbs for not adding guacamole and a tortilla to my order and don't have to take the trek down south blvd to the nearest Chipotle.

Bravo, Picante!
