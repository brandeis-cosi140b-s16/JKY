Groupon strikes again!!!!

Service was good here.... Although, he didn't know about the groupon deal they had going on. Can't fault him for it... That's on management. Once he figured out how to handle it... Then it was smooth sailing. 

We had two house margaritas, which I was happy to know weren't made with gold/mixto. Seared in a small coupe with ice. They were just "alright". I prefer margaritas made with a house made sour. I can't be certain there's isn't.... But it surely didn't taste like it. 

We ordered the lobster taco platter equipped with rice, beans, a verde sauce and three lobster tacos. I've never had lobster tacos before, let's just say it was a surprise to my taste buds. Also cane with chips and guac!
