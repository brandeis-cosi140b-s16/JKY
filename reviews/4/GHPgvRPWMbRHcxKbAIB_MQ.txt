This place is fantastic! The title says it all.. it's mainly burritos and they are delish. I love coming here early for their fantastic breakfast burritos. Smothered you say? Yes I say.. I prefere the red sauce.. the co-workers love the green, and they get a special added sauce inside... good stuff I hear. I love the nachos too!! Reasonably priced.
