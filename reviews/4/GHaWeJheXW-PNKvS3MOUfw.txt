Believe or not my first visit came just the other week.  Everyone raves about Chipotle and I too can see why.  Is it my favorite? Probably not.  I'm a Moe's fan really when it comes to burritos.  

They do have great fresh ingredients and the staff is as kind and friendly as any you will find though. 

This location I imagine can be a bit of trouble getting in and out of considering it's location is on a busy corner with the MET across the street.
