1st time ever to El Rico's Dos & we loved it!  The food was great, the service was awesome, great atmosphere, &  we loved the decor.  Found out about El Rico's Dos from our dining rewards program we are excited to return and bring our friends.  The green sauce is amazing, portions are large, & everything tasted home made.
