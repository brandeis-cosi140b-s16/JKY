I love hot spicy Mexican food, and I was surprised to find a really hot item on the menu. There was only one, but it was good. I ordered the Spicy Boneless Pork Ribs which came with tortilla, rice and choice of beans. I ordered the Black Beans. It was all very good. The service was good, especially for a large crowd of 20. Servers were friendly and fast. And the real test of a good Mexican place is the margarita. I passed on the house and ordered one of the specialty margs, and it was really good. This is a good place.
