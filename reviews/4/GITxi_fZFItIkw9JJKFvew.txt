Finally got to try this place out the other night! Food was delicious and service was great! The portions are huge so lots of left overs for me. The servers were very helpful even took the time to teach me some Spanish! Doesn't hurt they were easy on the eyes :) haha  Definitely will be back for some coffee and latin night!
