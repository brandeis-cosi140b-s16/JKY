Disappointed to see the bad reviews, because this place is really good. Still one of my favorite Mexican places in Phoenix. I've been dining here for 6 years, since it's down the street from our office, and it's still a great place to go for a quick lunch or after work cocktails. 

The service here is friendly, attentive and quick. I made a reservation for lunchtime for a party of 8 and we were in and out of there in under an hour! The food was served hot and delicious. And the best part was they treated our co-worker with a birthday cake, which we laughed at, because the lunch was set up because he was leaving our company. We had played along anyway and he enjoyed his delicious flan birthday treat. 

I've tried many dishes here and they are all so good. The pollo fundido is delicious and the burritos will last you for days because they are huge portions. But my favorite part of the dish is the pinto beans and rice. So good! And the nachos are always served hot and the most flavorful salsa in town. 

It's not in the most desirable locations, but well worth a visit if your in the South Mountain area. 

The outdoor patio is not the best, I'll have to agree. The seats are pretty low and there seems to be birds feeding from the berries in the trees, because we would constantly get hit by a berry and at one point a bird pooped on our menu. So try to get a seat in the patio away from the entrance and the large tree sitting there. But on a beautiful spring day, it's the perfect place to be to watch the sunset and enjoy a margarita!
