Been going here for almost 7 years, good drinks, good happy hour and good food. The quality has also steadily improved over time. Cheapest decent meal with booze for the money in Vegas.

I would recommend paying a bit extra for premium booze during happy hour or a big drinker will not be so happy in the morning.
