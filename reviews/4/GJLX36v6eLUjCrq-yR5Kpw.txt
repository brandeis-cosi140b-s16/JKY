It's a great spot to come after hours and eat. It's open 24 hours. It was sketchy at first bc of the area, but the food was good and no one bother us. I ordered a ham torta and they used real ham not lunch meat. My BF got a breakfast burrito and has good chucks of bacon, real bacon. The only thing is the dining outside area was messy/dirty, but it is outside, so how much can they do??
