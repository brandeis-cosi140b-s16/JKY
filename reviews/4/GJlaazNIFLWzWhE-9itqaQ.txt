Yup.  I'm actually going to do it.  I'm actually going to review a fast food joint.

I usually always brown bag it for lunch at work, but today I ended up at work empty stomached and empty handed.  I planned on picking up a pre-made salad at Vons, but there was major police action happening outside and inside the market.  Uhhhh, maybe another time...

I haven't had any fast food in months and months, but seemed to remember noticing that Del Taco had added fish tacos to the menu - which is great because I don't eat meat or fowl.  Luckily, there's a Del Taco conveniently located in the same shopping mall.

The drive-thru staff were perky and friendly.  On to the tacos - the battered and fried fish with cabbage slaw and salsa fresca were wrapped in corn tortillas and actually pretty darn yummy.  The fries were kind of meh - but I tend to like fries slightly overdone with some crunch. 

Overall, great place in a pinch.
