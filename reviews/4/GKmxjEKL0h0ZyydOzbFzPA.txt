My friend and I have been avid nacho fans since the 7th grade. So on her last night out here visiting we decided to hit up Nacho Daddy and revel in the carbs. Plus, after depleting our bank accounts over the weekend a restaurant with a coupon is always good.

For starters we got the Raspberry Margarita. It actually had a real raspberry taste instead of just the artificial one. Very good! And we split two Nacho skillets with our buy one-get one deal. 

The Thai Chicken Nachos came out first (they also brought a wrong order, but fixed it quickly and professionally) and they had a great flavor! I loved the Sweet Chili Sauce mixing in with the white queso-delicious! The majority of the toppings were just on top with some on bottom with many chips in between. We almost wanted more substance, but overall the chips were good.

The Buffalo Chicken Nachos were our second round, and by this time we were already stuffed! Although we were incredibly thankful they did not come out at the same time. We got to avoid the sogginess that happens when queso is involved. These nachos were also very good. The buffalo sauce was not overwhelming and had a really good flavor and it complemented the cheese well. The chicken was really breaded and a little to "fake chicken" like for my taste but it tasted alright.

Overall, great atmosphere for a nacho/pub joint. The place was clean, the service was friendly and the food was good. We came at the end of happy hour but they seem to have some great specials. Will I go back? Maybe, if other people want to go but I'm too much of a health nut to become a regular.
