Pupusas for $1.50...oohh sooo good...but oohh soo greasy.

This resturaunt seems like Grandma's in the kitchen. The pupsas are a Salvidorian kinda thingy...

Hand made thick corn tortilla filled inside w/ cheese beans and pork.

My one and ONLY complaint is that thier cheese is too greasy, after it melts, out pours the oily mess. 

but hey, you'll love it and you'll never know until you try it. 

& YOU HAVE TO TRY IT!!!
