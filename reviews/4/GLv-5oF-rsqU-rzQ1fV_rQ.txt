I visited this Z Tejas a couple of months ago and had a fabulous time. The downstairs was about to close, but they said no problem seating us anyway. 
The bartender actually served us and did a great job. 
When about to order something he had tried and hadn't liked he gave his input and explained why. Which I appreciate the honesty about a product he didn't feel was up to standard, saving me the time trying it. 
My food was hot, and tasted great. 
Our server didn't know how I liked my sour cream so he brought out both ways. Cold and the way the chef served it. 
My drink was never empty. Service was honest. Food was hot. They did great and I plan to return again.
Unfortunately my second visit was less amazing, but still good.
