Laid back place. I had the best carnitas tacos ("mexicano style" soft corn tortillas, lime & cilantro) but honestly, some of the worse rice & beans I've ever had....skip those. And the sour cream comes in the little packages like you would get at Wendy's or something....The complimentary chips and salsa were great, and the staff friendly and attentive. Pretty decent food overall. We had a party of 8 for lunch and surprisingly they accommodated us immediately, but the place filled up quickly, and not all with just college students. FYI-The lunch specials are yummy and a great price-check them out.
