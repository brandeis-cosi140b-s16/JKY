Had to show my friends this place just to prove to them there is a filly-B's where you can eat on the table without worrying about diseases.  Nice staff, salsa bar, and delicious, cheap, filling mexican food (everything you look for in a FillyB's).  All Phoenicians know FillyB's are big time hit or miss and this one is a home run.  When I get if it 4 stars keep in mind I am comparing it to other fast food mexican stands.  with that in mind, it would get a 5 except that it isn't 24/7 which is half the appeal of any establishment that has erto's on the end of it.  Just in case you were expecting a greasy drunk meal tell you DD to save his gas because it won't be open at 3 AM like you'd expect.
