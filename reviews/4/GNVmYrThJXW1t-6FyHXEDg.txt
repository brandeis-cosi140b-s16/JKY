With my other options in the food court being hotdogs, macdonalds, and pizza, Tacos and Rita's was the obvious choice. 

Carmen was super friendly- a sincere people person. Even asked where I'm from and we discovered a mutual love of an establishment back home- how cool! I'm in hospitality too, and a nice personal interaction makes for a much more memorable experience- fact. 

I ordered the 3 tacos. They were enormous. I'm from LA so I was expecting teeny taco truck size tacos, so I ended up having a snack for later (my suite at The Signature had a kitchen so it worked out). If you don't eat huge portions the 1 taco with beans and rice may be a good option. 

The beef tacos were really tender and tasty. Carnitas were decent too, but I def preferred the beef. 

Overall a great value, messy and tasty.
