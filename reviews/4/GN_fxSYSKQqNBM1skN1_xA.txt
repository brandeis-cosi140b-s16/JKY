Sea of Cortez style Mexican food. Doesn't get much better than this.

The Shrimp Cuilici (sp) is the signature dish and the item I order the most. It consists of shrimp baked in a creamy pepper sauce with a layer of cheese. It all blends together in a gooey goodness that you can spoon over tortillas.

All the seafood is awesome there, cooked in several styles. I love Mexican food and I love seafood. San Carlos Bay is the best of both worlds.
