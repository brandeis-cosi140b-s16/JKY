I'm torn on 4 stars but the employees are so nice so I'm gonna give them 4.  I had a carne asada ques.  It was great.  My problem is it comes with green stuff which I hate.  And like others have said  it was extremely tiny. Like mini appetizer.  So yeah this is the most expensive fast food I ever had. Two mini things and a drink is gonna run about $15.  They gave me a taste of the pastor.  Its not my thing but I'm sure some will love it.  Quality food here. Fresh and clean.  You get what you pay for. I just wish the menu was more clear on the sizes.  Just know it's going to be expensive if you are hungry.  My quesadilla was the size of a street taco to give you an idea.
