I am typically a Fili B's girl as opposed to the generic ***berto's fan, but I can compromise since Fili B's are harder to find when you aren't in the EV.  I was really really craving a big ol' steak and egg burrito, and I knew the only way to satisfy that craving would be from one of these places.  We were on our way uptown and we ALWAYS see cars in the Eriberto's drive thru on our way to work, so I figured it had to be one of the better ones.  Oh man it is!  My burrito was more like a steak with egg burrito.  It probably weighed three pounds!  It was absolutely delicious, flavorful, and surprisingly not greasy!  I devoured a whopping half of it before I tapped out and then I ate the rest for breakfast the next morning, and yeah, it actually tastes just as good.  I can't really attest to the quality of the other menu items, but if they are even half as good as my burrito was, then you're in good hands.
