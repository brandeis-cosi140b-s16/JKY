Hey! Just went to Padres last night for a margarita. Went with a couple of friends, they ordered some apps, that I of course stole some bites of, and it was pretty yummy. I had a raspberry margarita, which was made just right, and I also had a sip of my friends sangria, which was okay. 

Last time I visited Padres, Cascabel was playing (they also played at my wedding) and they were so much fun and everyone was dancing and having a great time.

It's a cute little restaurant, with a cute little bar.
