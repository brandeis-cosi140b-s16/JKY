there are a lot of roberto's places in vegas.. yet all aren't the best.  this particular location is clean and the service is friendly and fast.  I love the carne asada nacho or fries..  and the carne asada California burrito!  

I like to call in and place my order on the phone if I'm not eating there... and if u do eat there, you'll definitely pick up the scent!  [it won't smell yummy like your food!]

a definite plus:  24 hours.. and they're on top of it at any hour!  roberto's is definitely a quick fix for my mexican food cravings!
