Love this place.  Every time we make the trip from Tucson to Phoenix I get this craving for Poncho's.  The building must have been an old house from the 1930's and converted into a restaurant.  There are so many nooks and crannys to get lost in.  But when you make your way in you are greeted by this lovely older lady who is full of piss and vinegar with a great sense of humor who leads you to your table.  We were there Sat. at about 2.00PM.  The place was packed with large families who seem to know the wait staff pretty well.  Everyone is so friendly and efficient which is a plus. Now to the real test.  The food is wonderful, rich in flavor and beautifully  presented.  Unfortunately, I am a wuss and order the same gringo dish (Chicken Enchilladas with green sauce)  Hubby orders Chile Relleno, tamale, combo plate.  The thing is those onions which are sauteed to perfection slathered all over the dish including the rice. This makes me real happy.  If you love onions this is surely the place.  It's a "must go" when heading up to Phoenix.
