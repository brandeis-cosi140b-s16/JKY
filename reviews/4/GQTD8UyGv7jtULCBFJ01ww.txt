We went there on the recommendation of a guy that works at the sports book in Eastside Cannery. I ordered a carne asada burrito. It was good size, about $5.50. It was a guacamole sauce and a ton of meat! No beans, no rice. A nice surprise, though next time I'd add beans. 
My friend had the carnitas plate. $8.25 (or $8 something). It had a lot of meat, beans, rice, lettuce and guacamole sauce. Also two huge flour tortillas. I tried it, and it was really good! The guy taking orders speaks English, but a heavy Mexican accent. He got our order right. You order at the counter, pay, then sit down. He will call you up to the counter when your food is ready. Seating is tight, the place was clean. You get your own cups of salsa.
