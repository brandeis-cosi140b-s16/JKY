All I can say is that my hubby (a.k.a. the man who eats to live not lives to eat) RAVED about how good their enchilada sauce was.  I think we have found our new favorite go-to mex place.  AND, last night was JAZZ NITE...a bit weird ambiance for a Mexican food restaurant but WAY FUN!  Can't wait to go back.
