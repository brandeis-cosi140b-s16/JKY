This place goes against tradition. usually when I go into mexican places and they are nice and well kept....it sucks. This place is awesome tho, the inside is decorated with some great murals, nice tables, cozy bar. The portions are huge and the prices are great. The only thing that I don't absolutely love about this place is the margarita prices. I find them a little steep. Its a great place to go for dinner though and I highly reccomend it.
