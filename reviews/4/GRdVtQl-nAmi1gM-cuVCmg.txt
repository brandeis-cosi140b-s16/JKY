I've been to this location several times. They grande bowl works well for my resolve to avoid carbs. I always it minus the sour cream, rice or chipotle sauce but its still very good.
What I loved was the fact that on my visit this weekend the person taking my order was super nice. She not only made sure that I got the right order but double checked by letting me know each of the other ingredients in the bowl. She even offered to give me extra veggies since I was not having some of the ingredients.

Oh - and I did not know, they have a catering menu as well!

Its the great service that makes me go back everytime, even though there is another Rubio's close to where I live!
