I feel kind of slimy giving this place, located in a gas station, 4 stars, but 3 just wouldn't be right. Same old Roberto's that's located on every corner in town, but with a drive-thru and open 24/7 - you can't beat that. I'd actually give them 5 stars, but they don't speaka that great and they're pretty slow. But the food's damn good, cheap and totally worth the wait.

Their breakfast burritos are huge and stuffed full of eggs, bacon, cheese, pico, potatoes and can easily feed two (unless you're a big eater). And their super nachos are loaded with cheese, carne, beans, sour cream, guac, jalapenos and are ginormous! 

I don't think they speaka good Ingles here though. Each time I've been through the drive through, I ask for red sauce and always get green sauce.
