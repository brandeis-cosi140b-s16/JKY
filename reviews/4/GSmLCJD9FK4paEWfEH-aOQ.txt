This place was featured on "Diners, Drive Ins and Dives," so I had to visit when I was in the area. It's run by five sisters (all beautiful). This is not a restaurant or a cafe in the usual sense, although there is limited indoor and outdoor seating. There is no table service, and don't complain about the wait. If you want fast "Mexican" food, go to Taco Hell.  This is a hole-in-the wall place in a strip mall that serves great food, according to the people who go there. Most of the lunch crowd were laborers and working types, waiting patiently for big orders of take out. The young woman at the cash register (wearing a tank top declaring, "boobies rock," with a pink breast cancer ribbon logo) is pleasant and efficient. When she bellows out your order number you wonder where the sound came from. She just grins.

I've only eaten here once, I admit, but the marinated pork burrito was to die for. Spicy, just the right amount of heat, with bits of cilantro adding just the right notes.
