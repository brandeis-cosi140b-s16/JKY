This is the best hangover food in Vegas! It's right off the strip and the food is great. For those that are not that familiar with birria, let me just tell you its the best medicine for hangovers. The meat was perfectly cooked. You can tell most of the local latino community goes to eat here, and let me tell you they dont come here for the fanciness or vegas glamour, they come here because the food is affordable and good.

Try birria with a cold Michelada as a breakfast and thank me later.
