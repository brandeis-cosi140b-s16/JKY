This tiny storefront restaurant has received a measure of notoriety since an article appeared in the Las Vegas Weekly indentifying it as celebrity Chef Alex Stratta's favorite restaurant for authentic Mexico City cuisine.  Alex was dining elsewhere this day, but the restaurant was fairly busy.  Orders are placed at the counter and then while waiting for the food you can munch on not so authentic taco chips served with two homemade salsas, tomatillo and chipotle.  We each ordered a bowl of consomm√© loco, a rich chicken broth with shredded chicken, avocado and fresh cilantro that were accompanied by a pair of fresh corn tortillas - muy bueno!

A week later we returned for lunch and again enjoyed the consomme loco.
