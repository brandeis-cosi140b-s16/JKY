Definitely something missing at this Chipotle compared to others I'm used to frequenting, yet still good. Somehow the 'Chipotle magic' is not fully there and needs to be brought in. However, the location is perfect, next to a yogurt shop and half a dozen other fast food places including across the street. The seating outside is nice, the place is well kept. I will continue coming cuz I love Chipotle and yes I'm a fan!
