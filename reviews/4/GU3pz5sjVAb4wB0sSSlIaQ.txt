Great place to get food.... If you can find a parking spot. 

Stopped in for some late afternoon lunch at what is known as the MetroCenter location (even though technically it is just outside of 'Metro' off of 30th ave and Peoria). Even at around 3pm there was a nice little line there, though it moved quickly enough for me. This location stays pretty busy and there aren't many times when there isn't a line. 


The food? 

Fresh and good. They do a great job there and the quality was fine by my snobbish Chipotle standards, which I acquired over my many years of eating burrito bowls and epic-sized burritos and chips. Anyway, the atmosphere is also nice and they keep this location clean. They also stop by your table and ask you how everything is and if there is anything else you need (while your stuffing your face full of beans, rice and chicken), my answer is always a muffled "mmm, gweat" as I try not to appear rude but also not wishing to speaking with my mouth full. 

The parking? 

Not so great. It shares a lot with what seems like two other strip malls that are adjacent and sometimes parking can really be challenge of suburban proportions. I got lucky this last time but I've also have gotten frustrated before trying to get in a spot, fighting a Tahoe, and avoiding glares from 40 something year old women as I beeline to the Chipotle door trying not to look at them after out maneuvering them for a spot. This is really my only negative with this location. The parking isn't great. 

Other than that, I love the food, the staff, the atmosphere of the location, and getting one over on the suburban mom/professional parking lot navigator, who normally swipes my spot with four kids inside and offers only a heartless sunglass-laden glance as I try to find another parking spot with my head down after getting worked over by them.
