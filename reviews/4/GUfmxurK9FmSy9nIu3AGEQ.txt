A definite hole in the wall, but good food, reasonably priced, wide selection (take your time looking over the menu and all of the additional/small signs posted around). The best part is a dedicated owner who does everything himself: a one man show, so be patient, this is not McDonald's. He has been serving the community in this same location for 17 years. Bravo, Pert! Stop in, have a bite, and take a moment to talk to this positive, dedicated man who loves to serve you.
If the atmosphere bothers you (it is not pretty) then take the food out to a park or home.
