I absolutely love the food, the vibe, the service and the location. I went with a party of six and every single person had an excellent experience. There were smiles all around, and full happy bellies. 

The flan is the best flan I have ever had. 


The only thing I can say is that it's a bit pricey for what it is, that brings it down one star.
