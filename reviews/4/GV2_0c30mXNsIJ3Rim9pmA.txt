I love this place! My son and I go for the "Fajita express" buffet. Both the chicken and the steak are super tender and yummy! The rice is also good, as is the adobada. I always get some guac, cheese, and sour cream.

The salsa bar is also great! I love how they have fresh limes : )

The chips and salsa are soooooooo good! I always wanna ask if they sell them to take home : ) 

The wait staff are super nice and I love the inside! I paid 11$ for my son and I to eat : ) I'll def be back!
