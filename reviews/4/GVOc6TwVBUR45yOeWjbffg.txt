The waiter was very friendly, and the atmosphere was relaxing. .  The drinks and food were VERY good!! I forgot to review their online menu ( as I do not eat meat) to see if there were any veggie options, but the waiter was very quick to suggest The avocado and red pepper burrito, with a side of black re-fried beans.  This ended up being a fantastic choice..  The service was very prompt as well.  I would come back if given the choice..
