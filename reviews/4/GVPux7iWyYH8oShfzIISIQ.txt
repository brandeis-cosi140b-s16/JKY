This was my second time visiting a Garcia's and first time to this location. We had a Living Social deal for a three course meal for two so I wasn't expecting anything over the top, but to my surprise the deal was a great one! We went on a Saturday so I assumed there would be a wait, however we were seated immediately by a hostess. After we sat a waitress came and took our drink order and we informed her then that we had the Living Social deal which helped because they had a special menu for it. I really like that there was a separate menu because many times you have to ask what can you order and waiters and waitresses don't know, which ends up wasting time. The deal came with two margaritas, which were quite large and great by themselves. We ordered the chimichunga appetizer, which again I thought would be a small one we would have to split, however there were seven of them the size of spring rolls. I ordered enchiladas such were good and we finished off the meal with fresh made sopapillas..mmmm yummy! The customer service was also outstanding, we were served my three people including the manager! This will be added to my favorites list!
