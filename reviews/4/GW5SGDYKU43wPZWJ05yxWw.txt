So I saw this place on DDD so of course I had to check it out it was pretty good the tacos were very filling and you could taste the fresh ingredients the jalape√±o mash potatoes left something to be desired but the tacos more than make up for it ...the atmosphere is Latin Kitch and it's in the art district so there are a lot of cool shops in the area if your up for it ..the best part about this place is the cilantro sauce That goes in the tacos I recommend this place simple fresh clean food !
