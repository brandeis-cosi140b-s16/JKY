Wow, I don't know what they do, but they do it well.  I have dined there multiple nights and tried the carnitas burrito, tacos, and refried beans.  They were all good.  Cheap, considering what you get.  I ate for 7.50 dollars one night, and splurged at 9.25 the next night, and got too much food.  The condiment bar is nice, as you can make your tacos or whatever, exactly the way you like them.  Bottled Pine-apple soda was good to wash it all down.  Yes, I'd go back.
