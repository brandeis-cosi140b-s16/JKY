We were unsure where to go for food, I had a craving for some Mexican food, Filipitos was my choice, but the wife wanted something a bit less greasy last night. Super Mex it was.

Knowing that drinks are $2.25 each and last time we both got entrees, we spent almost $30.00 for alright food, we went about things different. The chimichanga plate is usually enough for 2 meals for both of us, so we decided to split it this time.

Somehow, by the end of the meal, I was starving (not an uncommon thing for me in general - may be due to the fact I knew there was no more food available).

Our server was friendly and had a good personality, we didn't have to ask for drinks, she was just a little absent when our drinks were low for a few minutes.

Food quality was good, their chips and salsa are very tasty.
