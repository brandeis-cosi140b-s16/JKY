Thanks to the staff at Baja Fresh.  Your catered meal for our meeting on March 6 was a hit.  I was able to cover all my special requests for no red meat, vegetarian and gluten free in one order and noone went hungry.  We had the Fajita Feast with both chicken and steak, all the fixings (plus a little more), chicken tacos, cheese quesadillas and the sweet churros to finish off the meal.  There was enough leftover for others outside the meeting to sample too.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the slight confusion and delay (15 min) in delivery, but a solid 4.5.  This is our second meal from this location and we will be back!
