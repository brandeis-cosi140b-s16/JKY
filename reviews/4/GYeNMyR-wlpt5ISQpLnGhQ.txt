I just love this place! We have been a few times now since living in the neighborhood
and will for sure be back.
I thought it was pretty rad that you could tag up the walls!
If you make a make it a combo then you get a drink, rice and chips and salsa.
I really like the "Carne Asada Quesadilla" it is just chocked full of flavor.
The burritos are huge and the tortillas very tasty.
For the 2 of us to eat it averages about $22 and worth every penny.
Give this little gem a try if you haven't yet!
The parking lot can be full depending on the time of day but the way the lot is grouped together it isn't a far walk from wherever you do end up parking.
