Yummy, great change of pace from your normal AYCE brunches in Vegas. I came here this past weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday, and they set us up in a private dining room for our 40+ person party.  

Must Get:
Green Corn Tamale
Plantain Empanada
Peruvian Shrimp and Grits - A fav amongst my friends
Skirt Steak and Egg - Top dish here!
Breakfast Fries - Reminscent of lomo saltado
Fig and Blue Cheese Quesadilla
Green Eggs and Ham
Waffle and Pork Belly -Generous pork belly portion

Ok:
Machacha Chilaqueles
Biscuit and Sausage Gravy
Lobster Pancakes - The lobster was really just a tablespoon of shredded lobster

Skip:
Churro Tots
Breakfast Enchilada - The tortilla on the bottom was hard
Sweet Potato Pancake - The syrup was too thick! I would imagine the pancake by itself is good. I would definitely ask for the syrup on the side next time
Yucatan Egg Benedict - The bread absorbed the egg flavor too much, imo.

Unfortunately, for a party this big, they charged as all for the unlimited mimosas, although a good number of us did not have mimosas. We made sure they took away our glasses for people who didn't drink, but one of the waiters even said "I don't believe that you're not drinking". I thought she was joking when she said that, but I guess it was true because when the bill came, they charged us all for mimosas. Kind of upsetting, because at the very end, people had already left cash for the bill and left, and the birthday boy ended up eating the rest of the bill. The service for the mimosas was great though, they basically left bottles of champagne on the table for us and brought new ones when we ran out.

Overall, the food here was really good and a lot of these dishes had a generous portion of scrambled eggs.  For the sweets dishes, they were all a little too sweet though. Service was good, they kept coming out with food and they were even nice enough to give us just steak when we asked.
