3.5 stars

I met a couple of friends at Julio G's the other night.  It was each of our first time there and we were actually pretty impressed.  It reminded me of a diner-type of feel - old school Mexican (Sonoran style I believe).   Very festive, and with this location's open air facility, it was refreshing.  (Not sure what it would be like on a summer night though!)

Our server was really attentive and sweet.  We tried not to fill up on chips and salsa - always a challenge at Mexican restaurants and this was no exception.  Their salsa was fairly mild but delicious!  For our entrees, I had the shrimp fajitas while one friend had the veggie fajitas and another had chicken soft tacos.  Servings are pretty big - and everything we ordered came with rice and beans.

My shrimp fajitas were sered in a spicy sauce that wasn't amazing... or maybe there was just too much of it.  Next time, I'll go with the veggie or perhaps chicken fajitas instead.  We were all too full for dessert... The total with everything i mentioned plus a beer and a diet coke came to $47 and change.  Not cheap but not crazy expensive.  Luckily, we had a $50 gift card; always a bonus!

Overall, good Mexican experience - family friendly, attentive service, good food, easy parking situation, etc.... I'm sure I'll be back.  

Hasta la proxima vez, Julio G!
