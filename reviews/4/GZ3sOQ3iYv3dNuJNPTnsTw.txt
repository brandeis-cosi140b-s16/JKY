Expected the worst, was pleasantly surprised! We happened upon happy hour and enjoyed decent margaritas! Didn't taste like overly synthetic bar mix and were sufficiently boozey! We ordered some taquitos and flautas which were pretty great! The pork was juicy and flavorful and the taquitos were crispy and nicely seasoned. Served with a ridiculous amount of sour cream and some tasty guacamole. Overall a great place to get tipsy before you gamble away all of your hard earned pennies.
