It's a chain so obviously if you have been to a chipotle you know what you are going to get. Great food that isn't bad for you. 

The location in champaign on green street is always busy with a line to the door. It gets a little frustrating but if I'm craving chipotle I will wait in the line because there is nothing better than a steak burrito with white rice, black beans, pico, and lettuce!
