After moving to the 'hood (and having driven past the place dozens of times), Hubs and I finally decided to give Loco Lime a try. We met some friends there for dinner before an event later that evening. 

Protip: give yourself plenty of time. Though there weren't many people there, the food seemed to take a long time to come out. Note: our server was *great*, super friendly, and came back to check on us many times, giving advice as to what was good, even unsolicitedly bringing out a dish of limes that he thought would go well with my order, and sincerely thanking us for coming in at the end of the meal, so I am definitely NOT faulting the service - just the kitchen seemed a little slow in comparison to other Mexican faves in the area.

It was all worth the wait, though. Chips were served hot, salsa was fresh, and everything we ordered was delicious. We had one vegetarian in our group who RAVED about his veggie-changa (sweet plantains inside! so novel!), and had enough left over to box up for lunch the next day. Husband chowed down his barbacoa tacos before I even saw what they looked like (I guess they were good?), and another friend made a worthy dent in her massive order of ground beef enchiladas. My blackened shrimp tacos were some of the most fresh and flavorful that I've ever had - and the server was right, the limes were the perfect complement.

Now that Husband and I live much closer to Loco Lime than we used to, we'll definitely be making this a regular haunt.
