Great for what it is. My family and I visit this taco shop often and I sometimes study here for school - when I don't need wi-fi. They have very consistently delicious tacos. And most of the food is pretty on par.

Every once in a while we get a mess up or they're pretty slow. But overall, they are great, family owned, local, authentic taco shop.
