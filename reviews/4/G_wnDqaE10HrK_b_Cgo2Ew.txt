So family brought home some food from Huauchinango a week ago or so, and let me tell you it was good. We got the pork with mushrooms, a few carne asada tacos, chicken mole (showing my lack of Spanish speaking), as well as something I still have no idea what it was. 

The pork was good, by itself nothing special but enjoyed the sauce it came with (was a salty sauce) and went well with the mushrooms. The rice that came with it was nothing special but was good to mix in. 

The mole was the really stand out of the bunch, I don't know a lot about mole, but this one had great spice flavor, and a good smoky flavor to it. It is definitely something I would go back for time and time again, I'll even skip the chicken and just have mole. 

The tacos were fine, nothing special, but nothing terrible. They are cheap, and that is the best part. 

The stuff we have no idea about, it was like a orange soup with maccaroni in it, no idea what it was called but I liked it. It isn't going to blow your mind, but the broth had a good flavor (a bit like gravy to me). Not much else I can say about it.
