On a nice sunny day you cant beat this location.  We sat at the bar with a view of the strip and took it all in.  Good beer and margaritas.  Of course we did the nachos.  Our plate was loaded with huge pieces of chicken.  Happy hour is good and the spinning wheel of specials keeps you around.  We will be back.
