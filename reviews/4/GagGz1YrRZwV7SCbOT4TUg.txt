If you don't like garlic or spicy heat then this is not the place for you. 

Upon reading some of my my fellow Yelpers reviews, I see that slow, disorganized service has been a sore point for them. Our experience was the complete opposite. We were warmly greeted, seated immediately, had our order taken promptly, our food arrived from the kitchen quickly and our severs were very attentive.

The complimentary chips were served with a green and a red salsa. Both salsas were zippy, but not excessively so, with nice balanced flavors. We ended up going through two bowls of each because I smothered my burrito with salsa, yum! The only downside was that the chips were pretty and multi-colored but right out of a bag. Give me monochromatic chips right from your fryer and you will have a friend for life!

We all ordered burritos (burros in AZ?). I selected the plain chicken one which was fabulous. The chicken had been stewed until it almost melted like butter in my mouth.  I had a close encounter with a whole clove of garlic and a small bone but successfully avoided a crisis with each of them. 

The portion sizes are humongous! My husband and I could have easily shared one plate and still left very full. Even our ice teas were served in what looked like 40oz glasses! 

We are looking forward to returning to try their adovada ribs. If they do something about the tortilla chips and watch the bones Los Dos Molinos will earn 5 stars from me.
