Typical Chipotle restaurant. I prefer this place over Qdoba any day because of their awesome-sized burritos and tasty chicken.  However, I wish this franchise supported the military and offered a discount to the vets. Cost to eat there gets pricey w/my appetite, but still enjoyable to eat once in a blue moon.
