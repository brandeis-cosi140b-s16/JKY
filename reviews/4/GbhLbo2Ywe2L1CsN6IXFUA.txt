The service was great! The bartender during happy hour was informative and attentive! While the food was good I wish it was more memorable, besides the burning sensation of spiciness in my tummy I actually don't remember what our  food really tasted like! We will probably come back to try something else and see if anything else would be more memorable!! I would say give it a try!!
