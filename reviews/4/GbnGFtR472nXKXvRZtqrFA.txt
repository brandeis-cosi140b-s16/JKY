More Taco Monday madness. 

Guacamole at $7 was nice and chunky, fairly no frills with just cheese on top
Grilled Shrimp Taco - $3 - best taco of the night, loaded with corn and good shrimp
The Treat bar - Most of these sundaes are about $5. We tried the Smores which had all the smores ingredients, but the "ice cream" was actually that frozen soft serve stuff. So it seems like your getting a good deal, but it wasn't bad and is a cool ending to your meal. 

Patio still nice and even had a good waitress.
