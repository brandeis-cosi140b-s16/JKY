The taco gods heard my cries, what luck would I have to stumble upon John's review? I hopped in my car and head right over...same place different folks, they're a bit confused and it took some repeating to get my order placed but once placed everything was as I remember it 2 months ago when Dan was the front man....wherever you are I hope all is well and you will be missed.

I ordered my usual for my son & self, asada taco, tostadas, and fish tacos....got home and they screwed up my tostadas - no meat, bean only..which I will call them about - one second thought maybe I won't there's no number listed.

Other than this mishap its back to business as usual over there
