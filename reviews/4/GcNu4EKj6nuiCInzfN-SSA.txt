I haven't been to the Emiliano's in the North Side (that many people have recommended to me), but the one on Carson in the South Side was very good. A step up in quality and taste, I have gotten take out from them several times, and have never been disappointed. The tamales in particular were moist and tasty - something that is easily and often overcooked. My chile rellenos were also very good. I recomment the Emiliano's Special which is huge with many different typical mexican dishes, and will satisfy just about anyones appetite.
