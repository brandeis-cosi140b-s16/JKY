For years, I have fallen victim to Del Taco and its remarkably delicious soft chicken tacos.  From my time in California, to my move to Vegas years ago, my joy was no greater than discovering that my favorite junk food would carry over with me to this new state.

Over a decade later, I still retain a soft spot for the soft chicken taco, and this Del Taco is not a disappointment in this regard.

Regarding this location, the service is polite, the lines are fast, and to date, I've never had an issue with my order.  It's located in a shopping center next to a bar, and outside of the many 'Bertos taco variants, this is the other preferred meal of choice after ingesting a few liquid libations, or late night "I have to eat something" snack.  This location has gotten me through a few rough nights of working late.

That said, it's not the building, location, prices, or service that I take issue with.  It's the drive through customer.  I was reminded of this just today as the woman ahead of me screamed a string of profanities at the hapless girl inside the window as she sped away.  For you see, this isn't the first time I've witnessed something like this at this location.

Maybe they're drunk from the local bar.  Maybe it's just something about the neighborhood.  Maybe these people are just stupid.  Or just mental.  Who can say, really?  All I know is I feel for the customer service, because as mentioned before, the people working here really are nice.  The only fast food place I can think of that actually initiates a brief "How are you" conversation, and sounds like they actually mean it.

Regardless, this is a decent location that actually makes use of a paraphrased (and edited) line from "Clerks": This place would be great if it wasn't for the fudging customers.

Well said, Randal.  Well said.
