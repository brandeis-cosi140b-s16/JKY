Authentic Mexican food. They make their lemonade the hispanic way with limes. Soooo good. Crowded during peak hours of lunch and dinner. No alcohol, but the food is the best. Looking for good Mexican food this is your spot. Nothing on the menu will go wrong. It is a place to try good quality mexican food.
