Went here for a company party a while back, so we had a private room and were limited to certain items set up buffet-style, so that's probably part of the reason I can only give it four stars at this time. Cheese crisp was ok, rice was decent, and the tacos were alright. I'm not a fan of bigger chunks of green peppers, onions, etc. mixed in with ground beef, and that's how they make theirs. I was a big fan of the salsa though, if you like it HOT there is no doubt that you must give Los Dos a try. I also have to give them credit for making a vicious Margarita. I didn't try one myself (I don't do tequila), however my dad who rarely drinks polished off two before our meal just to cope with the heat of the salsa, and ended up having ME drive home, with HIM hanging out the window like a teenage kid drunk on Mad Dog 20/20 for the first time! Absolutely one of the most hilarious nights of my life, and I have Los Dos Molinos to thank. Awesome!
