One of the best bean and cheese burritos ever. Great salsa verde. Drove through after work two nights in a row (after the first night I was hooked.)

I was skeptical at first, but they are friendly folks who know authentic Mexican cuisine. 

Super bomb burrito! I bet the rest of the food is pretty darn good.

Only downside-limited English so if you have a lot of questions or need custom orders you're kinda screwed.
