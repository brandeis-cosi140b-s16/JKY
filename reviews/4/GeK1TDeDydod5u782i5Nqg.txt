As good as it gets for the fast Mexican /drive through style restaurant. I haven't tried everything yet so cannot give 5 stars but its about there.

The carnitas are a must (can put them it pretty much any form, on fries, in burritos, in tortas etc). Beans are good and fish tacos are better than rubios. They give you plenty of food here for the money. One odd thing is they do not have any adovada type meat. They have several mexican drinks (horchata, bottled meixcan sodas, etc)

Salsa bar is definitely more authentic mexican style (so my mexican wife says). Nice variety with Red, Diablo (should be hotter with that name), green, chile/oil, carrots, roasted chiles. 

For south Chandler this is the best place i have tried so far in this genre.
