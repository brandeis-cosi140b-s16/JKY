This place is definitely good with me! 

I stopped in Friday for their 2 taco daily special with chips, queso and a drink. 

Yum! 

The staff was super friendly and the place was very clean. I ordered one steak and one pulled pork taco on crispy shells with lettuce, cheese, fresh jalapenos, sour cream and corn salsa. 

Simply delish!  

The steak and pulled pork were both seasoned very well. And they are plentiful with the toppings here, which is a huge win! 

Best part...the queso! OMG! Seriously, whenever you can...get it! It's worth it! 

There you have it, short and sweet. They have GOOD stuff here!! Plus it's a very convenient location for me, so I'm sure to be a regular!
