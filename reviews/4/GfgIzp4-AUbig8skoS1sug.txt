Dr. E and I ate at Rio Rico's last night after returning from downtown Phoenix events and I wanted to update my review... First of all, this restaurant is remarkably and refreshingly free of corporate operating style people... Entering Rio Rico you are greeted by people who may not have been trained in the chain restaurants schools of management, but who are genuinely happy to see you walk into their establishment. Seating is approached like match making, based in what is right for YOU, rather than a seating distribution chart. Appetizer recommendations such as the guacamole are based on what is fresh and in-season rather than the most profitable sale. I ordered the #11 combo plate with a Chile Relleno and a Tamale, along with an Arnold Palmer to drink. Everything wad served promptly, in the right portion sizes and was muy delicioso! I highly recommend Rio Rico because it is simply the real deal... You've got to try it!
