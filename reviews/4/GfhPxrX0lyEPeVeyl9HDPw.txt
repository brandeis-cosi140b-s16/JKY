My wife is a Mexican dining snob who loved the food at El Encanto de la Fuente. We had outstanding house Margarita's to start off the night. I must say the chips and salsa was great! I couldn't stop nibbling on them. Our waitress, Alysha, did an outstanding job of explaining the dinner specials and was extremely attentive to our table of six. 

Each of our party of six ordered something different and everyone rant and raved about how good it was. I had the salmon and shrimp dinner. The fish was cooked perfect....
