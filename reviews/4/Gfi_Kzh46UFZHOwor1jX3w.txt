If you ever crave Mexican and you are in the CU area, this is definitely one of the places to try. They serve their food very fast. If you sit in then they bring you chips and sauce.

There's so many choices I usually end up getting two things and being full fast. It's worth the price. I always get a carne asada burrito. The meat tastes good and the tortilla doesn't taste stale. I hardly ever get a bad meal from here. Highly recommend.
