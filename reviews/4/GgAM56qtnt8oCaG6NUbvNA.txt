My husband and I visited this place during our recent trip to Vegas. This was by far our favorite restaurant during our trip. 

I ordered the chicken quesadilla with a Pina Colada margarita and thoroughly enjoyed both.  My husband ordered the chicken nachos and he enjoyed those as well.

The service was great as well. We will definitely visit this place again on our next visit to Vegas!
