I ordered the surf n turf plate ( Steak and shrimp fajitas with refried beans,rice and tortillas) , a special not on their regular menu . Owner was super friendly and suggestive . The meal was good , well priced and made to order . If you want a spicy sauce , ask for the "Fuego" , a spicy sauce with really good flavor !! Lots of interesting options , their breakfast menu looked great as well . Wish this place served alcohol or atleast beer !!
