I took my wife there a week ago friday night.  I would rate it a 5 but the service could be lots better. It was dinner time and it was not crowded. We were seated right away but took some time for someone to come wait on us. Once the waitress finally got our drink order she did come back to check on us and get our food order. The service could have been much better considering there was hardly anyone in there.  We both ordered margaritas which were great. My wifes was some kinda fruit mango something but mine was more traditional. Small but not too pricey.  I ordered the seafood platter which was clams and then shrimp in the middle over rice. Camarones Diablo I think. It was plenty of food. Mexican food is not my favorite but this was great!  I dont know what my wife ordered and she LOVES Mexican food and she loved her food too. The service got better and the food was definitely worth it. Id love to try other dishes and dessert too. We did get the certificate from Yelp which you pay $10 and get $20 off your bill. So that was nice too. Definitely will go back but hope the service gets much better.
