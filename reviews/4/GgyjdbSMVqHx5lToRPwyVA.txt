The food here is bomb just don't go around lunch time during weekdays, not only is it crowded but they rush and end up ruining your food. Also today the lady tried to charge me 15$ for 3 beef tacos and a side of rice which is usually 8.50$ or something. Really good at anytime but not from 11-3 on weekdays.
