Bottom line... 3.5 stars. Decent place to pick up a cheap lunch if you are in the area.

They have great prices for lunch ($6 to $8). While their lunch menu is limited in options, you can order a lunch portion of pretty much everything on their dinner menu. The Jerk Chicken (which doesn't scream Mexican to me) was highly recommended by staff. I personally wasn't too crazy about it. The pineapple/cheese sauce that the chicken was sitting on was cold (maybe it was supposed to be) and too sweet for my liking. The temperature contrast between the chicken and sauce didn't do it for me. My coworkers ordered the Arroz Con Pollo (ACP) and Cali Burrito and seemed to enjoy it. My biggest complaint... they charge 25 cents per take out item.
