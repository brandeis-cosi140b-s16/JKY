I'm here all the time, it's the perfect neighborhood spot to grab a bite and drink and chill. It's not obnoxious and overly loud, you can just grab a booth and relax, it's dark lighting and cool, it's NOT your typical mexican-cantina. Dos Gringos has nothing on this place, I HATE DOS GRINGOS, it's sloppy, sticky, disgusting, and the food is garbage, not to mention the awful staff. Juan Jaime's has good food, it's simple but good. The staff at Juan's is also nice and accommodating, they know their people and take care of them the right way.

Juan Jaime's is a big win in my book for offering whole wheat tortillas...nobody else does I swear. They make a good burrito, they make good tacos, it's a good bite every time, I never have a bad experience eating here, and I don't get bored of it either!

I love coming here to just chill and fill up, it's relaxed, it's cool, it's a place to be.
