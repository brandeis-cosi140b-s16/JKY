If you like chipotle you will love this place. But they don't have the vegan friendly soy option. Yet. 
The buffalo chicken is house add and fantastic. So if you're feeling like supporting a local place and feel like eating a burrito or taco that you could've gotten at chipotle this is your place. The vegetarian option currently is only saut√©ed vegetables but otherwise a decent place.
