Had dinner at Taco Migo tonight.  Just down the street from my home.  They have a drive thru, but we wanted the full experience, and are glad we did.  
Service - super friendly staff, food came out quickly and order was accurate.
Ambience - very clean, well decorated, and really big inside with plenty of room for a crowd.
Food - I ordered the Migo Tacos and my husband ordered the Migo Burrito on recommendation from the cashier.  The ingredients are good quality and the beef in my tacos was tender and flavorful.  The pico de gallo at the salsa bar made the tacos even better.  Really liked the tortillas.
Other things I liked were that not only did they have the typical coke products at the fountain, but they also had self serve Aguas Frescas.  I had the Pina Colada, which was very tasty and not too heavy.  My husband got the Tamarindo which he said was too sweet for his taste.  I also liked the free chip bar and the salsa bar.  The guacamole salsa was awesome.
Overall, great place I'd go back to again for a cheap, quick, clean, tasty dinner.  This place is open 24 hours, though, so if you need to cure a late night craving, they've got help for that.
I hope this new place does well.  I think it's a family owned place.
