I think "Seat Yourself" means they are understaffed and will get to our party as soon as they possibly can.  There were 4 servers trying to service the entire restaurant during the lunch rush.

Not going to complain about airport food or pricing at JCT, it's as competitive as most of the tex-mex/Mexican places I've been to in recent years.  Spicy Mango margarita was not particularly spicy but it was tasty.  Burrito (Mexican style) was also tasty.

My only complaint - no chips & salsa for the table?
