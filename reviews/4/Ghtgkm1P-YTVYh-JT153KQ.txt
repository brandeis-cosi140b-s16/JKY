First time coming here to eat, the line was pretty long, and a huge birthday party was going on as well. Thinking our food would take firever, I was definitely wrong! Not only was my chicken fundido super moist and delicious it came out not even four minutes after we sat down! Then they were having seasonal horchata advertise but we didn't want to buy a whole thing if we ended up not liking the flavors, so we asked the girl who served us our food if we get a sample and she wasn't sure, but asked anyways. As busy as it was we thought she forgot about us because 10 minutes had passed by but then she came over with the samples and the salted caramel horchata was delicious! My boyfriend got two different burritos with shredded beef and it was super tender and juicy I couldn't stop taking it off of his plate lol. For a fast food sit down type chain it was definitely delicious!
