It's a restaurant inside of a rundown strip-mall, so I almost didn't go in at all. But I had heard good things about this Chinese/Mexican fusion, so I had to try it out. I wasn't disappointed. Their food was amazing. The Jade Red Chicken is a must and everything that I've tried on the menu (been there a few times  now) is flavorful and delicious. Large partions. And the staff is friendly and helpful for newbies (there menu ordering system is confusing). You can even try samples of things if you're not sure what you want.  I'm always in the mood for Chino!
