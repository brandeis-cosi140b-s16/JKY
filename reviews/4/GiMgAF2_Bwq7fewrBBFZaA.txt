So delicious! I stumbled upon this place a few months ago on Yelp, and knew I had to try it. I dragged a friend in and instantly we were hooked. We were greeted with smiles and a large bowl of chips, salsa, AND guacamole. 

On my first visit I went straight Fusion Taco. One beef, one chicken, and one pork. The waitress asked if I wanted kimchi on top and I most certainly did. All three tacos were fabulous and for $1.29 each you can't really go wrong. My friend and I made the rookie mistake of each ordering three tacos and an order of Fusion Bulgogi Fries (everyone raved about them on yelp so we had to give them a shot). We were so stuffed after the three tacos that we barely made a dent in the fries, but they were great.

On my second visit I went with tofu fusion tacos and even tried one as a lettuce wrap. They were both great, but I forgot to ask for kimchi so not quite as tasty as the first visit. 

Visit komex with a big appetite and expect a bit of a wait if you're going at peak dinner/lunch hours. And, don't forget to request kimchi on your fusion tacos!
