I did go back to this place after my first review and again I had really good service! Like the first time. I liked the fact that someone was going around asking for suggestions on how to make the place better, shows that they care about their customers. It was just a first bad experience, I definitely want to try the rest of the menu! And my favorite beer Victoria on draft!
