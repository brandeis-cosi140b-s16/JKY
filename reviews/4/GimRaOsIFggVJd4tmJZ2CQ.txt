I had to visit this place twice before I could write my review. My first visit didn't go so well a few months ago. However, I think it may have been my fault.

I ordered the adobada fries the first time around, and was not impressed. The fries were soggy, and didn't hold up well to the mountain of toppings that were piled on top. In my opinion, the fries need to be crispy so you can pick them up and eat them like nachos. I also ordered no sour cream on my fries, and somehow my order arrived with extra sour cream.  Since I had waited almost 20 minutes for the fries, I didn't feel like waiting even longer by sending them back. Instead, I tried to eat underneath the sour cream  and focus on what was good- THE ADOBADA.

The gentleman with the jungle knife cuts from the hanging pork with precision. I decided to try the tacos this time around. With a few quick strokes, the perfect amount of pork falls into two corn tortillas and the choice is yours on what comes next. You can add cilantro, onions, salsa, avocado, and pineapple. I chose to skip the avocado sauce-- as it is just too runny. I would prefer real slices of avocado rather than this watered down version of green goo. I am not a huge fan of pineapple, but somehow this could be the best thing that ever happened to a taco. The flavor combination will make your head spin. My only small complaint is that the salsa is too mild for my liking. I was in a hurry, so I forgot to get one of those roasted jalapenos off the grill. 

This place doesn't offer rice or beans, but with tacos this good -- I honestly didn't miss them. The tacos were $2.00 a piece, and I put down three with relative ease. On a good day, it would probably take 4 or 5 to fill me up, On the other hand, I probably shouldn't be eating that much anyway - TAKE IT EASY FAT BOY! 

5 stars for the tacos

Minus 1 star for no rice and beans and terrible fries.
