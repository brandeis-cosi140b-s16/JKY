I have been going to Rosita's for years now. First started going to the one in Tempe but now that I live in Mesa I frequent this location most often. If there is one great thing about Rosita's it is the consistency, I have never been disappointed and the food is always great. The food is served quickly too so if you're starving like I usually am when I come the wait isn't long for it to be made. Portion size is fantastic, you get a lot of bang for your buck and a buck goes a long way. The girlfriend and I can get a great meal with leftovers for around $25. The only knock I can give is the service itself, it varies from time to time and usually tends to be on the subpar side.
