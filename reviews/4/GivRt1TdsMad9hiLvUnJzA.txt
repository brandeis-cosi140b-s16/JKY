During a business trip to Phoenix, I missed this place during lunch so I made sure to come for dinner. The walk from the Westin wasn't too bad. For some reason I thought downtown Phoenix wouldn't be such a GHOST TOWN! I mean there's hardly anyone or anything moving around at night.

I was pleased to find this Chipotle in the same shopping center as Lucky Strike, which just happened to be my next destination. There were maybe 3 other tables taken at the Chipotle. There were probably 3 or 4 people working. When I walked in, I felt welcomed and I felt a sigh of relief from the cashier because downtown Phoenix is SO DEAD! I made a little conversation and was assured that it's always like this lol.

The food was fresh and delicious! It definitely met my expectations and I felt great after eating my dinner. Overall it was a great experience and I definitely recommend this place for any people traveling. It's quick, easy and depending on what you get can be decently healthy :)
