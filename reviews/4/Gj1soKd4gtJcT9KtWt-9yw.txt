Great spot for late night eats. The carne asada tacos were street taco size, and were filled with delicious marinated beef. They were $1.50 each. We also had some horchata, which wasn't super sweet like how other kinds can get, and was very cool and refreshing. I didn't see any hours posted on the door, but we were there on a Saturday night at 11 P.M. and they were still open.
