I recently had their breakfast burrito and was it really good.  Egg, ham, cheese, pico de gallo.  The thing was a monster.  It was filling enough for me to still be full at lunch time.  Combine the breakfast burrito with their red sauce and you have one heck of a meal.  Definitely worth going back again.
