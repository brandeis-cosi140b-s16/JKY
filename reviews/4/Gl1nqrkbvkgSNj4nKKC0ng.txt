The food is the normal Chipotle fare.  It's just as good as any other good Chipotle, so talking about the food really isn't needed.  If you don't like other Chipotles you won't like this one.

The location was very close to the hotel my company put me up in, which made it great for me.  There wasn't a lot of parking, so if I had to drive here that might have been an issue.

Inside it's the typical Chipotle setup, with some tables, booths and stools.  There was a good line, but still plenty of free seats so that's good.  The best part was the staff.  While I felt they were a bit slower than at my local Chipotle, they were very friendly.  We had a few laughs and it made waiting for my burrito that much better.

Overall this is a great Chipotle and if I'm back next year, I'll be sure to stop by again.
