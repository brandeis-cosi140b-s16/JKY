This might be the best pizza in Madison. 

I'd never had Salvatore's before, and I have to say, it was delicious. We got the burrata appetizer and the Carbonara Pizza. Both were wonderful. The burrata was fresh and refreshing. Which was a good starter before the Carbonara. The pizza was rich and delicious. The egg on it was perfectly done, which is an accomplishment.

The beer list is great for such a small place. They have a lot of local crafts, as well as craft beers from other places in the Midwest (Three Floyds, Founders, ect.) 
 
The only reason I can't quite give the place 5 stars yet is the atmosphere. It is a cramped place which is too bad because I'm sure it is only going to get busier. We had to wait 1 hour on a Tuesday (which turned out to be actually shorter than waits at other pizza places in town that night). That doesn't bother me as much, but the wait staff did seem a bit flustered with the bustle. My guess it is new restaurant jitters and that this place will be THE place soon.
