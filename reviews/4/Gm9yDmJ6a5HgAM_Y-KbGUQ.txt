This place has a great value and yummy flavors. I got a mini taco combo with chile verde pork, shredded chicken, and shredded beef.

Pork: tasty, good flavor 
Chicken: bland, meh
Beef: SO GOOD! Seriously, this took me back to my childhood with the same taste of a place a grew up with.

Salsas
Red hot: taste like too much paprika or something, I didn't like it
Hot green: yum! Nice flavors.

I'll be back for sure!
