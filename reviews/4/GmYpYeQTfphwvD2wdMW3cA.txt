This was all I wanted to eat after my mega 15 hour NYE shift. I had the California burrito loaded with flavor and all kinds of goodness. I've had many things from here over the years, and I'm not sure why this place has gotten some of its unfavorable reviews? It's simple, it's good. No complaints from me! I love the carne asada fries especially, but try not to eat them too often as I'm watching my girlish Gremlin figure. A+, Roberto's. Keep it yummy! xo
