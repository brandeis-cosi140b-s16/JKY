What I typically think about Qdoba is that it's just like Chipotle just not as good. I was in the mood for a burrito bowl and Qdoba was much closer than Chipotle so I thought I'd give them a chance. Pretty much all the same options as Chipotle. They offer brown rice as well, but I decided on white. 

Service was quick and satisfactory. Nothing amazing or noteworthy but it sufficed and I was in and out in less than five minutes. I took my meal home to eat and it was tasty and relatively healthy, depending on what you choose to eat. 

Overall the experience was a 3 1/2 star, but I rounded up for convenience sake. I have to remember that it's in the area, which I always seem to forget.
