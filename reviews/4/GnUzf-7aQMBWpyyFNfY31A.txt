I love the food here, and thanks for the margaritas, well blended!!!  We always order the Para La Mesa (Meat), the steak is perfectly cooked, tasty and juicy, just enough for 3 people and with all the trimmings.  I hope nothing will change here, i mean when restaurants are still new, the menu is always good, then after a couple of years, starts to decline, quality of food is bad, prices is expensive, then the staff will give attitude. As a local, i think this is the best place on the Strip to hangout and bring out-of-town relatives and friends. My third time it was always good, see you next month, we have friends coming :)  Oh the staff are always friendly here!!!
