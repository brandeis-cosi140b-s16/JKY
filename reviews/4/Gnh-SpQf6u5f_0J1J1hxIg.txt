Morazan serves Central American food at the best price around. Their portions are huge, and the plates are always so neatly garnished. They have an extensive menu that includes Mexican, Salvadoran, Guatemalan, and Honduran food. All the items are described in English and Spanish and includes lots of pictures which help with the language barrier for some customers. I've been here several times and the service is decent, the waitresses often check on our table and the wait on the food is not long. They also have lunch specials that are a steal. Bigger than dinner plates at most places and under $10, and to top it off, their corn tortillas are always hand made. I don't understand why anyone will go and pay twice as much for mediocre Latin food at some of the hipster places around town when this restaurant is so close to the city, particularly South end. The only reason for four stars is because the staff needs some training on personal skills. The body language on some waitresses could be seen as cold or not caring. Most likely it's just cultural. I've experienced the same thing at other ethnic places and don't take it personal.
