Favorite taco shop in Maricopa. Liked them more when they were in the dive across the tracks, had a homier feel even though it was a bit of a dump... But this place has good food, nice people running it, and reasonable prices.
They could give you a few more chips in their little chip boats though...
Love their chile rellenos, their red pork is killer.
Great place to get lunch or takeout, dining area is clean though a little sterile...
