I almost never write reviews but I feel like this experience warrants one. it's 7 am on a Friday morning and no one I've come in contact with this morning at the airport has been particularly cheerful. I've barely gotten a smile out of anyone. this changed with Cortney at Los Taquitos.  she greeted me with a smile and thanked me for waiting.  good customer service goes a long way with me and this girl has it!plus the breakfast burrito was pretty tasty with big chunks of bacon. no skimping here!
