I love this place for 2 reasons... their 4 cheese nachos and their 2-for-1 drink special. I can't quite comment on anything else because everytime I go I get the same thing. I did recently have their wings and those were very good. The 4 cheese nachos though are just amazing, at $14 it seems a bit overpriced but you can easily share it and still be full. Everytime I am out in Vegas I try to stop by here just for the nachos!! Everything else on the menu is very overpriced though. Stick to the basics here.
