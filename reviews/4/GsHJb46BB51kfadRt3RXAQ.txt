A coworker who lives far far away recommended this spot. I tried it out about 2 weeks ago and it lived up to her hype. I ordered up a loaded quesadilla, and wow it was amazing. Really generous portion too. It came out on a medium pizza tray! I also had some baja style fish tacos, so I ended up taking some home. I saw a trio of police eating there, and saw that they didn't contribute to the 25 cent refill container as they got sodas after being there a while, eating. Perhaps they ponied up a bit earlier than when I got there, perhaps its a perk for wearing an all-black uniform in the Phoenician oven of summer. Who knows. I didnt have any change so I felt guilty about getting a refill. Anyways, good grub... a step above a "x-berto" style 24 hour place. I will be back!
