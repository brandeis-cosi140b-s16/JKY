My family and I usually come here because it's the only place we can all agree with the food choices here. Been coming here for a couple of years and not had changed. 

The food is decent nice proportions ok priced. We normally get shrimp ceviche, shrimp coctel, and oysters. This time around my mom got some fish tacos which looked really good. The shrimp empanadas are also pretty good. 

The only thing I hate about this place is when they have music. They got a jukebox and most of the time 2 or so groups playing music. If you're sitting in the middle you can hear the jukebox and the bands playing. All that makes it so loud you have to talk very loud for the people to hear you.
