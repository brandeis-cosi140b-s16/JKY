This place has pretty awesome food!  I had the cocino soup and it was both tasty and authentic.  The soup had big chunks of potato and beef.   The chips and salsa took a little bit of getting used too (tomato paste like). But then the salsa became adicting.  

It was band night so it got pretty loud.  They play country music on one side and have a dj on the other.  The part of town is sketchy like someone said but keep in mind the police station is right down the street.  Give this place a shot it's pretty tasty!
