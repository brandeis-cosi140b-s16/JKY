I love me some El Pollo Loco.  When I visit California, this is the first place I must eat at.  So when I visited my brother I was super surprised that there was not only El Pollo Loco in Las Vegas, there was one minutes away from his house!

I only order their flame-grilled chicken because it's so juicy and the skin is so yummy.  Of course I eat this with their tortillas and top it with some avocado salsa.  So good!
