I have eaten at this Rubio's a bunch of times and each time I enjoyed my meal I ordered... Friendly staff and the restaurant is always clean. I have ordered the World Famous Fish Taco 2 Taco Plate (Crispy beer-battered fish, shredded cabbage, mild salsa and tangy white sauce) and the Fish Taco Especial 2 Taco Plate (Fish Taco with fresh guacamole, jack and cheddar cheese and cilantro and onions... Each comes with chips you get a choice of beans or rice as well I get the black beans they are really good. Plus they have a really good salsa bar to spice up your meal... For a really fast and great meal this is a must stop lunch spot.
