I went for lunch and I ordered the Venezuelan arepas. Arepas were crispy stuffed with cheese and chicken. The Chips were good and there is a salsa bar, I only like the mild one, the salsa verde didn't taste like anything . My husband ordered the American tacos, he thinks it was just ok. This place has an arepa and empanada special on Thursday and I will be coming back for more.
