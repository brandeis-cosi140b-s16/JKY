Was in the area and was hungry for Mexican Food, so I stopped by this Chipotle to grab some lunch.  It's a typical Chipotle.....if you've never been to one before here's a breakdown:

You select your menu item...ie Burrito, Taco, Quesadilla.  Then you instruct the employee making your meal on what ingredients you'd like on/in your item.....ie Pinto/Black Beans, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Salsa etc.

I decided to go for a Chicken Burrito w/Pinto Beans, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Pico de Gallo, Hot Sauce, Rice.  To wash it down, I got a bottle of Izzle Clementine Soda.

The Burrito is huge and was delicious.  I really like their Hot Sauce at Chipotle, it has a nice kick to it.  I devoured the entire Burrito, then enjoyed my Izzle.

Overall Value - I always get great value for my money at Chipotle.
Will I return?  I like this location, I'm sure I'll be back.
