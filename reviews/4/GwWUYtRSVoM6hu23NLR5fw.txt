I got to sample many of their original appetizers, guac, salsa and margaritas at their media night event on the patio. The staff was awesome and made sure everyone got to try their yummy drinks. The plaintain empanadas, tuna ceviche and prickly pear margaritas were delicious, and so was the chips, salsa and guacamole. 
The decor was changed, and while the new lighting and overall design is a bit more upscale, I miss the old colorful look that was Agave. At least they didn't paint over the hot pink exterior! The patio is still awesome, with new lighting and some changes to the seating arrangement. Also, new pillows maybe?
They are keeping the video poker machines, which I was told will be turned on next week. 
I hope they have lots of gaming promotions! Are you listening, Dos Caminos??
