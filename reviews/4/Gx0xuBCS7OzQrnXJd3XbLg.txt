Fast takeout friendly staff. Ordered Macho Nachos and Steak Taco's.
Tacos are very good.Macho Nachos are good but again I am seeing a trend of putting a little less meat and cheese on. Once more charge a bit more and load it up with the good stuff. If there was an option to double meat I would but guess the idea doesn't fit the standard.
