The seafood at this location is really good ! 
They have a variety of choices to chose from. Their food is VERY spicy , so a heads up when they ask you how spicy you want your food from a 1-10 
Take it serious and chose what you can handle lol
I chose a 5 and I was dying ! 
Other than the dining area being really small and a 15 minute drive from the strip the food is good :) well worth the drive
