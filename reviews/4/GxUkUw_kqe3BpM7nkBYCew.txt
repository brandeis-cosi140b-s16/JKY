As others have noted, this place is the old Mas Amigos. The food is quite similar to Mas Amigos even though the menu has changed. Many employees are the same, which is to their benefit. 

I'm proud to say I'm a regular. This place has excellent tacos Mexicanos. The pastor is probably the best I've had anywhere. In fact, everything I've had on the menu has been quite good. 

Before the switch, this was a great margarita place, with incredible prices. I can't speak to neither the price, nor the quality of the margaritas at present. 

This place remains my favorite of the Chambana Mexican restaurants. Minor transition issues caused me to give 4 and not 5 stars, but I will revise it upward once the kinks are out.
