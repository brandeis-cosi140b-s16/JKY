Pretty cool Mexican food spot in the Hard Rock. Atmosphere is inviting, fun and enjoyable. Enjoyed lunch with co-workers and was quite happy...And full! 

Queso, guac, chips and salsa to start. Watch out! Its so good it will be hard to stop. Guacamole is fresh topped with diced tomatoes. Queso served hot and addicting! 

I had the chicken and shrimp fajitas. Tortillas were hot and fresh and  steaming chicken and shrimp with softened onions and peppers.
