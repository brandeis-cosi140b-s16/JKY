I ordered the 3 taco plate. I was surprised that the taco shells were fried but they actually tasted good.  The ground beef was good and the salsa was very good too. The food takes a while to be prepared. I believe I waited almost 15-20 mins for my food. I ordered the food to go but that made no difference in the wait time. They prepare the food on a first come first serve basis.  The horchata was delicious. My only complaint was the beans. They lacked flavor and taste.  I was also surprised about the prices as they were on the expensive side for Mexican food.  Mexican food seems to be cheaper in Chicago than here.
