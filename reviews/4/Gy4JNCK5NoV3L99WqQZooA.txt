Canonita, what can I say. The ambiance basically speaks for itself. You can sit alongside the indoor canal and watch as tourists take their rides on gondolas as the gondoliers sing. It's a relaxing atmosphere, both for the young and old. Try to opt for this seating area instead of inside.
 
Their shrimp burrito is phenomenal - loaded with shrimp in every bite, no exaggeration. The cilantro rice was the perfect touch.

The chicken tacos (came with 3) were pretty standard- but they did have pickled onions which were a nice addition. 

Each plate ranged from 16-20 dollars, so it's pretty reasonable for Vegas.

P.S. Sometimes it's too busy that they won't be able to seat you if you try to walk in- so your best bet is getting a reservation!
