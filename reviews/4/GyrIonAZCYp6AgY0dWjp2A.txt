The Mexican Asian fusion was at it's finest with the Mexican Pho - an amazing blend of flavors. The sushi was also very good. I sat at the bar and had friendly (but not fast) service. Margarita was above average. 

Hip scene, somewhat loud. The place was decked out with Chinese paper balloons (not sure if this is permanent or just because of recent Chinese new year) that sort of clashed (and didn't 'fuse') with the Mexican style decor.

All in all, excellent meal, would return.
