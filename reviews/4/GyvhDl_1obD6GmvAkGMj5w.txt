This place was recommended by a local to us as we were in town for a swim meet. We stopped in for lunch and was not disappointed. The steak fajitas were great along with the half pitcher of margarita. The green salsa was different and grew on ya as you kept dipping. 

Atmosphere was great inside, definitely worth returning!
