Yay, another good Mexican taco shop!

Small place with 2 table and 2 chairs at a counter.  sauces and sodas lined up at the counter so you can see what is available.   The service was friendly and they filled us in our some of the offerings and info on the owner/chef.  Found out it was the wife of the owner/chef, so it is a family affair.  She said, "they have some specials on weekends including some Caribbean items". 

Corn taco shells are delicious had about 6 options and we choose the Carnitas and the Jamaican Jerk.  Very good tacos filled with a large portion of meat, cilantro, onions, cheese, lettuce and they bring out 3 different types of salsa to add to your taco.  

Jarritos Mexican soda is also available.
