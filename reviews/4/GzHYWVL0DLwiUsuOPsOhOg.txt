I have eaten here a couple times on our trips to Vegas. Since my last trip I found I have a pretty sever gluten intolerance. T&T's does not advertise a gluten free menu, but I was with a group of friends that were on the picky side and I figured I'd ask. I was told I would be safe with the Tacos (except for the chicken). I could order rice and beans but there might be some cross contamination. I ordered the El Pastor tacos with rice and beans, no problems. The tacos were stuffed, el pastor was a little different than I'm used to, but I enjoyed it for what it was. Rice and beans were good, Cadillac margarita was good too. All around I enjoyed the food.

My only complaint was the music, the strange mixes were bad, really bad.
