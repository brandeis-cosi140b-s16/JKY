Ordered the salsita  bowl with Red Chile as the choice for meat... For the price it was good portion size and the red chili was actually pretty tasty. They didn't have paper towels in the bathroom they just had napkins like the ones that you eat with. The lady at the register was very friendly though. It reminded me eating at my grandma's house after I ordered went to the bathroom and came out the friendly woman was bringing me my food in the bowl with no tray... Just like at grandma's house. Definitely going to be stopping back by over here to try out there other food items
