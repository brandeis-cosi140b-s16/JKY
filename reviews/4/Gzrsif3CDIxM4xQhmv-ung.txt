I went for the happy hour and was very happy with the $2 Margaritas.  I tried the flautas and mini chimi's both were decent but not authentic Mexican.  The chips and salsa were good and the interior is nicely furnished.  I talked to the waitress and she informed me that it is the owner's first sit down restaurant and she is still refining the place and is open to suggestions.  She recommended the weekend music nights, since the musician is a professional.  I am happy there is a good drinking place within walking distance of my home :)
