Hidden Gem alert!

Support local. This great restaurant has cheap margaritas, good food and great service. I have been eating more often there because I am trying to support local business dealing with the light rail construction. 

Make sure to utilize the Valley Metro "Metro Max" card that they are giving out during the light rail extension  - you'll get a discount!

PS: The bean dip for the chips and salsa is AMAZING!
