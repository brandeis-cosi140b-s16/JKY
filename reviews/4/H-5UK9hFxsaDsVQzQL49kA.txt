This is in our rotation of restaurants that our family of 5 visits regularly.  Is it authentic mexican food?  no.  But then again - hubby does not like true Mexican dishes...This is Tex Mex food.  The one thing we order off on the menu - and that really are top notch, are the fajitas.  Husband has ordered them everywhere - and really, here they are the best.  Mango Margaritas and chips and salsa are pretty good too!
