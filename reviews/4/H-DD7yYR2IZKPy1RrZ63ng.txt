Everyone knows you don't want to eat food at a place where nobody from that culture eats, so it is a good sign when you see a lot of Mexican folks eating at a place during lunch. On an odd side not I was just debating between saying "Mexican" or "Hispanic" I went with Mexican since I am reviewing a Mexican restaurant not a Hispanic one, (in case someone P.C douche wanted to crawl up my arse) 

I have only eaten one thing here and I have eaten it repeatedly. The Breakfast burrito hits all the right marks, huge, cheap and delicious. For $4.25 after tax you get what I am thinking is about a pound of breakfast food, freshly made (sometimes you have to wait a bit) wrapped in a tortilla. I get this in the morning a few times a week and don't feel like eating again until about 4 pm. If you are looking for a good cheap breakfast I would try this place out for sure. I haven't tried anything else yet but I did get an up close look at my coworkers lunch and it too was huge and looked amazing. I sent a customer to them the other day who was looking for a place to eat and when he came back he raved about his burrito. .
