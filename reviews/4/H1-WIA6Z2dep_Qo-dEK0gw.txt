The food here was very good, albeit FILLING. It was nice to have a number of vegetarian options to choose from. I thought the salsa was very good. It was spicy but I like spicy. 

Beers were $2.50 - a soda was $2. I would pick a beer over a soda any day anyway - but being frugal as I am, how could I possibly say no! 

I ate so much I thought I might be sick - but it was my fault, and not the food. No one forced me to clean my plate but I did anyway; a testament to how much I enjoyed it!
