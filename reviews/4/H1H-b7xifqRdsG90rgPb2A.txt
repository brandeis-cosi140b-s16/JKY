Butter crisp is a tasty appetizer. The place is a little small and the food ok. The waitress/ owner is always smiling and friendly. Service is fast. Chips and salsa is good. Nice little place to have on the way west side of town to have a meal. Red cheese enchiladas are good. I don't really care for the rice.
