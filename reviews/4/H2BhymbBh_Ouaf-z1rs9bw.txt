Aye carramba!

This spot has been a regular for me eve since moving to this side of town. Located inside of the Fabulous Freddys carwash/gas station, it is convenient to come, fill up, get your car clean and grab some food to go.

Regular buys
Carne asada fries/nachos
3 rolled tacos chicken with guacamole and sour cream
Carne asada burrito

All come in a very hefty size. Oh and they are not shy with their sides at all. Wait time here is usually under 10 minutes, but you can always call in for a pick up. Don't forget to ask for the pickled carrots and onion, yes they have it, just behind the counter.

The only down side of the location is, with all the business coming in for gas, car washes and regular convenient store transactions, it is hard to find parking. So be prepared to wait during the mid day, for a spot.

They do have a limited seating area for eating in. So come get your mexi  fix in a clean and very friendly toco shop.
