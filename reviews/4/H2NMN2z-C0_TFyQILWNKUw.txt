We have been coming here for a couple of years.  The food has always been good, but lately I have noticed an extra effort on a part of the staff to be more attentive and professional.  We also noticed that the menu has been completely revamped.  The food is very fresh and the chips were light, crispy and warm.  Prices are reasonable too.
