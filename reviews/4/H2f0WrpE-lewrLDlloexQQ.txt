Attended a great meet-up with Poly's Adventures in Dining.

Indoor / outdoor dining - i didn't even see the interior of this place - it was packed for what i believe was a boxing match ( watching on TV's )  you order at a take-out style window on the outside of the property.  in the front you have meats cooking on a few pits.  

The group sat outside near the pits ( kinda hot ! ) - i had 5 different types of tacos  - all  served on double tortillas and a taco bar with onion, cilantro, lime and 3 or 4 different sauces.  I believe the tacos were a $1 ( i had a few margaritas and a few beers and just gave someone $20 and asked them to buy as many tacos as they could  - they brought over at least 3 if not 4 plates of tacos !! )

This is the kinda place to enjoy long after the sun goes down - bring a lounge chair, a cooler with beers and some buddies and start chowing on the tacos  - good stuff !  BUT - bring a designated driver !!
