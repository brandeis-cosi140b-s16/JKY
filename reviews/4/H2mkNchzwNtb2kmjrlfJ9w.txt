On the way home from a successful shopping trip, my fella was craving tacos. We saw this place and decided to go renegade and give them a try without even glimpsing at the Yelp reviews. I know, living on the edge.

They have a grill set up outside the shop, but you order inside. The place is very small but they have about four tables set up for seating. Their menu is pretty extensive. I was really interested in getting the pozole, but since we were taking it go I opted for tacos instead, figuring they would travel better. I ordered barbacoa, carnitas and an al pastor. My fella got chorizo, some al pastor and some carne asada. We also got a hibiscus tea to share. The wait was short, but there was a little salsa bar that had all the necessary condiments and to go containers to fill up before our meals came out. 

Our food was ready quickly and we were on our way home in no time. It smelled great in the car and I could hardly wait to rip the packages open and since I had skipped lunch that day. Once home we unwrapped our dinner and were pleasantly surprised by how well the food traveled. They took a lot of care to package everything well. The tacos were great! I have to say that the barbacoa was both of our favorites, so we'll definitely be back for those again soon. I also really want to try some of their soups and other dishes as well. So glad taking a risk paid off.
