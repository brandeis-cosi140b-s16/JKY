VERY good mexican restaurant. BY FAR the best Ive been in Vegas. Had a grilled cheese with jalapenios with flour tortillas, a pink cadillac cocktail, filet mignon (with a side of shrimps and mushroom tamale) and corn creme brule. 

Everything was spot on. Very friendly staff .

update: I went back on november-december 2011. Ordered the Zacatecas Chile Relleno. It was very very good.
