Visited with a group of people from work for lunch, and it was fantastic. I had the Shrimp Verde, and it was quite tasty. Several people had the hot, lava bowl and absolutely loved it. I have no idea what the proper name is, but seriously, could it be cooler than "I would like to eat the hot lava bowl?" No, it could not.

I was a little surprised at the prices, which were more than I usually pay for lunch, but it is because of the fresh, great seafood. It came out to about $20 for each of us for lunch, but well worth it.
