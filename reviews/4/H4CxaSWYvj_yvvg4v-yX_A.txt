TOTALLY LEGIT. The real deal. Visited for lunch on 12/19/13.

I loved this place back when it was Guanjuanto. Then it took a bit of a downward turn... I'm happy to report that things are back to being solid.

+ Revamped the interior - new paint, new wall coverings, new furniture

+ Super friendly staff
+ Nice ambiance; not overly obnoxious

+ Free chips
- Salsa was *super* salty (and I love salt) and quite watery
+ Salsa had strong Chipotle flavor to it
+ Chips were warm and fresh

+ Great menu - so many good items to peruse and choose from
+ I went with two tacos: Carne Asada and El Pastor
+ Both came on soft corn tortillas that were perfectly cooked
+ TONS of onion and cilantro - WIN
+ Meats were perfectly cooked
- Meats were a bit under seasoned 

+ Prices were excellent
+ Hot sauce that was served in a squirt bottle was good, but very smoky (Chipotle flavor)

I'm so happy to report that this place is BACK, and it's STELLAR. I will definitely be back. Oh so good.
