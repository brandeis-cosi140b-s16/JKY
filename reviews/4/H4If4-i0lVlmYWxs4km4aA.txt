Love this place! The queso is pure cheesy deliciousness, the barbacoa pork is incredibly juicy, and the sweet tea is a definite 10! Bejng from the west coast I was dying to try some Carolina BBQ and definitely have nothing but positive things to say about this place. The decor is also charming and service great.
