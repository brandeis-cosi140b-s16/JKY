Distrito handled our group of 12 with aplomb, which was no easy feat considering the amount of coffee, water, and juice we were putting away. Yet, there was nary a glass half full for the entire time we were here for breakfast.

I ordered an omelet and it comes with your choice of three ingredients. I went with pretty simple stuff, but it was well cooked and came with a side of toast (they let me sub a bagel) and breakfast potatoes. The breakfast fare is pretty typical stuff with a Mexican influence. The restaurant itself is bright and airy. And the coffee is served from a French Press. Love that!
