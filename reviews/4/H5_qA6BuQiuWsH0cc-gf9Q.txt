Quick, easy, and tasty Mexican food.  I ordered a kids meal cause I wanted a churro (it was not good ha) and also a smothered burrito.  The tortilla was really good, tasted fresh and homemade.  Not sure if it was though.  And the chile was great.  

Busy on Sunday after church so we had to stalk other tables and sit down right when they stood up.  

Pretty hot inside, but It's AZ...what do I expect right?
