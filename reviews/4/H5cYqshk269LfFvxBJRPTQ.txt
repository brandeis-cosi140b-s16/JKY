First off, this place is WAY better than the other "mexican" place in Westgate. Our server was AWESOME and the food was very good! We loved the atmosphere there as well. Yes, it's a little overpriced but honestly, most of the places at Westgate are. We plan on going back one evening to kick back and enjoy!

**There's two different address listed on Yelp for the same location, so I'm leaving the same review for both!
