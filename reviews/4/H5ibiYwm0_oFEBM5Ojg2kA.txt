First visit to Pepe's Tacos. Had the super nachos. Was great only thing I would change and its just personal preference I would not put as many beans. Also had Beef Taquito plate. These were the best I tasted in Vegas. They were made fresh. Wife had the Birria (Marinated Goat Meat). She had the soup version. Since I don't ever recall eating goat I took a taste test and almost wanted to trade dinners lol. Mom had the usual Carne Asada Burrito which again I tasted and again I have no complaints. This was my first visit and it will not be my last visit guaranteed.
