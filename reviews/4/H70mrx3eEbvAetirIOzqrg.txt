I am falling more in love with this place each and every day. Super clean eating area and the back area looks spanking clean too. Friendly service, great burritos, and the tamales are soo soo good. Smells like Mexican Food Heaven in here my friends - good for a quick breakfast/lunch bite or late night grub after a night on the town.
