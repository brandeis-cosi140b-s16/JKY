100 chips and salsa later ( my fav 3 salsas), I still managed to finish the chicken enchilada. Good amount of shredded chicken, sauce, cheese. Comes with rice and beans. Like most other places, just good. I like that they have lunch portions. Good service too. A small bar if that's what you have in mind.
