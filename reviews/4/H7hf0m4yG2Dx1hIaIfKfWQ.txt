I love this place!  My girlfriend and and I have been there at least 10 times.  The staff there is very nice and I periodically ask how business is doing.  The have no problem telling me the ups and downs.  The burritos are a very good size and I love the fact they have a self serve salsa bar.  The dining area is very modest and family friendly.  I'm anxious to try their breakfast burritos as I am a big fan of them.  I do wish they had hotter salsa (but that's a personal preference).  Lastly their meat portion is very generous.  Sometime I wonder if it's too much but realize once I eat I feel it's perfect!
