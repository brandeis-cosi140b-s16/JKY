I love the atmosphere, food, and drinks at this restaurant. I don't often get alcoholic drinks with my meals. I have very specific restaurant settings were I feel drinks are in order - and this is one of them! I love their cadillac margarita's. I have such a difficult time in Vegas getting a margarita that is made right (i.e., not too sweet, not too sour). At Lindo Michoacan they know how to make a margarita. 

My favorite item on the menu, believe it or not, is the table-side guacamole. I know, it is just an appetizer - but it is the best appetizer! I used to have an avocado tree in my backyard growing up in Miami, so I miss avocados and love guacamole that is freshly made. I have had too many guacamole's that taste pasty or bland, but not here. They spice it up to your liking - so I have them dump in the bowl of onions & jalapeño's. They also have really awesome refried bean dip that comes with the chips. It is a perfect combination for a pre-dinner appetizer that mixes scrumptiously with my margarita and entrée later.

For entrées, I enjoy the chicken chimichanga, steak & shrimp fajitas, and fish street taco's. Some of the items are a little pricy. But, they serve all meals with Mexican soup and chips & salsa with refried beans. Many Mexican restaurants these days have been tacking on a separate fee for chips & salsa. So, I factor this in to the dining experience. Plus, I appreciate not being nickeled-and-dimed. When I start to feel like everything I want has a separate charge (e.g., sauces, chips, refill drink), I lose interest in the dining experience. 

The restaurant does have a Mariachi band that plays at night and walks about the restaurant.

I will be back!
