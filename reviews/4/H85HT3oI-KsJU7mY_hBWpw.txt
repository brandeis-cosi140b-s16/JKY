Fajitas will always have a special spot in my heart because some of my fondest family and friend memories took place here. My family brought me here at least once a month when I was still in elementary school. Then, in high school, my friends would meet me there on Fridays when we got out of school early. I barely went there while I was out of town in college, and now that I'm in a new stage in life, I had the recent opportunity to see it again. I could not believe that place was still open!! It's one of the few restaurants that has survived the decades. You can see that many restaurants have come and gone, but Fajitas still stands, proud and tall!

Their tortillas are unique in texture and flavor. It's not your typical tortilla that you get at the many Mexican restaurants around town. I wouldn't really categorize it as traditional. It's not quite the Chili's Americanized type tortillas either. Regardless, their tortillas are made fresh right before your eyes and they taste wonderful! 

The menu is fairly standard and simple. By the restaurant's title, they stay specialized in what they know, making great tortillas for fajitas. They have regular flank steak fajitas or the more richer Cadillac steak style fajitas. If red meat is not your desire, then they also have other chicken and veggie types available. The sides like rice and beans have never been included  with the entree. They've always been separate, but that sure hasn't stopped anyone from coming here. 

I love that they have many types of drink specials throughout the week! That's what makes it such a great place to look forward to going to on weekends!
