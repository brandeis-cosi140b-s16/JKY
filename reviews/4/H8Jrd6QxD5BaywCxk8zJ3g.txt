Ordered camaron agridulce, mole poblano & chile verde. They were always so good!!! Try their caldo de res esp on a cold day, it never disappoints. I see most people order the pozole; I'm not a fan of tripe but they seem to be enjoying it. Maybe I'll try it next time.
Also, the restaurant has started accepting credit cards--- that's a big plus.
