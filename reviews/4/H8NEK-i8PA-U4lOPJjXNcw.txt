My family took us here while we were visiting as they know my husband's love affair with Mexican dives.  They definitely scored on this one.  I even liked it!  

Their burros (basically wet burritos) were huge.  The guacamole was fresh and delicous.  The salsa was a little too watery - but we fixed that with the addition of the pico de gallo our server brought out for us.  

Their special spicy salsa is delicous too!  

Everything was very good and definitely family-style.  Service was a little slow, but it wasn't bad considering we had great company to enjoy.

I'd definitely recommend it if you're craving some authentic Mexican home-made-style food and you're in the area!
