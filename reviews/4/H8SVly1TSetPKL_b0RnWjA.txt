We live just down the street from this little strip mall restaurant.  Why oh why didn't I find it sooner!  I am a very picky eater and sort of a bland eater. They were willing to keep things out or add things to match my odd tastes.  Husband is an eclectic eater and will try anything so we make a good pair.  He was impressed with the enchiladas and the homemade salsa.  I ate a chimi and it was fried to perfection.  Very authentic tastes and great prices.  Houston, we are going to have a diet problem here.
