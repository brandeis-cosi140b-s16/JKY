Bring cash, they don't take credit cards. 

Super simple chicken, beans, salsa, marinated onions...put it all together in a warm tortilla and you have one happy mouth. 

I used to go here a lot when I worked in Tempe. It was always good then and that was 10 years ago. I went again recently with my husband and it was just as I remembered it. 

Cheap and delicious...if you are in the neighborhood give it a try!
