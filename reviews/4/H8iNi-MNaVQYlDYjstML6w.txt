I really like this place. The black bean burrito is great! Good portions. If you order in you get complimentary chips and salsa. Quick service. Fun decor.

The reason for the deduction of one star is because the place often seems like cleaning supplies. I appreciate that they try to keep the place clean but please try to do it at the end of the day or get less strong smelling products. It's not the most appetizing smell. I don't want to feel like I am eating my burrito with a side of Windex, I would rather smell my food.
