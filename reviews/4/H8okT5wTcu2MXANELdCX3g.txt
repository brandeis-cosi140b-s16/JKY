My husband has been talking about this place for awhile now.  I ordered their Mini-chimi w/ 3 rolled beef tacos combo special which came with the drink. My husband ordered their 2 enchilada combo with beef and chicken which also came with a drink. We shared an order of chips to try their salsa bar. Overall, everything was great: food, serving, service and price. It didn't blow my mind to where I would be craving anything on the menu like my own personal favorite Mexican take-out place in downtown Phoenix so I gave a 4-star.
