I live no where near a Some Burros....and it is probably a good thing...because I would go there way too often!  They are quick, cheap and have some of the best beans out there.  I also have major cravings for the Boracho Burro, which is a green chile beef burro smothered with more sauce and topped with sour cream and guacamole.  

I love this place so much I sometimes make up excuses to go to Chandler Fashion Center just so I can eat here!  I sometimes grab takeout if I am in the area for work and bring it back to my office.  They lose a star for not giving you free chips with take-out orders...but other than that...for "fast food" they are excellent!
