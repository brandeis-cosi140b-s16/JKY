I've been here a number of times and have tried a few menu items. The burrito or the chimichanga combo plates I find to be the best deal for your money and taste buds. Oh and the chips and salsa for the table are the best that I have had at any Mexican restaurant in town!

I would recommend stopping by for a happy hour, they have some really great drink specials on beer and margaritas.
