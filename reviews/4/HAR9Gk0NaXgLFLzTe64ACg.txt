Oh dear sweet Mango Salad! Your mix of fresh flavors refreshes me on a hot Arizona day. This SoCal girl is not used to 109 degree weather. But your air conditioned restaurant kept me cool. Although a tostada shell filled with lettuce, corn salsa, black beans, mango and guacamole sounds like a weird combination, I would eat you all over again! http://bit.ly/NXExhI

Yessss :D
