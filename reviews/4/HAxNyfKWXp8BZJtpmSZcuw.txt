For the second year in a row, we had a sales meeting in Chandler. Serrano's is within walking distance of the hotel, so we walked over, after bypassing another Mexican place...

Serrano's is a friendly place. The Mexican joint next to the SanTan would not seat us together (7 people in the group!), and the wait was 45 minutes. So we left that place and went to Serrano's. As usual, my advice was excellent... We were seated immediately!

(Okay, okay, I got lucky!)

Anyway, the food was as good as I had remembered it from the year before, and the bean dip was exceptionally good. I had a wonderful Pollo Ranchero dish that filled me to bursting. I don't think anyone was disappointed. Margaritas were tasty, and service was attentive but not pressured. 

This is a family place, and it's good for groups. They have several rooms where they can accommodate larger parties. I'd go there if I were in Chandler again.
