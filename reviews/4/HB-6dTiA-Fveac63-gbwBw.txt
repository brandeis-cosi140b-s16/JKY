Let me start off by saying that this is an awesome bar! When I heard Drift was changing into a bar with a pool, I was wondering if maybe it was a little much. After finally braving the line, you get into the bar and have to sign a waiver. The line was pretty insane even though we got there at 10:30pm. Next time I'm definitely going earlier or during the day. It took the normal scottsdale amount of time to get drinks.

I'm looking forward to going here a lot more :D
