Excellent food + excellent service = super duper satisfied couple!

We did want the table side guac and I ordered the 'Pollo Laredo' and wife ordered the 'Enchiladas De Dennis'. We were both very satisfied, al though I would have ordered something if I were her. We both have bit of a sweet tooth, so to end it all off nicely, we ordered the 'Cuatro leches'. Holy *%#&, we both LOVED the desert!

So, if you want good tex-mex in a casual, yet excellent service ambiance, then you have to go here.
