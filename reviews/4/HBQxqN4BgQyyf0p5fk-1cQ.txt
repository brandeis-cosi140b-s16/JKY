I had to try this place, especially with the reviews and cool pictures of their decor. Was very happy to see they were open on Sun. Tried there al pastor tacos and chicken flautas! Yummy. It looks like they make there own tortillas, not sure, but it was nice light and fresh. I will definitely be back to experience again!
