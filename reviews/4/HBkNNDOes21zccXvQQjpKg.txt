I never eat here. I ate at Rubio's once many years ago and hadn't been back because I thought it was ho-hum. I had some Free Taco cards and I'm glad they took them, they were a little old. No expiration on the cards, no catches, just FREE TACO.
    I ordered 4 tacos. They have a new Ono Taco which is mango habanero! I tried a free half taco in line from the gal. I liked it so much I ordered two! The flavor was huge, but the size a bit small for the retail price. I ate one Ono Taco in a few bites. Rubios has definitely ramped it up since I was in last. For those who don't know, when in Hawaii, "ono" is the word for scrumptious when describing food. Ono char siu pork was the order of the day when I was a kid visiting my friend there. I also ordered two fish especial tacos. Delicious with the avocado. The winning accents came from the salsa bar! The two dark salsas were COMPLETE FLAVOR WIN. Smokey chile sauces will always win me over, so glad they had those and not some boring jar-like salsa. I was hoping for some pico salsa, but they didn't have any there. Anyway with four tacos I left full. Maybe you're thinking "You SHOULD be full after four, you pig!" Yeah. Indulge yourself when possible and practical, I say!
Retail price for all 4 including tax was over $15! Ouchies! Flavor explosion, but pricey. That's OK, I don't expect that for cheap, but if I were to make a $10 choice I might choose Chipotle or Qdoba ($8 for a full-on deluxe burrito) or Pei Wei. Glad this was a free lunch. I would say go to Rubios if you have a coupon, don't pay full-on retail. Looks like a previous reviewer says there's a Tuesday deal? Here it is:
After 2:30 pm on Tuesday is "Taco Tuesday" and fish tacos are $1.50 each.
