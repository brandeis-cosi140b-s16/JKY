I had the opportunity to go here twice in two days.  The first time was for lunch.  I was giving a presentation that afternoon and didn't want to have anything too heavy.so I opted for the Grilled Chicken Burger off the "Gringo" menu.  It was excellent.  I came back the late afternoon the next day for a chicken burrito which was also very good.  That time of day the place was almost empty and no one seemed to mind when I set up my laptop to get some work done for a few hours before heading to the airport.  Just what I needed.  I'll be back next time I'm in town!
