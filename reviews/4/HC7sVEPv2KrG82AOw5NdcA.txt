I don't remember if this was reservation only or not, but I'd highly recommend them. We waited 45 minutes for a table, but wandered around downtown in the meantime until we got the text that our table was ready. 

The food was delish, though slightly pricey. For about $12, you get two tacos of various toppings. We all decided that if there were 3 tacos to a portion, this place would be perfect. While delish, $6 for a taco is definitely pricey. 

We tried the baja fish tacos, octopus, and the duck. The duck tacos were the unanimous favorite with their tangy sauce, but all were fantastic. Get the duck tacos if it's your first time, they were out of this world. 

If I get the chance, I'll definitely come here for some late night eats, but with a reservation.
