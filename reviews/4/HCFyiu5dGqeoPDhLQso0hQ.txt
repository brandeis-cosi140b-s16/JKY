Bring cash. Cash only business. They lose one star for not taking cards, and for not being able to hear their awesome juke box they had fully loaded with great music. Now the FOOD. they give you the chips and salsa at the beginning while waiting for your food and that was good. ..esp since good food comes to those who wait. I orderd menudo and it was soooo good probablyt he 2nd best in the city that i've tried yet. It went to #2 b/c of the lack of hominy. hmmm. i love the hominy. I guess its good when y ou're watching your carb content. 2nd my bf ordered the beef molcajaete and he said that it was probably the best thing hes ever eaten in his life. It was perfect he said. It had beef (steak type) with this awesome chile sauce and carrots and radishes and jalapenos and veg coupled with cotija cheese and avocado all in this huge molcajete -- hence the name. It was precious that he didnt know it came in that - fresh out of the oven burning hot.. literally. HOT!!!!!! (temperature) and spicy too. It was out of this world he said. He cannot wait till it gets to be winter again so he can go back. I think he'd eat there every week if he could. def. try this place. Its so worth it
