Been dying to check this place out and finally got a chance yesterday and was definitely impressed.  The service is great and I love how they'll give you a sample of the pork or chicken before ordering because I really didn't know what I wanted (I went with the pork and was not disappointed. My buddy got the chicken and was happy with his as well. 

Other positives -- quality ingredients including fresh jalape√±os.  Really makes a difference you can tell. Great portions and very fairly priced I would say. I like the Hawaiian themed touches around the restaurant. 

Only minus really -- they're going to need some window treatments of some kind very soon because despite it only being March and the temperature around 70-ish it was blazing hot at sundown with the sun setting in the west.  I suspect they might be aware of this and working on it. 

In any event, I'll definitely be back soon.
