Service is good. Salsa is good but not that spicy. I love that it had lots of onions and cilantro in it! I got the two tacos and rice. Beef was a little greasy. Huge portion of rice. Plates are huge. Large portions. Husband got a combo with a taco, enchilada and chile Reno. He wasn't a fan of the chile Reno. He said it was a odd texture. Other than that, I could go again!
