Same as any other Chipotle, I think. The quality was the same, portion size was the same. Staff acted as any other Chipotle staff would.

As busy as they were, they still managed to keep lemons in the silver canister, even after I watched a man put 6 into a napkin while mumbling 'Lemons, I need lemons. I love lemons.' He was well dressed, too. Not homeless. Unless Vegas homeless equals a suit and tie. Also, the prices were the same as any other Chipotle! I was a super fan of this. I was used to seeing higher prices for things I'm used to but this was 100% the same as the downtown Chicago Chipotle I'm used to going to. Double plus for that!

All in all, it was just like eating at home in both taste and on the wallet. This totally works when all you need is a quick meal before heading out. I am totally fine with that.
