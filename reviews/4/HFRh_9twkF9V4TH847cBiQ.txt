So I didn't think i was going to like this place at all! I was convinced I was going to get food poisoning, and I couldn't believe that I had let my friend drag me here.. But it was sooo good! I had a Carne asada burrito and it was delicious and yummy! The rice and beans inside were perfect and not overly seasoned.. The only reason I wouldn't rate this sketchy place 5 stars is because, the horchata sucked, it was watered down and tasted very bland. Overall I had a great experience, just skip the crappy horchata.
