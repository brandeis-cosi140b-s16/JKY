This place is pretty cool. The pool is a decent size to fit a good crowd, I definitely love the waterfall. The layout is nice, pretty spacious bar for having a pool outside. You can grab some seats inside at high top tables or at the bar. Then there are 2 more bars outside, with lounges/cabanas and a few seats here and there in the outside area. I went here on a Sunday night so it was chill, with a few people swimming and getting crazy. I heard this place is awesome for day drinking and swimming, so I am curious to come back during the day when it's hoppin to see what it brings. One piece of advice I have is, don't think you can come here to really relax and cuddle with your boo. People are there drinking and having fun, so you get splashed, hit with beach balls and people jump in right next to you. So if you are looking to just cuddle with your other half, you really don't want to get your hair wet, you have to expect to get interrupted and WET. It's not a resort pool, it's a bar full of all kinds of people so you can't get angry! Haha! Everyone is there to just have fun, your in a pool your going to get wet and interrupted! 

Looking forward to a day here of drinking and trying their food menu! Ill be back!
