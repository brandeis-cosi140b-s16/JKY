Don't be scared of the location, it's actually very sfe.  

We've never been disappointed with the food here.  From the basic bean and cheese to their nopales con chile and shrimp.  Everything is always delicious, love their rice. 

The cashier/owner is actually very nice, although at first glance she doesn't seem very friendly because she hardly smiles!

The cook has his own taquiza business, but I don't know if this restaurant does catering or large platters(?)

Prices are decent for Mexican food.
