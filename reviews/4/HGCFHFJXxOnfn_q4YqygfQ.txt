This is a find!  Colorful decor and food that is a cut above your average Mexican fare.  I actually had the grilled shrimp soup which was wonderful.  A flavorful broth with large pieces of vegetables (carrots, onions, celery, squash) and a generous portion of shrimp and fresh warm tortillas on the side made for a memorable meal.  

My companion enjoyed the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans and enjoyed every morsel.  Our waitress was delightful and her service was top notch.  We chatted with her on the way out about the Menudo Soup that they make from scratch there.   Menudo, a fabled hangover remedy, is made with tripe (beef stomach) in a broth with red chilles and only the cook knows what else.  

The decor is colorful - my glass of chardonnay was very adequate and a generous pour.  I'll definitely be back - maybe not for the Menudo though.
