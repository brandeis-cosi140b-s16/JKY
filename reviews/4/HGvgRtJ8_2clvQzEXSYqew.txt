We came here on my brother's recommendation. We loved it. Spicy and well made. Chips are just okay but the margaritas are excellent. I had green chili pork. Had to order flour tortillas on the side which I thought would come with it. Hubby had tacos and beef enchilada. Loved the red sauce. BFF had chimi. Yummo!
