The problem with this food truck? It just 5 minutes away from my house! My husband and I tried this spot after a Chow-Bella article named it one of their to ten taco places in Metro Phoenix. 

It's quick, cheap, and seriously tasty!  We tried the asada tacos and pastor tacos. Both are delicious ( and surprisingly filling), but pastor was my favorite! Also on the menu are vampiro tacos. That's right, the local to AZ and Mexico specialty...vampire tacos! I have no idea what this means, but I will be returning to try them.

Now, to go try the other tacos on that list.
