Went to Ninfa's the other night with friends.  I was totally prepared to dislike it since I loved NoRTH and was so unhappy to see it go.  Also, I have to admit I thought, yeah just what we need another mexican food chain.  
Happy to say Ninfa's is just what we need.  The atmosphere is warm and welcoming.  The staff is on top of it.  The food is great.  Not traditional mexican, but mexican with a twist that is wonderful. The house chips and the dark red salsa are great. The cilantro salsa was only ok. The red salsa has a smokey heat to it that is addictive.  I had the steak tacos, which were served in flour tortillas, looking more like a burrito. No onions or ciliantro in sight. Cooked perfectly and very tasty.  My spouse had beef fajitas that he devoured.  One of our friends had the mussels in the spice sauce, the other the chicken hard shell tacos.  Both almost licked their plates.  
The sangria margarita is tasty but for me the traditional margarita rocked.  Not too sweet not too sour.  Made with fresh lime juice not the bottled sweet and sour mix.  I could be very happy there with the margaritas, chips and red salsa......
