Typical Del Taco, located inside Circle K. There are tables and chairs to sit at inside and a drive thru. I like this location because it is so convenient- I can get gas, tacos, beer, and a movie from 1 of the 2 redbox kiosks all at one stop!
There are taco deals on tue and thur 3-11. I believe it's 3 beef for $1 tues, and 3 chicken  for $2 on thurs.
The staff is friendly and always gets my order right. No complaints!
