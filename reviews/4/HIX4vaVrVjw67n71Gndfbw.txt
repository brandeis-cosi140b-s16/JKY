I have not set foot in a Chiptole for I don't know HOW many years!! 
We are on the way to Lumberjacks Kpop talent show at the UNLV Student Union and Chipotle is right across the street! 

Hunnie Bunnie and I decide on a Burrito Bowl with cilantro rice, black beans, chicken, corn, mild pico and guacamole. It was delish! 
Hunnie Bunnie thought the chicken was a little spicy but she was a trooper and still ate it. She ate most of the bowl and really liked it! NOM. Plus I love all their fresh ingredients!
