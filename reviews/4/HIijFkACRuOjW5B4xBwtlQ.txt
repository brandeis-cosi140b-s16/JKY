back already!  My husband had the really spicy beef combo, and I had a chicken enchilada and taco combo.. I must admit, the beef was really tasty.  Spicy, but not overpowering.  the chicken was not really that spicy, they say all their chicken is spicy.
Next time, I'll get the beef too.
good food, smiling service, clean restaurant.
