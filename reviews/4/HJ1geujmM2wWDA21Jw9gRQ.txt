There is one reason I come here - the carne asada nachos. OMG. They are gigantic and smothered with so much yumminess. The amount you get for the price is practically a steal. When I get a craving for greasy Mexican, this is the place that hits the spot. And they totally let you load up on their different salsas, lime slices, etc. And when you dump all of that on top of the nachos... It's practically heavenly.
