People will say what they are gonna say bout this place but the breakfast burritos are 2nd to nobody's..   They take to time to boil the potatoes and make the tender as opposed to throwing a frozen French fry in the fryer..  Crispy bacon and lots of cheese..  4 outta 5 cuz the service is a little slower then it really should've ..  I will return soon for another..
