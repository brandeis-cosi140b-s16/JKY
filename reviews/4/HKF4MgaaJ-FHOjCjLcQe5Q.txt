Cool place! Same owners/concept as Spanish fly but this place is way better. Bigger pool, slightly older crowd(mid-late twenties and early thirties), and way more lounge chair seating. The food was awesome-shrimp ceviche was yummy and refreshing for only 5 bucks during happy hour. Drinks are buy one get one free for hh so got two pina coladas for 9 bucks. Friday around 5pm it was surprisingly uncrowded, quite a few empty lounge chairs by pool. Will return for another Friday happy hour for sure
