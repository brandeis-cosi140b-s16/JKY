So when I get up on Saturday mornings I make sure my husband has started on the mile-long honey-do list I've left him, and I shake my finger at him and then say, "No Bud Light until you're finished with that list, Mister," and then I pile on a gallon of some Jessica Simpson designer imposter perfume, put on my yoga pants, a push-up bra, my most over-priced tank top, and grab my squalling 16-month-old to go meet up with my best girl, Traycee, and shop at Nordstrom Rack.  We drag my kid, Barrington, all over the store, and he's screaming the whole way, but really, who cares?  Then we head to Juan Jaime's for half a bottle of tequila and a couple of tortilla chips, and Barrington is still screaming, but again, who cares?  I  had a great time and jacked the credit card up six- or eight-hundred dollars.  I forget, but I don't pay the bill so whatever.  

Man.  There is a whole other world out there, and I'm glad I don't live in it.  But sadly, sometimes I catch the effects of it.

I am so glad we finally tried Juan Jaime's.  Ladena has always been our server, and she is awesome.  She makes sure those drinks don't get empty and is quick with the food and the check as well.  

I have a new love.  It's their pomegranate margarita.  Delicious!  Right now I can't feel my elbows or my kneecaps and I'm pretty sure I only weigh 110 pounds.  That's a great drink!  We've also had the street dog lunch special, the carnitas and beef tacos, the nachos, and the cheese enchiladas.  Everything is tasty and reasonably priced.  

Next time we'll have to try the patio where we can then be entertained by all the bad drivers on Chandler Blvd.  GREAT place!
