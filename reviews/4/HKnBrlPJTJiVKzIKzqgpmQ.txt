We go here for great Mexican seafood. My husband always orders some type of seafood there and is very happy. I love their beef and their chilaquiles-Yum! Their salsa is very tasty and fresh. The prices are incredibly low, the staff is friendly, and the place is very clean. A great place for a relaxed evening!
