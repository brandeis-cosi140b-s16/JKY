First visit, 4 stars. Keep in mind, I'm rating this based on the expectations of what it really is... Mexican FAST FOOD, not a true sit down restaurant.  That being said...

The place has decent decor, with a couple tv's playing what ever game is on. The place is clean.  The girls working the counter were nice, and actually SMILED! When taking a to go order, they still offer you chips and salsa. The salsa bar has the usual green, red, Pico, limes, etc.  The prices were right in line with Fili-B's.

First visit, I got their carne asada fries with errthang on them, and a couple shrimp tacos. ...and now the reason for the 4 stars. The meat on the fries actually tasted grilled, even a lil Smokey! Not oily and old like most of the fast food spots out there. The shrimp tacos were ok. Not good , not bad, but ok. 

I will go back. Next time, I hope to try their red chili as well as their beans and rice. I'll update my review then. 

So, if you're looking for a quick taco or burrito in the area, this place gets the thumbs up from me. ... You know, a total stranger who is recommending a place for you to eat. Take it for what it is, and happy Yelping!
