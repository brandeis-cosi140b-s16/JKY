I had been to their sister location, Brat Haus, before but this was my first time to Taco Haus. My friend and I split the cubano torta, the street corn side and baked bean side. The torta was delicious and huge so splitting was a good idea. The street corn was AMAZING. The charred corn, Mexican cheese and popcorn pieces were the perfect combo. The baked beans lacked flavor and salt so I probably wouldn't order those again. I'll definitely be back to try more menu items. Oh, and they serve you corn nuts to start. Who doesn't like corn nuts?
