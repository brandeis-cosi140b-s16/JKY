3 1/2 stars, but I'm rating them 4  to bring up their score. 
For some reason, my friend Sage is addicted to this place. I don't know why. So we always end up eating here. 
I don't really like Mexican food, but when we want something cheap, and fast this is a good option. I like the different salsas especially the mango when it's in season. It's in a great location with plenty of parking spots, and we always get great service from the staff.
