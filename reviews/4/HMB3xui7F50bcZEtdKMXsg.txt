This was our first visit and of course first impression is a lasting one. The server came right away to our table. We ordered guacamole with our chips. The salsa. chips and guacamole were really good. The margarita was really good. The three carne asada steak tacos, black beans and rice were excellent.  The service was spot on, and the waitress gave us salsa refills and fresh chips without having to ask. The only thing to improve and the reason I gave four stars instead of five was the flies inside near the windows kept annoying us and trying to get their dinner portion. The restaurant needs to keep the front door closed and figure out a way to control the flies inside the restaurant. But overall excellent food, service and ambience. I will go back but will not sit next to the window.
