I really like Matta's but I understand why others have posted negative reviews.  I have been going here (including the original location on Main Street) for about 25 years.  The service is questionable sometimes, but I always enjoy the food.  It is not the "light and healthy" type of food that is trendy now, it is cheesy, heavy, delicious Mexican food.  I don't always want heavy food, but when I do, Matta's hits the spot.
