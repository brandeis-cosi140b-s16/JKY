I stopped in during the week for lunch was thoroughly impressed with this little hole in the wall. It's pretty easy to miss on the corner of 7th Ave and Roosevelt but it's worth every penny. I made the mistake of forgetting my cash (cash only) the first time I tried to stop here, but I cannot believe how affordable Norteno's food is.

They offer a lunch and dinner special everyday of the week (except for weekends it looks like), along with quite a few other specials and of course a normal selection of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, etc. I'd be prepared to take it back somewhere else as their seating selection is small, and outdoor (though it is enclosed), which can be sort of hot in the summer. 

I personally had the chile relleno special which came with beans, rice, and a tortilla as well as a drink for $4.99. The chile relleno was perfectly fried, smothered in a verde sauce, and saturated with cheese from within. The beans and rice were also excellent and hearty, some of the best I've had downtown. Based on other reviews, I'll definitely be back to try their red and green chile beef.

Overall I would definitely recommend this place, especially for lunch if you're working downtown. Don't be scared off by its appearance, Norteno offers excellent Mexican food.
