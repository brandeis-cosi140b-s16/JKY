Any time someone gives you free chips and salsa, it can't be all that bad of a place.  The food was quite tasty here.  I had a beef taco and beef burrito.  The biggest turn off for me was a whole bay leaf in my burrito.  On one hand, I'm really glad they take the time to properly season their beef but stuff like that can be removed before serving.  The Margarita was very tasty and decently priced if you get them on special.  

I'd come back here again.
