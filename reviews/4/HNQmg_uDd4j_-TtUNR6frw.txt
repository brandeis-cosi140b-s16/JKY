This place seemed homey from the get go. Yelpalicious Angela H. and I thought the place was cute and inviting. The server was very sweet and showed us some articles about them and pointed out some of their popular star items. 

I got myself a favorite- Enchilada Ranchera which is enchilada with green sauce and sourcream and I chose it with chicken. I am not too fond of beans so I opted for all rice. She said it's a bit spicy, but it the green sauce only had a whisper of spice which added a depth but didn't burn your tongue that you cant taste anything else. I liked my entree and rice and for $7.75 it could not be beat. 

She was saying that their chile relleno is one of their best known dishes. I love me that dish, but it's one of those things I have to be in the mood for. Yes, I am not Mexican, but my step grandma is and when she was alive she would make me chile relleno and pork  with some chipotle mocahete sauce everytime I'd come. Very few places tops that memory, but I will come back to try out the star dish as well as their bistek ranchero for sure. 

We met the owner as we were walking out and he seemed like a very nice guy who seemed very fond and proud of his place. I like humble homey places and will be looking to sample through everything.
