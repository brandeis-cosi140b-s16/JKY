I've only been once, for lunch, and I'm fairly impressed. The staff was very pleasant, and the Al Pastor burrito was quite tasty. Try the fire-roasted salsa; it has great flavor with just enough kick.

I wasn't very impressed with the ambiance, but it's not bad. The TVs were a bit loud, however.

Overall, I'm pleased with my visit and will be stopping in again.
