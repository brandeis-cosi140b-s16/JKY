My coworkers and I visit for lunch all the time. Fast service, friendly staff, good food! However, visited at dinner for my son's birthday, and was not as impressed. Slow service, wrong meal brought out to my husband, waited forever for the meal to be replaced. Overall, great for a fast, filling lunch.
