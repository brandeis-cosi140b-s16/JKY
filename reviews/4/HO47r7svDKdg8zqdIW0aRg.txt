I was in the area this afternoon and wanted a quick nibble...

I knew there wouldn't be much around to eat so I hopped on Yelp to find something 

Los Fav and Subway were the only two things around... I wasn't sure if this was the same business as the Los Favs on Broadway near ASU main so I decided to check it out 

The lady that helped me with my order was very nice and knowledgable of the menu... Great enthusiasm! 

I walked in a looked at the menu, same business, so I ordered the daily special which consisted of (3) rolled tacos and a side of rice and beans

I like how they have the red and green sauce in the squeezy tubes... 

For $4 it was a good amount of food and it was yummy 

If I am ever in the area again, which I highly doubt, I will stop by...
