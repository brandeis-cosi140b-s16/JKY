This resturaunt is a diamond in the rough. Los is one of the best sit down Mexican food restaurants I have found in the East Valley. The ambiance is great, and the restaurant is often frequented by a live mariachi band.

I have tried many dishes and everything has been great, my personal favorites being the carnitas plate and the carne asada plate.

I would reccomend this resturaunt to anyone who wants great Mexican food at a decent price!
