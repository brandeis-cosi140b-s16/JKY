YUM! I love Chipotle! I got a burrito with barbacoa and it was delicious! The servers were kind and gave us a lot of cups for water when we asked. They didn't seem rude about it either. There weren't many available seats open because this place is pretty crowded and there is Panda Express inside the same shop too and some other restaurants, so it gets really hot in there. But, it was convenient because it was across the street from our hotel and so we can just walk back to our hotel to eat. Overall great service, great quality food, and my favorite! :D
