Margaritas and... well, I'm already pretty much sold at this point. But the And ended up being some wee, tasty tacos. Went for Happy Hour and enjoyed a very nice house (sorry, "casa") margarita with a selection of their taco platters. 

Fish tacos were my fave, and I confess to not trying the mushrooms. Fungus doesn't belong anywhere except under a log, people. Especially not in a taco. But the rest of these trays and their relaxed seating and awesome patio make for a great place to get happy after work.

For bonus points, sit near the bathrooms. The community washroom confuses first timers, and you can give a stinky eye to anyone you see leaving without washing their hands.
