I visit the Monterrey in the University about once a month during lunchtime.  People from work had always mentioned it, but from the outside, it doesn't look like much.  It's in a strip mall.  I decided to try it and once I got in there, I was amazed.  They've decorated and themed the inside of this strip mall restaurant very nicely to resemble a Mexican restaurant.  It's also divided into separate areas, making each a little more private.  I was impressed.

They bring you chips and salsa to start like any good Mexican restaurant.  They're nothing out of the ordinary, but they always taste so good to whet your appetite.  The salsa comes in a little decanter which you can then pour into your salsa bowl(s).  It's unnecessary, but the presentation of it is very nice.  

The food choices are your basic Mexican menu items.  I usually get one of the lunch combos.  For about $6, you can't go wrong.  It comes with a couple of choices, rice, and a side item.  My favorite is the combo with the soft chicken taco and chile relleno (which isn't really a stuffed chile, it's more of a pile of mush of cheese and very finely chopped chile, but oh-so-good), with a "salad" on the side consisting of shredded lettuce, tomatoes, and guacamole.  Yum.  

Like I said, the items are only about $6 a person and they really fill you up.  For a sit-down lunch restaurant, it's an awesome and delicious deal.
