Let me start by saying i thought this place blew. big chunks. However, my wife, being the native Arizonan LOOOVES it. Thus, i would have to endure many unsatisfying dinners here while she delighted in mini chimis and bean and cheese burrito. I tried in vain to find ANYTHING on the menu i could tolerate. Any combination of food, be it chicken (always dry), steak (horrible, the kind of steak that is grade D, but edible) was awful and the ground beef? You know where i am going here. 

.25 for refills? What kind of communist/socialist refill-depriving monsters run this place? 

And then, like moses parting the sea, the Taco Al Pastor arrived. Served traditionally, with cilantro, chopped onion and a lime wedge, tender adobo marinated pork and proper non cold tortillas. My advice? scrap the whole menu, and just serve Al Pastor. Get a spit outside on your patio and make them 100% authentic. Until then, i now can actually eat something on their menu, and its magical. Perhaps, this is what my wife feels with the mini chimis she so loves...naturally, i think they are dry, unimaginative and bland.

Stick with the Al Pastors. You won't be disappointed.
