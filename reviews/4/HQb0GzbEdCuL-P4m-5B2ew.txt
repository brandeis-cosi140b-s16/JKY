My wife and I went here after searching for cheap Mexican food on Yelp. The place looks like a dive on the outside, in a strip mall next to a 7-11. We ordered ceviche, grilled steak taco, shrimp taco (off menu), grilled steak burrito, and chips and guacamole, all for less than $14. The ceviche was excellent! The girl behind the counter said to ask for it on the side instead of on top of the tostada and you get more. The portion was generous for the price ($3.50), and very tasty. The tacos are very small but also tasty. The burrito we took home for our daughter and her friend to share. They both said it was very good as well and the size generous. The only disappointment was the chips and guacamole. The chips were thicker and harder than we like, and the guacamole, although fresh, was blended to a very smooth consistency, not a single chunk in sight, and was somewhat bland. Adding the juice of a lime segment (several of which are included with each meal) and salt fixed the flavor. This place was a pleasant surprise and I'll definitely be back for the ceviche, if nothing else. Thanks for the recommendation, Yelpers!
