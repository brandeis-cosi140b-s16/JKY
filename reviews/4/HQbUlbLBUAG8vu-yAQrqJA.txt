With a movie under our belts, it was time for nourishment. What better place to so that than Gadzooks? This being our first time, I wasn't fully sure how to order, but with some assistance from the very friendly staff, we were able to get what we wanted. I ordered the green chile pork, red sauce and mixed cheeses. After a brief heating in their flaming oven, I had the hot (not the lava) salsa added, along with the crema. While I found the meat to be a little on the dry side, all the flavors popped wonderfully. It's just the right size portion to fill you up without stuffing you. I'll be back to eat my way through the menu.
