Stopped in before a Cardinals game. Everything is freshly made to order. Very clean place, owners are great, very friendly. The portions are huge!! I ordered a fish taco and a carnitas taco, one was like a meal! Both were delish. My husband ordered the special which was shrimp soup, it was a very large bowl filled with many large, pink, sweet shrimp and veggies in a very flavorful broth! Our dining partners ordered burritos that were huge and yummy! No alcohol, but no problem! Hope it doesn't get too crowded before the game now that I have given it away. Don't let the non-di script appearance fool you. It is a hidden gem!!! Please try it!!!
