Love the simple warmth of this place! Small enough to know the owners care and large enough to serve a small night-out crew. Been here a handful of times with good service and great food every time. Okay, there was the one young, awkward waitress, but we've all been "that server" at one time! I forgave her because she was just trying so hard.

The salmon-guacamole is my go-to appetizer. It's savory and perfect as a refreshing starter. My guests ordered the red enchiladas and the fish tacos. Nothing but compliments for the meal!! 

And, don't forget desert. Tip: if you order the berry chimi, and I hope you do, be prepared to share it! Or, eat it all with no regrets (it's really good!!) but you will have to be rolled home in a wheelbarrow (it's that big).

Now that the liquor license is up and running, my only hope is for an espresso option to follow dinner. If you need a barista, let me know!
