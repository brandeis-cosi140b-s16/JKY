I live right next to this place and I've always wanted to try it. I finally went in today and found it pleasantly packed. The restaurant smelled good--though a person could be turned off by the run-down condition of the restaurant. 

I ordered the shredded beef burrito and it was quite good. The tortilla was firm, and delicious. The guac is clearly homemade. The beef was of good quality but not that 'shredded' it was more like chunks of easily pulled apart beef.

I enjoyed what I ate but I'm still left with the feeling that the food was missing something, I don't know what!
