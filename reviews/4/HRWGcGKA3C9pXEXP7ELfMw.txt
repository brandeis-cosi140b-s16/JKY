Stopped by after being let out early from a training class (I live in Tucson), based on yelp reviews. I have to agree with most of the posters. The place is small and practically hidden away, but it's clean and the staff is attentive. I ordered the shrimp fantasia which is bacon wrapped shrimp. I am not a fan of cheese on top, only because my doctor will probably have it out with me due to bacon alone, so I simply wiped it off. I must say, it was really good. Nice sized shrimp, appropriate amounts of filling and well cooked bacon. The rice and beans were typical, but I came here for the seafood and didn't leave disappointed.
