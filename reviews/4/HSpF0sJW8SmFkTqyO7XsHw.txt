I will have to say I agree with some of the posts on here. I don't understand the bad reviews. The food is really good. Salsas are all amazing and I love how everything is fresh.
I would definitely come here instead of Chipotle.  The setup is similar anf the staff are friendly. They let us try a sample of the meat to make sure it was what we wanted.
Horchata is great......and I'm picky with the Horchata. 
My only downfall was the amount of grease that dripped off my quesadilla. But don't get me wrong...the quesadilla was awesome. 
I think we will definitely be back.
