you get your money's worth on their lunch buffet, might not be the best mexican food ive ever had but its certainly not the worst. what do you expect, its a mexican joint in a shopping center beside of a harris teeter..lol if you want americanized yummy cheesy mexican this is a good spot. love their pico! and their buffet at lunch has a lot of good things on it. rice and beans here arent great but the other food makes up for it... wait staff here is on point, you never run out of drink, you might run out of chips but if you ask they'll bring more :)
