We were there during the soft opening, for Sunday breakfast. The food was nothing short of delicious, but it's to be expected from Chef Silvana! I had the Huevos Divorciados. Each egg sits on a different sauce (red & green) and both sauces were excellent! I scraped all the sauce off the plate so as not to loose a drop. They serve Menudo 7 days a week....rare! The menu is not your typical Mexican restaurant, and a bit upscale (pricing, too), but worth the visit. You will enjoy the patio atmosphere.
