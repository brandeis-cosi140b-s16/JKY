One of our favorite Mexican restaurants. My wife had a craving for Mexican food, so we stopped off here for dinner. We've know about this place prior to moving to AZ in 1998. The food is delicious. I keep forgetting to write a review and I started this one in November, 2011. I must have the comings of Alzheimer. 
Anyway, this place used to be packed before Rancho De Tia Rosa opened. Now the customers are starting to frequent this place more because the last time we were there, both dining areas where 85% occupied.
