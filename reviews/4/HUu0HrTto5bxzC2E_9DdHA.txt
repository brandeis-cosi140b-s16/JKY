Pablanos a spicy name for a place of odd contrasts.


The food is gourmet style, but there is a drive through. There are LCD screen menus and a register to walk up to but they wait on you at the tables, the prices are a bit high, but you are in a low rent part of town.

We walked in and when the cashier / hostess / drive though attendant / waitressed asked if we were dining in or to go we said for here. She said sit and I will bring you menus. 

Looking at the menu there is no lunch or dinner, just many items that range from $6-$12

The meal starts with complementary chips and salsa, red and white chips with three types of salsa. Oddly on refill the chips went from wide strips to narrow ones. The salsas were all good and the chips were fresh too.

I went with a veggie burrito $6.49. It did not have exactly what the menu listed in it bu tit did have a great flavor, a richnesses and attention to detail, even the carrots were waffle cut.   Overall it was great with the soft tortilla and the fancy cut in half on a bias presentation. It was bit greasy for the health conscious. 

Mexican food is not a rare commodity in this part of town, it takes a brave new concept to give it a try here.

If you are in the area and want some different style Mexican options give this place a try.
