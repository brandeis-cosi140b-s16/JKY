I absolutely love the food! Some of my favorites are the pupusas!!  (obviously!) The cheese and bean is my favorite. The seafood soup bowl is very flavorful also the deep fried whole tilapia fish, delicious! Overall its a casual diner style place. Very affordable. Oh and try the Salvadorian horchata! way better than the Mexican version...
