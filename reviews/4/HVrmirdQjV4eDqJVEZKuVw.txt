This place is now called Don Tortaco Mexican Grill.  I stopped in to see what was different, and the answer is....nothing.  From what I understand it is exactly the same as Roberto's.  The menu and even the employees have not changed.   It is still the same owners, just branding some of their locations differently.    This location is nice and very clean as always. 

The prices did go up a little, but not much.  It is still the same great place that I like to stop at a couple of times a month for shredded beef tacos.
