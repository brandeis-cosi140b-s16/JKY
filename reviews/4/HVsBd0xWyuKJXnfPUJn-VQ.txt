After a happy hour and a taco monday, im on board with this place. the combo of those 2 would be ideal.

3-6p M-F HAPPY HOUR nets you half off apps/botanas.
$4 margaritas and $3 beer. 

APPS. the chicken tortilla soup is the best deal and quite hearty as its served in a big ass bowl, normally only $4. the brussel sprout nachos are next best, as far as a good deal at hh goes, and interesting with the street corn queso as a topping along with a fried egg.

the chips and salsa are questionable.
you can pass on the wings..

TACOS. i liked them. i tried 4. normal size and $2-3 all day mondays. they have several different sauces to add to the eats, some good, some okay. smart doing taco days other than a tuesday. but really, shouldnt every day be taco day?

also theres a little ice cream bar but have yet to delve into that part of the biz.

good first impressions but this could easily lose a star with one slip up.
