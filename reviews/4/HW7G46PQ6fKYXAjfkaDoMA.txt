Friendly, professional, fresh made breakfast burritos. The smells of the fresh cooked ingredients was mouth watering. My only gripe is that there was NO spice on my burrito. The sauce was OK that they offered, but it needed a little kick to clear the sinuses. Other than that, it was a positive experience overall. 

I did hit them negatively a while back for not being open during business hours. The owner responded and apologized, professionals!!!! Either way , they have since redeemed themselves two-fold.
