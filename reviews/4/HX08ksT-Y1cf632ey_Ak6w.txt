We went here for a date night on Friday night, and we were the first ones there that evening.  Some more came in after us, but it was never busy.  Bad for them but I liked it because it was quiet and quaint!

They bring you chips and salsa to start, which has a but of a kick to it, but still good flavor!

I ordered the chicken chimichanga and my husband got two tacos, pork and bbq beef.  Everything had excellent flavor, we both loved our meals!!

They had two servers working, both would check in on us, which could get annoying, but I understand they just want to make sure everyone had everything they need or want.  It just can be a bit much.

We both would give this 4 stars, can't say anything that we disliked here, just like to save the 5 for the best!  We will be back.
