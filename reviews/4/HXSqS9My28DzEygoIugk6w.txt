Being the Mexican food fanatics that we are, my office chose to check out Panchos for our Christmas party. I'd made the reservations at least a month in advance & made it clear that we'd need extra space for several large boxes of presents. At check-in for the reservation, they confirmed the request. But, our table/area was NOT going to work. The manager & their team quickly accommodated us & all was well again in the world of Mexican food & Christmas cheer. Our waiter- Miguel?- & the busboy worked their tails off. & they did it with a great attitude. The chips, salsa & guacamole were excellent. We all ordered a range of entrees & we all agreed the food was of high quality & quite tasty! The prices are on the higher side, especially for Mexican food, but the ambiance, staff we encountered, selection & dishes justify them. After dinner, we spent another hour loudly laughing & shrieking while opening gifts... toward the end, one of the members of management came over & we thought he was going to tell us to dial it down a couple notches, BUT he actually came to tell us he appreciated us bringing energy & Christmas cheer to the restaurant. What could have been a disaster, with the initial accommodations, turned into a pretty rad, successful holiday evening with our family away from family.
