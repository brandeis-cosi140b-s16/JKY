Hole in the wall Mexican joint. Consistent quality. Friendly staff. I used to go to the taco place on the corner but now I only go to this joint when I need a quick bite to eat for lunch. My only complaint is that the carrots at the salsa bar seemed mushy...must be canned.

Also, they have surprisingly good chicken wings as well.
