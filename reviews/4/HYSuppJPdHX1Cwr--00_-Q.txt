Went there tonight. For a saturday night, it wasn't full, so we had a table right away. We tried the margarita and sangria, ok. Ceviche was good, plenty of chips, salsa was good. Taco carne asada were good, we didn't try anything else, price wasn't killer, I thought it would be a lot more for Biltmore area.
