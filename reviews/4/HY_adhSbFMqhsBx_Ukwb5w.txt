I found this place from a bartender at the hotel we were staying at, we asked him where does he go for good Mexican food.  The service was excellent as we had a large party.  Margaritas are large and really good.  I ordered the special and had to split it with my husband it was really great food.  We ordered the special with pork and it came with the taco, burrito, beans and rice and the food was awesome.  It was a large plate of food.

We tried to go to dinner on a second trip to Vegas and we couldn't find parking and we circled for at least 10 minutes.  We gave up and I was disappointed.  My husband decided to try again for late lunch the next day and we got it. Yay!!!!

Food was as good as the last trip and service fast and friendly.
