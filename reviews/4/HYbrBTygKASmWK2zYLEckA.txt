My husband and I moved to Las Vegas from Southern California, where we are used to being able to drive to any given corner and find a taco stand with authentic Mexican tacos being prepared on a grill outside. This is simply not the case here in Vegas. An authentic taco is hard to come by, so we were very pleased when we came across El Paisano.

Passing by, it looks like a sketchy hole-in-the-wall kind of place (as many of the best places to eat often do), but what finally brought us in was smelling that familiar aroma of carne asada on the grill and seeing the chefs grilling it outside...it reminded us of home. We went in and ordered two chicken tacos, two carne asada tacos, and a large horchata. Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm!!!! 

The restaurant itself is very small on the inside, so don't come with a large group expecting a sit down dinner. But you will find that many people get their tacos and then eat it right there in the parking lot outside or in their cars.

If you're a fan of real tacos, this place is a must try. Reasonably priced, authentic, and delicious!
