When driving up off of Glendale Ave, you get to see very lively but campy murals and 3 massive parking lots before you enter the back door (the main entrance-don't try the door at the front or you'll never get in).  The food is just like you'd want from a traditional, homestyle, local, family owned joint-- excellent rice and beans (all homemade), great enchilada and tamale sauces, excellent tortillas, fresh chips and sweet tomato salsa.  The prices were excellent-- lunch specials for 5 bucks, dinner platters for 1-2 people 9.50.  Give this place a try.  It's a real down home place.
