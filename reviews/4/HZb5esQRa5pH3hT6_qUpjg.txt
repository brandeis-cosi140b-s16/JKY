I liked it. Sat at the bar which had a couple of seats immediately available which was great. Our bartender was more like a guide explaining when the restaurant opened and the different options. It really turned our weekend's experiences around as we had pretty bad food in Downtown that weekend. 

Chicken tortilla soup was really good. I asked for no cheese,  but it still came out with some. It didn't ruin it though. Margaritas were good too.
