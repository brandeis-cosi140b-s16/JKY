Moe's would get five stars, but they don't because I think we should be able to have queso body shots.  This is epicenter of course full of drunken adults and young adults so going in on a Friday or Saturday night is always entertaining.  Whats good is the staff knows everyone is tore up and they just ride with it.  They are always super talkative and it makes the time fly when you are waiting for that delicious queso. $7 dollars gets you out the door with a drink, chips + queso, and quesadilla.  You will the wake up in the morning and wonder why you feel like garbage, but it will all make sense when you find the Moe's receipt in your pocket.
