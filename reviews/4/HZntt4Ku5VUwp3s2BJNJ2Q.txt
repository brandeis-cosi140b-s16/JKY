3.5 really but it's not allowed. Servers are usually prompt and attentive. If you like hot salsa you have to ask for it. The chicken poblano is well seasoned and stuffed with finely shredded chicken. For a delicious vegetarian option ask for spinach enchiladas...not on the menu but still available . Typically there is not a wait and the food comes out piping hot;) not a whole lot super special to set macayos in a category of it's own but it's good flavor, prompt and consistent service and the margaritas are not bad either ;)
