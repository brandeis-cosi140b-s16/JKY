I'm sitting here stuffing my face with the rolled tacos supreme. Why didn't anyone think of this sooner? They are really really good. I was over at the dealership and looked on Yelp to find somewhere to pick up some food. I saw that this place only had 4 reviews, and Filibertos had 23. I think Fili's is...meh so I tried here instead. I was hoping for a drive thru, and got one. Can't rate it any higher because this is the only menu item I've tried. Very delicious though!
