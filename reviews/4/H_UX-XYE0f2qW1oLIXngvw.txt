Lobster tacos were a nice treat. Service friendly . Simple establishment with nice fresh food. Clean! I checked the chairs and floors. Would easily eat there again.  First impression not good as focus seems to be on alcohol with the big bar and all the booze on display. I was skeptical about ordering food but was pleasantly surprised!
