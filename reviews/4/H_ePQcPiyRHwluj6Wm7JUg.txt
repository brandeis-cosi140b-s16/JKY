I stop at the blue burrito about once every other week when I'm passing through PHX. I'm a big fan of the Works burrito for breakfast and the fajita burrito for lunch and dinner. If I have enough time to dine there, that great otherwise I will just head to the carryout. It's worth walking here from other terminals.
