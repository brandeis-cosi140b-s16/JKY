Had an amazing dinner last night.  I had heard from this place from my friend at work.  I saw the menu online and had to check it out.  I started with the coconut civeche which is citrus marinated snapper tossed with diced bell peppers, scallions, cilantro and coconut habanero sauce.  It was very good.  We then ordered two entrees first the Soft Duck Tacos which are soft corn tortillas filled with slow braised shredded duck, covered with a roasted tomato-habanero cream sauce, topped with chopped onion, cilantro and sesame seeds.  They were really yummy and you get 3 of them which is more than enough to fill you up.  I got the Veracruz Style Seafood Casserole
Fillet of mahi-mahi, clams and shrimp, baked with roasted tomato sauce, olives, capers, chorizo and roasted poblano peppers.  It was amazing.  I will totally go back again and if you haven't been you should totally check it out.
