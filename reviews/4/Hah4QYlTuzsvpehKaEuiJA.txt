This is a Mexican Restaurant far away from the neon lights of Las Vegas and is in the Sunrise Manor neighborhood. You pass this place as you go visit Lake Mead if you are anywhere North of the strip like Freemont street. It's a large inside and they serve really good ceviche.

The best ceviche (street style) I've had I have to say. To be fair I've tried a half a dozen decent places and this ceviche is so good you'll scrape the bottom of the styrofoam plate for every last bit of it. Yeah, I wasn't even that hungry too which makes it that good (for me).

Chips are stale but that's the style, their really not stale. The salsa is hot and red.

Observations:
It was hot as usual and I decided to see if the fish tacos were any good. I know the ceviche is incredible but I was in a hurry and didn't want to eat ceviche in a car in this weather so I chose a taco. Good but not great. As I waited the only two patrons inside the place were eating asada plates. One guy couldn't help but keep looking at me as if I were some undercover guy looking for Butcho or somebody. He had an incredulous look on his face and kept turning his head over to me like if I was going to rob the place. He couldn't help it, that's the face he was born with I suppose. I finally got my tacos and thanked the two ladies working the front and kitchen at that hour and left. 113 degree weather sucks ass but it's a dry heat at least.
