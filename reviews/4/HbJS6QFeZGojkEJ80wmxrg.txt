My wife and I have eaten at Mi Pueblo a number of times, it is located a couple of miles from our home. We have never had a bad meal and the service has always been great. The prices are very reasonable....all of this is why we have been here a number of times. 

I had the jerk chicken for the first time. I will have it again for sure. The chicken was in stips, char-grilled, and very juicy. The jerk sauce was a sour cream / pineapple blend which was very good. Not spicy at all which I would have liked but the mixture of sweet and sour really worked well. Also on the plate was a side of black beans and white rice along with grilled asparagus and zucchini. 

We will definitely continue to eat here. They have a very robust menu, lots of liquor and drink specials, tons of seating indoors and outdoors, and very friendly staff.
