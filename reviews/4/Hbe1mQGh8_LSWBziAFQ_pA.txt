Wow, always nice to find one of these out-of-the-way places that surprises one with the quality of the food and in addition, the quantity. Based on the other Yelp reviews a friend and I started with the ceviche tostada for $4.99. It was a heaping mound of ceviche comprised of fresh shrimp (small pieces but tasty), finely diced tomato and onion, and lime juice, with additional fresh limes to squeeze on top. For one person, this is, in and of itself, a meal. I could see having this with a beer or an ice tea and calling it a day but I'm not a skinny person eater, so I kept going!

Next I had a combo plate (yes, rice, beans and salad with the main entree) with a shrimp taco and a fish taco. Both tacos were substantial and the seafood was done right, flash fried so it was crispy and not greasy and they give you two  types of sauces, one a chipolte cream and then another hot sauce, which I prefer. They come in squeeze bottles so add as you see fit. There is also a bottle of ranch dressing that one can spritz on the salad, and hey, it was a good salad, fresh dark green lettuce, not just iceberg. The beans and rice are okay but nothing special.

Wait service was friendly and timely and as it was a work day, I had the ice tea. I look forward to coming back when I can  try some additional items, but with an adult beverage, like the mixed grilled seafood plate, that looks amazing!

The only thing that was not all that great was that, as others have mentioned, when someone plays a song on the jukebox, it is loud! If they could drop the volume on that thing by like 25%, it would be perfect but hey, for the quality of the seafood, I'll bring some earplugs and keep eating!

Bottom line, go for the ceviche, stay for the seafood tacos and other delights from ocean waters.
