I actually liked the food here. The beef was flavorful and not dry at all and the chicken was good as well. 
The waitress gave us some chips and salsa but I was surprised that they didn't bring over any Pico.  Ah well....
The horchata was pretty good so I would recommend that too.

The decor is pretty interesting. They have these super heavy chairs that are very uncomfortable so be prepared!

I would have stayed longer and maybe ordered more food but there was a baby crying his little head off the whole time I was there and I had to get out of there.

Next time I'll try some take out since I really enjoyed the food.
