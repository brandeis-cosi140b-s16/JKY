This place needs to train their front reception counter and be better prepared for a crowd of 30 especially when advanced notification was given a week in advance, 3days and 1 hour prior to arrival. All three persons who took the call had no idea about a group coming even though the first "manager" said he would  put on the calender and let others know.Pass the chips and Salsa/Beans and keep them coming while we wait for our meals.

Fortunately ... their best asset was the sole waiter - James. HE DID A FANTANTIC JOB to.manage and serve the crowd. Definitely impressed with his skills and pleasant manner. This review 4-Star is for James!
