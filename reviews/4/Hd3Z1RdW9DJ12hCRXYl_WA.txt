We've been in the area for 12 years and had a bad experience about a year ago and haven't been back since. Me and my husband decided to give it another try and it was Taco Tuesday night. Our waiter was Jason and greeted us by taking our drink order and told us chips and menus were on the way. As he was taking our drink order they arrived. Definitely a step up from the last time we were here.  We sat on the patio and had margaritas and tacos and were pleasantly surprised. The weather was great, atmosphere was great and the service was great. We will have to definitely come back soon and will tell our friends who haven't been in a while to do the same.
