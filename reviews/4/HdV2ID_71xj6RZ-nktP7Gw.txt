The Tamale Store made me a believer!  Not having grown up in the Valley, I wasn't exposed to tamales until recently, and I must say my initial impressions were not too favorable. I was ready to chalk up tamales under the category of ethnic food that is more about tradition than taste.  Most of the tamales I'd tasted were bland, mealy affairs of corn skimpily 'stuffed' with under seasons fillings.  Then one day, upon a suggestion from a friend,  I tried a Tamale from the Tamale Store at their kiosk at the Downtown Phoenix Public Market.  Now I'm a believer!  

Unlike the tamales sold at most other places in the Valley, the Tamale Store's version consist of the perfectly cooked masa that is fluffy AND flavorful, overflowing with scrumptious fillings. They carry a full range of tamales, from the traditional (beef, green chile, pork, etc) to unique vegetarian combos ( green corn and cream cheese, spinach and mushroom) to delicious dessert choices (blueberry, pumpkin...) 

I haven't been to the retail store yet, but they are the highlight of my regular trips to the Downtown Phoenix Public Market. I usually have one to eat on the spot, and take a dozen frozen ones to enjoy at home.
