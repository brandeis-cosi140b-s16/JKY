I am a big fan of this restaurant. The location is not so great...just a strip mall, but I think their food is excellent. We are vegetarian, so we get the same thing every time we go...split the cheese enchilada and cheese tamale plate. It is so good. We also love the chips and salsa and margaritas!!
