wow what a gem, went there today for lunch by my work. Chips and salsa where fresh and tasty!

The place was pretty empty (which I like, no screaming kids please!) but the staff was fast and nice and checked on me twice but were not hovering and asking a million questions.

I had the Carne Asada Burro and it was very tasty! The beans were delicious! And you could tell they were homade.

Overall it was very nice. If you are ever in the area try it out!
