I was introduced to Bajio by a co-worker who lives nearby and visits so often that most of the employees know her. She loves the Chicken Green Chile Salad which I tried once and was good. But I love the Pineapple Shrimp Salad which is what I usually get because of the delicious mix of flavors and textures. The salad has both rice and lettuce and comes with crispy flour tortillas. The Shrimp Tacos are also good. They saute the shrimp right when you order it so it takes a bit longer but is nice and fresh. I didn't like the Enchiladas which are not what I consider a true Enchilada. It's like ordering a Quesadilla at Chipotle.

From what I can tell, they bang the kettle when someone leaves a tip. This annoys me too, but like Tracy I keep going back because the food's good.
