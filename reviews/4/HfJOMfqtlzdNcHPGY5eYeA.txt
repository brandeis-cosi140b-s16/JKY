You know that combined feeling of excitement and anticipation you get when you walk into a restaurant and it's as if you've stepped into someone else's country?  Each time I walk into Sinaloa, I feel like I've been transported into a small beach side neighborhood in Mexico.  Although I feel out of place, I'm ecstatic because I'm about to eat some of the best pacifico style seafood in the Valley.  One of my favorite dishes is the Chiccarron de Pargo.  A botana plate of lightly breaded pargo fish (pacific red snapper) that is served on top of a delicious salad that includes poached shrimp, avacados and orange slices.  The "cherry on top" of this dish are the 2 large bacon wrapped peppers stuffed with a cream cheese and shrimp known as "Toritos" which are also available on the menu as an appetizer on it's own.  Oh did I mention there's also a full bar!  If you're not a fan of loud jukebox playing "ba bam bam ba bam bam" ranchero music consider ordering your food to go, which I did just a few hours ago.
