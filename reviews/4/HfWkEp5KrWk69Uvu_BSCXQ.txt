I really like this place! Since we live in Tucson and my mom lives in Gold Canyon, this is my girls and I favorite place to dine when we're in the area.

I have never had a bad meal here! The service is usually pretty good but sometimes you have to ask more than once for something. 

I think they have the best green corn tamales I've ever had! (way better than Tucson Tamale Company's tamales)  

The patio is very nice and large so the tables are not jammed together. They have a full bar and the margaritas are YuMmY.
