Great service, good food and felt great after! I really enjoyed my dinner her. The food wasn't too spicy and the margarita was really good! We even had the man with the guitar sing to us and he was awesome! I will definitely go back! Best part of our meal was that I felt great after. The last time I had Mexican food that I didn't make I felt horrible the entire night. The quality of the kitchen and the ingredients must have been very high!
