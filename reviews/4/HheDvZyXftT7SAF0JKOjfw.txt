A true dive on the end of an access road and also on the end of an old motor lodge. While the lodge may be dead, This little joint is alive!
I had under an hour to get to the airport and had the choripollo dinner. Delicious breast topped with chrorizo and cheese.
Coronas are ice cold.
Service is team oriented. 
My kinda place!
