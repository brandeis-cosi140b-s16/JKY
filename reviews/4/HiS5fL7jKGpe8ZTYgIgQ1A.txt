This is really a 3.5 but I'm going to bring it up to a 4 because it was quick and really inexpensive.

I don't really think I'm a Mexican food connoisseur by any means but I do know good food in general and I have to say I wasn't really impressed.  I mean I was expecting to be blown away, which I guess is my own fault.  My enchilada was no better than any other enchilada I've ever had.  The salsa was good but the chips were not...they almost tasted stale.  I did enjoy the patio area, it provided a good background for lunch with a group.
