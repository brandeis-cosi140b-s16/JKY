I've been having a yearning for something like home cooking but didn't want to put the work into making some good ole lengua tacos. Being in the near vicinity lead me here and hope it wasn't going to be a bust. 

This place is basic, hole in the wall with solid food. The BF and I both got 5 taco plates ($6 or individual was $1.25 I believe) with a few varieties. We came for lengua and it didn't disappoint. It was tender, almost melt in your mouth so they know how to cook this right. I felt like it needed a tad bit of salt, but rather have none than too much. Cabeza tacos here are so good! I think this is my favorite...I even ordered another one of these since I only got one to try. It is of course a bit fatty, meaty concentrated flavor so not for everyone. Pastor here was solid, I thought the seasoning was just right. Carnitas were tender, but out of the 4 varieties we ordered it was not the standout. 

I like that there are refills here on drinks. I feel that ordering horchata in some places, I never get enough. There are various La Michocoan paletas/popsicles in a fridge and they are nice to cleanse the palette after a meaty lunch. Creamy and not ice-y at all like some of these paletas can get. 

This was a solid, cheap (under $10 for the plate, drink and popsicle) and fast lunch. Definitely worth the stop in the area!
