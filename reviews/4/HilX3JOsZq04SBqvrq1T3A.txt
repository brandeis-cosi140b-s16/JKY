Got this place through delivery so can't review the restaurant itself really but only the quality of the food and its fantastic.

It has taken the top of my list for chimichanga(vegetarian, with tofu) no less. I've never even had anything like it before and it was quite amazing. Similar style to Burrito Drive with fresh vegetables and TOFU mixed in. Quite a large serving. The rice and beans was amazing also - probably the best I've ever had. The price was about what i expect. I'm really excited to try other parts of this restaurant's menu such as the Udon Bowl.
