I should start by saying I'm not really a food savant.  If I like the food in a place; it's good.  If I don't like the food at a place, it's not good.  My senses are not keen enough to pick out the hint of Cayenne pepper used to season the enchilada or whatever.  Regardless onto the review:

Alright.  So this isn't a really big place.  There's outdoor and indoor seating, a couple of big TV's (or maybe just one, I actually don't remember now), and some cool paintings on the walls.  The paintings aren't anything Rembrandt, but for some reason I find them oddly entertaining.

I personally enjoy the food ordering process.  It's the Subway style layout, except with Mexican food.  You get a choice of three types of meat, two types of rice, three types of beans, two types of sauces, plus a bunch of extra stuff.  Personally I don't experiment too much, but I can honestly say the chicken, re-fried beans, Mexican rice, and red sauce is tasty.

The employees are friendly and put up with the zoned-out, zombie-like way I shuffle about when I'm thinking of what I want to eat, so thank you for that.  They give off a good, fun, I-don't-hate-you-for-being-here vibe and ring a bell when you leave a tip.

So all in all: good service, good food, good atmosphere.
