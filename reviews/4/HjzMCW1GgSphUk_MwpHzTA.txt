Note: I'm an east coaster. I'm no taco pro. But these guys are awesome and the $5.99 lunch special is rad. 4 'cos (carnitas, pastor, pollo, chorizo), rice, beans, soda, bawse. The rice is bleh (but who needs it) and the pollo taco is bleh (isn't every?), but every other 'co was legit. 3-4 bites each in corn tortillas, they were sized perfectly.

The salsa's are solid, too. Reading previous reviews, I knew to ask for them at the window but didn't expect four different kinds to be tossed in the bag. Each different in consistency and spice level, it was fun to mix and match. 

This place crushes Roberto's (minus the breakfast burrito) and I can't wait to get back here (tomorrow). Bonus: it's right next to a taco bell (sorry TBell).
