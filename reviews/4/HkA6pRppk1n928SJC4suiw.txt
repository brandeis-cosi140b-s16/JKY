Good service. The daughter works the front and she is nice and works hard to make sure the restaurant runs well and is clean. 
The food is really good for AZ/MEX. Cheap. Carne Asada burrito is very good. Also, the beans are authentic. One of the best breakfast burritos around. 
Now, some people knock the location and decor. Well, I don't eat either one so I'l leave that to other raters ( my friends say I can eat a lounge chair in less than a minute). 
Nice people and quick to get your order out. Recommended by this mexican food aficionado.
