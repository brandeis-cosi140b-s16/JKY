I really like this restaurant.  The food is always good.  The salsa is nice and spicy and the service is fast and attentive.  It's a great place to take my entire family.

I usually order the chicken fajitas, which are amazing.  I also love that they serve a complimentary bowl of soup with the standard chips and salsa.  Nice touch! The kids love it.
