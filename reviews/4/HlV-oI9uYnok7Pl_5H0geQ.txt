Overall Viva Mercados was an excellent dining experience.  The atmosphere was average, the staff was above average, the food was above average.

Viva Mercados begins the dining experience with Chips, Fresh Salsa, and Bean Dip.  The Bean Dip was a new and welcome experience for Mexican Restaurants here in the states.  It is delicious.  The Chips are light and delicious as well.  My wife and I shared a Shrimp Ceviche that was presented very well and was delicious.  It had TONS of shrimp and avocado and was very limey and satisfying.  My main course consisted of the three steak Tacos that were EXCELLENT.  The Steak was tender and seasoned very well and the tacos had shredded cabbage onions and a sprinkling of lime juice.  Very good.  My wife had the Chicken Fajitas.  Tons of Chicken, and overall very good.  

The staff was very friendly and attentive and extremely expeditious (almost too quick).  They seemed very interested in serving quickly and getting the table back.  I personally do not like this and would prefer the diner set the pace (as it is done in Europe).  One small negative in an overall excellent experience.  Additional point about the staff was that they had live Mariachis playing and it definitely added to the experience.

I would highly recommend Viva Mercados for delicious, semi authentic Mexican food.
