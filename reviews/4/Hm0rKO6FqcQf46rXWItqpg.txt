I'm not totally comfortable eating in because of the TV and the spare atmosphere, but when I get take-out tacos and bring it to the lounge at work, and open the styrofoam containter, the entire room fills with the most aromatic, fragrant corn tortilla bliss that ever was produced.    There is something about their corn shells (I asked, and they are made in Chicago - - maybe Milagro?) that is gently soft and almost falling apart, but immediately wafts you to Virgin of Guadalupe heaven, and everyone in the room is swept along.   I always get the lengua, but you can't go wrong with any of the tacos - - get all the extras, and take some salsa too.
