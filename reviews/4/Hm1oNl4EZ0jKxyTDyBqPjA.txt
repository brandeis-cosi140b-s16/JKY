Great Mexican restaurant.  My wife and I have been to this establishment a number of times and it is always good.  Last night was no exception.  

Chips and salsa arrive to our table shortly after we are seated, followed by an attentive waiter that took our drink order.  On a couple of occasions, we have taken advantage of the 2-for-1 house margaritas, but opted for fountain Coke products for this visit.  My wife always gets the combination plate No. 2 where I typically attempt trying something new.  On this particular visit, I went for an old standby that was on special: the seafood burrito.  The best way I can describe my burrito is that it is always consistently good, yet frequently inconsistent.  
I have had the seafood burrito on a number of occasions and it's always delicious.  The seafood is never overdone and never fishy but there is always a little difference in the execution.  On this most recent occasion, I was given the option to have beans and rice on the side as opposed to inside the burrito, but I don't think I have ever had the burrito with rice and beans.  It was also stuffed with a decent amount of spicy yet almost fruity jalapenos which I have never noticed before.  I have also ordered the same burrito and it has come to the table smothered with queso.  
Please don't mistake that I am complaining.  The food is great.  My wife always gets the combination plate No. 2 because the beef is always tender and flavorful as well as the chicken.  We have never had a bad meal at this location.  Burritos, tacos, the chimichanga verde, the fajitas jalisco; they are all great.
You don't walk into the place expecting 5-star gourmet but it tastes delicious and it is reasonably priced.
