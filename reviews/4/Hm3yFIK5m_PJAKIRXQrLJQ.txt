Anyone who is from the South East Valley or Tucson knows what to expect from Mexican food.  The nicer and cleaner the seating area, the worse the food. The weirder and less nice the seating area, the better the food. This is the way of Mexican Food. 

             The place does look kinda dingy on the inside. Mismatching chairs, peeling paint, ghetto attempts at creating space and etc. are obvious.... but the food is awesome. I go there quite a bit and have yet to have a negative experience. 

 You don't go for this place for the atmosphere, you don't go here for the unrivaled customer service. You come here because you love Mexican food and real Mexicans make REAL Mexican food.   
 
    The Tues Taco deal is awesome and the breakfast burritos are amazing.
