i used to frequent this location often and always had zach as a server by request.  my order was always correct and we even let him order for us a couple times and were not dissappointed.  also let him persuade us to try new shots and drinks occasionally. the food and drinks were always good and if anything was wrong it was quickly rectified.  our waiter has since moved on so we no longer go here as often but if you read  this zach let me know where you are now we would like to come support you wherever you are.
