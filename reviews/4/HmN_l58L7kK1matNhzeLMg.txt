I like coming here in the morning and having a breakfast burrito and then going outside and sitting in the morning sun.

It is nice too, if you happen to prefer a coffee or tea instead of a juice with your breakfast burrito then you can go next door to Starbucks and get that.

Is this place super styling? No. But I like it. Simple. Order food. Get it. Eat it. And then you are off to your next Yelping location.

Maybe next time I should try one of their non-breakfast burritos!
