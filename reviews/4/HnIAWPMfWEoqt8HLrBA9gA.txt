This location is the best America's Taco Shop of all the ones I've been to. The quality of the food is a notch above the rest. Even if you haven't liked ATS in the past, I'd suggest giving this one a try before writing it off. The staff are exceptional and the owner of this location is the real deal business owner. When he's not checking in with his customers and managing things he's rubbing elbows with his employees. I've had the pleasure of talking with him more than once and I can assure you he's passionate about his work and it shows in employee demeanor and high quality food. 

I'm a sucker for their Al Pastor and Bean/Cheese Burrito. When you get Pastor at other places, it's usually kind of greasy and gritty due to the cut of pork, but not here. I don't know if they use a different cut or really trim the meat before cooking, but whatever they do pays off BIG TIME! 

I don't always get it, but the Horchata is wonderful. One time when I was talking with the owner, he brought me a Horchata coffee drink - I have no idea what it's called (Horchatalatte? I'm sure if you ask him he'll know), but it was damn near a religious experience it was so good.
