Food has always been very tasty here. The mashed potatoes are unique and tasty and mostly all dishes I have had we're good. The one I recall being a bit less in quality were the steak nachos and not because it lacked flavor or quantity, just a bit of a grizzle problem on the steak. 

The patio here is one of the best in my opinion. Cozy with a fireplace and lots of fun lights. Great for an afternoon with margaritas!

Oh if u are a chips and salsa lover it is very tasty (and somewhat spicy) here. 

Only reason I gave it four stars vs five is that they have a lack of desire to run their air conditioning until it is absolutely necessary which can leave it a little warm for some inside.
