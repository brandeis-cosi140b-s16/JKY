My husband and I visit Viva Mercado's often.  The wait staff is attentive and very friendly.  Our drinks are never empty! The complimentary soup they serve is very good! And I also love the chips and salsa/bean dip.  The chips are always fresh and crispy.  I love their chimichanga's and my husband is partial to the fajitas that come to the table still sizzling.  If you haven't tried this place yet, you're missing out!
