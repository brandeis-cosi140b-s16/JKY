I visited there and was SHOCKED to see that it was physically connected to a strip club.  I was MORTIFIED, but still went it in with great trepidation.  It was well worth it, though.  There were strippers inside (according to our guacamole maker), but they were properly clad--no stanky legs in there. LOL!!!  My mom and I shared the Carne Asada and the tableside guacamole---it was mmm, mmm, good!  The tortilla chips were even good.  The Carne Asada was extremely seasoned and tender, in addition to the portion being rather large (and I'm greedy); we couldn't eat it all, so we definitely had leftovers.  Now let's get to the service---it was subpar.  Our server was inattentive.  When we brought to her attention that we didn't receive flour tortillas as requested, she searched through the tortillas only to prove herself wrong---idiot!!  Who does that???  We had to continually repeat our requests and some were never even answered--and that was by random workers walking by, as we couldn't wait till Christmas for our server to reappear.
