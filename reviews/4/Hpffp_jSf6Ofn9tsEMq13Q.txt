Love love love the al pastor from this taco truck. The place always looks clean and shiny, and they keep the salsa bar spotless and well-stocked. Beware the green salsa, it's not guacamole and it's killer hot and spicy. The food is 5 star but I have to deduct 1 star for not having a place to sit here ( the location at E Charleston has a nice little seating area).
