Went in January for my birthday lunch.Loved the laid back vibe, especially compared to Postino next door. Skinny margaritas was fantastic!!! Got a taco combo and split with the hubby crispy fish, baja fish and the standard side of black beans and a carnita taco. Would skip the crispy fish next time, beans were ok. Others were above average but the soft corn tortillas get messy fast so eat quickly. Another upward project success story.
