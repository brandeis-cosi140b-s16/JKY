Few restaurants will receive 5 stars from me so this rating is good. Much of what other Yelpers has written is true. The place is bright and seemingly clean. The food could be spicier than the dish that I had yet I like food that makes me sweat & this didn't. Nonetheless, I will be back as it was very good. 

Food server was very pleasant and always had a nice smile. She was attentive yet didn't smother me. 

Very good!!  :-)
