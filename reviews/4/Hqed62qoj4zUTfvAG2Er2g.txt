Service was attentive and food was decent, some say bland,as they must like a lot of salt and seasoning, which I like to add a little salt,not overdo  the seasoning, like most places I have been too. I got the shrimp fajitas and was amazed the huge shrimps I got, yummy... Lots of onions and some bell peppers, which I know come with it , but really do not partake.. The rice was a little stiff, not soft and fluffy..
And the chips with bean dip was yummy too, and change from the salsa mix...
the extra star for service....
