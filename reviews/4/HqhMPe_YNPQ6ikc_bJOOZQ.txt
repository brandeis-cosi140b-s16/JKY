After months of inadequate staff who constantly messed up our order and took forever, something changed, and this Taco Bell has returned to what it had been.  Friendly staff, reliable service.  And that tasty Taco Bell quality I've come to enjoy when I'm good and hammered or just not in the mood to cook or drive very far.
