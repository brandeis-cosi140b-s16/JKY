Ladies and gents - listen up. If you're looking to impress your date, The Mission should go on your list. Sexy, dimly-lit interior? Check. Spacious yet comfy bar area? Check. Tempting menu with plenty of items to share? Check, check, check. 

I'm a huge fan of tableside guac, and the Mission whipped up a batch just to my liking (maybe less so to my friends at the table.) I'm not a fan of tomatoes with my avo, but feel free to load up on the garlic, onion, cayenne and anything that's extra hot. Yum! I could have made a meal on the freshly-made guac, crispy-thin chips and smoky-flavored salsa alone.

We were lucky enough to sample a tasting menu, which is how I prefer to eat at restaurants like this where it's easy to be overwhelmed by all the delicious-sounding options. For the life of me, I can't remember every single item we tried, but the pork tacos were a standout and I loved the presentation of the extra tortillas on a salt block. As expected, they have a huge variety of tequilas to choose from, and the margs, caprihinas and mojitos all have an twist. Try the pineapple ginger mojito - it's just as flavorful as it sounds. And the milkshake with churro dessert. You will not be disappointed!
