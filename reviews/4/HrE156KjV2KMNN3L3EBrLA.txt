I have to say, when I first came to Champaign-Urbana, I heard about many different restaurants from different people, but none of them were Mexican. As much as I like it, Chipotle doesn't count. I have eaten lots of somewhat authentic Mexican food in my life time, but I honestly never expected to find a place like this!

It's a pretty easy place to miss. It's a tiny brick building that says "Mexican Grocery Store", and the interior is certainly isn't going to win any awards for cleanliness. But I wasn't fooled, I could tell right away that this place was going to serve me true authentic mexican cuisine.

The menu above the counter might be hard to read, but they had a very nice selection of meats to choose from for their tacos. I tried Carnitas, Shredded Beef, and Chorizo tacos. All of them were quite delicious!

But the food wasn't the only impressive part about this establishment. When my friends and I went, it was manned by just one person, and he was extremely friendly to boot. He really deserves a medal for the effort.
