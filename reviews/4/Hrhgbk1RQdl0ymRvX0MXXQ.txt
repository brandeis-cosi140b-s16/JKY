Chipotle is the only corporate/chain restaurant I still eat in, for a couple of really good reasons.

First, fresh ingredients and great taste. Not the biggest variety of options, but what they do, they do well.

Second (and this might surprise most people), in addition to their meats being naturally and humanely raised, Chipotle also sources most of its produce locally. They buy direct from local organic farmers and distributors who source from local, organic farms. They are more responsible in this way than many locally-owned places.

Kudos, Chipotle.
