I think every review so far is right on, but I always assume the grease is suppose to be on this kind of food :) It is one of the better drive through 24 hour places, especially here in the NW side of the valley.  I chose it over Fil's.  The horchata isn't too syrupy, the beef hard shell tacos are awesome, the quesadilla is good, the bean and cheese burrito is awesome, and the hot sauces are the bomb diggity! Every time we drive through, the staff talks it up (or even sings and dances) with us.
