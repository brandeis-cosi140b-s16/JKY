i kept it simple with chicken taquitos. couldn't find one thing to complain about. some of the best chips and salsa around. i'm not one to finish a whole basket but i pretty much felt obliged to do so the shit was so good. i can see where someone may have complaints about the staff, but they're busy - so give 'em a break. i'll be back soon.
