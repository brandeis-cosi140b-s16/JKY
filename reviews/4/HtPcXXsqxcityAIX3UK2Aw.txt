El Patron has become a frequent hang out for my family and friends, from Ladies night out, birthdays, or just a night out for a fantastic dinner. 

Their drinks are amazing and extra large in size, if it is your birthday, they will put you in a sombrero, serenade you, and provide you with a tequila shot, if over 21 of course. 

During warmer weather, they have live music on their outdoor patio. 

Chips and salsa, served along with a unique spicy ranch type dipping sauce is something different. Specific wait staff are designated just for keeping the chip basket full with warm crisp chips. We always order a side of con queso, which is authentic Mexican melted white cheese, not the Velveeta and rotel dip served at most other Mexican restaurants. 

The menu selections are vast, providing a wide range of choices, including chicken, beef, and seafood meals. My favorite are the many varieties of fajitas, sizzling hot when served at the table, and with loads of vegetables that are still crisp and flavorful. 

They also have a great variety of deserts to finish off your meal, if your stomach still has room, I recommend the fried ice cream, or flan.
