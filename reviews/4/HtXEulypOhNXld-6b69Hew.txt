Not really close to a 5star standard, but good quality food in large portions at reasonable pricing, although I'd skip the dinky undercooked spring roll. Plenty of free parking but a sketchy area in general,  And, the building specifically is not appealing. The staff is friendly and helpful. All told, worth going again, especially for Mexican breakfast, but not worth a long drive cross town.
