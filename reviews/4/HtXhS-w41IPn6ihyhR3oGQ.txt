I can see where this place would be a turnoff to some people. It looks like breeding ground for Juicy-clad, ugg-wearing teenage girls with its trendy Mexican decor, but I actually like it. Our bill wasn't too bad, $40 for 3 people, and the shrimp salad I had was DELICIOUS. There were some pears, avocado, glazed walnuts (I think), and BBQ coated shrimp among other ingredients. SO GOOD!

I went during the middle of a weekday, so it was pretty quiet there, but the waitress sat another noisy party directly next to us when the entire patio was open. That's so unprofessional.

Overall I would come back to this place.
