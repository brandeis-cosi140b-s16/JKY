Local Biz Alert!!

I had no idea this was a local business for years. I remember seeing them in the airport, then in Scottsdale Fashion Square, and recently after looking for some good Mexican food near Scottsdale Shea Healthcare to take my girl to lunch I noticed a Yelp Deal for this place and thought it was finally worth a shot. 

It was not until I walked up to the front door and noticed the Local First AZ Sticker that I knew it was locally owned. Sorry for taking all your time to mention that, it's important to me. 

So to the restaurant, it's your typical fast casual restaurant, you order, pick up your food with a number, get your own drinks, salsa, but a waitress comes around to refill your drinks or clear away empty plates. 

The food was pretty delicious. HUGE portions. For sure something that can be shared, or eat half of it and take it back to work for lunch the next day.  The ingredients tasted fresh and the menu looked exciting enough to where I had trouble picking something and I look forward to going back and trying something new, like the enchiladas. 

The salsa bar and chips deserves its own paragraph. If you like Baja Fresh's salsa bar, then you'll also like Blue Burrito's. I believe there was 4 different salsa options, plus cilantro. Then there is a big container of fresh chips. They were still warm and very tasty. It's all you can eat for the salsa and chips which is awesome!!

Next time we go back, I want to get a margarita too!
