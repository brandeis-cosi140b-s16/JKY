This is my first ever time trying this chain.  I am pleasantly surprised!!! MUCH better than "Taco Hell".  My fixin's were fresh, the meat was well seasoned.  I was afraid to try it because fat Mexican food can be really gross.  I'm not opposed to pulling into another one of these drive thrus in the future now! Food is 3/5 but with their affordable menu pricing I added a star.  Where else can you get lunch for under $5!!!
