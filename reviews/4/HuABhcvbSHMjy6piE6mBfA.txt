This is a great little place.  The atmosphere is authentic enough to feel like it's good mexican, but not fancy enough to feel all conceited about it.  They have some good (unlimited) chips with salsa or bean dip to eat before your meal, and they've got a solid menu full of very reasonably priced stuff.  On some of it you can tell they are cutting corners to save money, but I don't mind because they're passing the savings on to you by not charging too much.  For example, their Chili Relleno is wrapped in a scrambled egg instead of being batter-fried.  Or their fried ice-cream that's just covered in corn flakes instead of a true sweet-crumb batter.  But they still taste great and, like I said, it's cheap.  I ate there last night with my wife and it was $25 for the both of us.  Maybe $30 with the fried ice cream.

Also, they take reservations for large groups.  Sometimes I'll go there after a business meeting so I'll call ahead and get a large table for 12 in the back.  They're cool with that and the service is always great.
