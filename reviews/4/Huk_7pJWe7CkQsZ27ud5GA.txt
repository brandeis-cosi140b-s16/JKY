Aaah, Taco Bell. If my boys could eat here every day, they would. 

I've never actually stepped foot inside of this location. I always go through the drive through, the only downside is that they have a really long wait time, the drive thru is always busy, that's why I can't give them 5 stars. Average wait time is about 10 minutes but on other occasions I have waited up to 20. 

The employees have always been very nice and friendly. I always get the correct order, which is great, no ones likes driving back because of an incorrect order, now, I don't want to jinx myself (knock on wood).
