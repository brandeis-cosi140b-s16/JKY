Found these guys by accident and I've got to say it was a happy accident. The only reason it's 4 stars is because the decor and ambience are a bit quirky. You need to get past that and enjoy the food. Green chile beef relleno was excellent. Just spicy hot enough (I usually have to add hot salsa at restaurants because the spices are too wimpy). Husband had Sonoran enchiladas which were unlike anything I've ever had before. Servers were all friendly, quick to respond to requests and attentive. If you get here and are dismayed by the definite "50s look" complete with hokey neon martini glass, go in anyway cuz you won't be dismayed by the food.
