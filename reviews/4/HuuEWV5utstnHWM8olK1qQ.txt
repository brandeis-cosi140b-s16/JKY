I have been eagerly awaiting the opening on Silverado Ranch, and I was not disappointed.  

The atmosphere was relaxed and the table area roomy and clean.  The ingredients were fresh and seasoned wonderfully.  My favorite is the salad bowl with beans, grilled shrimp and red sauce. 

Zabas will finely l definitely become a regular lunch spot.
