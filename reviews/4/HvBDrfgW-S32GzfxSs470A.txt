I don't know what the negative reviews are talking about.  We stopped in today and had enchiladas and burritos and they were good.  Both things and sodas were $12. You can't expect gourmet for that price.  For the price you pay, the quality is appropriate.  We enjoyed it and will go back next time eye in the mid for a fast, cheap meal.
