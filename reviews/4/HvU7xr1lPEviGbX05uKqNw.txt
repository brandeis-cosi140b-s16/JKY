Located in a shopping center next to the Marriott South Park, pacos tacos did not disappoint! Moscow mule was spot on and perfectly blended. Sat at the bar and ordered a two taco entree, brisket and shrimp. Side of Brussels sprouts. Absolutely delicious, perfect amount of heat, and service was spot on. Bar staff was appropriate in the amount of checking in, never overwhelming. Scene is vibrant and always busy, but you are still well taken care of. I recommend and will be back!
