Wow. Very pleasantly surprised by this place. I've stayed at this hotel before and shyed away from here because when I walked up the decor just says run away. The decor is like a Denny's trying to be Mexican. Not sure if the problem is the cheap plastic plants or the lighting....but don't let it keep you from the food here. I had the Flaming Fajita plate which comes with shrimp, steak, and chicken. Also had a Cadillac Margarita. Both were great! I actually was sitting there eating and drinking and talking to myself about how surprisingly good this is. I'm pretty critical as you can tell from my other reviews, and this place is good! Service was fast and courteous too! Will be back. Wish the hotel was as good.
