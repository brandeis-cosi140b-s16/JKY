I love this restaurant... From the fun, artsy decor to the mole sauce... it's great!  The enmoladas are amazing.  Seriously, the best mole sauce I've had in recent years.  The dining area is small but cozy... the atmosphere is so comfortable and unique that it makes for a great experience.  The staff aims to please... they are always friendly and attentive (and they don't overdo it to the point where they're annoying).  Give it a try if you haven't!
