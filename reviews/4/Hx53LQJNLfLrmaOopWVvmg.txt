So whenever former Phoenix Yelper Jim W arrives or departs, you can count on a dust storm, a big one.  It's like he's got his own set of haboobs.  But when he suggested La Condesa, I said to hell with a clean car and clean hair.  It was about time I met La Condesa.  And the pleasure was all mine.

First off, the salsa bar is more like a salsa buffet.  And the guacamole..yum, it had mango in it!  Not sure if that's a seasonal thing, but it was tasty.  The carne asada taco was good, but the Mayan Cochinita Pibil taco (let's just call it shredded pork) was so far beyond good, you have to taste it to believe it.  And I suggest you do, soon.
