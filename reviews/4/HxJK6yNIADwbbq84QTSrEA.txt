Rubio's is A-OK indeed. Good food, good variety of fish and good service. But here's why I give them only 4 stars instead of the 5 stars I gave one of their smaller one-site competitors Tortilla Fish on Elliot Road in Tempe: Besides being expensive, It's so cookie cutter and mass produced that something gets lost in the flavor of the food. The corn tortillas have machine rounded  edges, like they were pulled out of a bag instead of made fresh. The avocado slices are so exact and pressed together that it seems machine made. Don't get me wrong -- as chain's go, Rubio's is reliably good, but I'd be willing to bet their legendary first store in San Diego was a lot better.
