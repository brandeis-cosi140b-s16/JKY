Such a great little place. We can argue for days about Authentic or not....Who cares? 
The Food is fresh and yummy! Not too much salt or grease and everything seems to be made to order. 
I went for the Coastal Trio which was Fish Taco, Shrimp Taco, Tilapia Taco! All were great and loaded with fresh ingredients. If I had to nit-pick the tortilla could've been a little softer, but it held together great! 
Salsa bar was amazing with something for everyone. I think 6-7 types to choose from. 
This is a very nice place that I will certainly visit again! 
If you like Seafood Tacos/Burritos, give this place a try. Don't let the Commercialized Type Presence scare you away, its very good food!
