3 pm on a Tuesday: about to fall asleep at work, drank 2 cups of coffee.

5 pm: About to leave work, had another coffee.

7pm: Just finished working out, had a bit more coffee.

By the time 8 o'clock rolled around, all the caffeine hit me HARD and I was bouncing off the walls.

Being a poor-just-out-of-school "adult," I decided to hit up Diego's for their $1 margaritas to drink my caffeine high away. After 4 drinks, I decided I've had enough, and paid less than double digits. 

Moral of the story, $1 margaritas = awesome :)
