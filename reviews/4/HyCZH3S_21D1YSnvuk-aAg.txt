The food was great, the service was terrific and the atmosphere was nice too. We went early, as we had 2 toddlers with us, to which the staff was super accommodating. According to my daughter the Lengua tacos were the best. The craft beer selection was enormous,  we will have to go back and spend more time tasting the yummy brews.
