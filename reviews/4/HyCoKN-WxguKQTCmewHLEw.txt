I went here for dinner with a friend this past Thursday evening and we had a great experience from drinks to food to the customer service.
We were able to be seated outside on the patio immediately upon arrival which was great!  Our server was very friendly and attentive; she provided recommendations for drinks and food and she didn't rush us out after finishing our meal which I really appreciated, especially with it being such a pleasant summer night to sit outside.  
We both went with the taco dinner-I chose 1 fish taco and 1 of their calabacitas (zucchini blossoms, yum!) tacos, while my friend went with 2 chicken tacos.  We also both got one of their lime margaritas.  The dinner came with refried beans, rice, and some pickled veggies too!  All in all, we were both pleased with our food!  The calabacitas taco was my favorite hands-down, but the fish taco was pretty yummy too.  
I would definitely recommend Wedge as a great spot to sit outside, catch up with friends, and enjoy some Mexican food in downtown Champaign for a fairly reasonable price.
