Late one night, compelled by hunger and a dwindling bank account my boyfriend and I decided to try Los Armandos on a dare. While we are not picky eaters caution is the watch word when considering a place to grab a late night nosh.

To our surprise, we quickly discovered two things: #1) exceedingly low prices and #2) and after midnight no one in the joint speaks English.

On our first trip we ordered Carne Asada for me and a #6 combo platter for my other half. Upon arriving at our mutual dwellings, we both crossed ourselves and said a prayer, then when at it.

The Carne Asada fries filled the styrofoam container to the breaking point; the meat was very tender, very flavorful and very plentiful and the fries were freshly 'Frenched.'

My boyfriend's #6 combo platter taco/beef burrito with rice and beans left him hovering 18" above the floor for several hours after he consumed the food.

In all, we have become true devotees of this well-lit hole in the wall little patch of Mexico!

We highly recommend to this place anyone who happens to be low on cash, big on appetite and in the general vicinity.
