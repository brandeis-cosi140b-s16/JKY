We had a marvelous lunch of seafood tostado grande and grilled salmon with mushroom and garlic sauce.  It was as good as it gets!  Iced tea, cold beer with lime in a salt-rimmed mug --what else is there in life!?!
Yes, it is a divey neighborhood joint.  But the attentive service makes up for the "comfy" decor.
