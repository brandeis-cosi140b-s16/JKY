I've been to Someburros a few times now - it's all been takeout so I can't speak to the service but I absolutely enjoy the food.

They have a big menu with tons of a la carte choices, I've had the bean tostada, cheese enchilada, nachos, guacamole, chips and salsa - these have been consistently tasty.  The beef potato taco was good but a little greasy (it's the kind of taco that is stuffed and then lightly fried in a pan), the shredded beef taco came with a soft corn tortilla - it was a little bland and the meat was too dry.

What bumps this from a three to four star is the huge menu and extremely cheap prices.  They also offer a variety of interesting sides/extras in different sizes.   The food is fresh too, no soggy lettuce or mealy tomatoes here.  Above average Mexican fast food.
