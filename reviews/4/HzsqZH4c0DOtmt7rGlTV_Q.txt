Oh, classic Dos. I've been to Dos 100 times, this was the first time I've ever eaten here. Had a taco plate with 5 chicken/chorizo tacos......FREEKIN BOMB!!!!!

Nice atmosphere for a Sunday afternoon, country music playing thru the speakers, pretty mellow crowd. One waitress it seemed like, but she rocked!!  

I'm still a fan!!!!
