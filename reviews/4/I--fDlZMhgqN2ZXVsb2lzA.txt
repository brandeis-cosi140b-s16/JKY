Ordered the Stuffed Chicken Breast and it was very unique and delicious! It consisted of a chicken breast stuffed with jalapeño cream cheese, sautéed (fajita style) vegetables & topped with queso fundido. Very rich and creamy. I'd order it again because I've never seen anything like it anywhere else. 

Our server was Lance and he was great. He was very knowledgable about the menu and he kept up with everything we needed. 

The only area of improvement is the chips and salsa. The salsa was just okay and the chips were a tad stale...but I still ate a ton of them. 

I'd go back next time I visit Arizona!
