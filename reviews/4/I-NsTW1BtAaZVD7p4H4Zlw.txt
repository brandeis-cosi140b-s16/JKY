My favorite Robertos and luckily it is close to the house. I always get a friendly smile and feel welcome and that they appreciate my business. I have read other reviews about them not melting the cheese on the enchiladas, that was not a fluke or an oversight on an order, they just don't. They will if you ask though but for me the flavor is good enough that I don't even care about that. I love their rice and beans, may not be the most authentic in the land but is very pleasing to my simple pallete.  For the money and the portions for a fast mexican meal it surely does the job for me. Its rival for my attention is pepes. I haven't tried many other places and now that i am joining the yelp family I will seek some others out.. Robertos, can ya keep up the pace cuz I am gonna cheat on you.....
