We went here for our 2nd anniversary.... We were staying at gold canyon and so this was a great close option... Food was good... We had the shrimp fajitas and burrito. Service was wonderful and they have a nice patio with some old growth trees and they had some twinkle lights when it got darker. Good chips, salsa and guacamole. Overall a great option for the area.
