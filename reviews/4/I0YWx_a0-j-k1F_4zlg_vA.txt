Never had an issue with the Filiberto's franchise. Always decent food, and always open! This one is on my way to work, sometimes at 4 in the morning! A good chili verde burritos sounds like a good way to start the day! In and out of there will fast, haven't ruined a order yet! Easy place to get in and our of there, located right off of Grand Ave.
