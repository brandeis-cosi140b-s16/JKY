I have been going to this place for almost 5 years now and it has always been good. From the time you walk in and notice the great decorations and the smells of sizzling fajitas. You are greeted by friendly staff people who actually seem happy to see you and then are given a choice of where you would like to sit. 

They do offer seating outside on the patio but the inside is best given it is usally over a 100 during the summer time and they always keep it nice and cool. The menu is not very large and features old school Mexican fare such as tacos, burritos, and rice and beans. Now if that was all they offered I would still suggest going there. One of the things that makes this place really great is the fact that they give you Free Fresh chips AND salsa!! How about that?? 

No over priced stale tortilla chips and jar pace picante sauce, but great tasting free food ( not normally seen hence the reason for the caps). They have a full bar stocked with every kind of mood altering beverage you could want to pour down your throat to chase that extra cheesy mouth full of queso dip you are going to want to order as a starter. Warm with a little bit of spice to give it a little kick it is the best way to get your dinner started right. 

If you are really in the mood for a few drinks, some great food for the after work crowd or a nice family style sit and eat some good food type place then this is the spot for you. (NOTE) Make sure to go there during happy hour as the drinks are much cheaper and the SUPER BIG nachos are half off. They also serve breakfast on Sunday if you are looking for a new Sunday breakfast joint.
