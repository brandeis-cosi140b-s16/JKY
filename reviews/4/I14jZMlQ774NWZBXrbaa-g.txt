As a long time local, I've seen this place fail as four different food places, I was pleasantly surprised when I stopped by there for a quick lunch yesterday. The family has put in extensive work into the interior and exterior. Noted are a kids play area, several picnic tables and a sand cornhole area with scoreboards and three sets of boards. 
    I came in, sat at the bar and spied the menu. Ordered a Bell's two hearted. ( one of my favorite) it came in a plastic pint cup. A glass one would have been a nicer touch. . I ordered the steak tacos which were seconded by the bartender. They showed up quickly in two nicely grilled street taco sized grilled corn tortillas. Stuffed with fresh pico and grilled steak with a hint of cumin. Yum!  Choice of pinto or black. My black beans were actually too smokey, making me wonder if they were burned. My side scoop of rice was pretty standard. 
$15.18 bill and I'm out the door. I'm really looking forward to eating my way through the menu and spending some outdoor time there this spring. I'm still wondering if location is going to be this places downfall as it can be difficult to get in to and out of.
