Jordan's is the first restaurant I ever ate at- I was only 4 months old and I had rice.  Ever since then, this restaurant has been my guilty pleasure.  My favorite thing on the menu is the sour cream cheese enchiladas- they are heavenly.  Nowhere else makes enchiladas that good!  The food is definitely NOT heart healthy, but it's great for mental health.  I am a big fan of the shredded beef tacos, the crispy bean tostadas, and the yummy chimis.  I would stay away from the fajitas and the salads, though.  I've taken people here, and they don't like the paste-like hot sauce in lieu of salsa, but I'm absolutely addicted.  I always get some to go!
