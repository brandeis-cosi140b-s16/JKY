Fantastic awesome tacos! Decent deals for happy hour/lunch specials and I would highly recommend the $2 tacos on Tuesdays (2 tacos would satisfy all but the hungriest of eaters). Very quiet for our two lunch visits although it's not exactly a bustling location in general. Service was fast and the other food entrees that we've tried have been good - chimichanga, pollo fundito, etc all were as expected.
