Almost gave a five star, but the service seemed to get worse and worse as the meal went on. Cozy, authentic Mexican restaurant with a large menu for anyone's taste buds! I ate the carne asada burrito and added guacamole and sour cream while my boyfriend had the cheese enchiladas. I would stray away from adding sour cream because it made the burrito a little too "wet"- totally my fault. The enchiladas come with cotija cheese rather than the Americanized version! I'd recommend getting your soda from the glass bottle rather than the can- so yummy.
