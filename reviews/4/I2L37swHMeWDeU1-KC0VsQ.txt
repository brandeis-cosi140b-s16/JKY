I have driven by this place many many times and would have never thought to stop in. Thank God for Yelp! On the recommendation from a few awesome fellow Yelpers, my husband and I stopped in for lunch on Saturday.

First thing I noticed when walking in is the salsa bar! Salsa bars rock!

There are few tables in there. We ate in but I got the impression most people ordered to go. 

We decided to split the California fish burrito and a side of chips and queso. I was a little nervous at first cause it took a little time to get the burrito together....what i didnt realize was it was becuase they were frying the plaintains on the spot!! The burrito was ginormo (thank gosh we split it cause i was full for like 8 hours after!) and had rice, beans (half black, half pinto), tilapia, pico, and plaintains. Super messy, yet super delish! The queso was that white queso and was really good. I love me some queso! 

Good thing for me is that soon we are moving really close to th Burrito Factory......bad thing for my workouts cause Im gonna have to amp them up to compensate for discovering this place!
