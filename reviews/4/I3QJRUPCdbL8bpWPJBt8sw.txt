Wow, some of the best coastal Mexican food I've ever had, hands down! 

So who needs to go on vacation to get this type of food. Not this person.

Free chips with seafood Ceviche as your wait person greats you. Good horchata and blended drinks. Oh yeah they have a wide assortment of Mexican beers and sodas. But the food is amazing. A very large menu. Many of the dishes share a similar yet very different spice combination that makes them all worth trying. I have been to there Madison location more than a dozen times and haven't had the same thing twice. All were great, some seasoned better than others, but all great. 

I look forward to going to this establishment and even crave it at times.
