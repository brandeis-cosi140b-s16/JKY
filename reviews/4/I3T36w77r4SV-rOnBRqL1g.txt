We stopped in for the first time based on a recommendation of another Yelper.

The chairs are extremely comfortable, but the artwork on the wall is very strange. I don't get it. It seems like they just decided to hang ugly paintings instead of actually painting the walls, they are very dirty. 

Our service was ok, but I assume she was new. I ordered 2 tacos a la carte and my boyfriend ordered a meal which comes with beans and rice. We then headed up to the salsa bar to accompany our chips. There were sooo many to choose from. I loved the green salsa and who would have known salsa made from radishes would actually be really tasty??

Our tacos were great, the beans didn't taste like they were from a can and the meat was cooked perfectly. The only issue I had with my lunch were the taco shells, I feel like they were a little too soggy.
