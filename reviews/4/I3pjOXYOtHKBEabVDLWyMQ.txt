After a run on a nearby greenway, I was looking to refuel. Stopped here and boy was I glad I did. The man working the counter was an absolute delight. He welcomed me in and proceed to explain the WHOLE menu.   All I wanted were tacos. But he was on a roll, so I let him finish. The tacos were delicious and made in lightning speed. I was out of there in 5 minutes. I had the pollo, carne asada, and al pastor. All were delicious. I definitely recommend stopping here. If not for the food, stop for a person who is nice and happy doing what he does. You seldom get that anymore. Support this small business!!! Please.
