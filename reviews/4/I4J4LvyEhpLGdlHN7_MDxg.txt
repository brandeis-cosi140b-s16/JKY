This Mexican restaurant is close to my in-laws place so we recommended giving it a try one Sunday after church. We heard this was related to Baja Joe's in Mesa, but it is in fact not. But the menu is almost identical. We have been craving fish tacos, so we ordered the Red Snapper, whole fish,  cooked in garlic.  They have very good quality tortillas I must say. We used the tortillas to make a little burrito with the garlic fish and added the delicious chipotle sauce and habanero hot sauce to give it a good kick. Those were delicious. I must say they could use a reassessment of the salad they serve because they were wilted and just did not look good. The fish was also a bit smaller than I expected considering the price and when compared to Baja Joe's. I also got to try my brother-in-law's shrimp burrito - enchilada style and i must say it was HUGE! Also, they were generous with the perfectly cooked shrimp! My mother-in-law got the carne asada and that was cut pretty thin and wasn't as juicy as I expected, so I don't think I would recommend it. The ambiance of the restaurant is basically as if you walked into Mexico, it compliments the food in my opinion! The service was great, the waitress was very attentive and was very helpful when we had questions, even with a decently packed house. I am definitely planning on coming back for another round, and I'm glad we got to give it a try!
