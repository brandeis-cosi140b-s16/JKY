We liked this place on Bell and like it here. The food seems the same. The new space seems bigger and better. Service was great. It is an excellent place for lunch. There are many more authentic places no doubt but this works for us. I had a super burrito which I have always liked. My wife believes the pollo fundido is the best. The margaritas are good though not great.  I suppose with top shelf tequila and hand assembled ingredients they would be better but more expensive. Chips are healthier, that is unsalted which is not a plus in my book.
