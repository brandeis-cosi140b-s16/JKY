Went for breakfast for the 99cent bloody Mary's. they are small but a buck you can't complain. Got the hevous rancheros & they were excellent! Nice portion & very filling. Potatoes were nicely seasoned, beans were just typical beans. If you are looking for a good quick breakfast on the strip check em out.
