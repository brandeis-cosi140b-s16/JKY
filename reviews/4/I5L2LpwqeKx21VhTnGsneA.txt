I wanted to see this place as my in-laws live in Surprise and besides shopping at a strip mall there is nothing else to do. Plus living in Hawaii, I wanted to be able to bring home some real tortillas.

This place is non-descript looking, but easy to find. Inside is not the prettiest or busiest of places either; poorly lit/dark, only 1 person working. It's like a mercado as they offer different kinds of Mexican/Latin products. But those products seem more of "filler" than the real reason you'd be there as they were dusty. It is a working factory too.

I think there's food available because they have a bunch of cafeteria style tables/chairs for eating but there's no menu at all, just one sign that said "NACHOS", on a counter to the far right. 

At any rate, I didn't come here to eat I came for tortillas. They have a large amount of fresh tortillas available for purchase in all sizes. Flour, corn, they even have a bunch of refridgerators with tamales. $10 for 1/2 dozen, $19.99 for full dozen and $23.99 for a variety of mixed dozen. Tortillas ranged from $2.00 to $4.50. Super cheap if you ask me. And they're still warm! Except for the huge Sonora style tortillas, they only make those at 10p at night and they're in the fridge.

If you're in Surprise, around the Dysart Rd/Grand Ave area, and need some tortillas, definitely check it out. Way better than buying something at Safeway or the like.

Pros:
-Affordable and fresh tortillas
-Tamales
-Quick, in and out service

Cons:
-No ambiance, kinda dark and dingy inside
