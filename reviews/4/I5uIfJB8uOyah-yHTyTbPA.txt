there is a sit down restaurant & and a take out right next door on the side. i've never been to the sit down side, but i've been to the take out portion many a times on many a occasions, and they're usually very good explaining & customizing your orders. if the line is long (five or more people/orders, you should expect an experience of about 20-25 minutes). but the food is pretty good.
