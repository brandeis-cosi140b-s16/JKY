I have eaten here from time to time for over a year and a half now, and I am always amazed with at least ONE of the items I order.  The hard part is consistency of menu items for me.  

I had the Sweet Potato and Black Bean tacos... they were OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  Unfortunately, the ceviche that i'm accustomed to from them is usually served in a giant bowl with beet chips and a variety of other fixings, which is NOT what I received, and it was definitely a bummer.  

If you've never been, you should definitely go, and if you are only looking for cocktails, I had a watermelon margerita, and a blackberry-ginger margerita yesterday that puts their competition to shame.  Go check it out!!!
