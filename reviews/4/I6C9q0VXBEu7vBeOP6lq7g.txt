We returned to this restaurant during our December 2013 visit.  We were not disappointed.  

We shared Queso Fundido, Beijing Glass, When Pigs Fly, Happy Family, Mongolioan Beef Lettuce and Pato Pasilla.  Each dish was wonderful.

The waiter convinced the two birthday girls at the table to get the Mango Rice dessert.  It was amazing.  Puffed rice, mango, whipped topping and other delights.  Not a disappointed diner amongst us.
