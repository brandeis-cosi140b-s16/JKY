We went to this location specifically for breakfast.  I did a head to head comparison of the sausage breakfast burrito by Taco Bell and that of McD's.  What I liked was that the burrito was bigger than Mc.D's they used real cheese and brand named sausage.  What I didn't like was that the burrito was bigger, it needed more filling or a smaller tortilla, one way or another.  It was also missing the onions and peppers.  My wife had the bacon crunch wrap and that was good as it was prepared.

The best part of this visit, was the staff, they answered our questions, ask our opinion and listened.  The manager, David, had a Breakfast burrito made and added the Green Sauce to it, it was really good.  He also advised us that there is a new breakfast menu coming out to all the AZ Taco Bells soon and improvements have been made.  

I can't wait to try the new menu, I feel they were on the right track with what they had, and hopefully will continue to get better.
