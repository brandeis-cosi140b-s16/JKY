This is an awesome breakfast spot.  Never have a problem getting a table-usually opt for the bar tables.  The veggie omelets are great and loooove the rosemary potatoes.  They are not the ordinary breakfast potatoes that everyone else serves.  The eggs bene may be in my top 3 for best bene EVER!  Also great breakfast burritos!

Full bar is a great plus but was disappointed by the bloody mary.  The mix may have been bad.  All in all love this place!!  Ask for specials not on the menu-the ribeye steak and eggs was a great quality meal for the price (12 or 13 bucks). 

 The guy server that makes the foil roses is one of the best servers.  In fact all the male servers have always provided great service-unfortunately not so much with the female servers i've had.  The last time it was a girl and she was nice but very unattentive.
