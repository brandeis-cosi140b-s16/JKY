Had to take care of some stuff in this part of town that I have never had any reason to visit.. On the way home, I spotted this place and had a sudden craving for a Mexican Seafood platter.

Mojarra Al Mojo De Ajo: A Whole Fried Tilapia sauteed in garlic  sauce and topped with more garlic sauce. Comes with beans, rice, salad green chile sauce and fresh handmade tortillas. 

 - The fish was fried perfrectly and tasted fresh from the sea, the garlic sauce was no joke (smothered with Garlic!) and extremely strong but I loved it, the green chile sauce was intensified with spices/heat but did not linger (Very nice!)
- Rice and Beans were typical and satisfying
- The Tortillas were Mesmerizing!! There is Absolutely No Comparison with store bought tortillas and their handmade tortillas served here.

Carne Asada Taco: Litlle diced meat, very soft, not much flavor but their red chile sauce, cliantro and onions, especially the handmade tortilla made it a success.

The Price was inexpensive for portion and taste, Place was decored surprisingly vibrant and server was helpful and kind. Would come here more often if it was closer!
