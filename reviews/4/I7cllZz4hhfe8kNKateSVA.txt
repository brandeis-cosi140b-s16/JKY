I always wished that Chipotle was open past 10pm and I almost got my wish in Panchero's Mexican Grill.  It is just like Chipotle.  They make burritos, bowls, tacos, salads, and quesadillas, just like Chipotle.  The cool thing about this place is that they make the tortilla's right in front of you.  They put a ball of dough in a tortilla press and right before your eyes, it turns into a tortilla.  They then toast it up on the griddle and you're ready to build your burrito/taco/bowl/salad/quesadilla. I went to a late movie last night at Tempe Marketplace and the other day when I was at Yogurtland I noticed that this place was about to open up and that it stayed open late so I had to try it.  I got a chicken burrito, my usual at Chipotle, and they did not disappoint!  The chicken was juicy, the rice was fluffy, and they only charge 0.95 cents for guacamole instead of 1.80 at Chipotle.  I am a huge Chipotle fan, and this place is open until midnight Sunday-Wednesday and open till 2am Thursday-Saturday so whenever I am craving a burrito late night and I don't want any of the 'bertos, I will be heading over to Panchero's Mexican Grill.
