An authentic Mexican Restaurant created from a German Guy is direct translation of Hussong's.  Love mariachi three piece band. Love the Sombreros on the Deers on the wall. Love that you have to leave the restaurant for the bathroom.  Its just like back to the future.

Next time I would like to request De Colores, por favor.  
Perfect for large table parties but good for tables of two, too.

Just make sure you get lemon or limes in the water. Just sayin...
