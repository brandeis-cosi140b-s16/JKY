Passed this strip mall place a thousand times, finally tried t out. Much better than I expected... Food was original, very well prepared, and extremely delicious. I had a pork adobada thingy (spelling???), and my Wife had a southwestern chicken pasta bowl that was really great! Service was outstanding, replenished our chips and salsa numerous times. No 4 star rating for the lack of ambience- Sort of a sports bar mentality, not a date place or fine dining room. Great place, otherwise!
