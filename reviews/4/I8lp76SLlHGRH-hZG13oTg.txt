I think china poblano is a very solid 3 stars, I gave it a fourth star because our second visit was on the busiest night in Vegas...NYE and we had no reservation. They accommodated us quickly, although it was at the outside tables but that's fine by me...more people to watch. 
Our server was great, I have no complaints about the service. 
My husband & I ordered chips & salsa which were great, good seasoned chips, salsa was smokey and far from any pico de gallo. We also ordered 4 tacos...2 fish, 1 cochinita (BBQ Pork) and 1 carnitas. We've had the fish tacos before and they were delish...this time they were totally different. The fish wasn't very battered, and the salsa was way different. Definitely not as good this time around but still very decent. The other tacos were full of flavor but very small! We both said we could eat 4 more! So after the chips & salsa & 2 tacos each we were still hungry so we ordered dim sum. A 4 piece order of When Pigs Fly and they were a knock out. Very good. 
Now, a part of me wants to take a star off because of the high prices. This dinner was over $70 and I really couldn't justify paying more than $35-$40. You can't call this a full dinner. It was more like a lite bite before a concert type thing. 
The kicker was the 2 cokes my husband ordered during dinner. They came in glass bottles and are imported from Mexico. I've seen them at my local grocery store...they sell them 10 for $10. For all of you yelpers that are not math geniuses, that's $1 ea. China Poblano charges $5.88 each!! Holy coca cola! $12 on two cokes?! That's a little unreal. In a separate visit we ordered the 20 vegetable fried rice--as featured on one of those television food shows--and it was good not amazing. This is not a place I NEED to return to. But it's also not a place I would stay away from. Although, I might smuggle in my own Mexican Coca Cola next time.
