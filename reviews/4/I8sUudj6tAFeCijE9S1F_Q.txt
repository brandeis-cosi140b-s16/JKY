Just had a chicken burrito bowl and it was sooooooo tasty! The meat was moist and flavorful and our server had no problem adding shredded lettuce to the bottom of the bowl at our request. The Guacamole was perfect and the blue corn chips were a nice change from the usual. This place is set up just like chipotle, but for some reason the bowl just seemed a little more juicy than chipotle! Very good! Lost one star for charging a buck for grilled veggie topping...I usually get that at chipotle to feel healthy but am too cheap to pay for it:)
