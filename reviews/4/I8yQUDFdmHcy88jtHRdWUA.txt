I was in the search for a good al pastor burrito, and I found just what I was looking for here at Los Taquitos! It was perfectly seasoned, with a slightly tropical twist of pineapple added to the meat and marinade. It was a sizable portion, especially since I ordered it enchilada style, smothered with some deep, rich tasting red chile sauce.

Service was fast and friendly. Unfortunately, the soda fountain was out of order as the Diet Coke fountain only spurted out soda water. 

Overall, this is a great choice if you want filling and reasonably priced Mexican food.
