What a great experience for my family and I! 

Not only was the food delicious but the service was fantastic! Caitlynn made sure that our drinks were always topped off and we were never in need of anything. 

I could have probably hung around all day chowing down on the light and warm tortilla chips, homemade bean dip, and fresh salsa. The guacomole was not overly seasoned and made to order. The chunks of avocado made for a healthy and yummy dish - and at $3.99, it's a steal!

White the shrimp fajitas were tasty, I would suggest giving the fajitas a healthy overhaul. A little too much oil and harshly chopped veggies don't do much for the presentation. 

Kids meals were a great serving size, coloring contest kept them entertained, and they didn't even bat an eye when I wheeled in my large stroller with a sleeping toddler. The game was playing at the bar and the bartender made sure to give us a nice, friendly greeting as soon as we came in the door. 

Will definitely be visiting Garcia's again!
