This place is hole-in-the-wall awesome.  I had the shrimp fajitas and they were bomb!  Their refried beans are unique, they're not gross like you'd usually expect - they were flavorful and delicious.  The guac was top-notch as well.

However, their service was really, really slow today.  Only go for a work lunch if you have the time to spare!!
