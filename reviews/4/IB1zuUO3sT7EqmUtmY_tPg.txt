One evening I ate at one of Phoenix's most noted Mexican establishments.  The next day I had lunch at Elvira's.  It must have been a bad evening for the chef because I liked the food at Elvira's much more.  Enjoyed the chips and salsa, the spinach enchiladas were kitchen-hot and well assembled.  The beans and rice were a good compliment.  Dining on the patio was excellent on that balmy afternoon.  I'd go again.
