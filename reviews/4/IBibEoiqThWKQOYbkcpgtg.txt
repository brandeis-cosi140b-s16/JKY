Stopped in for lunch with a friend during the week. After reading other reviews, we met around 11:30am to try to beat the crowd. Walked in and the place was almost empty. I ordered the Mexican salad with Chips and Guac while my friend ordered a chicken chimichanga. Both were excellent. The guacamole was on point! By the time we were ready to leave there was a line out the door. Good thing we got there early! I've already told my coworkers that I've found us a new authentic Mexican lunch spot.
