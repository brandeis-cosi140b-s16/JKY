We used to go to the now-closed location at D.I./Durango alot (before Chipotle was here- the cashier said that that location was closed due to numerous robberies). We came here recently, a couple weekends ago. It was for lunch on a saturday- nice day so we just barely got a table outside. Inside was big/spacious, clean and not too many people eating inside either. The food containers were full. There were several people working there. (No drive-through window.) There was yummy seasoned smelling chicken on the grill which reminded me of El Pollo Loco. They make it right there in front of you- to your liking (beans, salsa, etc.), like Chipotle and Zaba's. Simple menu  (like Chipotle, and prices were around the same too, average price $6-) but no take-out menus available. 

My husband had the burrito and I had the hard corn tacos (you could get soft flour tacos). I think the cost was around $16 (regular price) for the both of us but we had an Entertainment Book coupon so it was half that! It was very good- as good as I remember, a few years back. The flavor of the seasoned chicken was really good. The crunchiness of the corn tacos was fulfilling. I had corn, lettuce, cheese and salsa. Notice I keep making references to Chipotle. I just love Chipotle (been there 3x in a month's time) so it easily edges out Qdoba Mexican Grill; the concepts are similar but not exactly the same, but it still gets high marks.
