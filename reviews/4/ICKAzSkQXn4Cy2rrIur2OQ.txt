This place is the jam. I was pleasantly surprised from the moment I pulled into the parking lot. The Steak taco with the tempura style poblano was one of the best tacos I've ever had. The guac was legit too. I think this is one of the few guac servings that we weren't able to finish being it was such a heaping pile of goodness. And the frozen margaritas are the way to go, tastes just like the famous Z-tejas margs.
