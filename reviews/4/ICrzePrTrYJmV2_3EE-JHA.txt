Located on the first floor of one of the World Market Center buildings, Mundo is the only restaurant open during and after shops at the WMC shops close.

During my two visits, I noticed that chips and salsa were brought out immediately. The wait staff is always there to refill drinks. The recommendations by the staff helped make my second visit a success. There is actual flavor to the food I ordered, not just spicy, it was both. 

The steaks were excellent, which is a different experience from most Mexican restaurants I have been to. The price per entree reflects that this is a higher end restaurant.

I would not advise paying $24 for a shrimp tamale however. That dish should be around $14 max. The street corn and Mexican risotto are great side items. I ordered the Mexican risotto on both of my visits.

If you are looking for a premium meal before or after an event in the World Market Center, Downtown Las Vegas or The Smith Center, do consider Mundo.
