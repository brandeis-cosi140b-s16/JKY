3.5 stars. 

Almost didn't eat here today because it looked so sketch outside! Also had a hard time finding it because the sign is not very visible from the street. They are located in the lot next to the 7-11 next to a tire shop. Inside it looked much better and was a full house around 1:30pm with a crowd ranging from guys in suits to nurses in their scrubs. Tried an assortment of tacos: carne asada, pollo, fish (they use Swai). Carne asada was tender, wish it was a little more flavorful but it was satisfying. Chicken was chicken haha. The fish taco was yummy, dressed with cabbage and a chipotle-like sauce, batter had a hint of cumin which I liked. Best fish taco I've had in the area. Cheap prices!

Personally I like Taqueria Los Yaquis better for their carne asada (much more flavorful) but I'm being generous with the stars because Atoyac has normal hours lol. Will definitely return if I'm in the area!
