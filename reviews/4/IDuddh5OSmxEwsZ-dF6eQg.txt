Giving it 4 stars for now, it was my first time here today. The place was full of customers dining in even though they blocked off one side of the restaurant. The cashier/hostess/server was nice, speaks very good english and friendly and can definitely multitask! I ordered to go since it was busy but they had dine in only lunch specials for very good prices (mon-fri  11am-2pm) I ordered the asada torta it was very delicious and flavorful (layered w beans, meat, lettuce, tomato, avocado, and mayo) and a drink all for $8.95(anything under $10 they charge .50Â¢ fee) I'll def be coming back to try new stuff there, maybe even tomorrow! Haha
