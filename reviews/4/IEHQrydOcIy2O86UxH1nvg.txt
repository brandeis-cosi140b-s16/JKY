Good food, decent service.  Ordering and getting food were a little slow.  We were 3rd in line when we got there and it was about a 10 minute wait to order and then another 20+ minutes to get food.  For this type of place, that's a bit slow.  Once the food arrived, we weren't disappointed.  Burritos, tacos, and enchiladas were all excellent.  It was definitely a step up from other Mexican restaurants in the area.  We'll definitely be back.
