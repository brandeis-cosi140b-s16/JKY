This could be my one and only review for a west side biz. Nothing against you Westsiders but I rarely venture past Central Ave. So I found myself working out here in the area and took a gamble, without even using Yelp walked in for some lunch. I mean, it's Mexican, how bad can it be. 

I guess the best way to describe this is it's similar to a Baja Fresh. They have a fresh salsa bar which was amazing!! You can get your burrito "wet" (my favorite). I ended up getting their enchilada plate. They have it on special right now, $4.99 for their combo plate. The ingredients tasted fresh as far as I could tell. The rice was fully and tasted good. 

It's your typical fast casual Mexican joint, and judging by all the chain stores/restaurants in the area, this place is a good bet you'll get a good meal. 

Oh, gotta give props to our cashier guy, we told him it was our first time and he hooked it up with 2 free drinks. He was pretty helpful in helping us order since they had so many good looking things on the menu. 

One last note, Surf and Turf Burrito is pretty good apparently. 

Protip: Want to feel a little less guilty about that burrito your ordering, for .25 cents more, get a whole wheat tortilla.
