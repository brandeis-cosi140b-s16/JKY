I have been here a few times, it is located in the Sunset Station Casino, right off the casino floor in probably the center of the casino or thereabouts.

The tacos here are awesome, beef or chicken, in a flour or corn tortilla, good flavor and very big.  The salsa bar is awesome as well, the tortilla chips are fresh, when you order your food, watch the staff make the food for you, since you can see the prep tables and grill.  There are only about six tables and a few small two seat tables available, so this place can fill up fast.  I have not tried the burritos yet, but from watching other customers and what they order, they look huge.  For the price, you cannot beat the quality of food, I can't wait to go back again during my next trip.
