We visited last night, and the restaurant was not very busy when we arrived. Within about 15 minutes of being there, they became very busy though. I was observing our waitress and how hard she was working. I noticed there were only two (2) waitresses running the entire floor. Yikes! This poor girl was busting her bum, and the great service we got showed that. There were people assisting with food running and bussing tables, but these poor girls were still being ran dry. Great food, and great service in spite of being understaffed. Still, hire some more help! That's not fair to expect one person to serve half of a restaurant. We tipped her extra and I hope she got more help. That's the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars. Hang in there waitresses, and don't think some of us aren't recognizing your hard work!
