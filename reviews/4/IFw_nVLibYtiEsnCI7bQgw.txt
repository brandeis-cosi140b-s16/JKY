Los Reyes De La Torta is a restaurant I heard about from watching Man Vs Food. I saw the host eat a "Torta del Rey" and I thought to myself "That is something I NEED to try". For those who are not familiar with the torta, it is a like a sandwich in the sense that it is meats and veggies in between two breads. The bread is referred to in spanish as a "telera" which is a wide and long bread. The torta del rey is stuffed with beans, pork, breaded steak, ham, an egg, a wiener, chorizo, monterey jack cheese, avocado, onion, tomato and a salsa that is spicy. I had to take the torta to go and I had to eat it about 30 minutes after I ordered it but it was still very tasty. The only downside is that by the time I ate it, the bread was already soggy as you would expect with all the ingredients but it was well worth it. The torta came with an order of fries but they were not that good, hell, even if they were good, I still wouldn't have been able to finish them as I was only able to eat half of the torta before I got full. 

As for the restaurant, there was nothing to really scream about. The restaurant was plain and had no booths or anything, just a bunch of table spread out around the place. The menus were in all spanish and the person who took my order spoke to me in spanish so you may have a language barrier when you go to this location. I also did not see any fountain drinks at the restaurant, all I saw was a fridge that had cans and bottles of soda. When I did ask for soda, I was served a can of Coke. 

I gave the restaurant 4 stars for the flavor of the torta alone. If you are someone like me who carries a "spare tire" around your midsection, try the torta out, you will love it. As a coworker of mine once said "Live life....... to its fattest" :)
