Why am I giving four stars to a place with veggie burritos worthy of only three? 

Well.... EVERYTHING ABOUT REVO MADE ME HAPPY.

- Free chips and salsa galore. With free refills. Did I mention the word "free?"

- Friendly, spunky staff. I was indecisive about choosing a salsa, so they gave me two of both kinds.

- Hooks for purses and coats under the tables - innovative, classy and functional.

- 100% vegan, filling veggie burritos for seven bucks.

- Funkyfresh decor that's reminiscent of... well, nothing really. It's all over the place. In a nice way.

- Bathrooms with life-sized images of scantily-clad beach babes and guys on the walls. 

- Without my asking, waiter took my reusable water bottle and filled it for me before I left. 

That, my comrades, coworkers, and esteemed colleagues, is how you earn an extra star.
