I'm surprised at the negative reviews of this place. We have been 3x at different times during the day and have NEVER had a bad dinning experience or bad service. The service is always prompt and accurate. The food is good and the guacamole is fresh and not even close to being runny or "from the store." Chunky and fresh just like it should be. For a small restaurant still working out the details of being relatively new, I hope the reviews will continue to improve as does the restaurant itself.
