This was an "Authentic" Mexican food place. "Authentic" meaning this is food made by Mexicans for Mexicans, and not by Gringos trying to make Mexican food! If you speak Spanish you'll be able to read everything on the menu and understand what the staff is saying. If not you'll get buy, but maybe you're not ready yet to try the Lengua or Menudo!

Pricing was great - a variety of daily lunch specials are offered for around $5. And they offer free corn chips and salsa.
