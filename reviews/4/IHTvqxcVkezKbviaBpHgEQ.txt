freshly made tortilla chips and some literally smokin' freshly off the stove good habanero salsa when you order.  

the space is mostly bar counter service, and shoulder to shoulder.  I came right after noon and it was a constant flow of traffic and to go orders.   seems like everyone who had takeaway orders received chips as well.  orders arrive quickly and the staff is ever so kind and helpful. 

food was good and tasteful, though my steak burrito was a little lacking in beef.  not the best i had, but its ok.  

also had al pastor which was much better on a fried tortilla.  

I'd go back when I'm around again.

well deserving of being best mexican cuisine in CU
