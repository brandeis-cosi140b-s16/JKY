Tasty grab & go food window and patio on the east side of blanco. Modern Mexican with NO relation to the fast food -bertos or cheesy blandness of most sit down places.

They have a small selection of guacamole, tacos, quesadillas, and snacks.  Very tasty but expensive for the size.

I like the fact they have a cook make it once you order it so it comes out piping hot!

The salsa has a kick made with fresh chilis and ingredients.

My go to is usually 2 chicken tacos and a guacamole.  The quesadilla is straightforward but done properly with the slightly crispy tortilla and evenly melted gooey white cheese.

By far the best thing here is the rotating agua frescas.  The girls at work and I constantly check if they have strawberry agua fresca.  These are made with fresh strained and muddled strawberries and no added sugar.  We have asked so many times if they add sugar and they always insist no.  I've had the raspberry lemon, lime, and peach and they all are true to the fruit.

The people working are usually nice and Greer and Nathan have helped me before with a smile.  The cook even started my order when I stepped up while the window person was away.
