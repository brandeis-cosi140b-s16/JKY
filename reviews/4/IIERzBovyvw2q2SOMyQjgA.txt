After seeing that Tia Rosa didn't go thru, I thought it would be another empty space at the Pecos Village....
Then came Nando's.... I just had to check it out.

As we were ushered to our table, a cute girl came and introduced herself as the waitress. As she was taking our orders, a plate of chips and salsa came. Wow! It seemed so choreographed. Our orders came in about the right time. Not too soon, not too long. And they were huge portions! They tasted good too. We are light eaters, so we had to bag the rest. While waiting for our check, the owner/manager came over and briefly chatted with us - asking about the food and service. He was glad we liked it and had some left to bring home. 

I would definitely come back for the food (need to try the other entrees), service and the convenience (close to home).
