Good food and fast service.  I always go during lunchtime too. Manager helps just as much as his employees.  He was friendly and remembered people's orders.  

I don't like fish so no fish tacos for me! But I love their burritos. It is a lot of food!  

They are always clean when we come in too! Overall they are a wonderful inexpensive place to eat!
