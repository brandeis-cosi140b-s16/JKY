Pleasantly surprised. I had low expectations but we live nearby and there aren't a ton of options in mint thrill so we gave it a shot. 
Decor is average at best, nothing impressive but not awful. 
Chips and salsa were pretty bland but not a big deal. 
Service was fine. 
The entrees really stood out. Wife had chicken tortilla soup and it was very good. Also a chimichanga as a side item but she ended up taking it home since the soup was filling enough. I had grilled chicken tacos especial and they were great. Spicy and tasty and the chunks of avacado were a nice touch. 
Prices were cheap too. 
We'll be back.
