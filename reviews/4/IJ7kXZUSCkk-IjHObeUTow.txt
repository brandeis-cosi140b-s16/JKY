Personally these are my favorite tacos. They are fairly small but that it the actual size that  tacos shops in Mexico will serve them as. There is a different line depending on what you would like to order, so make sure to look up at the signs so you dont end up in the wrong line. There are many different tacos options, such as carne asada, lengua, adobada, chicken, also quesadillas and fries with your choice of meat plus cheese.

Drink choices vary as well. You can do your regular fountain drinks, drinks in bottles, or Mexican drinks such as Horchata, Jamaica, and Tamarindo.
