The Pollo Fresco was awesome!  The white sauce over the chicken breast complemented the rice with fajita veggies very well... the veggies had pineapple in it for a nice twist to the normal grilled variety.
 The chips came with a hot fire roasted salsa and a medium salsa both with great flavor.
The Margs were weak but he server assured me it was because they were training a new bartender and to come back on a happy hour or weekend and I would luv it.
Goupon is a good deal.
