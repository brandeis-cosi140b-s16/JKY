For the money that you are paying, Roberto's Taco Shop offers a sufficient quantity and has a very consistent quality from my past experiences. Although Roberto's is good when sober, but it is most definitely better tipsy. 
Although the staff there can be a little bit grumpy working an overnight shift, it is a minor issue because Roberto's is virtually fast-food and does not require too much service.
