Our first time in and it won't be our last. We had a tasty red-chili pork, and a carne asada. Each came with handmade tortillas that were yummy! Other than the beef tasting a bit salty to me (not my companion), it was all delicious. Love the neat table tops that are recreations of Spanish-language tarot cards. Fun!
