I came here for take out food around 7pm on a Friday night. There was a line, but it moved pretty quickly. The concept was really interesting! You start by choosing between a salad, a burrito, tacos, or bowls (apparently a bowl is a burrito without a tortilla- for the healthy folks). You go on choose what kind of rice, beans, meat, and toppings you want. Be careful because if you say "a little," it seems that they still give you a full serving, maybe even a bit more than a full serving. Fascinating concept, I'll have to come back and try something different!
