I was starving after getting off of the plane and happened to see this place. It had all the right signs of being a real taco joint. I do spend time in Mexico (was there last week and go back next month). 

Ordered two al pastor, two carnitas and two barbacoa. I liked the al pastor even if they were not cooked on a trompo. The carnitas were ok. The barbacoa were really good and very moist (I think the meat was cooked that day). 

If the carnitas would have been better I would give it 5 stars. 

A word on the decor do not expect much but who cares.
