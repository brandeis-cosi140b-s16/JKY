This place is ridiculously delicious. I've had many of their menu items and have never been disappointed.  
The drive thru is a bit long when crowded, but that's because they're made to order.
It's a real restaurant menu with a drive thru so it's not like Taco Bell, it's worth the wait.
Horchata-AMAZING!
