The "hood" is a colloquialism not intended to imply "ghetto" or any particularly dangerous neighborhood. I am a proud resident of the Biltmore 'hood and my neighbors are retired Mormon doctors who all own corgis and drive Buicks and have umbrellas with "Vanguard Investments" emblazoned on them.

Anyway, even though the neighborhood isn't particularly risky it's dangerous just having this place so close to me. After a particularly harsh day at work I treated myself to the carne asada burro combo. Highly addictive, and there's probably enough fat in the tortilla alone -- never mind the filling -- to keep me and an African village or two going for a week or so. Nevertheless, it's delicious and a great antidote to an evening spent with too much single-malt and too many cigars and some women named Wanda and Clarissa. Those who know . . . . know . . . 

Anyway, go and enjoy.
