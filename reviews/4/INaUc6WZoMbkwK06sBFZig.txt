Always Consistent. If a restaurant can't nail down consistency...what's the point? Knowing what you're getting when you go is a plus. 

This place has been here for a long time. There used to be a Popo's Too on the east side until it sadly closed down. My sister and I were not happy campers. But low and behold the original is still alive and well and kickin' great dishes EXACTLY LIKE THEY DID ON THE EAST SIDE! Again, consistency. The owner is always present and taking checks, seating guests and that again is an added bonus. Everything is fresh, the rice is great, unlike most places here where it's just starchy and gross and the medium salsa is always yummy. Request the hot salsa as well...it's not overly hot and quite frankly not sure why it's their "hot" salsa but regardless-it's deliscious. I had the El Pollo Especial except I ordered it not fried and with Machaca beef...and they were of course accomodating. The jalepeno cream cheese they top it with is well, excessive, however a little goes along way and I'll be eating the other half for dinner. 

If you get the opportunity to go, go. The margaritas are also quite yummy and who can go wrong with $.99 ritas for happy hour. Just wish they were closer to Scottsdale!
