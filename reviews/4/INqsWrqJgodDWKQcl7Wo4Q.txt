Eaten here several times.   Its really good.  Its not cheap, but its not steam table covered in canned sauce.  Try the cocktails.  They really have some killer house drinks.  We did the tequila dinner.  Highly suggest it.  Worth every penny.  To go there and not get the tableside guac is a total loss.  Love love love mexican food.  Its kicked up and not your normal beef enchiladas. But!   Its not cheap either. You are going to pay more.
