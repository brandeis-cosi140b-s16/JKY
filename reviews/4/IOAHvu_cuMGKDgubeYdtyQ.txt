Food served til 4 AM?! Umm yes. This is a great place to go after a club to soak up all that alcohol you drank there. Honestly, I went here twice. Once, I don't remember clearly but the faint memories was delicious! At late night though, they only serve Dominican sandwiches. No worries though, they're delicious.

I had a nice house margarita and an awesome 'Rickis' sandwich. The cabbage gave it a crunch which differs from the other sandwich. The 'Churris ($5)' instead has one beef patty instead of ground beef and onions. I tried the 'Churris' last time I was there and faint memories said that it was amazing, but then again I will have to try it sober to remember the exact details.

I will definitely come back more often, because it's just a great place to just hang out. Not that many people come through so it's quiet to talk. Most likely though, I'll be coming here after the club before I go home.
