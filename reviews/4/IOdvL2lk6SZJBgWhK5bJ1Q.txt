Fancy it ain't, but good it is!  One of my favorite lunch spots even though it is a few miles from the office.  Located in a cheap looking strip mall, you may not think to give it a try but you should.  Prices  are low and food is simple but well prepared.  Their specials are a good way to get  a lot of food at good prices!

Inside decor is not much - except for the brightly painted chairs (go figure the nicest part of the store is the chairs).

If you are in the area give it a try!
