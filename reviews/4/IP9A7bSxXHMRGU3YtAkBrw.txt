We had a fun time here. Great to watch sports as they have a ton of TVs with every sport possible. The plates, cutlery and entire place could use a good clean! Went during happy hour ordered a few appys and all tasted great. I also got the baked cookie with ice cream which was a great desert to share. Nothing fancy at all but tasty! Service was good and drinks were reasonable. Again the only issue I had was the cleanliness!!
