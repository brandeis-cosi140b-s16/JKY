Vegas local here, I check out downtown once a month.  Chose La Comida due to the pre-open hype and was curious about the wide range of reviews on Yelp.

The entire experience was great.  No reservations, had to wait 20 minutes, not bad for a First Friday night.  Tough to get access to the bar but we finally got some pre-dinner drinks.

Sea Bass entree was great, wife enjoyed her fish tacos.  Service was excellent.

Ceviche needed much more lime juice, barely tasted any lime.  Salsa was a waste of time, no spice and blah texture.
