I stated eating at the Los Favoritos in Chandler about 7 years ago. Since that time, I have visited just about every restaurant in the valley and have found them to be consistently good. As with any chain, every once and a while you will get a bad meal but overall I cannot recommend a better place to get a breakfast burrito anytime of the day! Yes, they do serve other food but I have limited myself to the rolled tacos and breakfast burritos which, by the way, are big enough to squelch my hunger most of the day. I recommend the chorizzo, but your tastes may vary.
