Revo is such a great place, both for the atmosphere and the food. The rice is nothing short of pure perfection. I ordered the Combo on accident once, rather than just the burrito, and I was simply blown away. It is definitely something to savor! The black beans are not anything special unfortunately, but they are a good addition to the chips and yummy poured over a burrito. The salsa is just as amazing as the rice. I love southwest/mexican food, and have been to numerous places that serve salsa. There is something different about the salsa at Revo that gives it a boost above the rest for me and my roommate. We both HIGHLY reccomend it. I have the hot and he orders pico. We both LOVE everything we have had at Revo, except for the average black beans. Nevertheless, they serve as a good addition when eaten on the burrito. I would give our and a half stars if possible.
