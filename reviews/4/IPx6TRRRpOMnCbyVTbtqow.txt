The finest Mexican food, will not be found here, but hey you what you were getting into when you walked in to this joint, and if you didn't please contact me, I have some land in Florida I would like to sell you. That being said, this place was pretty good as fast food goes. I signed up for the Del Taco email club, and got a coupon for two free chicken soft tacos. the rest of my order consisted of what felt like 3 pounds of food, and the bill came out to around $5. That my friends is what we call a bargain. So So if its late at night and you have had a touch of the creature, or at least wish you had,stop by and spend a buck or three. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
