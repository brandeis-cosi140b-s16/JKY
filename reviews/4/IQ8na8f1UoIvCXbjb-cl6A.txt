Second day in Vegas and I slept in after a late late night. When I woke up I was in the mood for some lunch. I had seen this place on the way to my room the first night and I wanted to try it so I decided that was the time. I went in and was greeted right away by the host. I have some pictures with him. He was totally adorable and his accent was so cute. He was very friendly and made me feel welcome. He got me something to drink right away. My waitress was also very attentive and friendly. 

I ordered the shrimp tacos and I have to say they were very good. I can see from the other reviews that the food leaves something to be desired but in my opinion the shrimp tacos are a good choice. They were actually pretty big and had alot of flavor. I had to get a to go box because I couldn't finish all of them. I also ordered a cup of tortilla soup. That, unfortunately, was not good at all. It had no flavor and the menu said it had cheese, well where was it because I sure didn't taste any. Tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups and I have had it in many different places but this one was probably the worst. I will admit that the food is very pricy but at the same time Vegas restaurant prices are always inflated. 

My overall experience having lunch there was good and I will be back. 

I had another experience here at night. They had a 2 for 1 drink special going on and I just kind of wandered in at the spur of the moment. There was a group of Puerto Rican people there dancing. I went in to see what that was about and next thing I know they are pulling over to them to dance with them. I ended up with a margarita in each hand and dancing with these people all night. I had a blast. They kept the drinking coming and the music going. If you come with some fun people this place can be a fun place to party at. The margaritas were not the best I ever had but they were sufficient. I was more caught in the dancing.
