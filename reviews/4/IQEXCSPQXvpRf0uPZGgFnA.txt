When I first moved to Vegas, me and my husband were eating at this Taco Bell at least once a week. The employees recognized us and had memorized our usual orders down to my request that my burrito be grilled. Yup, we have a problem. But I can't help it - I love Taco Bell. Out of all the fast food chains, Taco Bell is probably the most vegetarian friendly IMO. I'm loving the new cheesy rice and bean burrito for $1 and the spicy potato soft taco, also for $1. Where else can two people eat for $7? Taco Bell love aside, this location is always clean and the employees are super friendly. I will maintain that this particular Taco Bell is the best in town (until proven otherwise). My Taco Bell is better than yous :P jk
