Julio's is great.  Maybe it's just the nostalgia from my college days at ASU, where I would eat at the Julio's near campus (now closed) on a weekly basis.  But I still go out of my way to come to the Scottsdale Julio's to eat, because I really like the food.

Their portions are huge.  I love their tacos, tamales, tostados, and enchiladas.  And their salsa is amazing,  So fresh and tasty! 

I hope this place stays open, because it's one of the few places where you can get good Mexican take out.  If only I lived closer.
