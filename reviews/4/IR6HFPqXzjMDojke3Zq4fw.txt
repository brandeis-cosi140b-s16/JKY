A block down the street from work and they have AMAZING Carne Asada fries, that I cannot finish by myself. I really, really wish they did... the Small box for carne asada fries. Also had the Breakfast burrito on another day, which was delicious too. Their salsa bar is always kept clean and looks freshly made. Will definitely keep coming here when I keep forgetting my lunch.
