I have a few places that I like to take out of town guests and Guedo's is on that list. I'll be brief.

PROS:
- Good food.
- Generally fast for making on the fly

CONS:
- Cash only (*** UPDATE: they now accept credit cards)
- Small portions (Guedo's burrito and tostadas are probably best bang for the buck)
- Weird hours. Even the outside bar closes early and is closed on Sunday and Monday.

To keep the price down I normally order 1 guedo burrito and 1 tostada and 1 small drink. you can have them refill your drink if you want, for free. This combination seems to be the best bang for the buck for me.
