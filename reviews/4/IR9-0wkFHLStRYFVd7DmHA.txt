Very good, traditional Arizona Mexican food. The restaurant is clean and well decorated (Mexico-style colors) with a very nice landscape mural over a couple of walls (I understand it was a well-known graffiti artist). The tables are 4 person tables that could easily be combined. It's in the strip mall adjacent to the Peoria Theater, and has some room to grow. I can easily see it as the destination after a trip to the theater.
  The food was very good, with very large portions. I'm a big eater, but was stuffed with a chimichanga (they come enhilada style). My wife had the carne asada torta and really enjoyed. The rice was unique - not typical of the chili flavored spanish rice in most places, but more of a dirty rice with bits of vegetable, etc. It was very good, and a nice change. For dessert we shared a deep fried cheescake. My wife enjoyed it so much she's bringing a daughter back for the cheescake in a few days for her birthday.
  The prices are pretty much in the sub-$10 range for entrees, and the portions are large enough you can take some home for tommorrow's lunch.
  So, we're adding this one to the few mexican food restaurants that we frequent.
