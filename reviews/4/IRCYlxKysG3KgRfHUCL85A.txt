Came by this restaurant and boy were my cultural eyes opened.  They had many strange and fascinating items from south of the border.  The first is called a taco. (tah-ko) A curved fried shell with beef, lettuce and cheese.  Next was a burrito. (boo-ree-toe) An unfried, rolled shell with beef, lettuce and cheese.  Then a tostada. (toe-sta-dah) A flat, fried shell with beef, lettuce and cheese.  I can't even describe the fish taco, it blew my mind.  All kidding aside, a clean, good, fast-food restaurant.
