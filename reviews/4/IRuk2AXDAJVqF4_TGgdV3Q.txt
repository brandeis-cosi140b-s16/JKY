I am a fan. I usually wait for a few visits before I review just so I do not pass along un-trusting reviews. 

Well Jesters is much better then the reviews let up. The food is fresh and well made. The place is clean and the service is spot on. 

I had a burrito, filled with meat, beans, cheese, and killer hot salsa. (I was having stuffed head syndrome that day) Man was it good. 

The second time I had the ground beef enchilada's. While it seems really boring the meal was great. The flavor just kinda melted together in a symphony of yum. 

If you live/work near by stop in....tell em Daren C sent ya. If you don't like it tell em Nick B sent ya. LOL
