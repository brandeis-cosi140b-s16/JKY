I have no idea how anyone can think Faustos is better than this place. First it is super clean the staff is friendly and knowledgeable and the have Jamaica! But let's go over some things here the Carne is super tasty and at 5.95 a really good deal for the portion. Both sauces are tasty but u enjoy the green sauce a bit more than the red the beans and rice had prefect seasoning and I loved the open layout and big windows it gives such a bright feeling in the building. Also not to do with food but the music isn't super loud or filed with static which was pleasant. If you want the lower los angelos feel and some really good food at a decent price where you can sit with the family I highly recommend Robertos any day of the week.
