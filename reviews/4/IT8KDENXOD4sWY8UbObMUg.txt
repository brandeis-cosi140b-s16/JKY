I went to Red Mountain High School just a mile away, and for seniors who could go off campus to lunch, this place was where it was at. It has such affordable prices, coupled with the most monster portions you can find in Mesa, it makes for my favorite casual Mexican restaurant.
Their menu is fairly similar to Filiberto's for anyone else who grew up in Mesa and knows, but their portion sizes blow even the famous Fili's out of the water. Everything they serve is authentic, full of flavor, made to order, and makes the absolute most out of your money.
