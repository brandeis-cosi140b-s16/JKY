This place is great.  If you love to sit outdoors and enjoy some wildlife you will defiently want to check this place out.  You must also get a pitcher of the frozen margaritas.  You will feel good after just one glass.  The steak fajitas rock too.  Great atmosphere, great service.  Would recommend to anyone.
