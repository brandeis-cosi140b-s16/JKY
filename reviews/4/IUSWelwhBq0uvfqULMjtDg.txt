It has been a year and a half since my first review; I'm happy to I have yet to have a sub-par experience here. Living just up the road from here we're in for dinner once every month or so. The chorizo and cheese appetizer has been a favorite for my fiance and I. The carnitas taco platter has also been a favorite.
