Surprising place really, located in the same strip mall as the sexy shop, happy ending massage parlor, and strip club (oh, and Fu Lin). I was not expecting this cavernous and brightly decorated El Torito-esque restaurant. Service was friendly and quick, obligatory tortilla and salsa were good, and amount of food was ridiculous. 

Popeye quesadilla appetizer was tasty, had a ton of spinach, a glob of sour cream and guacamole on top. Machos burrito was giant and nopales (cactus) was interesting, in a good way. Arroz con pollo was gargantuan. I was literally shocked at how much food was piled on this ginormous plate. Definitely enough to feed four people. Tried a bit of the sauce (minus chickens) and it was pretty tasty. 

Good stuff. Great food to price ratio.
