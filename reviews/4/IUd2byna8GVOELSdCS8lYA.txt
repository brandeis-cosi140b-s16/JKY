Per usual I am not a fan of Mexican.. Never the less the wife dragged me here. And per usual I didn't leave disappointed. Kinda lower end feeling place but fantastic food. I got a quesadilla and shredded beef and it was very flavorful. The wife got a fajita salad which she said was good. We also got some nachos with shredded cheese on top and a couple drinks.. Paying $26 for a meal in Vegas which isn't bad. If you want a little cheaper McDonald's is right there but I can't suggest that.
