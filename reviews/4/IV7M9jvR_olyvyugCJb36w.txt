My very good friends from Phoenix were nice enough to take me here when I visited earlier this year.  They had been coming here for years and had absolutely swore by its food superiority in comparison to any of of their San Diego and LA rivals.  I ordered the carne asada fries and received a huge pile of fries topped with guac, carne asada, sour cream, and cheese.  I added a healthy dose of hot sauce, and it was deliciousness on a plate.  I also had a nice giant iced horchata to wash it all down.  Sadly, I couldn't finish the giant plate and took the rest home.  The meal was awesome and memorable, and I can't wait t go back.
