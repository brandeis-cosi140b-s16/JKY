From the outside this place may not look like much, but the food is good & comes at a great price. The tackiness makes this place stand out on Woodlawn & the inside doesn't disappoint in that category either. While a tad bit dark in the dining area, the tables & seats are all painted bright colors all in crazy designs. While this has nothing to do with why I like the place, it does make it feel like they're trying to get you to notice.

Nothing too exciting on the menu but your typical Mexican dishes, but the lunch menu prices are on point. You can come in hungry & leave full for cheap. They have free chips & salsa to pass the time till your food arrives, which is always a plus. I've never seen a long line here & I've almost always been seating immediately.

Tres Pesos tries bright colors to draw you in off Woodlawn, but their prices are why you'll keep coming back.
