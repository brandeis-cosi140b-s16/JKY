I like this place a lot. It's not a high-end Mexican place by a stretch, but they do a solid job at making really tasty meals for a really cheap price. It's amazing how fast the drive-through can be even when there are 15 cars lined up around the building.

Service is friendly and quick both inside and in the drive-through.
