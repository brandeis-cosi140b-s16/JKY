On the outside (which is inside the Cosmopolitan), it resembles that of a truck/street vendor, but don't be fooled: Here lies a 2-in-1 deal so unique.

To the right is the Mexican food, to the left is the Chinese food. Your choice, choose wisely.  

I decided to go with carb overload and steer towards the noodles.  Dan Dan Mian they're called: wheat noodles with spicy pork bits.  It was incredible. When it arrived, my first thought was "This is freakin' tiny".  I thought I could eat five of them!  So yes, small portion...but wowww is it tasty.  

Also went with the salt and air margarita, which my bartender creatively added a touch of hibiscus tequila to it.  I give her props too, because she could give a Tequila lesson to anyone who could listen. The salt "air" was a cloud of ecstasy.  Yum.

So yeah... a little expensive but unique dishes.
