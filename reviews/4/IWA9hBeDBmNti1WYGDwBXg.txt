This restaurant definitely wouldn't be for everyone. The food is very delicious and a bit on the spicy side if you order their green or red sauces. It's the best pork I've ever had and Hawaii has some good kalua pork. Minus one star because it was really really dark. If there was something in your food, you would never know. The waiter was great but if you are looking for privacy be prepared to sit down at a table with strangers,  that's all they offered to us. Kinda weird at first but it could be a good experience if the company is worthy.
