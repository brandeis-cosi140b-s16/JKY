Stopped by today for lunch, after a friend tipped me off on this being not far from where I was.

The loot:
1 Tofu + Egg Taco
1 Chicken Taco
2 Beef Tacos
2 Pork Tacos
1 Garlic Fry
1 Asian Fry
1 Crazy's Sweet Dough
1 (Just for fun) Order of asian chicken wings

Total $20, cash only

My wife and I agreed that pork tacos were the best. Pork was well marinated, and tender. I liked the beef, it was charred just the right way, even though she didn't care much for it. Chicken was excellent. Just the right amount of asian ginger-based spice, some kimchi, and lots of fresh greens. Everything was cooked to order. Tofu taco was something i never tried before, so i can't compare it to any other place. It was good, although the main taste came from the kimchi and the spices (as expected).

Chicken wings were a little less spicy than I would like them to be, but they were tasty, and not greasy - actually a tad on the dryer side on the outside (still tender on the inside) come to think of it.

Fries were very good. They had the home made taste to them, and were cooked in tasty oil. The garlic fries could have used more garlic, but if you aren't a big fan of really garlic-y fries, you are bound to love the subtle flavor. Asian fries were great, with just enough zing to make them stand out from most other fast food places.

Crazy sweet dough (very much like donut holes) were surprisingly good. I expected them to be more soaked with oil, but was excited to find out that they were crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside - no oil drippings, and the taste was donuty (and not oily). The powdered sugar on top was just the right amount.

I was the only person in "line" so it took a little while for everything to come, ~15 minutes, but it was well worth the wait. Plus the weather cooperated - it was the high 70s and pleasant, instead of the 100-degree heat we have seen all week.
