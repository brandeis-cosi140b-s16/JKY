Generally I am a fan if I stick to what I know I like

The beer battered shrimp cabo-tacos. When I get this I am a happy camper...but I have tried other things that fall short.

Chips and corn salsa can go either way- sometimes they are fresh and delicious - sometimes they are stale and not so delicious. 

I had the lemon tuna tacos yesterday and they were just-ok. I like my tuna on the rarer side so this didn't really do it for me. The cabo fish tacos are just ok in my opinion -although I am not a huge fried fish eater. I am not so into the steak tacos either. 

The jalapeno mashers  are really tasty although they certainly are not the most health conscious choice 

Margaritas are pretty standard here. I've had good luck in terms of service and the place itself is really cool.

Solid 3.5-4 ( 4 if I get my go-to meal)
