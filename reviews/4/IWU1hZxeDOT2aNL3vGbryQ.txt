2 people, 1 order of vaca frita (yes that is fried cow), a side of yucca with mojo, and a side of sweet plantains, and you got yourself a MEAL!  I have had a few drinks here which are decent, but I love the food.  
I came here once after work to satisfy an extreme craving for yucca with mojo...the waitress was amused.  The owner or manager came and explained to me the twice-cooking process of yucca so I can learn how to make it myself.  He also told me where to get the ingredients for mojo and what they are.  I was pleased!
This is a fun place to go with friends and there are salsa dancing lessons offered in evenings!
