I would've loved to try the food here since this seemed like the only Mexican restaurant inside the Venetian, but their drinks were great. I came here at about midnight, and it was the only bar that was open around Tao. After getting shafted for $13 drink, I managed to save half the price by buying my drinks here. 

I talked the bar tender into making my vodka cran strong, and he went nuts with that vodka bottle. He got me stumbling out of that place and ready to party at Tao. Most important of all, the drinks were only $7 instead of $13. What a difference a walk down the hotel makes...
