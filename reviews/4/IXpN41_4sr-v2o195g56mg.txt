So I got a message from the owner after he saw my review, and he asked to give it another try . I did (didn't tell him I was going to cause that would defeat the purpose), and I think the place has definitely improved.

I would go back here to eat.
Prices haven't increased and the menu has been updated.
There are some new things to try and the staff seems to have gotten larger an more attentive.

I recommend it for a quick lunch or a dinner that won't break the bank :)
