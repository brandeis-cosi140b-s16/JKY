This is my favorite Roberto's in Vegas. The service is good and the food is pretty darn good. Went with a hungry crew from work and all seemed to be satisfied. I got Carne Asada chips that were hot and tasty with a chicken taco for good measure. Great experience. Will definitely return. It gets busy at lunch so call your order in ahead of time and it will be ready when you get there.
