For airport food we were impressed! I love salsa and the salsa rocks- the green and red have so many wonderful flavors. I had a steak quesadilla and smothered it in that spicy red salsa. My husband loved the carnitas tacos where he loaded them with that yummy salsa.  It was the perfect dinner before heading back home. I don't get the bad reviews we thought it was really delicious. Our service was great too!
