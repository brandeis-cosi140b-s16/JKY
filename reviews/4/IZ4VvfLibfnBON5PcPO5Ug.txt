Always stop here on Fridays for my post work lunch. The staff is always great and food delicious.  One thing I hate is I never see name tags so here's the generic description of my one crappy experience. Stopped in today and the male Hispanic manager on the food prep line was stingy with everything he put on my burrito. I swear you could see him counting the pintos and grains of rice he put on my food. Everyone is always so generous and he barely put anything on my burrito. The food was still good none the less. The other employees were friendly and made sure I got everything I needed.
