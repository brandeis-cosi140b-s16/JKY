I went here with a friend for some food to go and had a good experience. 
I got the pork torta and my friend got 3 tacos, one chicken, one fish, and one steak. My torta was okay, the pork seemed extremely salty though, i wouldn't order it again. My friend who got the tacos was more than pleased and stoked that they were baja style. He only ate 2 and i ate the steak one the next day which was still super delicious!
