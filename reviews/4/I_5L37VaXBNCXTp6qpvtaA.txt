im from tx and i miss my texmex...yes this place reminded me of my texmex food because i have been so deprived probably..yes this is a chain but i dont care....reason being the chips were delicious and fresh, salsa was nice and chunky and had that wateryness to it. throw in a big burrito and some chili con queso and im a happy guy. this place is good and i really enjoyed my meal
