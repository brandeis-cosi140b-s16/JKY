Very glad my gal found this one.  Mexican food americanized. Nice ambience, friendly staff. Even a tequila godess to offer up suggestions.  I had a margarita, which was delishious. Chips and guacamole was a nice starter. Food was tasty and average size portions. Cant complain, cant give 5 stars. Was above average and worth going too.
