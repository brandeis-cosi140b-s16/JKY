The food was pretty good. I had the steak fajita lunch special. Would come again. 

As mentioned in other reviews the bean dip and salsa is complimentary. Salsa was very good. Bean dip was good but bonito michocan has cheese on theirs so it's a lose here for me. 

I like them at for lunch the drink was only 1.50 instead of 2.50 which was a nice surprise. 
Overall service was good. Will be back to try the carne asada instead of the fajitas
