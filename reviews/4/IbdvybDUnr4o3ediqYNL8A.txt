A lil pricey for Mexican food, but they're at ARIA, so what would you expect? The quality is good, don't get me wrong, its downright frickin tasty. But heads and shoulders above Diablos at Monte Carlo? not really...and being from So Cal, my Mexican food preferences are somewhat biased. Shrimp Taco, Chile Relleno, Enchilada, all good. Drinks...lil pricey but not bad. Bar made 'em fairly strong. Good Margueritas on the rocks. Great service, I mean top notch, and good environment. If you don't like clubbing though, might not wanna go. Had the music loud enough to focus on lip reading...Still, we like it!
