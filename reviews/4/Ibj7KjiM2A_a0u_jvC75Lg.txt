My husband, son and I tried this even though it only got three stars. Glad we did!  Food was excellent and despite being down on wait staff, they got our food out in a timely manner. Margaritas were great!  Prices were steep for non tourist places, but definitely in line with Vegas prices. We would go back for sure!
