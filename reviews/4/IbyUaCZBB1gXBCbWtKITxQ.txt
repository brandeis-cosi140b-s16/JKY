I was already in love with the food from Taco Y Taco, I didn't think it could get any better. With the addition if this new location, they proved me wrong. It's definitely better. Same great food, but add a bar and a snazzy interior, this location is a whole new experience. 

The restaurant is the same set up as the original location. Ordering stations based on the type of meat you will be ordering. They have the same great salsa bar and menu items, so I'm excited. The al pastor is still my favorite but I have to branch out next time. Elote is also a must. 

If only they would open a location on my side of town, but until then I will be making the drive to their Trop and Eastern locations in the time being.
