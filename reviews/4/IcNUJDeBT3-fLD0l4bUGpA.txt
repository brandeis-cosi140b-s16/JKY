This place is great! Coming from southern Orange County, CA I have been dying to find some decent street tacos! This place definitely fits the bill. For only $2 dollars a taco, it is well worth it. All the tacos are amazing, especially the potato taco. The ribeye taco is juicy and tender as well. With the large selection of salsas you can't go wrong. So so happy I finally found this place!
