El Charro is a staple for Mexican Food in Mesa.  I've been driving by this place for nearly 30 years and everyone I know has been there lol.  They have been open since 1958, so if you grew up in or around Mesa you probably have been there also.  

It was packed to tonight.  There were several larger parties waiting for space to open up, but luckily my wife and I were able to get seated immediately at a booth.

I'll start out by saying the homemade chips and salsa are delicious, like really really good!! We ordered chips and salsa to go ($3) that's how great it was!!  My margarita on the rocks had a bit to much sour mix, but was still drinkable but at $8 I probably won't order one again when I come back (my meal was $9.95).  The menu was real similar to most Tex Mex restaurants I've been to while I lived in Houston.  The wife and I both decided on combination plates.  The enchiladas were good, super cheesy, but I enjoyed the beef hard shell taco the most, when I go back I'll defiantly just order a (2) Taco combination plate.  Rice and beans were also good, nothing special though.  

The service was outstanding, our waiter was really on point with the chips and salsa refills, and made sure our drinks were never empty.  For how busy it was on a Saturday night, it was really pleasant to have such awesome wait staff. 

Hasta la vista El Charro
