My daughter wanted to go to SumoMaya for her birthday over the Christmas Holiday in December 2014. My wife also checked some reviews and they were all positive; as this one is. Our experience was excellent from the moment we stepped into the restaurant, to the server to the food. As this was our first visit, the server was very helpful providing  insight into the different dishes. If you go in a group, I would advice that everyone order something different as everything the menu is wonderful. We really enjoyed the whole experience.

Please note, the only reason I give SumoMaya four instead of a five is for me, it was a little pricey. For a special occasion, I would definitely go back.
