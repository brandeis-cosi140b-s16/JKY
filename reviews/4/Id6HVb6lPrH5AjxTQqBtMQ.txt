Stopped in for dinner after a long Saturday at work. Immediately I was taken aback  by the loud table of nine hundred children, because the open seating arrangement allows for no sound absorption. Not exactly how I wanted to relax. It was a bit cool that day, but we decided to sit outside where it was quiet. We started off with an order of chips with mild salsa and bean dip(and yes...you have to pay for the chips and salsa--not complimentary). These were okay, but nothing special. Not sure I'd order them again...For the meal I chose the Chicken chili. It was very good, laced with just enough green chile and beans. It also came with blue corn bread which was nice. Quite filling for a low price! The boyfriend ordered a tamale, which he seemed pleased but not fanatic about. They also have good iced tea, which I'm a big fan of. We both got a decent meal and left under $20 later. We'd go here again.
