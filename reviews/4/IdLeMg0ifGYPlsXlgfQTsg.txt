This place is right down the street from my house so one Friday on the way home we decided to try it.  It doesn't look like much from the outside and the "patio" faces the gravel parking lot so that's kind of lame.  Inside the d√©cor is nice and it's very clean.

We were seated right away as it wasn't crowded and given chips and salsa immediately.  Both were tasty.  My husband had a margarita that was on special and it was very good.  I got a steak and vegetable dish and he got a chimichanga, both were enormous, cheap, and served quick.  I appreciate all of the above.

It's not going to win awards for atmosphere but the food is reasonable, really good, and worth checking out!
