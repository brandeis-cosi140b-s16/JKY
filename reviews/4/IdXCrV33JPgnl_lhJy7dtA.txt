First time at this Valle Luna but have been to the Chandler location several times. 

We arrived at 11:45 for lunch on a Wednesday and waited about five mins to be seated. The decor looked updated but they went for a dark look with table lights. A bit gloomy. 

Our server, Claire, was efficient in bringing us menus and drinks. My coworker ordered the Sizzling Steak and Shrimp Fajitas and a coke while I ordered the Burro de la Casa with an iced tea. My meal came out in about 10 minutes along with his condiments but his sizzling platter took about five more mins, so I finished way early. 

The fajitas were tender and flavorful but the amount of onions was overwhelming and he ended up picking thru them to look for protein. My burro was nicely made (I got Machaca) and the sauce was nicely spiced. The meat was tender, juicy and fulfilling. 

The only downside was at the end of our meal - she disappeared and we waited quite a while for our check.
