I was introduced to the Pink Taco approx. 10 years ago, and it has become a tradition for us to go to Pink Taco either at the beginning, or end of our trips to Vegas.

My favorite item here is definitely the shrimp tacos. Over the years they have scaled back a bit on the quantity of the tacos (which is why I'm only giving 4 stars). 10 years ago, they would serve 4 shrimp tacos along with beans and Spanish rice. About 6 years ago, they scaled the dish back to 3 tacos, which was still enough food, but was a slight disappointment. Now they have scaled down to only 2 tacos on the dish, with the other half of the plate consisting of beans and rice. The tacos are still just as delicious, and the amount of food was just  right to fill you up.

Our waitress, Cristal, was very attentive and friendly. I would definitely recommend requesting to be seated in her area.
