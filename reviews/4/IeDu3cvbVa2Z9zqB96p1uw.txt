Had the opportunity  to swing by on a lower key Wednesday evening.  Patio was open and the doors remained opened to allow the beautiful weather to sneak into the bar area.  $5 craft cocktails were the special and the Pablo honey was a deal for that price.  Fresh basil, honey and ginger beer balanced out the drink and of course the rum!  I sat that the bar (the seats aren't the most comfortable).  The Gypsy salad was a winner, with large portions of seared hallo ump cheese.  I wish the walnuts were raw (they were candied) but the greens were crips and the onions sharps.  My meal was from the small plates-steamed mussels in a chili cream sauce with a chorizo pick de gallo.  The mussels were a little small, but plentiful.  Overall, great dish!
