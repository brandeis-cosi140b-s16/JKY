There's nothing fancy about this place. And it shouldn't be fancy. All you need to know is that it's REAL Mexican food, with a good chance of getting sick and also a good chance of getting robbed while eating at the tables. 

This neighborhood is somewhat dangerous. I ate at a taco stand in Mexico and had the same two feelings. It's legit.

The unhealthy food tastes good!
