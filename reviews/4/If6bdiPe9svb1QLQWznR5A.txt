Absolutely delish! This is a quick, easy, flavorful, and easy on the wallet lunch spot. Their food is always very tasty and consistent. I've ordered a variety  of their dishes and all of them always beyond expectations.

If you like super spicy salsa.. You have to ask them for it. I can only drop a couple drops if it because it's like fire.. But good.
