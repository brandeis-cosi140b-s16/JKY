I guess I'm the first review for the new Desert Ridge San Felipes.

A fun new happy hour spot!  My review is based on atmosphere and drinks only, because all I ate was some chips and salsa (which was yummy!).  

Sat on the patio for happy hour on a Friday evening, didn't leave until after 11pm.  Fairly good prices on decent margaritas ($4, I think).  
This location doesn't turn into the clubby-like atmosphere like the one at DC Ranch does.  But they have some good music, great people watching at Desert Ridge and it's a chill place to hang out with friends.
