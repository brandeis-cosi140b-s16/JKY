Decided to stop her with some friends for happy hour after doing some gambling. They have 99 cent margaritas & 99 cent tacos. That night the tacos were chicken. I guess they change daily. The drinks were pretty good & seriously..who can complain about a drink that costs 99 cents at the Hard Rock?
The tacos were also pretty good. Fresh shredded chicken on a small tortilla. A couple of them & I was ready for the evening of drinking. They have some amazing eye candy at the Hard Rock so its always fun to eat anywhere on the property.
I cant wait to bring my friends here on our girls weekend away this weekend..
