I first found out about this place when my neighbor mentioned he was one of the cooks and so graciously surprised us one day with a couple platters of enchiladas and a giant bag of chips and salsa. 

We loved it so much we decided to go to the restaurant and eat. 

Just for the record,I'll have you know some of the best Mexican Food Restaurants I've eaten in have had no windows and Rositas is no exception. 

Service was prompt and friendly. Chips were hot and crisp. Salsa was good too but not as good as the kind we were given by our neighbor...must have been his special recipe ;-) 

I ordered the 2 item Lunch combo for $7.95 and chose a chicken taco and a tostada (see pics) 
This is something I typically order everywhere I go and it's usually swimming in grease, but not here! Not even a drop!! 
Everything was Hot , Fresh and Delicious!! 

My husband ordered their Stacked Enchilada Platter with fried eggs on top (see pics) 
Unbelievably good! Again Hot and Fresh and Truly the absolute BEST Enchilada Sauce either one of us has ever had! 
This is now the go to place for Enchiladas! 
I even had to ask for a side of the sauce for my dish I liked it so much. 

I will definitely be back to try more from the expansive menu. They even sell items in bulk to go, great for when you aren't in the mood to make dinner, Rositas to the Rescue! 

They are open at 9am for Breakfast too and serve hot cinnamon crisps instead of chips and salsa, now if that's not a reason to go I don't know what is!
