Dick's Hideaway is a true gem.  Located in a trendy mid town Phoenix location, this place offers a true dive vibe with exceptional food.  Going there on a Sunday early afternoon with a couple buddies, I was eager to see what this place was all about.  

I'm pretty sure Jimmy Hoffa's body is easier to locate than this place, but once you do find it you're in for a treat. 

 It's small, but luckily we were able to get an open table right away.  The beer selection could be better, but I wasnt complaining.  I ordered a chorizo breakfast burrito with red chili sauce which was great in size and taste.  For only $5, was a gonga of a deal.  

Highly recommend so get over there now!
