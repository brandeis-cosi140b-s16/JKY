Ever since my first time here a few months ago, I've been a monthly visitor of this hole in the wall establishment. Across from the UNLV campus, this is a nice and cheap hangout place for you and your friends.

The place has an artsy feel to it. I like to call it pretty hipster (but what is hipster anyway?)

Out of all the tacos I ordered, nothing can beat the traditional carne asada tacos. I order these every time, along with a new type of taco. I've ordered so many, I forgot which ones I tried.

But I can tell you this. These tacos fill you up pretty quickly despite their small size. They stuff these tacos to the point of overflowing, but I'm not complaining. I finish off my meals with a plastic fork and scrape whats left of the ingredients and leave the plate clean of any crumbs.
