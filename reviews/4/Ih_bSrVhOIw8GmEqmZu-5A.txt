The food was good but they needed more meat in it. the bloody marys are excellent, have a double. Our server Cardi, short for Bacardi, was great! She did an excellent job.  Only thing I would recommend is to have the hostess wipe the tables w a dry napkin prior to sitting folks. Really annoying to sit down on a WET table top!
