Yum yum yum, kept hearing about chipotle as soon as I moved here and now I know why. Every ingredient is fresh, and their selection of lime rice is unique and tasty you can get either white or fried. 

The only thing holding this specific location back is their own success. There hasn't been a time I've gone where the line wasn't stretched past the door. If they could implement more efficient ways of moving the line besides online ordering (which is nice) this is easily a 5 star location.
