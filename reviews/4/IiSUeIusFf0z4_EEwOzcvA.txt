Modelo beer, and margaritas.  Verde chicken and southwest steaks, with beans that I'll eat and that means they're not just re-fried.  Free home-made chips and  fresh salsa, and they don't give you mean looks when you ask for seconds.   All this goodness is priced for families or causal dates.  It's a plain, bare-bones room (with adjoining bar) but the food more than makes up for it..  This stuff  tastes like the Mexican food I ate in  Mexico and California, not the stuff from Chi-Chi's. Go there!
