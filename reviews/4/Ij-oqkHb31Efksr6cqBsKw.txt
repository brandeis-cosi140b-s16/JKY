Came here when they had a yelp deal $10 for $20 and the food was pretty good for the price.  I would say their food is better than Roberto's but won't be as good as a nice sit down dinner.  The have some good carne asada fries, shrimp, chicken, pork, and carne aside tacos.  I've been there a few times now just to get some horchata.
