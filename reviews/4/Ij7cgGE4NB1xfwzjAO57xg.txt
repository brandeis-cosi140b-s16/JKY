I'm in AZ, it's Friday night and time for dinner.    As my friends are still unpacking into their new house, they suggest coming here for dinner.   I think "A sports bar?   Umm... OK."

As we pull in the parking lot I see Filiberto's Mexican food and Filiberto's Sports Grill in the same building, right next to each other.  I s'pose if your gonna have two restaurants, might as well have them next to each other, right?

We walk in and there had to be 15 TV's up on the walls, wow!

SERVICE:  Our server Lizette was pretty cool and did a good job tending to us.   I think my joking around might have been a little more than she was used to, but she handled it well.   The bar tender actually came out to our table to confirm something about my drink after I ordered my 2nd margi, pretty cool!

I eventually had 2 strawberry margaritas on the rocks (they have no blender - $6.50 ea).   While he first one was very tasty, with fresh sliced strawberries in it, I could not taste ANY booze in it!    I got our servers attention and mentioned this to her.    She suggested "a double shot" with the 2nd one.   I did ($3 more?) and the 2nd one was much better.

FOOD:  After my friend told me what he was going to have, I ordered the same thing, Sizzling Chicken ($10.95).    This is two grilled chicken boobs on saut√©ed red & green bell peppers and onions, mixed with melted american & jack cheeses.  This came with a bowl of instant mashed potatoes (with a lot of cheese mixed in, perhaps to mask it was instant potatoes?) on the side.   Bar food at its best baby!   The chicken / cheese / peppers & onions combo was actually pretty darn tasty, better than I expected!!!   Now I just have to make an appointment with my cardiologist to roto-rooter that gook out of my veins!   LOL

OVERALL:   A nice, but pretty noisy sports bar with decent bar food at reasonable bar prices.   3.5 stars rounded up.
