Ok.  I'm a Sun Devil alum, so I'll admit that the first two dozen times I visited this place I was NOT sober.  I was convinced that it was amazing after 5 hours of drinking back in the day, so after moving to SoTemp for my professional career, I popped in for lunch takeout quite a bit.  Yup, it's very good sober too ;)  Amado's needs to be taken for what it is:  quick, casual Mexican foods.  I'm a big fan of the rolled tacos, which are generously served with fresh guacamole.  The taco salad is Heaven. Make sure to hit up the little salsa bar during the day to accessorize your meal.  Bonus:  the entire breakfast menu totally helps cure a bad@ss, Mill Ave induced hangover.  For 'em, Amados!
