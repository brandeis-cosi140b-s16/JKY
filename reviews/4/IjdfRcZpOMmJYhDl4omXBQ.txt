I'd give this place a 5 if their prices were lower (poor me!) - I've never understood expensive Mexican food! But c'mon, this place has yucca fries. Did you know what yucca was before you wiki'd it just now? I hope so, because it is amazing, and should carry just as much weight in the Mexican dining gig as it does in traditional Mexican cuisine; the first person who cooked the root for me was a friend from Chihuahua, Mexico.  Oh, right and the rest of the food: unendingly satisfactory. The flautas were rich and creamy within their crispy shells, biting into the tortilla chips was a zing of salt-acular sensations (even better when dipped into the best tomatillo sauce you never thought Pittsburgh was capable of), the house sangria was delicious and on special (Sangria Sundays!), the black bean empanadas were bulky, fluffy, never-ending clouds of day-of-the-dead heaven....etc. I think we had nearly every appetizer because we wanted to try everything....but still, it wasn't enough. Too much goodness in this giant green treasure chest. I'll be back!
