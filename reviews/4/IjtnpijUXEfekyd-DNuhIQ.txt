I like being able to come here for lunch during work and it's not a chain restaurant that's super loud, overpriced or slammed. Service has always been fast and the food is good. 
Breakfast burritos are pretty fantastic. 
I just always feel relaxed here and can get things done on my lunch break. My favorite lunch place. Staff are super friendly and attentive.
