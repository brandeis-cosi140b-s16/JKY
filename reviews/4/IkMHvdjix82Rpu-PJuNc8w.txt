Had lunch here today. Service was friendly (truly friendly, not "I want a tip" friendly), food was fast, fresh, and tasty. 
I had the huevos rancheros... often the egg is tough with this dish, but it was cooked properly here. The maize tortillas are AWESOME.
I skipped the beans as I don't eat pork and they smelled like they were cooked with lard... I didn't ask about this because I knew the eggs, rice, and tortillas would be enough.
All the salsa is homemade and authentic...if you are looking for sweet, tomato-ey salsa, this is not it...it has a deep, rich, earthy flavor. Did I mention they make all of it from scratch!
Lunch was $8 including a beverage. 

But the number #1 thing about this place is its people.
