Yeah, this place.  This is not a food review, this review is only for those who like to drink way too much and end up at places like this.  During the day time, dead.  After 10 pm, turns into a club.  I like the house margaritas.  HUGE patio too.  Bouncers are wicked nice.  Great place to end up for the night with a bunch of friends.  Food is alright, I usually just go for the attitude and the atmosphere.  IE when I blackout and feel like being in a pile of dancing people.

You are going to want to know someone if you don't feel like waiting in line for a while here.  Or just be a good looking chick.  That helps.
