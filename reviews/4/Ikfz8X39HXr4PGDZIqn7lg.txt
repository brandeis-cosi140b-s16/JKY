Went to Vida Vida mistakenly last night when trying to meet some girlfriends for dinner. We ordered frozen drinks and chips before realizing we needed to be next door at Vida Cantina and Kitchen. Vida Vida is a smaller place with a smaller menu with food coming from the same kitchen. We loved their chips and salsa. Before we went next door we noticed they were setting up live music which is always fun! We would totally go back for a quick bite!
