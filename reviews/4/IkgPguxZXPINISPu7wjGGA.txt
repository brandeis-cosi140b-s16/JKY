You know, I don't go out of my way to hit up Los Cerritos, however I make sure to stop if I'm hungry and I happen to be in the vicinity.  Just yesterday I had an Egg, Potato, Bean and Cheese burrito for about 4 bucks and it was well above average.  

It wasn't too greasy, and the eggs were even fried (as opposed to scrambled) and fried is what I prefer - score.  The tortilla was very fresh, and thinner rather than thicker.  it was a good weight, and it took a good 7 or 8 minutes to prepare even though the place wasn't busy - which is good because it means I'm most likely not going to get sick later due to undercooking; I'm always suspect when I get things too fast.

Also worth noting, the man behind the counter was very friendly and thorough, and accommodated a special vegetarian request I had - hold the bacon, add beans.  Service with a smile always makes me happy:)
