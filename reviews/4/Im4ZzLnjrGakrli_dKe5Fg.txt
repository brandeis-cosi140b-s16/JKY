If you are looking for authentic regional flavors, Mama Lupitas is for you. Food is fresh and delicious with the right amount of spiciness. 5 starts for food and service, just beware that the location or the restaurant amanities are not top notch. My favorite dish is the Chilaquiles with eggs, but they also have some pretty good caldos (soups), and other regional dishes from southern Mexico. My recomendation is for you to explore, you will not be dissapointed.
