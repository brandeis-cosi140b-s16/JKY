Don't know why we like this particular Cabo over Palace or Santa Fe locations but we always seem to end up here on our visits back.  We never seem to get there in time for happy hour but pricewise it's on par with most chain places, with a little better quality.

Mom always said don't fill up on chips and salsa before dinner but she never had theirs, the spicier the better. Good enchiladas with plenty of cheese, fajitas were tasty too but easy on the onions next time.  Dessert options were so-so, we just had another margarita instead, I'm not big into fruit ritas but the strawberry hit the spot.

One drawback:  I don't expect every restaurant in Vegas to be 24 hours but the best you can do is 9 on weeknights? Just an idea...
