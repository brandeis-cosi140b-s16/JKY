Yummy! Food is great, venue ... not so much. It definitely looks like a hole in the wall in the middle of a strip mall. Food is delicious and the place doesn't look super nice. But again, when you go to get food, you mostly only care about the food.

I love love love their tortillas here. It's warm and doesn't taste like it's out of a plastic bag that you'd get from costco. The carne asada is also very good here, great quality. I ordered the Carne Asada California which is simply a carne asada burrito with fries in there. I also had some of my friend's carne asada fries. Both were really delicious, but I'm a fan of thicker fries when it comes to carne asada fries (in the burrito, I like it thinner). So really no complaints on the food. It's cheap. And if you are REALLY hungry, they have a Jumbo Burrito which is half carnitas and half carne asada for 8 dollars. Such a steal because it actually is.... really huge. Salsa was also very good, flavorful and had a nice kick to it. Staff is friendly, no complaints there. 

I wasn't a big fan of the venue at all. It's beat up, the dining room and furnishing are all really dull and the bathroom has graffiti all over the walls and is dimly lit. They have a couple of old video games and some old pool table there, too. Seriously needs a make over.

So come here and take it to go. Eat it at home or somewhere else where you can actually enjoy the surroundings.
