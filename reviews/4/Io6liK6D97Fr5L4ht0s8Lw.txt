You know, I've got to give them 4 stars. As I always state, this is not in comparison to Posh, or Mastro's, or Ocean Prime, etc, but apples to apples people. Compared to other chain Mexican restaurants, Chevy's is a good, consistent standby. Fresh guacamole, homemade tortillas, and pretty darned decent carnitas. Call me crazy, but I'd say it's a solid dining experience. A far cry from the mass produced garbage at Macayo's, and we've always had friendly service, and they get brownie points for the military discount. Stay away from the fried ice cream though, much like everyone else's, it tastes like it's coated in corn flakes. Sadly, the best Mexican food I've ever had is in Holland, Michigan, a little hole in the wall called Margarita's. Whats up here in Arizona? I've tried Old Pueblo, Mi Patio, etc, and they are all icky, low quality, with dried out rice. so I stick with Chevy's or Z Tejas when I want something with a Mexican/Southwest flair. I think the Camelback location recently closed, so we go to the Arrowhead location.
