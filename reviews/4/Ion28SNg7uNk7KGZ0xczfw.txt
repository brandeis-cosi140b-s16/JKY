Good food, extremely friendly service both in the bar and in the restaurant. I had the grilled fish tacos - you have the choice to substitute your rice for veggies. They were grilled, fresh, and a generous serving  - much better than I would expect for veggies at a Mexican restaurant! Reasonably priced.
