Food's good but they charge you a "service fee" for using a credit card which is annoying. Otherwise best hard shell tacos I've had... Really! Hard shells are really light and thin but crispy. Very tasty. Pork is best. Lunch specials are pretty good,. Always check to see what the lunch special is. Haven't had anything there I didn't like.
