Hidden below the Wells Fargo building but I love this place.  I always get the chicken burrito bowl.  You pay upfront and then add all the toppings you want.  You don't have to pay extra for guac so I love that. They will also put chips at the bottom for you.  It goes 1. Johnny Burrito. 2. Chipotle. 3. Qdoba. 4. If I must, salsaritas - terrible.
