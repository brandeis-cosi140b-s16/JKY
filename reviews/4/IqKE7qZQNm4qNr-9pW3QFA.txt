The Spanish Fly is where I ended Cinco de Mayo.  After margaritas and tequila at Aunt Chilades, where Charlie Sheen failed to show, it was decided we would go join the party at the Spanish Fly.  Good idea!

I had some Austrian guests in town.  They, in addition to myself, had a great time.  We were showered with friends, tequila and dollar bills.  Dollar bill explaination:  Several dollar bills mysteriously ended up the pool (where you unfortunately can't go after sunset). They were fished out by everyone.  I will definitely be going back to that place during daylight hours to swim when it's allowed.  I don't remember spending too much on drinks, the crowd was nice and I enjoyed walking around the place.

Hot spot to stay cool!
