Love the food here?  Back when I lived in Sacramento, CA this was lunch as most everyday.... Just as good here in Surprise, AZ.  Fresh meat, filling portions, everything seems so fresh and it could put you in a good food coma after eating 1 serving.  
This is a great after the gym snack... Even has beer, chips if you crave that with your fresh food. I would eat here more often, but my better half is not into large, heaping, portions that will satisfy anyones hunger....
