I prefer this place over Robertos.  It's near a convenient shopping center in Henderson and they don't play loud mariachi music while I'm here.  They do have a juke box (that is not even on) and soccer is playing on their big flat screen TV.

Enough people come and go, but it never gets too packed.  That's my kind of crowd.  

I usually get the chorizo plate or the carnitas plate.  Plates come with rice, beans, and pico de gallo with some type of guacomole sauce on top.  The carnitas are partially crispy since the skin is included.  Even better with the green sauce from the sauce bar.    

If you are looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant that's a step up from Robertos, then this is the place for you.
