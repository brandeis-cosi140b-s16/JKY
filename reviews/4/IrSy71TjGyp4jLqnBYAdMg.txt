This place is a favorite for my extended family. My Grandma likes to talk about bringing my mom and uncles to the original location on Fridays when they were kids. For me, the family tradition of La Fonda's adds to the comfort food feel. With all of that said the food here is great. I love the Fundido and the fajitas are great!

The customer service could improve here. The staff used to all be very friendly and talkative. It was very much a family atmosphere. Now, not so much.
