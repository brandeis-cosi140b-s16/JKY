I love the marriage of tacos and noodles at China Pablano. We have good Mexican food in Colorado but I've never had amazing noodles like we had. Extremely well developed flavors and gourmet noodles. Eight of us ate so we tried many different things. The margarita with salt foam was brilliant! I hope restaurants in Denver start copying it so I can have it on the regular! The desserts were also exceptionally delicious. I felt everything was very fairly priced.
