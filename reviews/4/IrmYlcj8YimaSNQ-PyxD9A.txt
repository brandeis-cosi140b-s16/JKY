Mi Patio is good. For the area that it is in, I find it strange that there isn't more competition in Mexican food. I guess I could head deeper into the aves but, as a rule of thumb, I don't associate the Avenues with solutions. 

From the outside, I was concerned that we were walking into a canned beans, store-bought hard taco shells, overpriced experience. In retrospect, this is probably due to the Corona theme on the outside of the building that made me think of all the substandard Mexican joints in Tempe that survive off the binge drinking college crowd. So, shame on me for such judgement - authentic Mexican doesn't have to come from a rundown brink building in a south Phoenix barrio.

Promptly seated, the service was attentive and the food was good. I got my panfried taco shell (complete with bubbled sides - muy authentico!) and left fat and happy. I think Mi Patio may be our new go-to Mexican place when we don't want to drive all the way to the South Phoenix Barrio.
