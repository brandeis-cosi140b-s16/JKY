Wow, only one review here... that's crazy when I know SO many of my co-workers and friends eat here!

OK, so be ready to wait in a long that goes alllll the way to the patio if you come during lunch time... not too slow of a line, but still enough to drive me away or just make me plan on coming earlier than 12.

Their staff here changes a lot so I can't really speak for any of them as far as their friendliness or quickness, but overall, when you've ordered, they are pretty damn quick at getting you out.. which is very helpful when you dont' want to kill a whole hour for work lunch.

I would say that my only complaint is the 'natural' claims on their proteins.. this is not always the case and rarely do they actually post the signs that say "sorry, we have conventional X/Y/Z".  I totally understand that the good stuff runs out but I'm pretty sure it happens often, so when I don't see the sign often, I'm sure they're just not putting it up when they should.

But Chipotle is a great option for people looking to have a more healthy eating experience.. I usually stick to the 2 or 3 (If i'm feeling super hungry) tacos on soft corn with all the fixins.. that or the salad with any of the meats.  Those two are the only things I ever order.. never been disappointed with those.
