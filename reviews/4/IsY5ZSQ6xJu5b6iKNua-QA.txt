Aha! a bright green painted wall with a large inscripted "Roberto's Taco Shop" inside this shop transports me here, even on an early morning to get a stomach-filling Mexican meal. In Vegas 24 hour restaurants and businesses is not a surprise but I like it that this is open 24 hours! in this westside neighborhood in the proximity of South Jones and the Highway 215. This is one of several Roberto's Taco Shops in Vegas. 

My ever favorite Chicken Enchiladas wrapped in soft tortillas generously heaped with chicken and cheese. (#6 on the menu with a Chicken Taco). With the addition of lemon, cilantro, cucumber slices, pickled carrots with onions, green jalapeno peppers from the Salsa Bar, it is much of a meal. Green or red chile sauces and salsa sauces are extra choices to perk up the meal adding zesty spiciness. Otherwise, pick your choices from the Salsa Bar. 

Ordering is from the menu posted above the service counter. Popular Mexican fare such as burritos, tacos, carnitas, enchiladas, asadas with rice or beans and many more choices. No available printed menu or even a "take-out" menu. Noticeably, an absence of Mexican food aroma. No smell of cooking? Must have a very strong air cooking suction filter or air purifier system? Unlike other places of eatery or small restaurants, aaah this place is a smell of clean and it appears well attended to. Modern dining furnishings in granite-like table and padded seats. Service staff and kitchen staff is amiable, patient, and helpful. Prompt sevice. To the far right side of the shop is where beverages can be poured to beverage cup. 

It's well-lit at night, shop's neon red signs are visible from the road. Notably from a flyer poster, Wednesdays are 99 cents Chicken Taco Day!
