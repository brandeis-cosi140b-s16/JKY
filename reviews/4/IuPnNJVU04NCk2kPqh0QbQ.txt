So far, this is my favorite mexican restaurant in Casa Grande.  I don't know why it has two $$... it was super affordable to eat here, especially for what we got!  I appreciated the 70's ranch-style vintage layout of the restaurant and the booths. I'm a stickler about comfort and interior design--to be honest it's almost as important to me as the food.  This restaurant has good personality.  It's not a boring chain like so many other places.  The booths are super comfy.  Their food was affordable and delicious, the servings were big, our server was really nice, and (unlike the experience of some other reviewers) we didn't have to wait at all.  It wasn't too busy.  Definitely support this place!
