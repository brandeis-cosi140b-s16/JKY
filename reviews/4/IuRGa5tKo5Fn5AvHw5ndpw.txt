Just off the plane, needing to get a quick bite before a meeting... we see a Jack in the Box.. and move on to Juliobertos!

Freshly made Mexican, good prices and the ease of a drive through!

I ordered a quesadilla - with carne asada.  Very delicious and fresh.  Flavorful beef too!  My only issue is that they didn't cut it into triangles... Which made me look like a savage trying to eat it - either way, I found a way to get it in my belly.

My friend got a chicken torta - some kind of sandwich.  He loved it too!

If you are ever in this area of town, its a great alternative to lame drive thru burgers!
