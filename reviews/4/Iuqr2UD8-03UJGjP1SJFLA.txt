First off, let's just get this straight: Manuel's has THE BEST salsa in town. Period. Having said that, the rest of their menu is pretty fantastic, too. We love the pollo especial, fajitas, rolled quesadilla, green tamales - pretty much you name it, we've eaten it there. Becky is our favorite - and super special - server and she always gives us excellent service. Stop in, say hola, and enjoy some fabulosa comida Mexicana.
