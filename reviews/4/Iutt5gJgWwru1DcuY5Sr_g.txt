I popped in a few minutes before closing time and grabbed two carnitas tacos. I was pleasantly surprised. The tacos were of good size, the meat was of good quality and it was a tasty meal. They had green and red hot sauce - both were tasty, but without a lot of heat, which was fine for that evening. Can't wait to go back and try some other dishes.
