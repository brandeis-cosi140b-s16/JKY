The place was pretty large, meaning that there was plenty of elbow room.  There's sand on the floor for the outside and a wading pool for the hot days.  There are many private areas in this bar, so if you wanted a private party (sort of), it'd be a good place.  A wide range of music is played here, with music videos played for the songs.  

Kind of cool, there are seats at the bar, stools with tables for high seating, couches, restaurant style seating, it's a place for everyone.  I wish I got on the dance floor, but I was talking to my friend I haven't seen in years!
