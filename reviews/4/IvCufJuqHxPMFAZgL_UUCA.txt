This place is a hidden jewel to all the tourist. 
if you are looking for a tradtional authentic mexican restaurant then this is the place. the owner came from Michoacan, Mexico and they know how to cook.

from homemade tortillas to everything on the menu. You can not go wrong with nothing on this menu.
they even bring you chips, homemade beans, and salsa in the beginning.

i would recommend this to anyone. Great food, Great service, and TRUE mexican food.
