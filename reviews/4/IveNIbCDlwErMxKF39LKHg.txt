I came here for the Sonoran hot dogs, which are pretty yummy. Not El Guero Canelo yummy, but good enough to hold off the craving until the next trip to Tucson.
I also ordered the carne asada torta, that was muy buena ijuesu!

They have Mexican soda in bottles. Ample parking and friendly cashiers.
If you are even in that area of Chandler, stop by for a quick lunch.
