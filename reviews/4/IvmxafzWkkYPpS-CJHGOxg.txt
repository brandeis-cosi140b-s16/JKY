Best green chile beef I have ever had.  Great Chimis.  Very authentic red salsa with good taste and not painful.  It's like your Hispanic buddy invited you to dinner at his  Abuelas's.  Casera  comida at it's finest.  Now if that liquor license would go through.....  Leave Someburros to the out of town gringos who wouldn't know good Mexican food when it's just down the street.  To the owner and employees, thanks for enduring and reopening, keep up the good work.  We Love Ya.
