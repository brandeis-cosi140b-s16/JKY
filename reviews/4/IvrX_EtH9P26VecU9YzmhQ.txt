After looking at pictures from my trip to Costa Rica, I was craving plantains. I was thinking about hitting up a Cuban spot near my house but, my boyfriend suggested a pupusas place. I've never had pupusas so, I was intrigued.

We entered and it was like a big warehouse type restaurant with lots of tables. We ordered the mixed/combination (cheese, beans, meat) pupusas and plantains. Also, had horchata. My portion was less than $5 so, MAJOR score.

It came with some kinda of slaw and hot sauce. I tried the slaw on my pupusa but, didn't like it too much. Hot sauce, on the other hand, I loved on everything including my plantains.

Anyways, I finished my 1 pupusa and half of my plantains. And I was stuffed. And such a happy lady =)
Everytime I'm in the area, I try to stop in because they're open early and definately a cheap eat!
