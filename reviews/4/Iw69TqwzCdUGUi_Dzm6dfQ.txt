My wife and I frequent this El Pollo. The quality of food is always very high. The service is quick and courteous. 

When we are in need of some flavorful grilled chicken and fresh made salsa they do not disappoint. 

If you have not tried the stuffed quesadillas, they are full of chicken, avocado and amassing sauce.
