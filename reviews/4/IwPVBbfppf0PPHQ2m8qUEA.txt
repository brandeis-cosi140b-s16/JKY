Having passed this restaurant dozens of times my friend and I  finally decided to give it a shot. What we were after were some great margaritas and Don Pedro's did not disappoint. I had the special margarita and I can say it was the smoothest margarita I have ever had (and I've had plenty). 

The free tortilla chips and salsa were very good. We decided to just get appetizers and we were glad we did as the portions were gigantic. I ordered the Fajita quesadilla and could only eat about a third of it! It was very tasty as well.

Our waiter (Usvaldo) was very attentive and informed us of the upcoming events...karaoke  and a live mariachi.

I will definitely be coming back. I went on a Sunday afternoon but would love to go for some drinks/apps on a Friday or Saturday night.
