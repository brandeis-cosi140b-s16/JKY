I first experienced La Palapa in small quantities at a couple yelp events in Pittsburgh Public Market- I was super excited to check out this adorable little restaurant and try some full size options!

My sister and I visited on a Saturday afternoon around 1:00- there were a few parties in the small restaurant, allowing us to have plenty of options on where to sit. We chose a cozy little table next to a window, so we could people watch (who doesn't love that?!). First off, our server was ADORABLE. He was super helpful, in a great mood and just made the experience that much better by his wonderful attitude. 

I was curious about the horchata, so he let my sister and I sample it before making up our minds. After trying one sip, I knew I had to order it- it was amazing! Really refreshing. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and a beef taco, my sister ordered one chicken and one cheese quesadilla. I was given two tacos- one chicken and one beef. Not a big deal. 

The tacos were HUGE. PACKED with meat and served with guacamole, lettuce and salsa. The chicken was awesome- it was shredded, juicy and full of flavor. The guac was amazing and so was the salsa! Our server asked if we wanted hot sauce, and of course we did. WOW. It was a home made green sauce and full of flavor. It added a really tasty kick to the tacos. My sister loved her quesadillas and loved the hot sauce with them as well. I wasn't so crazy about the beef taco- the meat just was a little flavorless to me and it was almost too much meat. I couldn't finish it at all.

The horchata went PERFECTLY with the tacos. The creaminess of the horchata really cooled my mouth down, which was awesome. 

You can't beat the prices of this place- the quesadillas and tacos are a little over $3 each.. making them a steal! I have been to tons of taco places in which I needed four to feel full. One and a half tacos from La Palapa and I was STUFFED.

Overall, it was a great experience and I can't wait to come back!
