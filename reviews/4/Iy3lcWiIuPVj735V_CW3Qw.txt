Los Mesquites just recently opened where I think the old Leland's restaurant was located several years ago.  It's nice to see a mexican restaurant open to compete with El Encanto.  

The food was a solid four stars.  They make their own chips and salsa.  The salsa is mild with the flavors of fresh fire roasted tomato and mexican oregano as primary ingredients.  Best of all I didn't detect any cilantro (sorry fans but I am one of "those" cilantro haters).

The lunch specials are reasonable at $5.95 - $8.95 for versions of their dinner offerings.  My wife had the taco salad with grilled chicken.  She enjoyed it very much.  The shell was freshly made and the salad was very generous for a lunch portion...lots of chicken.  One nice thing is they put enough lettuce in the salad.  Seems many taco salads are light on the greens.  I had a Chile Relleno.  It was fairly spicy, nicely battered, and lightly fried.  I appreciate the plate not dripping with grease like many Chile Relleno dinners do.  The best part was the homemade corn tortilla the Carne Asada taco came in.  This was a wonderfully thick creation with a great masa flavor.  I will definitely order something that comes wrapped in these next time!

Finally, the service was a four star attempt with three star results.  I chalk it up to being new, but there was a little difficulty getting orders straight between the tables, and some tables waiting 30 minutes for food while others waited 10.  But the servers and owner (?) were very nice and explained what happened to the customers.  Our service was great and I'm sure closer to what you can expect.
