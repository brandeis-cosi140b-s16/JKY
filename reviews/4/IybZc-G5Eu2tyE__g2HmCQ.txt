We got there after 2pm on New Year's Day and the place was packed, but we've been here before and we knew the wait would be worth it.
The staff are friendly, fast and genuinely want to provide you with great service!
We were seated and drink orders were taken immediately. The drinks arrived pretty fast as did the chips and salsa. Warning: if you ask for the habanero salsa, you will get burned! t is HOT and tasty if your tongue doesn't fall off first.
The food arrived promptly. It was hot, delicious and there was plenty of it! Even though they were busy, they did not hurry us and allowed us to eat at our leisure. 
Like I mentioned earlier, we'd eaten there before because we wanted a tasty, authentic Mexican food experience. It's a few miles off the Strip but well worth the drive. A taxi will run you about $20 and the restaurant provides a shuttle service which came in handy.

Good Food, Good Drinks, Good People!
