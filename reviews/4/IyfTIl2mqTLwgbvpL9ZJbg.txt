If you think Taco Bell is quality Mexican food you probably won't like these types of places....But for those of us with more sense, it is Great to have places like this to get great little tacos even at 4 AM, since they are open 24 hours.

Amigos gets 4 stars because:
It's open 24 hours; 
The tacos are consistent and overflowing with meat; T
he specialty habanero sauce (by request only) is INSANELY hot but when used sparingly ads great flavor to the tacos. 
4 small tacos and a drink combo is $6.75

The reason it's not 5 stars:
The variety of the tacos is missing a few staples (there is NO CABEZA) which, in my opinion makes the best tacos. 
They claim to have the world's best chicken enchilada...OK it is a big portion for the cost, and does include delicious chunks of dark and white chicken....But nothing ever needs as much sour cream as this enchilada has. it is literally stuffed and topped with so much sour cream you almost can't taste anything else.
I once had to borrow a large serrated knife from the kitchen while I was dining in, because they were completely out of plastic knives. 

For the brave with huge appetites they have the 22" 4 lb. burrito, which you can often see people leaving with as if carrying a huge loaf of french bread over their shoulder or cradling like a small child. They stuff everything in it including the beans and rice. I'm not a fan of this style because all the flavors run together, but.....at only $15 for 4 lbs. it is a more reasonable challenge than the one featured on Man vs. Food from NASCAR cafe, and its more cost efficient to feed 4 people with. Split one with 3 friends and its only $3.75 for each person to have a 1 lb. burrito.

My advice is to stick with the tacos and get it to go. 

This is how the 3 small taco chains rank in my opinion:
Pepe's 
Amigo's
Roberto's
