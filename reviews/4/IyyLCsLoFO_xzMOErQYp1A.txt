Despite it's name (which makes me think of a dirty bar south of the border), Spotted Donkey has fancy mexican food in a upscale, nice setting. The interior is split into a few different areas, all of which are pretty and cool. The patio is awesome - trees draped in lights, lanterns on every table, & a sweet fireplace. I really like this place! We had:

- Nachos: Really yummy & loaded nacho's. The chips are whole fried tortillas and they are covered in a ton of delicious stuff. The black beans are delicious, the salsa/hot sauce is delicious, and the different kinds of cheese make the whole plate cheesy with different flavors. We got the short stack, which was perfect as an app size. These definitely are awesome with margaritas, and the full size is perfect for hanging at the bar.
- Cheese Enchiladas: Good flavors, but the tortillas were so hard and unpleasantly hard to chew. The pinto beans are yummy, the green enchilada sauce is flavorful, but the carrot slaw was way too sweet and didn't blend well with the rest of the flavors.
- Chop Salad: I love the fact that they toss & serve a salad tableside. The ingredients are all fresh and it's a hearty sized salad (perfect as a full sized meal with some nachos).
- Sonoran Sunset: Beautiful colors, fun name, & a good balance in flavors.
- Mango Margarita: So awesome. Really fresh, sweet mango flavor without being overly sweet and it has a wonderful smooth texture. Love this drink!
- Mango Strawberry Margarita: A little too sweet...the mango is better.
- Cactus Heart: Fun name, pretty purple color, and delicious.
