Could I be more of a fat kid? I'm rating one of my favorite breakfast burrito places. I didn't even know "breakfast burrito" was a food group until the past year. Arizona, you are glorious.

Boyfriend and I love to call in our orders and head out to pick up a HEFTY bag of tastiness. My staple is the potato, egg and cheese, add peppers and onion. They don't skimp on tiny ramekinitos of red and green sauce. These suckers are HUGE. Just call it a wash on yor diet and enjoy. The tortilla is light and flaky and just...dumb, OK?! Melty cheddar oozes throughout the ingredients without being gloppy. It's beyond.

I love that we've NEVER had an order mix up, which is better than I can say for almost every other bfast burrito joint I've haunted. Los Favs, your name is so correct!
