Monday night specials are great! The $10 taco sampler and $10 margarita sampler are a great way to get happy hour started. Our server was very attentive and the patio was kept clean. My chair was broken when I sat down, and it ripped my dress a little. 

I was with a group including my mother, and she thought the clothing on the waitresses was a little risky (shorts were pretty short/tight). I used to work in food and I can see her perspective, but for downtown champaign this kind of apparel is nothing new. 

I would suggest a visit! Good presentation is also exceptional for the CU area.
