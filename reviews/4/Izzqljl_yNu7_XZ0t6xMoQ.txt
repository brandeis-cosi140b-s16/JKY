Caramba's is find in the Sun City Grand area.  My wife and I really enjoy going to Caramba's because it's just down home good, inexpensive Mexican food.  We go at least twice month if we are in the area.  The food is always fresh and plentiful.  Love the salsa bar.  We can load up on our favorites and they are great on the food.  I like the Chorizo and eggs platter.  Breakfast is great but I have to admit I wish that they would open earlier for breakfast. Check it out this local restaurant that out does all those overdone place in the area.
