Sorry, it's been a while since I've been to the Mission; but reading someone else's review made me realize; I need to YELP.  Whenever I see corn on the menu; I have to get the street corn - yummy!!!  Just always have to get extra napkins; since it's messy. Also, since someone else paid; we tried the Pork Shoulder tacos to share.  It was plenty of food for the 2 of us.  Love the atmosphere and will definitely be back for the corn and will have to try the posole...
