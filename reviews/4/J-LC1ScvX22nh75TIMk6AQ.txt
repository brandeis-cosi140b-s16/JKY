I have enjoyed the Tempe Z'Tejas for years. This one is in a unwalkable area, but it was just as tasty!

Location:  Near a strip mall of sorts. Tons of parking available. 

Variety: It's typical tex mex types of food.  There are quesadillas, tacos, salads, etc.  Though one can make a meal vegetarian or vegan, it isn't as easy as other places. 

Service: Quick, efficient and friendly. 

Food quality:  Everyone talks about the chambord margaritas- these are an absolute must have!  Also, one is adequate!  The food itself is good, but I wouldn't say it's anything special. I go for the margaritas! 

Ambiance: This is a quieter location than Tempe's location.  It was pretty quiet.
