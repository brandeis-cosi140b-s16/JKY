Really enjoy this place. Actually forgot about it for a while and then remembered how awesome it is and went back again last night. Red jade chicken is great. Like to get half in quesadilla form and the rest with the beans and rice. Love the jerk fried rice. Portions are huge. The snickerdoodle cookie given with the meal makes my day. A great place to grab food to go in north Phoenix.
