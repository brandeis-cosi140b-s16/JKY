Spicy Mango Margarita.... enough said. I am not a huge Margarita drinker but I would come back to this restaurant just for that drink. It was so delicious and I think the spicy aspect of the drink took out the sweetness of the margarita, which I loved! I did not eat any food, my aunt and I came here for a happy hour, but all the food looked amazing and I would love to  try. Next trip to AZ, I will be revisting for this one of a kind spicy drink!
