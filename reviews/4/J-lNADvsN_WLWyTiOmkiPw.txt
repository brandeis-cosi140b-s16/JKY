Boredom set in watching raindrops fall off the palm trees. A trip to the lush gardens inside Sam's Town was in order. Some Disney type animatronics is always fun. After a zero star experience at Lindo Michoacan, I was a bit hesitant to try another Mexican restaurant. Well, suprise suprise. I ordered the shredded beef burrito and it was excellent. My wife ordered the chile rellano and chicken enchilada combo.She didn't have to say a word, the huge smile on her face said it all. Service was great too. I truly suggest a trip to this well priced establishment to end that craving.
