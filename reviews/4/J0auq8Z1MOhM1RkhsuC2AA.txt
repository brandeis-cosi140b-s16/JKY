I am not from the area so probably won't be eating here again anytime soon. I would love to give a 3.5 but swung more towards a 4 because I felt some previous ratings of a 1 was unfair. 

Food: the chip salsa was a bit runny and the chips were assorted with a few that were stale. As for the entrees and dinner as a whole. It was great! The food was of decent portion, cooked as ordered, came out hot and delicious.

Service: our server was very friendly and did a good job understanding our questions and request. He returned promptly with refills and asked if everything was good several times. I give him .

Pricing: average for an eat-in Mexican restaurant 

If we are ever in the area again looking for Mexican, we wouldn't hesitate to eat here again.
