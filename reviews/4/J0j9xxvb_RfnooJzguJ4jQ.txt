La Hacienda is a place I've been visiting for over 15 years for a quick, affordable meal.  We bring our whole family here a lot because we don't have to wait long to get our food.  usually we are in and out in 30 minutes!  The chips and salsa are tasty.  If you want a drink, I would recommend the Horchata.  As for a meal, i've always been a fan of their chicken chimichangas.
