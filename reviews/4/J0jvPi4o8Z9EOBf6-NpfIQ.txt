Authentic Mexican food with plenty of parking at their private parking lot. I arrived just after noon for lunch and the dinning room was full of patrons.

I went with the chili verde burrito which came with beans, rice and salad. The burrito was unique BC it contain pieces of strips of green chilies and delish tender pork. The sides, chips and salsa were also yummy.

I gathered from the way the family greeted the clients that this is definitely a locals joint and and the owners appreciated the support with a number of signs - Thanking clients for their support!

I'll definitely be returning.
