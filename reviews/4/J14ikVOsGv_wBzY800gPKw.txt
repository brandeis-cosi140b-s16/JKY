Very good food!  My biggest recommendation for this place is to improve their hours!  To close at 6pm on SATURDAY is ridiculous, and then only stay open till 7 during the week just makes it very difficult to come here.  I would probably go there more often if it wasn't closed by the time I get out of work.

Also, I think they could provide larger portions, and include chips and salsa.  Instead of charging $6 on combination meals, charge $8 and provide more food, and/or chips and salsa!

Food is great, but provide better hours and more portions, even if you need to charge more.  customers would still keep coming.
