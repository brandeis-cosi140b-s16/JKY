I am a big time fan of this small Torta shop in Avondale and I really enjoy their food as it gets me away from mainstream Mexican food joints and into a touch of something different. I have tried 3 different torta's and have yet to have a menu item there that I did not thoroughly enjoy. They have fresh ingredients and love to use the avocado in many plates which is killer if your are a fan. They also choose to use higher quality meats in their menu items as you get ribeye tacos and a better cut of pork. I tried their super nachos last night and though they were different and used actual nacho cheese I really enjoyed the dish as well, and it was loaded with meat, cheese, and guacamole. The salsa bar has some real fire kicking salsas so be mindful not to dump it in your sammy or you will get burned on both ends. The service is great and friendly, it's always clean, and you won't feel like an outsider if you come with friends or family to eat a meal here. I would recommend this to my yelp friends.
