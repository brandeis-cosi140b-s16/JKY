This little hole in the wall is so authentic and Good you will not be disappointed. Yes it is a couple miles away from the strip but its good and inexpensive so it works out.  I had the fish ceviche tostada and a shrimp tostada. I wish I could eat more it was so good! the service was good the server was very attentive. A cool bonus, mariachis came into to play live music. I was there with a group of 8 and we sampled each others food, everyone had a great plate of food.  They serve beer and alcohol good tequila, micheladas.  I will come back here for sure!
