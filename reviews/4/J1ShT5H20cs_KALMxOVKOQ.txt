Being an AZ native, I'm very picky about Mexican food.  Caramba's is the best fast food joint around.  Made fresh daily.  One of the few places that know how to make a crispy cheese crisp.  Few places make good menudo, but this one one of them.  I like both white and red, but prefer the red.  Lots of carne, very flavorful,  not greasy.  Great beef tacos.  Multiple salsa flavors on a salsa bar.  Red and green chili are good too.   You won't be disappointed with the food or prices.  Caramba's........where you don't peso much!
