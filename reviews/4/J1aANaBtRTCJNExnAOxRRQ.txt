The pork they use is fantastic. Tastes just like when I was in Hawaii.  Really enjoyed the burrito. I've only had one bad experience here. Went late at night,  the rice was old and hard and the guacamole was completely brown,  like it had been out for awhile.  Good greasy food otherwise. I definitely recommend this place.  Be sure to try the coconut bark. I'm hooked. The service is always friendly and appreciative of the patronage. Tacos had a lot of grease, but flavor was perfect.
