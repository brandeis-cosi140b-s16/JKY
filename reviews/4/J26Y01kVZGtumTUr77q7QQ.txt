After our absolutely awful experience next door at the terrible Red Bird Cafe, we were famished.  We walked right in to Filiberto's, ordered a couple breakfast burrito's and a soda, were treated with a smile, and got our food all in a matter of 5 minutes.  Plus, we got it all for less than what we were about to spend next door.  I haven't had any form of Berto's in years.  I honestly can't remember the last time I ate at one.  Needless to say my first bite into my steak and egg burrito was so nice.  It was meaty, cheesy, and stuffed full of eggs.  It was the perfect foil to a cold, rainy, blustery day.  The only thing I wasn't diggin was the messy floor.  Oh well, the food was delicious and I got a Diet Coke.  I was a happy girl.
