On my lunch break, I was looking around and decided to try Rock Taco. It's been open a few months now and I'd never stopped by any place that had occupied it's spot in the food court, but today was the day. 

The atmosphere is good. Positive, energetic, good lighting (not too bright though), fun kitsch on the walls. 

The menu has varied tacos to try. Being lactose intolerant, I avoided anything with cheese or cheese sauce. When the tacos came (pretty promptly), I was a little underwhelmed by their size, about 3 bites apiece. They almost reminded me of tapas. Despite their size, they were delicious. Between the tacos and fresh chips and salsa, I was pretty full. These are not family sized portions for each patron, but an appropriately sized portion for $8. I wasn't stuffed, but I was very sated. 

Service was prompt and polite, Patrick did a great job of keeping on top of my chips and water. The food came out promptly even when it was a little slower on a Tuesday at noon (in food services, being slow doesn't mean the service is better, it can be quite the opposite). 

Their draft beers looked great, the obligatory Coors Lite but some other delicious beers, I believe I saw Kiltlifter, Dos Equis, that kind of stuff. 

I look forward to visiting Rock Taco again
