I tried this place late on a Thursday, so the crowd was sparse. The set up is cool, a bar to the right and tables to the left. There isn't a whole lot of seating so I would guess at certain times it's tough to get a table. The drink menu boasts quite a selection and there are plenty of draft beers to choose from too. 

Yo Rita takes a progressive approach to taco dinning. They have selections from traditional chipotle chicken to outlandish takes on the taco.

We ordered:

1 Chipotle Chicken
1 Artichoke Heart
1 Cubano
1 Calamari

All were good and paired with different sauces to complement the meat or veggie. They only one I might not order again was the Artichoke Heart. Not that it was bad, just the other three totally overwhelmed it. The Cubano was the best, a perfect pair of meat, Dijon mustard sauce and dill pickle.

All the tacos are in the $5-$10 range. This might sound expensive, but the tacos are huge and 4 are more than enough to feed 2 people.
