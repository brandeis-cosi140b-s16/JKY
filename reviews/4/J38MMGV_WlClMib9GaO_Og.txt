Me, my brother, and my cousin hit this spot up. We sat at the bar ordered 2 rounds of Hite and a couple shots of soju. 

I ordered a bulgogi taco, a calamari taco, a bulgogi flauta, and a pork belly taco. 

My bro got a shrimp taco, bulgogi taco, and 2 pork belly tacos. 

My cuz got the bulgogi burrito. 

The chips salsa and guacamole were good. 

The bulgogi was dry and it was not marinated long enough. 

The calamari taco was excellent. 

My bro gave me one of the shrimp from his taco and it was tender and good. 

The flauta was dry to me and with the bulgogi not being marinated long enough it didn't work to me and I had to add guacamole and sour cream to every bite to finish it. 

I think the crown jewel was the pork belly tacos. The pork was thick cut and had a smokey flavor to it. I mixed a couple of the salsas together and it rounded out the taco nicely.


I like this spot!
