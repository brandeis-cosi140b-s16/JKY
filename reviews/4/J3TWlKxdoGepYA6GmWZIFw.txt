It was a sad day when my other favorite taco shop closed down, but then I found Roberto's Taco Shop just down the street and things started looking up again. Another 24 hour local taco shop to satisfy your cravings at any hour of the day or night...whether you want a breakfast burrito with eggs, cheese, potatoes and any meat you like (chorizo, bacon, or sausage) or you rather come in for lunch and get a carne asada or carnitas burrito, or a late night snack of fish tacos, then you have found your place. 

The service is fast and they have a serve yourself salsa bar with both green and red salsa and of course their selection of pickled carrots and jalapenos.

One item that I know I want to try on the menu is their carne asada fries...definitely something that I used to get back in LA and San Diego at all the local taco shops.
