Finally realized this place is open! Was excited to see this place going in but it felt like they were under construction for ever.

I wanted this place to be awesome because Hacienda de Rosa's Restaurante was just awful.  This is a walk up and order place but you can take a seat in a pretty large floor space for dining-in.  Like I said before we came in to order and go, my wife and I both got the cornitas seafood and it was awesome!

Service was pretty quick to even though the place was super busy.  We are in the area so it's great to find an awesome Mexican food place nearby.  Keep up the great work! :-)
