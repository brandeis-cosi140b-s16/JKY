This place is a must stop at on every Vegas trip of ours. Their carne asada breakfast burrito is to die for and they serve it 24 hours a day. Their pickled onions and carrots at the condiment bar goes well with anything they serve. Yeah there's nothing glamorous about this place but after a night of partying and drinking this place always hits the spot as a hangover cure. Considering it's in this small sketchy strip mall behind a 7-11 inside Roberto's is actually very clean for what it is. The guys working there are nice enough and the food is always consistent and a great value overall. I'd rather eat here than a majority of those fancy expensive foofy places on the Strip.
