Okay, so this was a total hole in the wall, but GREAT carne asada burrito. I would  perhaps have given them 5 stars if the 3 rolled tacos had actually first included the gacmole they were suppose to and the cheese was melted. But the carne asada was very good, almost San Diego-like.  The place put the food together in a heart beat but it was 10:30pm.  

I have to say, this place is in the memory banks...so close to the airport and the strip (if you have a car).  Just do this, order a carne asada burrito and ask for extra gac and if you order the rolled tacos do the 5 with the works.  

Glad I found this on Yelp and for sure 4 stars..oh and this is take-out only, no seating really and not a place you want to hang.
