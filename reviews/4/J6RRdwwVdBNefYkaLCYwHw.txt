Came because Yelpers really liked it. It seemed a bit more "assembly line" than I have been eating around Phoenix, but was still very good. Just sort of lacked that "grandma in the kitchen" feel.
I kept it simple with a couple chicken tacos and a few rolled steak tacos. Added some chips/salsa for good measure. They have a great little self-serve salsa bar with 5 different salsas that were all very good. Mild to Spicy, couple green, few red. 
The Tacos were huge! Piled with Guacamole and Pico, and some pretty good chicken(guessing thigh meat) The rolled steak tacos were pretty much a taquito from what I know. Service was great and friendly, location was nice and clean. There are a lot of options for Mexican food, this one is pretty solid. East to get to right off The 101 on 59th Ave. I'd probably go back if I were in the neighborhood, but wouldn't drive miles out of my way to go back.
