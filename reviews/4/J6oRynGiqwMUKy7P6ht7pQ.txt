One of the best tacos I have tasted. I'm Latina and I have ate a lot of tacos in my life but these ones for some reason remind me of home lol. For some reason the ones in Brookline taste better than the ones in beechview or Oakland. I also love that you are able to go to the store and buy Mexican sodas and drink them while eating your tacos. A true 3rd world country experience in the burgh!
