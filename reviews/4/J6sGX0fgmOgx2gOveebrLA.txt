We had dinner at this place our first night in Phoenix after watching the Dodgers beat the Rangers (Go Blue!) at Spring Training.  It was convenient to our hotel, and we chose to go there after reading reviews on Yelp.  We were not disappointed.  The food was good Mexican (a little more traditional than "fresh Mex") and quite reasonably priced.  I had the Mi Pueblo Enchiladas plate: one chicken, one beef, and one cheese enchilada.  The beef and chicken enchiladas were excellent, the cheese enchilada didn't appeal to me as much.  My partner had an enchilada, carne asada dish which was also very tasty.  We had good Margaritas.  There is table service although the space is set up for counter service -- I'm guessing they don't have table service at lunch?  I'd definitely go back.
