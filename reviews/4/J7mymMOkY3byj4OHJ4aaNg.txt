Hit this place up for happy hour yesterday.  Happy hour menu is $3/$4/$5.  Drinks and food at each price point but it's only good in the bar and when I got there at 5:30, the bar was bumping.  

I tried the guacamole (only $4 on happy hour!).  Nothing spectacular but the good thing was that the chopped jalapenos were on the side.  My friend is not into spicy food and I am, so I just added a ton to my guac on my plate.  Woo-hoo!  Service was just okay as were some of the appetizers we tried.  But I will definitely come here again for a cheap margarita and awesome chips and salsa.
