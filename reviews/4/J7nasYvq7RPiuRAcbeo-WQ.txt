It is really hard to find decent mexican food in the madison area.  We come here often as a family.  My four year old loves the taco and rice and beans kids meal, my 7 year old loves the half order of nachos, my husband loves the carne asada and I love the California Burrito withe steak.  The only reason they don't get five stars is that the service can be mediocre at times, and I refuse to give five stars to a restaurant that puts drippy nacho cheese on my burrito.  However, they are always willing to substitute real cheese for me at no extra charge.  So, if you go, and you want real cheese don't be afraid to ask!
