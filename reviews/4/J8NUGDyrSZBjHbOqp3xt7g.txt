The bf and I were looking for an after-show snack and found Diego.

We got their guacamole for 2, Diego Sampling (Braised Beef Taquitos, Crispy Braised Chicken Empanadas, and Chorizo Quesadilla with a Three Layer Dip) and the White Snow Crab Cocktail. The sampler was alright but could have done without. The guacamole was made fresh and at our table. the Crab cocktail came chilled and tasted great with the nacho chip. Both DELICIOUS!!

Service as great. The waiter & waitress were very friendly and recommended we try their churros for dessert. It came with 6 sticks of churros and 3 dips; Chocolate Morita Sauce, Raspberry and Caramelized Goat Milk. Yum yum!!
