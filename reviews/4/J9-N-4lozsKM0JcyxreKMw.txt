Very cool ambiance, we take office visitors to da Mucho all de time. Not many places you can hit during the day and hear a Band of Gypsies while you eat. I get the half-ass burrito, which is HUGE. A nice blend of rice, machaca, refried into beans. I can't even imagine how big the big-ass burritos is. Cool, attentive staff too.
