I love this place.  Not simply Chipotle, but this one.
The service is so good and it makes me feel so good to eat in there.
They actually seem to care about you here.  Something not always consistent with every location of this brand.  I always get the same thing when I go and never get bored of it.  They seem to recognize me when I go there which is often on a Saturday afternoon if I am in that area.  Such friendly people.
