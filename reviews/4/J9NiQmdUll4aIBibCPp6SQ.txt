Our lazy asses did not cook this Friday night, so we decided to Filibertos it!  We always call in our order (they need a cc # if the order is over $10).  It was 15 to 20 mins. we show up at the place for pick up.  They forgot to make our order.  They apologized and offered us free drinks.  We declined the free drinks but they offered again.  We declined and they told us the order will be done in a few mins.  They apologized again when we got our order.
