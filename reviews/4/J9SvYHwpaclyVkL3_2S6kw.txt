I have eaten here numerous times... Breakfast burrito, pork tacos and the Pork burrito... I am not a taco expert but i do like their tacos,, more than anywhere i have tried in the valley.. 1.75 a taco, extra for guac,, I definitely am a fan..  The breakfast burrito is good,, i get the chorizo, with bacon, eggs, rice and beans..  I eat one and i am full till supper..  The burritos are good too,, everything is made from scratch.. Definitely try this joint out... Their menu is expanding as weeks go by....  I think i will try an enchilada.. dont think i ever had one before... Corner of Craig and Lamb,,
