Finally went back to Chronic Taco, since my last experience was not so hot, I'd stayed away for a bit.

I'm so glad I went yesterday.  
The service has improved a LOT...very friendly employees, cracking jokes with me, and smiling.  The quality of the food was back up to par...I'm really happy.  I plan to go back again soon.
