Went here for my Birthday.  Really yum...great ambiance...the staff wore their authentic outfits ...I felt like I was in Mexico.  
The menu was huge and I didn't know what to choose.  I'm not a great fan of spicy things and I ordered this dish which they adjusted the spicyness for my taste buds.  
1- the margarita was delish!
2- everything was good.  
I should have more details but bottom line....JUST GO THERE and try something you have never had before.  You will enjoy the experience.
