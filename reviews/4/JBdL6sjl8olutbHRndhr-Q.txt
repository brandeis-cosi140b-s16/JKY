Oh Chipotle, what's not to love honestly?  Great quality ingredients that you can have thrown together in a completely customizable meal, it's hard to go wrong with that set up.  I managed to stop in at a rare time when they didn't have a huge line and made my way up to the counter.  The people behind the counter greeted me with a smile and a "hello" right away, and proceeded right away to get my order taken care of.  The girl who rang me up was very friendly too and even put a smiley face on my container!  Call me a sucker for the small stuff but I love things like that!
