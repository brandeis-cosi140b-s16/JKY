Every trip to Phoenix, we find ourselves at Ajo Al's. It's got somewhat of a nostalgia factor for my husband. In light of this, be forewarned that my rating might be inflated.

I always get the flauta dinner -chicken is better than beef, for sure- they are juicy and stuffed (no meat skimping here!) and well flavored. Beans and rice are pretty good too.

My biggest complaint would be in regards to the drink selection. Margaritas are plentiful and varied, but if you're not a tequila person (I'm not) you're pretty much  stuck with soda or beer. Eh. Wish they'd make mojitos or horchata or something.

Service is mediocre but usually not lacking, decor is a little random - don't come here if you want something "classy;" but with the right expectations and some fond memories, this place delivers.
