Full disclosure, I have not actually been in the El Burro establishment - I've only had food delivered to my desk at work. I can't comment on the appearance or state of the actual building.

I CAN say, though, that wooooow, these guys make big things! It's a silly line to type, I know, but for my most recent meal I just ordered one burrito that was about $6 or $7, and it was massive - as big as and maybe bigger than a Chipotle burrito. I didn't even eat dinner that day, I was still so full from lunch!

I'd ordered the shredded beef burrito and I really liked it; the rice had been mixed in with vegetables that had been marinated in a mildly flavored sauce, so it had the teeniest of spicy kicks. I'm not a big spice person but I thought it was reasonable and mild enough that I still enjoyed it. My only complaint is that whoever made the burrito did not evenly distribute the meat. I bit into one corner and thought, "Wow, I have a ton of shredded beef on this thing!" And I was in heaven - that tangy beef mixing with the slightly spicy rice and veggies? Awesome! Alas, 3/4 to the end of the burrito, the meat trail ended, and I only found a few wisps of beef at the very end. It was still delicious eating the rice and veggies, but I would've loved to have a more even distribution of meat in that burrito since the beef was easily the best part of the whole ensemble. 

Still, good food = I'm not going to gripe too much! Since people at work order here frequently I'm sure I'll have the chance to try more on this menu soon - if it's as good as the burrito was, I'm sure I won't have many complaints. I definitely recommend El Burro!
