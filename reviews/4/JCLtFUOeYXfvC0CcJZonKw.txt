The sweetie and I finally made it in to try some tacos.
First, let me say I'm a seasoned veteran when it comes to tortillas chips, and salsa. I found the chips excellent in consistency AND flavor. The salsa was mild - but very flavorful. I usually like my salsa with more heat,  but this salsa was pretty good.
My sweetie ordered a soft taco trio. I ordered chicken hard shell taco / with rice & beans. Sweetie loved her asada tacos. My chicken tacos were excellent,  and filling. The rice was flavorful,  as were the refried beans.
The service was very good. The seating is spacious. The prices were a tad more than Pepe 's, and Robertos,  but the food is a cut above and worth what you pay,  in my opinion. 
We liked this restuarant, and we will be returning.
