I ordered two fish tacos and a chorizo and egg burrito. The fish tacos were SO good. The downside is that they are served on one tortilla, so it got messy after a couple bites. Fresh veggies and great salsa verde. The burrito was a bit salty. The serving was way more than expected. I could have shared it and will been satisfied. Customer service was done all in Spanish. Once they realized I mostly speak English they switched it up no problem. Seating is at plastic covered tables and metal chairs. I'd come back again for the fish tacos.
