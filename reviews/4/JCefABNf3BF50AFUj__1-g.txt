Not Bad.....Not Bad At All

I was expecting Mi Pueblo Mexican Food to be the typical Mexican fast food. Boy was I wrong.  Mi Pueblo is a step above the rest.

Lets start with the complimentary hot chips and salsa. Many Mex style recipes give you those cheap paper thin tasteless chips but not Mi Pueblo. These chips are lighy, crispy, and flavorful and  salsas are really tasty.

On this visit I ordered the grilled chicken taco plate and I  not  disappointed. The chicken was moist, seasoned, and loaded with flavor. The chicken tacos came with a homemade "dressing" not sure what it was. All I know it was really good.

Even though I was completely full from.my meal I couldn't leave without trying dessert.  So I decided to try the  sopapillas which come drizzled with honey and powdered sugar and a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side, it was delicious.

Good food, inexpensive meals, and great customer.  I will be back.
