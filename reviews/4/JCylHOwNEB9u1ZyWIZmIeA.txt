I'm not going to lie, my first experience was not good but I am so glad I gave them a second shot. I didn't like their nachos(I'm from Texas so I put queso on my nachos, not shredded cheese). I came in again for taco Tuesday and I must say, these are some of the best tacos I've had in Charlotte. The portions are really good for the price. I come here anywhere from 2-3 a month.
