Don't be fooled by the (not-so-appealing) purple exterior and sign out front; this is a cool, stylish place inside with some quality food. I went for lunch and enjoyed the mole chicken enchiladas -- outstanding, though the portion was small for $9.99. Chips with fresh guacamole and salsas was a good choice; otherwise I probably would have been hungry after. It only came with a few chips (not enough), but they brought more as soon as we asked. A friend got the black bean sauce enchiladas (I think) and seemed happy; he said his tortilla soup was tasty but could have used some vegetables or something, because for most of it he was just spooning broth. He seemed a lot happier about the margarita; there are a lot of options for quality ones there. No problems with service. The place was empty at prime lunch time.
