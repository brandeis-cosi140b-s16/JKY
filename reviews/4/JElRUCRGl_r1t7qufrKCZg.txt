To my utter surprise, this place is fantastic. I'll be honest in the fact that these holes in the wall scare me a bit since I have no idea what to expect. I have driven by this seafood spot for a couple of years and always laughed at the name. Last night, I was in the mood for Mexican and the hubby in the mood for seafood and something healthy. I really wanted chips and guacamole, which by the looks of the menu, they do not sell. No matter as I am always a sucker for some ceviche. There were seafood dishes galore and prices ranging from inexpensive (my small shrimp ceviche $5) to mixed seafood dishes for $18. Some of the more expensive dishes are offered as a daily special which can save you a few bucks on certain days. 

Our food came with tostada shells and per my request, avocado on the side ($2). It was a small whole avocado cut in half so very fresh. My ceviche was awesome, especially with the avocado. My husband had a crabmeat tostada and I was amazed at the amount of crabmeat piled on the top. My husband felt there was a 1/4 pound of crab meat on that thing. The food felt and tasted very fresh, too. 

Again, this spot was great. I tried to drop subtle hints to go back tonight but the husband wasn't having it. Maybe I'll try again tomorrow or the next day, or the next day.....
