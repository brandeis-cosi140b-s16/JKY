The name of this place is a bit off putting but regardless the food is totally decent, if not good. My boyfriend and I had been craving tacos since we moved to AZ and have failed to find any really good places. We were told Chronic Taco was a good taco joint and stopped in last week. In all honesty it was pretty awesome. The interior was not exactly my style but I loved the food. The salsa was not very spicy but the chicken was tasty as were the re-fried beans. All in all it was not perfect but definitely good for a quick lunch or a late night stop. (And fortunately we did not run into the blond bimbos or drunken revelers that other reviewers mentioned.)
