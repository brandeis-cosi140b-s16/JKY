Thank you Amados for being opened 24hrs!  

Since I was visiting Arizona only for 5 days from Hawaii, I would be out really late partying with my friends until the wee hours of the morning.  Rather than going to a diner, spots like Amados is the perfect remedy for that late night hunger. 

Unlike Hawaii where Mexican restaurants charge 7-9 dollars for a carne asada burrito, Amados charges only 5 dollars for the burrito then another 1.50 for a drink.  Helllllla cheap compared to what I'm used to.  Not only that, they hook it up with mini-containers of hot sauce.

Of the 5 days in Arizona, I ate here 4 times.  Great food, great value, and the awesome convenience of being open 24hrs.  Winner!
