It's easy to drive by and not think twice about stopping. This little restaurant does not offer curb appeal. Tucked in a shopping strip, the main draw is the brightly colored sign offering $1 tacos on Tuesday and Wednesdays (in Spanish). However, thanks to Yelp and reviews (especially one from my personal friend, Julia S.) my husband and I took a chance and are so happy we did! 

The food is delicious! They have various offerings of Mexican, Colombian, or Honduran fare. Each day they have a lunch special for $6!! Everything is fresh, large portion, and friendly service. I got a huge bowl of soup, rice, salad, tostones, and carne asada (I was craving a bit of meat). Husband got a veggie burrito with rice, beans, and salad. Yummy!! Their salsa (red and green) is very fresh and flavorful too. They mainly speak Spanish, but you'll have no problem communicating what you'd like. They also have a little pastry section and small bar.

Go, you'll thank me...so will your taste buds and wallet!
