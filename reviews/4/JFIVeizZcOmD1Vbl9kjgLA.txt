Was craving a torta very badly and the only other place nearby I know that served them was Tortas Paquime, but was never really impressed with that place. So, I decided to give this place a try. El Tri definitely knows how to pack them! I ordered 2 Arizona's to go and a quesadilla with the words. Quesadilla was so large they had to put it in a pizza size box! Tortilla was handmade and warm. Pretty tasty! Tortas were huge, I only ate half of mine, but my husband was able to finish his entirely...although, he dropped into a food coma just seconds after polishing off the whole thing! Will definitely come back and try another one of their sure to be delicious tortas.
