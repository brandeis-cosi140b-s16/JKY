We followed our yelp lead to this awesome place! It is a great lunch place- fresh ingredients and the super low price point! The help was very friendly and despite our long wait we were glad we went! We even went back on taco Tuesday.  We're all tacos are $1 (in retrospect we would skip taco Tuesday as full price is only $1,50 and we wouldn't have to wait one hour for 4 tacos ... Nope I'm not kidding) this is a great place in Phoenix area!
