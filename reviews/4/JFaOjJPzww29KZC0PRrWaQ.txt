The beans and rice here is fantastic. The tacos? Not so much which is a shame because tacos + beans & rice is a fantastic meal. I don't know if the tacos are made the same, but the very last time I ordered them, they were no good. The taco grease destroyed the bottom of the taco making in inedible. My Nana and mom love the burritos, tamales, and the chips. Yummy. Good place to go but avoid the tacos.
