I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, but wow.  This place impressed me.

I tried two soft shell tacos with carne asada and carnitas and one hard shell taco with shredded beef.  The tortillas were big and fluffy (with a slightly crunchy shell) and the meats were quite tasty.  Maybe a little dry for some people, but that's okay for me.

Then I "rewarded" myself with a Churro.  Yum.  Looks like I'll have to give this place four stars...
