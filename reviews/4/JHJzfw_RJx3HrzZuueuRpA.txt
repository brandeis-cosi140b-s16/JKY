Happy to be one of the first yelpers to try this place because I enjoyed it and want a restaurant in my neighborhood to do well. The food is basic Mexican, but they do it well. You can tell they have experience from their previous location, as the service is efficient and friendly. The bar seems well stocked and prices are reasonable, so come on down for authentic Mexican in a nicer location than some places.
