If you're looking for a two-steps-up-from-a-hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant with delicious food, go to Los Olivos.  The food was DELICIOUS!!!  The atmosphere is great because it's very low key and exactly what it should be for what it is.  Yummy carne asada or floutas or enchiladas.  Very yummy!!!
