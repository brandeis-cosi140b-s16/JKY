I should have tried the Sunday brunch buffet months ago.  The offerings are spicier than their regular offerings.  I especially liked the chicken mole and the pozole.  They have lots of other things, including chile verde and some kind of stewed beef dish (I didn't ask because I'm allergic to beef).  And it's only $12 including a non-alcoholic beverage.
