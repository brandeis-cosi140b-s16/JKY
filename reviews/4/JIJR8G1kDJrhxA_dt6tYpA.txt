Nice new little Taco shop.  Has a cement bar with about 10 stools and a few stools in the window, so it is small.  Fast friendly service.
You can chose from a Carnitas, Pollo, Vegetarian,  Americano (just like your Madre made), and Carne Molida.  Tacos were $3.  We were in and out very quickly and really enjoyed our tacos. I had a carnitas and carne molida.  The carnes is a spicy beef but not real spicy and tasty with bell pepper, Mexican farmer cheese and cilantro.  If you are in the mood for a taco and on the Southside, give it a try.
