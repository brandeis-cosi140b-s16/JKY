I ordered a quick chicken burrito and they made it right in front of me. Chicken was fresh off the grill and tortilla was handmade right in front of me. we did half red sauce and half green.

Daiel was our prep guy and he went crazy on service building me the perfect burrito.  Stephanie at the register wss friendy.

first bite was hot and perfect amount of spice.  Hates off guys to a great meal! I will be back for sure. Jim
