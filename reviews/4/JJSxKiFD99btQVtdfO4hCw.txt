We stopped in here for Happy Hour on a Thursday and I am so glad that we did.  The place has a great vibe and even greater Happy Hour Specials.  The chips and salsa were on point and went perfectly with our margaritas.  I also had the Two Taco Platter.  I had both types of shrimp tacos- the Island Shrimp and the Diablo Shrimp.  Both were excellent, but I preferred the Island Shrimp.  The Diablo is advertised as hot, but it wasn't that bad.
