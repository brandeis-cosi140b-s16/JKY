I went here to celebrate my fathers birthday. It was a little creepy because it was the middle of the day on a Saturday during a football game, but the place was deserted. Once you got used to it though, I was very happy to be in such a peaceful place. Our waiter was very soft spoken and difficult to understand, as well as slow to refill water.
My aunt ordered a frozen cocktail, which she didn't seem to like very much.

The food was amazing. We ordered the fried shrimp appetizer and dip. The dip is what made the dish really interesting. It was really sweet at first, but after you swallow it got very spicy (I combo I very much enjoy)  I loved their chips (I ate almost a whole bowl) and ordered the Killer Chimichanga with shredded chicken. I went home craving more. The beans and rice were generic but still a little above my standards for something as simple as beans and rice. My father ordered the enchiladas, which he practically inhaled so they must have been fantastic. The deserts sounded amazing and I wish I had saved room to order one.

I will DEFINITELY be coming here again.
