Great lunch specials and daily $.99 items. Always a great meal. Love this and all Filiberto's but this one is walking distance from my place and is open 24 hours soooooo, yeah. What more could anyone really ask for? Typical food, you all know what their food is all about, but I really like this location. Not just because it's super close and I can get great Mexican food at any hour of the day, the inside is unique. They have a few fun games and a bigger than average seating area if you need a cheap, good place to eat at 3am! I love fresh Mexican food, especially late at night. Thank goodness we live in Arizona, and 3 minutes from this gem!
