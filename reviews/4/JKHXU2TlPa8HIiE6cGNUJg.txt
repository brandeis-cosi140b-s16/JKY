I love Carlos O'Briens, so happy to have a location on the west Side of town.  It was hard to find, the google map was confusing, I had to call to find out it was located in the sports complex.  However, the food was Excellent.  Atmosphere not very cozy like a restaurant, I expected a more traditional Mexican food setting, it is more modern and very basic.  The food is great, the service was good, I will go back, after all it's all about the food...
