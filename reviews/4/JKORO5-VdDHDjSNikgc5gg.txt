This location happens to be across the street from ASU so you can imagine how extremely busy it is...ALL THE TIME! The parking lot is way to0 small as well as the amount of seating. Given its busy-ness they might want to think about expanding to accommodate those that would like to eat "for here" rather than "to go." I also hate the chairs. Call me picky but the seat bottoms have a weird slant to them. Overall the whole arrangement in this store and actually all the stores isn't very appealing.

That out of the way...I am addicted to the Veggie Bowl: rice, blk beans, pico, corn, cheese, and avocado (ps. avocado is no charge with the veggie option). I love it, I love it. 

I haven't had any of the meat choices in quite some time since I discovered the veggie bowl.

This store is consistently good. Thank you!
