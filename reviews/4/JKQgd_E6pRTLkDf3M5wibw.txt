It's no secret that I really enjoy Chipotle. I love that guacamole is included with the veggie option and their salad dressing is amazing. I could eat it for days without getting sick of it.  Pretty disappointing that on my visit just now they were out of salad dressing... OUT?!  Did I mention they didn't tell me until I paid for my salad that they were out of the amazing salad dressing?? Argh. Double argh. They half-heartedly asked if I'd like to wait 15 mins for dressing, or have more salsa, or if I'd like to have them make me something else... I was in a rush to get to a movie, so I ate the salad without the amazing dressing. But what I really wanted was to go back 3 minutes in time and have the girl at the front of the line tell me they had no salad dressing the second I asked for a freaking salad.
