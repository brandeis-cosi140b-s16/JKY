Mexican style tacos, Tortas, and other Mexican fare but inside a chain restaurant. I love that you can get horchata and the guacamole is better than most Mexican traditional restaurants and I can't complain about the tacos...better than average. Salsa is pretty bomb (amazing!)! Would go there again but wish it was cheaper
