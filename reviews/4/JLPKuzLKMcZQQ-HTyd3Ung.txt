Am I really writing a review for Chipotle right now? Yupp! I've tasted the fruits of Chipotle all over the United States. I've seen a range in quality and service. You might catch them on a good day...you might catch them on a bad day. 

I came here the other week and I was quite impressed. I went with my usual burrito, except this time I was extremely hungry and  felt like I was up for a challenge. I loaded up on pretty much every add on they offered - the helpings were generous. I also went with double chicken. Make sure they scoop you're first serving of chicken before you ask for double meat. Don't let them compromise the size of each protein serving by speaking too soon. 

I was prepared for a challenge and I was ready to take that burrito down. However, I was concerned that who ever had to wrap my burrito wouldn't be prepared for a challenge of their own...resulting in my burrito quickly become a burrito bowl.

Boy was I surprised...the young lady's burrito wrapping skills were exceptional..!! This woman had the hands of an angel. It took a few extra pieces of aluminum foil, but she got the job done! I wish I could shake her fathers hand and say, "well done sir"!

I can't promise that you guys will run into the same angel next time you guys stop in for a burrito at this particular location. But you happen to be in the area on a Thursday around 1pm, make sure you stop in. You might hit the jackpot, as I did!
