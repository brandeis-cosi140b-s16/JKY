Came here on a friend's recommendation.  Definitely good, flavorful food.  Seems more mexican than korean fusion, but good nonetheless.  A true 3.5/5 in my book, but I will round up to a 4 since it was better than a 3.

The location sucks.  It is in an old part of town, near nothing else, but the food is worth it if you are around this part of town.

We tried the tacos and the fries platter, both with kim chi, and both were yummy.  

Overall it was good and I can see myself coming back again, just not running back anytime soon
