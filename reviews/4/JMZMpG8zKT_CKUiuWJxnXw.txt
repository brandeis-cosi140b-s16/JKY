After seeing a movie, we decided to check out Cantina 1511. We arrived around 6:15 on a Sunday night and were quoted a 10 minute wait so decided to hit the bar. We ordered two house margaritas which were awesome! We were paged after about 15 minutes and seated. Once we were seated we received chips and salsa and asked if we needed a drink refill, which we did. After reviewing the menu, we chose the pork tacos and chicken fajitas. While we waited we enjoyed the fresh chips and salsa, which had a kick, which I loved. The smell in the restaurant was great so we were anxious for our food to arrive. The pork tacos were amazing! The pork was moist, almost melt in your mouth and had chopped pineapples which added a great flavor. And, the fajitas, best I have had in a long time! Piping hot, great grilled veggies, and accompanied with warm tortillas and a great assortment of sour cream, cheese, guacamole, and a few other items. What a great experience and I look forward to getting back to this location!
