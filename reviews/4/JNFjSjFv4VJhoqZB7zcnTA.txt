When they say amigos, they arent kidding. friendly service. great veggie tacos and tasty veg burrito. When I asked if the beans were vegetarian they didnt look at me like i was from another planet (which i am incidently... Los Angeles, where Mexican food is never served with ground beef). And the answer was YES. correct!  

I have yet to try the margaritas, but the salsa was fresh, and the chips excellent. I cant speak for the meat dishes, but for veggie mexican food in the shampoo banana, it cant be beat.  I would say the food is on par with El Charro, but a little less greasy and with nicer atmosphere.  do it!
