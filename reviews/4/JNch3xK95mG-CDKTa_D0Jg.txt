Not the best service-

We were not greeted once were seated at out table or offered drinks till 10 minutes. I had to get the manager's attention, who could not find our waiter. The manager got our drinks and checked us out. 

Food-
Decent selection of salsas, however the hips would've been better if they were warm. Frijolles Charra were much spicier than indicted on the menu, so watch out. 

Atmosphere-
One OF THE BEST
