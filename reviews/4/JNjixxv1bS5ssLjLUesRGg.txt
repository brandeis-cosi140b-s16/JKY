Last night we had early evening dinner reservations for a party of six. By the time my wife and I got there (a little late due to rain), the others were already seated and had ordered some appetizers -- chips & salsa and traditional guacamole -- which were quite good. We had a smattering of margaritas, tequila flights, beer and the Ladies Best Friend, which my wife really enjoyed. The drinks were outstanding.

We were initially seated inside, but chose to switch to outside once the rain had completely passed and the tables and chairs were wiped dry. Five people had some sort of taco meal and I had steak Mesquite Fajitas. Everyone seemed to enjoy the tacos. The fajitas were not sizzling as one would normally expect. They were just okay.

Service at Wedge was exceptional! Although the interior was already crowded, our waitress was attentive inside and remained so once we moved outside.

I had not been particularly tempted to go to Wedge since tequila has traditionally upset my stomach. However, I did try some habanero tequila, which was very good -- with no bad effects!

We were celebrating a birthday and the birthday girl got a free tequila shot after dinner. Not bad.

All in all, we had a delightful evening and will surely return -- perhaps to try one of the many different dinner specials that Wedge has throughout the week.
