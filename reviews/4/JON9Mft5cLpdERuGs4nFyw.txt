I love the original location on Central Avenue, this location is alright (3.5). I've been here twice now, so this is a general review of both occasions. They get an extra star for the outdoor patio, as the other location only has 2 tables outside the front door. Margaritas on a warm sunny day? Patio is necessary for this! 

On my recent visit, Myself and two other ladies indulged in the dip trio of queso, pico, and guac, in addition to the salsas we had already been served. All of the dips were fresh tasting, especially the pico and guacamole which are two crucial elements to Mexican restaurants, I think!

House made margaritas, light and not overly sour, which I enjoy. Had two of these. 

The special of the day was fish tacos, served with black beans and rice, so I ordered these but I was underwhelmed. First of all, our server never brought up the special to begin with, so I had to ask him about them. All he told me was "they're good".  Your basic tilapia, fried, with a rather bland mango salsa and a streak of sour cream. Just wasn't mind blowing, and I don't think I'd order them again. They're better at making awesome enchiladas and street-style tacos. This said, my friend who ordered enchiladas was thoroughly pleased with her selection.

Service was not absolutely horrible, but our server certainly did not go out of his way to do well at his job. Never got a name, never came back to ask how everything was after we'd taken our first bites, left empty glasses and stacked plates on our table, and just generally lacked personality. Refills were hard to come by as well. 

I'll come back when I'm in the area but I hope service will be better.
