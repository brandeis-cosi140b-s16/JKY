This is a Scottsdale tourist experience, but it's a pretty good one.  Family owned.  Friendly enough, capable and fast service.  Not particularly personable.  Chips and salsa fresh and flavorful.  Mexican dishes are a notch above the usual for most American cities, but nothing imaginative or really special.  It's a good Mexican meal.
