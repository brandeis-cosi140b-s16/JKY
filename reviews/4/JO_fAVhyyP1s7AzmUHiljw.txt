Tipppp theeeee truckkkkk.....SHIT, wrong truck!

This is exactly what mobile(sorta?) food should be like. Hanshiktaco really has it right even if they don't really move. When I walked up I was instantly identified as a noob and given a free sample of a doughy sweet ball of deliciousness. I was then told about the entire menu and all of it seemed to make my stomach rumble and my mouth water.

After listening to everything they offered I decided to go with the beef taco and one of their Korean dogs. The taco could only be described as tangy and sweet with enough spice to knock you on your ass. If you love sweet and spicy this place is definitely for you. The Korean dog was just as good and the texture of both dishes were spot on. Just the right amount of crunch to go with the soft, succulent beef.

Don't let the confusing prices fool you, after tax everything comes out to a round number. The atmosphere at this truck was pretty cool seeing as the staff was super helpful and the classic rock tunes were plentiful. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu, what are you waiting for?
