Nice little hole in the wall with simple & fresh Mexican food.

There's a full bar and happy hour from 4-7 everyday!  I'll admit, the shopping center this place is in may put you off... don't be scared.  The restaurant is a bit dated... continue not being scared.  Total comfort food awaits for those not easily deterred.
