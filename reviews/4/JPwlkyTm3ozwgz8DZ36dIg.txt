We stopped in for dinner last week after receiving a tip to check it out for authentic Mexican food.  The parking lot was full, so that was a good sign.  We were warmly greeted and immediately seated.  Beware...the salsa is homemade and seriously spicy - very tasty, but dangerously hot.  We both tried enchilada combo plates and they were quite tasty.  The shredded beef taco was not our favorite, but the rice, beans and enchiladas made up for it.  Definitely a go to for authentic, tasty Mexican food!
