Since my boyfriend and I play a little bit at Station Casino's, Sunset Station, we each received a $10 food and beverage credit in the mail. Being we had recently visited their cafe, we opted to try their Cabo Mexican Restaurant. 

We made our reservations through Open Table, although we really didn't really need them. The restaurant had a nice crowd but due to the large size of the dining room, everyone was pretty well spread out and there were still ample seats left.

To start I ordered a margarita and we were brought bean dip, mild salsa and warm tortilla chips. Margarita, two thumbs up! It came in a huge glass and the tequila/mix melody was absolutely perfect. The tortilla chips tasted homemade and of the two dips, the bean dip was hands down was my favorite. Our server was kind enough to let us know about the salsa bar which we could help ourselves to if we needed any more chips or salsa. At the salsa bar there was about 10 more options for salsas! They have so many options, it's hard to choose! We were so happy not to get an appetizer because we filled up on all the chips and salsa!

For my meal I opted for the pick 2 combo of a tamale and tostadas. The tamale was decent as were the tostadas. The beans were the same that we had with the chips from earlier so I was a bit tired of them by the time dinner came around so I passed on those. 

Overall for a Mexican restaurant, it wasn't bad!  If you're in the area and looking for a nice, clean Mexican cuisine, definitely check them out, it's worth the visit!
