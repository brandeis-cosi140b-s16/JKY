Baja fresh is pretty freakin fresh.

I love their "no freezer, no MSG, no preservatives, no nuthin crappy" vibe, which they reinforce with signage plastered around the restaurant.

The food is delish. Lots of good options for meat-eaters & veggie-heads. They do it right with a delicious salsa bar that containis at least 5 different salsas, fresh limes and they've got a good selection of iced teas.
