I have recently fallen in love with the vegetarian crunchy tacos! This location serves them up pretty well with generous portions of peppers and onions, corn, sour cream, and lettuce. 

I work in the area and my lunch break is usually slightly after the lunch rush so when I visit this location they always seem to be winding down from the busy lunch rush, which means I often have to wait while the employee does something else. Sometimes the "assembly line" doesn't move as efficiently as possible...but the place is always clean and the food is always fresh.

I don't know if you know this, but Chipotle serves Mexican and some Domestic beer and margaritas! I didn't have one this time because I was on my lunch break...but from previous experience, the margaritas are pretty good and really strong. Definitely try one some time!
