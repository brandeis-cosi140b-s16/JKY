It's Del Taco - I expect dirty, delicious tacos, fries that I'm certain are clogging arteries and cheesecake bites that melt in the mouth.  I got exactly what I expected.  

Store was clean, cashier was friendly and the food was served up quick.  It's definitely a step up from Taco Hell.  If you go in expecting anything other than the afore mentioned things, you'll be disappointed.  If you order something other than tacos from a place called "Del Taco," you'll also be disappointed.  

Overall: A-  
The location is a bit off the beaten path of places to go, but it's clean, staff is friendly and sometimes you just want a dirty taco and fries!
