Yaaaay! Mexican food a less than a minute drive from my house that isn't Taco Bell! =] 
My brother lives in Tucson, so when he came up for student holiday last time, he went to Mi Familia. He really, really liked it. Which is a lot to say since my brother is picky about his Mexican food. 
I was personally tired of Filiberto's and Taco Bell makes me queasy, so I stopped in to Mi Familia. I love this place =] It's cute and close to home, and is family-owned! 
What better way to support our neighborhood than eat at a family owned business to keep them going and to stop the chains from taking over? I like the burritos and the salsa bar, and will definitely be taking my friends in soon! =]
