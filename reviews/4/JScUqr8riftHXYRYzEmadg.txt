I'm worried for this little place that is filled with so many heavenly things.  It is located in the very back of a strip mall littered with furniture stores going out of business.  Go eat @ Don Rafa's.  Everything that we have had is amazing.  The red salsa and guacamole are a little weird but they have a green salsa that is so spicy and accompanies any main entree perfectly.  The staff is totally endearing.  Nothing cookie cutter about this restaurant.  Fresh corn tortillas made on site.  It's delish.  Don Rafa burrito is filled with tender carne and spicy chile's.  Super Sope Pancho is large and in charge.  My husbands favorite.  The taco's are great, the flautas are great, the chips are great, the rice tastes like your great aunts rice (the one you totally love to go home for) Go to Don Rafa.  It won't disappoint.
