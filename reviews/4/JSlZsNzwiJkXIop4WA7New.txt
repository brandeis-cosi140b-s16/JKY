David's is a really great place to grab a burger! It's a small shop with a 50's feel to it. They also offer shakes/malts, Mexican food, and breakfast (all day). I managed the Texas Burger, Amy enjoyed a David's Original - both were perfect. They could spend a few bucks on updating the sparse decor... but it's still cute and one of the best damn deals for your dollar in Scottsdale. I am planning to return soon to sample breakfast.
