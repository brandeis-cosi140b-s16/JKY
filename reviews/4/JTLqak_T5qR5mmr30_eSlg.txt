The menudo is the best! Beans are delicious and the food never changes. 

Here are the reasons I didn't give 5 stars. 

The restaurant itself is not in very good condition, it's defiantly a dive but overall I don't mind. 

They don't actually serve breakfast potatoes they serve French fries. Yes, I know they are both potatoes but it's just weird to me. A Mexican restaurant should serve Mexican style papas for breakfast not French fries. 

They only accept cash. 

Other than that this place is a regular stop for Sunday morning breakfast!
