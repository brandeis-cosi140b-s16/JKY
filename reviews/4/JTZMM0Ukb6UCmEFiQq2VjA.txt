I LOVE this place. A friend of mine took me here a year ago, with a promise of the best sweet tea I've ever had in a restaurant. This wound up being 90% true. lol All in all, nice staff that isn't annoying. They explain the menu pretty well, and don't rush you through your meal. I try something different every time I go (every 2 months or so), and haven't had a bad meal yet. I try and bring a new friend every time I go, and they all go back, even without me. So yeah. lol Good food, fast service, comfortable space, EXTREMELY REASONABLE PRICES. It's right next door to Punta Cana, and I've had both, I prefer Maria's.
