Love the gecko grill! I've been here a few times and have loved everything I've tried. Their menu offers the mexican food basics but does them without the excess lard/oil. Their cheese bean dip is out of this world delicious! I have friends from out of town that wish they could bottle it up and take it home! The only missing feature is alcohol! That said, we always see lots of families bring their kids here... so its great for that!
