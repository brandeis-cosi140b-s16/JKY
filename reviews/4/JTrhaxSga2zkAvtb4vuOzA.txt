Updated look!  Food is awesome. Give them a try if you haven't already. They installed an ice tea dispenser!  Service is good. Food is very tasty and good sized portions. Price is right! Two cheese enchilada, beans, rice, small side salad for less than six bucks. You can't beat that!!! 

I love seeing this place busier and busier each week.
