Busy, but the line moves fast. That seems to be a standard at Chipotle. However, I have to admit I love the food. I have never had a bad burrito/bowl and, it is always fresh. The amount of food is enough to fill you up with out the chips, but I always have to order them. There is something about the chips... a hint of lime, I think. The staff is very knowledgable and will answer all your questions.
