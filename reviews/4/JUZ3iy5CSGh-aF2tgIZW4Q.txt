Good quality fast food Mexican lunch for a reasonable price. It's consistent and it's clean. I like that they have gone green with real plates, silverware and glasses. Free chips and salsa when you dine in. The salsa is actually hot sauce and I like it.  I had the No. 1 combo which is a taco, cheese enchilada, rice and beans. It's served very hot, meaning right out of the kitchen 

It's not a fancy restaurant, but it's 10 notches above a Taco Bell.
