Love this place! This new restaurant is set in a Spanish villa and has a fun and classy ambiance! There is a huge patio complete with small firepits and an outdoor bar.  There is plenty of parking available as well. 
The menu is Tex-Mex. There are plenty of delicious vegetarian options. Everything is reasonably priced, and the food is delicious. Would DEFINITELY recommend the Calamari as a starter. This is probably one of the best versions of calamari I have ever had. The guacamole, salsa, and cheese are pretty good, not the best. The tacos are delicious!
They serve beer, wine, and cocktails. They have a very creative and interesting cocktail list. 
Great ambiance, delicious food, great drinks, and reasonable pricing. I will definitely be back!!
