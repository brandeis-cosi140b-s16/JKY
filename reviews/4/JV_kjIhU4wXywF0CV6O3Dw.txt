I'm a big fan of Del Taco in general, and more specifically, this location. I come here often - and have done so of a long time.  O have nothing but good things to say - In my opinion, it's one of the two best Del Taco stores in Vegas.  The food is always superior to the other locations, and the staff is always friendly and professional.... even at 2 am!
