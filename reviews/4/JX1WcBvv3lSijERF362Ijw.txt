Went in at 4:30pm on a Saturday and no wait in line. I was already excited cause the chicken burrito cost a few cents less than my usual Chipotle location back in MA.
Staff here was super friendly and they put generous portions. Chicken could've been cooked longer cause it was a little more chewy than in previous burritos I've had from Chipotle - and I've sure had plenty - but it was still good nonetheless.
