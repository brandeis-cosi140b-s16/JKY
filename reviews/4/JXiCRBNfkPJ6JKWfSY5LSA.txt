Stopped for quick food on the way to the Hoover Dam from LV.  

It's new and very clean inside.  

Got the Big Burrito Especial.  For $8.41 I got a soda and big burrito that was excellent.  The regular salsa was good, especially with a bunch of the chopped onion/cilantro mixed in.

Sadly I checked the website when I got back to VA today and the closest location is 1,725 miles away in Aurora, CO.  Luckily I found out that I can save 3 hours by taking I-64W from Lexington, VA instead of just I-81.
