I took a chance and stopped for lunch. I had two tacos and a cheese enchilada.  Service was perfect. The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because I am a bit of a salsa snob. While good, this food deserves a better salsa. I highly recommend stopping in for lunch. Nice authentic tacos and enchilada sauce.
