i keep going here. i don't really know why. i think maybe they're using an addictive chemical that makes me crave it fortnightly!

better than the one on university.  delicious salty chips and 2 different salsas. giganto sodas.  average tacos (the chips and salsa make up for it).

probably will go there tomorrow.
