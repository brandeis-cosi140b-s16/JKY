For years now it's been my favorite Mexican restaurant. We ate there this last week and were a little disappointed. I still think it's a good place, but the food was a little on the bland side. 

I'm hoping this was just due to a different cook during the holidays. 

Anyone else experience this?.

Eaten there a few times in the last few weeks. Everything seems to be back up to the quality I'm used to.
