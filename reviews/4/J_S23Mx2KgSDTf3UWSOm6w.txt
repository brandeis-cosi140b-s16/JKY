I keep going here.  A recent take-out discover were the tripa tacos (like little rigatoni tubes crispily fried - - but actually made of belly meat) - - truly a FUN food - - and really tasty.

Tonight sat down and had the Lomo Taco plate.   Very satisfying beans/rice/guac and tenderloin tacos with fragrant corn shells.  They have cut the number of salsas to four - - all of which are fantastic, particularly on the excellent chips (are they Milagro corn chip bits?).

In any case,  great food;   wonderful service (it has changed from trying hard, to wonderful);   and wild atmosphere (bright colors contrasting with sterile feng shui;   blaring TV - - some might not enjoy - -  with GREAT mtv-type blaring brass-band norteno music  - - LOVED IT!).

This place remains an otherworldly delight, that gets better all the time.
