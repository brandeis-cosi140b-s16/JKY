Walked into the bar first and almost left, too small and smoky of course.
Fortunately Desnudo is next door and smoke free.

Small menu but a great food and a great deal for the prices.  Had ceviche, flank steak tacos, fish taco, and chicken taco.  Every item was delicious.  Ceviche seasoned perfectly, steak tacos melt in your mouth, not chewy.

2 cons: No salsa and chips when you're seated.  And the two salsas that arrive with food are tasty but no spice.  They may have some tapatio or cholula in the back but I didn't ask.  Next time I will.

Great service.
