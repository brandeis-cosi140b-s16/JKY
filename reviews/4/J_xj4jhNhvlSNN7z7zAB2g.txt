Our first visit was a pleasant surprise. Very friendly service. The food had good flavor, and the shrimp was cooked to perfection. Vegetables were not over-cooked which was a huge plus. Generous portions. We did have quite a wait however, but the restaurant was full of other hungry patrons. I wish they had more salad choices. We will definitely be back to try more.
