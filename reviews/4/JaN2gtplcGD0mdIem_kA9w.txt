I know there are a lot of negative reviews of this place, in mid December I stopped in and tried both chipotle and honey tacos. I only really remember the honey tacos being decent. Today I tried it again, this time however the steak burrito was the 5.25 special. A couple notes-

The special is not just lunch but all day.

Also the burrito wrap can be substituted for a bowl which they fill with your choice of  types of beans, rices, salsa and guac ( I presume they would put guac on it if you asked) tomatoes and onions sour cream.

I recommend going in to pick your favs before trying delivery, that being said I was there at 7:30 pm and they have two drivers so there is an attempt to make the delivery service better.

This is point where I have to say the steak bowl was very good! I chose Spanish rice, black beans and the standard veggies with cheese and sour cream, the portion was plenty and the ratios of components was well done, 

I recommend going in for your first time to see the options first hand, for me giving it a second chance was worth while.
