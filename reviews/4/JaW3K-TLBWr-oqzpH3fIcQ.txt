Located at Blakeney Crossing, across Rea from the big Blakeney shopping center, I enjoyed my first meal at Salsarita's (I am beginning to think I am Yelp-stalking Candyce B. - I keep checking out places on my side of town that she has reviewed).

Nice sized place without being too big, but another LOUD stop because of the uncarpeted floors and the exposed ceiling.  On a Thursday around 5:45, it was busy without being packed.  Parents with screaming crumb snatchers in tow were streaming in.  A nice size seating area with booths and tables/chairs, with a couple of high top tables.  They also had an outdoor seating area, but it was a little too windy/cloudy this evening to enjoy that.  Salsarita's is another Chipotle/Qdoba/Moe's place where you walk down the line adding ingredients to your bowl/burrito/quesadilla/taco.  

The food:
A small steak burrito:  Their small is pretty large to me, if I had gotten the large I would not have been able to finish it.  I had a steamed tortilla stuffed with steak, beans, rice, sour cream, lettuce and cheese.  They had many ingredients and several types of protein including chicken, ground beef, shredded brisket and shrimp.  Several kinds of salsa.  Flavored sour cream, onions - lots of choices.  I found everything to be well flavored and fresh tasting - no brown lettuce in my burrito.
Chips and queso - Warm crispy white tortilla chips with white queso.  Mild, creamy and yummy.  
And my favorite - a Coke Freestyle machine (YAY COKE!), so I had a cherry Seagram's ginger ale - yummy!

Because they have started the countdown to Cinco de Mayo, the chips and queso were free (YAY!).  Friendly employees, clean restaurant, tasty food - I will definitely be back.
