Went there for dinner.  Good service, very good food, nice decor.  Had sangria, guacamole, and entrees were NY steak (special of the day) and sea bass.  Both were very good.  Would have been 5-stars, but I was hoping for a more inventive menu.  I thought I would see a dish that I have not had before, but I did not.
