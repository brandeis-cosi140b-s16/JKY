I have been going to Mad Mex ever since I was a kid and it is still as great as it was back then.  If you are looking for a great margarita this is the place to be with Mad Mex's Big Azz Margaritas.  Amazing deal for half off margs between 9-11pm in various flavors either frozen or on the rocks.  They have a special flavor that changes every month as well.  The food is equally as great, I especially LOVE their burritos.  Students get 1/2 off Mon-Thurs 2-4pm, which is totally worth it ($4.5 dollars for a HUGE burrito!). Be sure to get the bean dip because it is life-changing!!  Be careful when paying with a credit card though, I have had multiple friends have the wrong amount charged to their cards.
