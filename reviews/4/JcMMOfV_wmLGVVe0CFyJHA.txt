Had a great lunch here yesterday.  I judge a Mexican restaurant by their margaritas and their Chile Relleno.  Well, they don't serve Relleno, but the margaritas were fabulous.  Fresh mix, not that nasty sweet and sour, could have been a bit bigger but for $6.75, who cares.  I had the oyster appetizer and Tortilla soup.  Both were fabulous.  Hubby had chicken soft tacos, served with lots of fresh spinach, very good.  Very good service, but the place was pretty empty, we were there at 11 on a Saturday.

We'll be back.
