Nice upscale modern atmosphere. The menu is not your standard Mexican fare. Unique dishes. Good Service. They make their Guacamole fresh at your table and it is very tasty. The Chips comes with 2 salsas, a first roasted and roasted tomatillo. The Fire Roasted is really good, but the roasted Tomatillo is served warm and is definitely an acquired taste. I had a Spinach Enchilada that came with seasoned snap peas and rice. Overall a great dining experience. I would recommend that you try it for yourself and not be deterred by some of the negative reviews on here. After all, if you want Mexican that is standard there are many other places for that in the valley. The food here is definitely gourmet and the quality of the fresh ingredients used is excellent.
