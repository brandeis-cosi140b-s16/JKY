I had some of the best Ahi tuna I have experience in a long time. Rare actually did mean rare, I am glad to see that their cooks have been trained in the are of tuna searing. 

The tamari tuna is basically a sesame crusted seared tuna on a bed of rice and veggies with a great Chile sauce, think of it as an upscale jap-mex fusion.  The tuna itself was of a very high grade, sliced thinly and a dark ruby red. It was tender and lacked the sinuous bits cheaper ahi can have. The flavor was fresh and well accompanied by the tamari crusted sesame seeds. 

I also had a small salad with their sesamee ginger dressing, which is so good that  I would order in cocktails if it were not frowned upon. 

There was also a copious amount of corn bread so I could get my south western starch fix.
