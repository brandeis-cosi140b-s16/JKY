Been here several times. Hasn't let me down yet. It's easily accessible off Boulder Highway and is open 24/7. This is one of my preferred spots to redeem the BOGO coupon for the Double Del Cheeseburger, $3.00 each, and I don't recall having any issues. They also aren't upselling jerks who pester you about trying a new item or asking 3 times whether you're sure that you've concluded your order.
