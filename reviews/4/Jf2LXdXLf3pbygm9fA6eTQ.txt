How to enjoy dinner at Verde:
1) Make a reservation
2) Be prepared for the noise level
3) Try a flight of the many tequilas or mezcals

Verde is trying hard to be the hip new restaurant, and why not? When your location is next to Salt, you have to be competitive.  At 7:30PM on a Friday, the bar was still packed with leftover happy-hourers and other pre-dinner drinkers.  Their drink menu is extensive, with something to satisfy everyone.

I liked their basic, one page menu.  The fewer the items, usually the better they are, as was Verde's case.  I got the veggie enchiladas, which were vegan (! soy cheese).  This cheese-less wonder really allowed the flavors of the shrooms to come through.  

I had the red Sangria, which contained one piece of apple and tasted like a chilled red wine, with only a slightly fruity taste.  I like my Sangria with more of a kick, but it was a generous serving.

As many other reviewers said, the service is spotty.  My drink took a long time to come out, and our waiter disappeared after our food was served.  I'll chalk it up to a busy night and let it slide...this time.
