LOCATION: 4 Stars.  Kinda weird,  at the North-most parking / building of the World Market Design Center.  Valet Parking.. Nice, and yes as a Vegas local, I "expect" valet parking everywhere!!  
SMITH CENTER DINING MADE EASY: 5 Stars, it's just across the street.
ATMOSPHERE: 5 Stars-  I want to move in and live inside this place forever! 
SERVICE: 4 Stars. We had a main waiter and his assistant.
DRINKS: 5 Stars- First is first, we had to order a Sangria and a Margarita.  Ahhhh.
My Sangria was sooo  good, I was forced to order another :0p.  
PRICE, I don't remember, but they were worth whatever I paid......  When I move in I can hit the happy hour every day....  (Deciding where to put the sofa in my fantasy right now)
FOOD: 4 Stars, and oh So yummy. Our dinner started with warm chips and salsa brought out to greet us. I had so many sides I wanted to try that I could not decide on an Entrée nor did I want to fill up from a main dish. 
So,first we ordered fresh Guacamole that was even better than mine, probably because I didn't have to make it.   Then on to Chicken Tortilla soup with attractive presentation and taste that did not disappoint. This thick, rich soup had many different flavors blended perfectly without any one flavor being over-bearing. I had read reviews on Yelp that said "you must eat the Mexican style street corn" so we did.  All I can say is the same, "you MUST eat this corn"-with chile arbol, cotija cheese, citrus + cilantro .  MORE MUST: Mexican risotto : -with chile poblano, corn, & cilantro,  AND  Sautéed Spinach:- with charred onions + jalapeños. The soup and sharing of the sides filled us up 'just right' before heading over to the Smith Center Opera night.
I will definitely keep this restaurant on my "Let's go back" list.
