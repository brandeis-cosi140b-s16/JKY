This is our local neighborhood go to place.   Its fast food, take out folks, not A fancy sit down with margaritas. So don't whine when you don't have table cloths and waiters in tuxedos.   The place is  sparkling clean.   Fast take out with big portions.  Yummy, really good fresh food.  Ten years and never an issue.  Tacos, Burritos and combo plates.   We have had it all. My favorite is the californina carne asada.  Make sure you get guac and carrots on the side.   If you have never ordered the pickled carrots and jalapenos then you are really missing the boat!!  Prices are good considering what you get. You can find cheaper but can deal with what comes with it.  Also their breakfast burritos are a great early start for weekends.
