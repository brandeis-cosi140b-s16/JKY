Jimena was one of the best servers I've had in quite some time! Hope you get in her section!

We had great service and great food at a very reasonable price. I had a fajita skillet dish with steak, shrimp and chicken. My boyfriend had the enchiladas. Both were delicious!

Also, if you out order a large margarita, be prepared for a LARGE margarita! Not complaining, it was a delicious surprise!
