Love this place! Really good, fresh, authentic "fast" Mexican food. It is not the usual "bertos" type Mexican food or Globe-style (cheese, sour cream, fried), which might explain the bad reviews here. But, if you like fresh sort-of-light Mexican food, this is one of the best options in the East Valley. We really love the salsa.
