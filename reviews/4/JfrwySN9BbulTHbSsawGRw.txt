Anyone living in AJ knows that they are going to have to go elsewhere for a decent dinner out.   This place is a little casual, but they have the very good Mexican food.  Freshly prepared, defiantly the real deal.  Delicious!  Very friendly people and the prices extremely reasonable.  Finally a restaurant in AJ that's NOT embarrassingly bad!
