I am a huge fan of Julio's! Their menu alone puts Taco Bell and DelTaco to shame. With a wide variety of items to choose from, including dishes with shrimp and fish, it is hard to NOT to find something to eat. What I love most about this place is that it is open 24 hours. The staff is ALWAYS friendly and has even cut me some slack on occasions when I placed the wrong order--they were kind and even made me an entire new plate. Also, the portions are quite large, I often can split a meal with a friend if we're not super hungry. You can also dine in at Julio's. They have a clean inside environment with plenty of booths and tables. 
I recommend the Chimichanga--chicken or steak, or the Carne Asada burritos.
