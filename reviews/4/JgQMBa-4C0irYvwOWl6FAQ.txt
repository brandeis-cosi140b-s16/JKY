Just to start out don't even believe a word from Don S. review, he's so full of it his eyes are brown.  And what does someone from the left coast know about mex. food!  He probabably thinks Chi Chis is the bomb or tres margaritas or some other chain.  Also who would buy 2 tacos and not take advantage of the 3 for 5.00 deal?  He probably shops for groceries when he's hungry!  Well anyway, I eat at the 2 hip. at 7th, and dunlap.  Order the carne asada taco and a coke.  Dump abunch of the mild red sauce on it and take a big bite, its not you average tasting taco but I have been there many times  and I like it.  Oh by the way anyone that knows anything about carne asada it can be a little chewy, its hard to trim and I don't make a big deal about.  And thats The Truth.
