I've been here a few times for brunch and I've found it's kind of hard to go wrong. There is never a wait, you can pick if you want to sit inside or out, and there is usually a pretty fun crowd at all the tables. 

I've tried the breakfast burrito which is my favorite, it's hearty without being too gooey or stuffed. It's definitely a big meal, so expect to walk away full and ready for a nap. I've also tried the Doctor's Ordered eggs dish (which surprisingly flavorful for something that is considered healthy) and the Huevos Rancheros (which is good but too heavy for me). 

A few tips about this place: 
* Get a side of the potatoes, even if it doesn't come with your meal. They are SO good! 
* As always, I like to start my brunch off with an appetizer of a pancake (because I'm a fatkid) but theirs is not listed on the menu...just ask for it if you want one or an entire order. 
* This is going to sound weird, but they have great toast. The bread they use is thick cut and delicious...plus they have good jam options at the table. 
* The service is kind of hit or miss. I've had great waiters (he made me a tinfoil rose) and totally crappy ones (took our order, had someone else deliver the food, and then didn't come to check on us at all...as in we had to get up and go ask other servers for help), just giving you a heads up.
