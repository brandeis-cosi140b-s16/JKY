I love this place! Great food Mexican and American. Very good breakfast menu too. Staff are super friendly and go above and beyond to make your dining experience great! Place is always packed, chips and salsa to start you off. Me and my family will continue going and recommend this restraunt to others. Fajitas are also super good!
