This place is a dive, the interior & exterior is dying for an update, it's surrounded by an eyesore of buildings... But I'm here for the food though! The food is legit, don't let everything else fool u. I'm Mexican, my mom is a caterer & I love exploring in different eateries. If u want good food, great prices & love alcohol this is the place!

My review is solely on the good food & service & nothing else. If u r looking for ambiance & something fancy this is not the place.
