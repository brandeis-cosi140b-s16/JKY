Chile Relleno burrito was good all ingredients seemed fresh. Moving just a few days ago from San Diego, I wasn't sure what the Mexican food would be like here in Henderson so I did my research and went in curious to see for myself. I ordered the chile relleno burrito and a tamale/cheese enchilada plate just in case I didn't like the burrito. Well, I ate the burrito which was good and tried the tamale and enchilada which were OK but probably will stick to the burrito for now.
