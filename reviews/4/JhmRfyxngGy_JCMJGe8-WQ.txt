Totally random stop for lunch in some area of town that I had never been before, but it does appear to be in the lower income part of Phoenix. Located in shady strip mall, I chose the random mexican over the random Chinese next door. It turned out to be an excellent decision. The food consumed here was a simple chicken burrito, which was $4.25 plus I added rice for an extra 75 cents. The chicken was cooked nicely, shredded and all white meat (rare for divey Mexican) and packed into a large burrito with the rice, beans (refried), cilantro and onions. A decent salsa bar was also available and the red sauce had a smoky flavor and the green wasn't watery either, but more a guac sauce. Cucumbers, carrots and shredded cabbage also on hand if desired. Some of my best burros in life have come from the worst looking places and areas and El Nuevo Taquito comes through in that respect. Mexican music playing in the background is also always a comforting sign.
