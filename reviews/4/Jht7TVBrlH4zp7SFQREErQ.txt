First time here for dinner tonight. Nice little place off Harris Blvd. The shame is that i have lived 2 blocks away for 5 years and just now tried it. It was really good. Wish  I had tried it sooner. 

I had the Maya combo. It was giant. The waiter should have warned me. Not complaining really. As i said it was really good. But it was so huge i was almost embarrassed to have it sitting in front of me all by myself. I took a big box of leftovers home. A great value in the end.
