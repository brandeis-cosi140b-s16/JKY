I am so glad I found this place because I have been a fan of their restaurants in Tucson, AZ.  I had the chicken tacos which were good and the charro beans were excellent too.  Not too much bad to say about this place...the food is great and it is right near work so a good place to go.

You wont find great service here but the food out weighs that expereince by far.
