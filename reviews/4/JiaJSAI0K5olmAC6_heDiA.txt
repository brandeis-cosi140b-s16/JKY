Wish we would have gone on a night where they had live music! It would have topped off my experience! Food was delicious, absolutely no complaints! They have really great priced drinks, and I'd recommend trying the sangria with white wine! The Pan Con Bistec is what I ordered for food and it was soooo good! Will definitely be going back to try out their happy hour and hopefully listen in on some live music!
