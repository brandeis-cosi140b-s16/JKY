This place is great for a better taste of Mexican fast food. The three rolled tacos with guacamole are great. The salsa bar is wonderful with the marinated onions and carrots. My Mom and brother have had the dinner menu which are a great quality when you want dinner quality fast food. There is no drive through at this 24 hour location. Enjoy!
