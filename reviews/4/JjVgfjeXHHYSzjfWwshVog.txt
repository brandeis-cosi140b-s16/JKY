This is one of the best mexican restaurants in the valley. Although it isn't exactly authentic flavors, the food is delicious and cheap. I especially like their mango salsa tacos (I can't remember what they're called).

The chips and salsa come free here and are excellent. The green salsa and beans are especially good although they charge for extra beans.

This is a great place for smaller groups but large groups will want to stay away because it is a small restaurant and you'll end up waiting forever to be seated.
