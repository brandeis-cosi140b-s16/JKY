I give it a 4 star because I compare it to it's competition.  I am not putting it up against an Abuelos or some fancy sit down kind of place.  I am comparing it to Filibertos or Amados or that kind of place.  

I am big on breakfast burritos and they have my favorite.  I don't really venture off that section of the menu.
