I've stopped in here a couple of times, late at night. Great late night happy hour from 11pm - 2am. The Tijuana street tacos...so much food for $5 happy hour price. And they are really good. Order the habanero salsa, I dare you! This has become my favorite late night, close to home hang. Awesome bartenders with great personalities.
