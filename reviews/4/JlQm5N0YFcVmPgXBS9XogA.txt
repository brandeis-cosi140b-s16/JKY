Things I love about Chipotle:

-The menu is simple, but you still have the option to vary it up by trying different combinations of ingredients, salsas, and preparations. 
-The barbacoa beef and carnitas are super tender and flavorful. 
-The chili-corn salsa gives everything a spicy kick and a satisfying crunch. 
-They have margaritas, which I haven't tried because I see this place as more of a lunch spot but still seem nice to have as an option. 
-The prices are relatively low given the overall quality and portion size.
-The meat is humanely raised and the overall vibe of the restaurant communicates a sense of social awareness. 

Things I don't love about Chipotle:

-The chicken is a little bit fatty and not as flavorful as the red meat and pork options, which is disappointing since I'm trying to limit my red meat consumption.
-The peppers and onions that come when you get a fajita option are usually kind of soggy and flavorless. 
-The vegetarian options aren't great, and it seems odd that they haven't introduced something more substantial (e.g., mushrooms or tofu) than peppers and onions for people who want to avoid meat.
