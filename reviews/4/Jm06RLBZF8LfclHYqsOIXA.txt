My wife and I went here for lunch a few days ago.  I tried to be super smart and healthy and ordered the Chipotle Ranch salad, but it was probably more of a calorie bomb than the tacos.  Anyway, it was pretty tasty and of a decent size.  I'm not sure I like a mound of guacamole and full size tortilla chips (not strips) in my salad, but it was good nonetheless.  I would like to return to try their tacos.

Their chips were good and fresh but their 4 or so salsas were just ok.  None really stood out to me in terms of flavor or heat.

The only thing that really stood out about this place was the service.  The staff here really went out of their way to be super nice and friendly which is rare for a fast food type place.
