Hold on...wait a minute: Is that a 24 HOUR DRIVE THRU I see?! *Thinking* Oh yeah, definitely gonna try this place. I know, a Drive Thru BIG DEAL your thinking right? Well, in SF Drive Thru's are RARE. Very RARE. Unless your going to eat a Mc Donalds, Jack in the BOX..A Mexican Drive Thu SON OF A BEE STING! ok you get it. 

It was late and I was in "party mode". I would not expect authentic Mexican food from this place. At this point I didn't care what the food tasted like, I wanted some. Did I mention they are open 24 hours a day! 

I ordered:

A beef chimichanga plate and it was huge!! It was covered with cheese, sour cream and guac! It was fresh and tasty! Nice and Greasy.....yum! Rice and Beans. Not a fan of the rice..whatever though. The chimichanga was good! 

5 Chicken Rolled Taquitos (yes, my eyes are bigger than my belly)...They were nice and crunchy not soggy at all. 

The Horchata was refreshing a simply delicioso! 

Definitely a place I will go back to when in Arizona!
