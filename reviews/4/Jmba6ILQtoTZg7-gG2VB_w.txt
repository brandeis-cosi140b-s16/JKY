I happened to pass this place again after many years and decided to stop in because I saw the sign that said "Texas Barbecue". I am so glad I did. We ordered 3 dinners,the pulled pork, beef brisket, and the pork ribs. Fantastic. I liked the pulled pork the best so I will definitely be returning. I ate the pork ribs. They give you 4 and they have so much meat, I was only able to eat 3 and I'm a big eater! The brisket was tender but again the pulled pork was divine. It did take a little longer to get our food, 20 - 25 mins, but I had no problem with it. We also had the pound cake but that was a little dry but still tasted good. Can't wait to go back and take friends.
