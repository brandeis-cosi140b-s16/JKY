It's Chipotle.... it's like nearly every other Chipotle. Fast, efficient service even if there is a line. 

I like getting the Carnitas bowl. Yummm.. 

This location has a nice outdoor patio, which is perfect for enjoying a margarita after work. 

Staff has always been friendly, and the restaurant has always looked pretty clean.
