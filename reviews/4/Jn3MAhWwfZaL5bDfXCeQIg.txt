Food was good. Best tamales and tacos I've had Service was substandard. Cashiers was the rudest I've experienced in a long time. They would have rated 5 stars if it wasn't for that. We will revisit and recommend to our friends and family. However the next visit if service hasn't improved I will speak with manager.
