Typical Chipotle experience, long lines, great food, humanely raised at a decent price. One of my favorite quick places to grab a bite to eat that I don't feel guilty over eating. I rated this particular Chipotle at a four star because their line moves incredibly slowly compared to other Chipotle's in the valley. Friendly group though and upbeat. The new sofritas are awesome.
