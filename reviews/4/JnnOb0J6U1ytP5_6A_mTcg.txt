awesome place. stopped in since we wanted Mexican and they had a check in special. the free rolled tacos sucked, but my burrito was great, and fresh. the chicken tacos were out of this world!!! my only two issues are the soda fountain being in the back(and they aren't always up front to refill your cup) and the various salsas aren't that great. you also have to ask for napkins cause they keep them in the back. the cook was friendly and this place is very cheap!!
