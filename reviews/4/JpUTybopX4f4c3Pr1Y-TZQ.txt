During my week-long stay at MGM, I ate here ... a few more times than I'm proud to admit (out of sheer convenience and deliciousness). Compared to the other offerings at the MGM food court, this place offers the healthiest choices at decent prices and hugeee portions! It's similar to Chipotle (though probably not organic blahblahblah).

Everything is ~$10 regardless of choice of protein (grilled chicken, steak, pulled chicken, etc.) My fave was the burrito salad, which comes with a tortilla base and all the fixings (rice, lettuce, corn, salsa, etc). The tortilla itself is one of the best I've had. It is fluffy and crispy on the edges, without being overly greasy. 

I wouldn't recommend getting the "burrito bowl" because it's tiny, even though it's the same price as the burrito salad/burrito! Just get the burrito or even a burrito salad, because you essentially get the same ingredients (rice, lettuce, meat, etc.), just in a different form.
