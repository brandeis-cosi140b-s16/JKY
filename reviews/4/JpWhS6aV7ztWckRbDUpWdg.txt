First of all, this place isn't really fusion, it's Chinese and Mexican side-by-side. But that's okay. The Chinese food was definitely better than the tacos we tried (which were good I'm from California and my standards for tacos are very high). This place is worth it for the Chinese food. The Dan Dan Mian was to die for. Our dumplings were excellent too. I would go back for the Dan Dan Mian alone! 

The ambiance is good. Festive, and the decor is interesting to look at. I do wish more of the seats had backs on them, though.

Service was excellent.
