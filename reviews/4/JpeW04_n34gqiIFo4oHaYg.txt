Bf and I have been coming here for ages. Essentially, it's a made-to-order, Mexican take-out restaurant (although there are almost always enough tables to sit at if you prefer to dine in). Good burritos and bowls. Prices are decent. Fresh ingredients. Sides and extras are good too. My only issue are their drinks- no horchatas and the only real option to soda is some green or black tea that doesn't taste very good. My bf would love to see a salsa bar added   :)
