The last time my sister visited we decided we want to try a place we had never been. This fit the bill as we have never eaten anything in Buckeye. It has the small town feel to it and the folks serving you are friendly. I remember the food was quite good, but no idea of what I ate. It is a place we would stop in if ever we find ourselves in fabulous downtown Buckeye again.
