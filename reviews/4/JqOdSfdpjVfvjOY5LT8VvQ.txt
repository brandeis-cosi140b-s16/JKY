Just got back from Carlsbad Tavern.  It was good.  Great service.  Fun atmosphere. Kid friendly.  Loved their black beans.  My husband loved his fish taco salad.  I liked my meal.  I wasn't excited about my food like my husband was.  My only suggestion to them would be to add more vegetarian options without relying on cheese.
