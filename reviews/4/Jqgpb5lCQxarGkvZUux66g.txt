Finally tried Barrio Cafe two weeks ago....(am I the last one? There are like 300 reviews of this place?! sheesh)

The neighborhood is ghetto-fabulous, but arriving while it was still daylight comforted me a little.  The food was just as good as I expected! (Thanks, yelpers!)  The guac is to-die-for.  Pomegranate seeds and chunks of avocado....ah-mazing.  I ordered the non-alcoholic "Mexican Water" I believe is what it's called.  It is a mix of fresh lime juice and seltzer water in a long neck glass rimmed with salt.  Very refreshing!

Favorite dishes:  the steak with crab dish, the avocado salad (though it is only avocado, shrimp and mango..no lettuce.)  And, the chicken with apricots, nuts, etc.

Delicioso!
