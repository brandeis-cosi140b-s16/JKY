This is my go to Mexican food when eating out. And it's great because they are located EVERYWHERE.  They make all their salsas in house and they are constantly prepping the fresh veggies. They have a free salsa bar for customers. My favorite side condiment is the spicy marinated carrots and cucumber slices on the side.  Prices are very reasonable and proportions are hefty.  There are the more "greasy" options, but you can choose to get healthy variations also.
