I have gone here a couple of times and was impressed with the food enough to go back.  This place serves your usual Mexican-American style food but does not go over the top on portions like some other  restaurants of the same genre.  The chicken I had was moist and well seasoned white meat.  I also tasted some of the steak from my boyfriend's burrito and it also had a good flavor.  The house margaritas are good, the salsa is tasty and the service was pleasant and our waitress apologized for neglecting us a bit because she had a 12 top in her section.  I would definitely go back here to try the Pollo Con Queso as my boyfriend's Mom said it was delicious.
