So so so good! I stayed at the Monte Carlo, and this is in their food court, so it was perfect to grab food at before I headed back out to the pool. I tried the chicken street tacos and balsamic chicken salad. The street tacos are on this amazing tortilla with either chicken or steak, guacamole and pico de gallo. I added salsa on them from the salsa bar too to add some spice. The salad was good too- fresh greens with corn, chicken, and a great vinaigrette. If you need a quick bite, this is a solid choice.
