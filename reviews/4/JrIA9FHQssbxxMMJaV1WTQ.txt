Arrived into town looking for an authentic restaurant versus some of the chains. My wife and I were extremely pleased with the horchata and the delicious carne asada tacos. Serve it yourself salsas make this extremely enjoyable also. Guacamole comes standard on the tacos which drives up the price slightly.
