It's no wonder that the line is out the door at this Mesa Chipotle every day. The meu is pretty simple: Tacos, Burritos, Burrito Bowl and chips. BUT everything is delicious -- even the quesadilla which you they will make but isn't on the menu.

My favorite is the Burrito Bowl with chicken, rice, pico, medium salsa, sour cream and cheese. The bow is the way to go for the ladies -- those burritos are huge! And the salty tortilla chips here are some of the best I've ever had.
