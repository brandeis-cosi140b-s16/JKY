Delicious authentic Mexican food! Family owned, comfortable feel. The decor was music themed which I love. 

I ordered the Barbacoa taco plate. It was delicious, perfectly spiced, and  just enough food portions. The one critique I would give is that the beans were not my favorite. 

I would definitely recommend if you are looking for your Mexican fix!! :)
