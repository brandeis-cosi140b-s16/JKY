We eat here just about every time we come to Vegas.  We had fajitas today and they were outstanding!  The tortillas are warm, soft, and tasty.  We had beef and chicken fajita -- both were terrific. The server seemed like he might be new, but was clearly doing his best to take good care of us. We'll continue coming back . . .
