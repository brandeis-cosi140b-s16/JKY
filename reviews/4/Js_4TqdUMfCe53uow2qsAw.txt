Pretty sure this is the same place as 'burrito bandito' that used to be on 19th Ave and Union Hills... Until I ate a mini chimi. The menu is not correct, it's not meat and bandito cheese on the side, they put the bandito cheese on the inside and fry it all together which I thought was super nasty. Please update your menu accordingly... Husband had the 'big booty breakfast burrito' it was great, and the quesadilla. Younger girl at the counter was quite unpleasant and that's my biggest take away from my visit. Not sure I'll be back.

giving them more stars because the girl that worked here tonight 11/16/15 is so nice (ive had her now twice) and im obsessed with a shredded beef and cheese burrito from here.  SO GOOD, just dont love their mini chimis
