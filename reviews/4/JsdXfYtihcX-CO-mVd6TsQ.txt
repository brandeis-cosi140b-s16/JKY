Best cheap Mexican food in the valley! Found this place after the deli I wanted to go to next door was closed. 

Their gorditas are legit. They have every filling from chorizo with egg to classic carne asada. So simple and delicious with just lime and hot sauce. My girlfriend gets the taquitos supreme which is a deilcious gut bomb. I stick to the gorditas and sometimes throw in a white cheese quesadilla. 

If you are a gringo like me you might get some attitude but be nice and nice things happen. Norma is the short lady working behind the counter, be nice to her and see how fat those gorditas can be, mine come over flowing with carne!
