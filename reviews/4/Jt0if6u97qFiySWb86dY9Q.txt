Had the Inca salad to start and then had 2 tacos (shrimp and pork). Everything was very fresh and tasty. I don't remember having quinoa before, but am now a fan.

They were out of fish for a taco, so I dinged them a star.

Their green salsa has just the right amount of fire for me. I didn't try the red.

Will be back and recommend to anyone who likes fresh, non-fried Mexican grub.
