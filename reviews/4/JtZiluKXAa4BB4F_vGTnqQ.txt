Cheese crisp!!!  This place is *right* across the street and I've only been a few times.  Tonight, I needed something fast, close and naughty!  So, I remembered someone recommending the cheese crisp.
The tortilla was super-crispy and LOADED...LOADED...LOADED with cheese!  I also got the green chile strips on it.  They were huge strips and cut the greasy cheese just right.  Side of awesome guac - had a little kick to it!  The place itself isn't fancy at ALL.  There are a few different rooms to dine in.  Service was really friendly - all young boys.  Woohoo!
