This little shop gave some surprises. First, I didn't expect it is such a small shop. You cannot believe such a tiny eatery enjoy a high a reputation; second, the food is really good. The shrimp taco is a really delight. It is worthwhile my efforts to make a special detour to this restaurant during my trip  to Grand Canyon.
