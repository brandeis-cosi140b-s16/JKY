Good food, average prices. Our drinks (blueberry mojito and dragon berry tea) were very strong, but the food serving sizes were great. We ordered the carne asada tacos, tostada salad, and chips/salsa and everything was very tasty. Food and drinks came quickly too. They have a large assortment of tequilas for a build-your-own margarita, as well.
