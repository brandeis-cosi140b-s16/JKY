i had heard about this place so I decided to stop by friday after work. I ordered 2 tortas ahogadas to go for my dad and myself. When I got home I realized they had given me the wrong order. I called in and manager was kind enough to tell me if I went back I would get the right order for free. I went back yesterday after work and I did get the right ordere. My torta ahogadas are very delish. The sausce is very tasty. The whole torta was very good. I would would go back again.
