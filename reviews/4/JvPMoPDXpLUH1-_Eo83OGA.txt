Stopped by for lunch on a sat, have to say the last time I was at Chevys was up in the Bay Area with my pops about 5 years ago, so for me, it was like being there for a 1st time all over. Yes, this is a chain place, but it didn't feel like it.

1st off, ordered a grande strawberry margarita with a double shot of tequila, oh baby that was good!

Chips and salsa have hit the table and now its time to cruise the menu,  I have to say our sever, Kevin was extremely nice and professional, made sure we had everything we needed and we never had a where is our waiter moment, I love love love great customer service! Awesome job Kevin! You my dear rock!!!

Saw on the side of the menu you can soup or salad, a main entr√©e and a mini desert for 12 bucks, that right there was a screaming deal for my buck! So I went with it!
Ordered the tortilla soup, chicken fajitas, and fried ice cream. The tortilla soup reminded me of my mom in laws, so dang good, thought I was home for a min, the chicken fajitas, oh man what a treat, they come with fresh tortilla, I watched Kevin press them & cook them.  The mini deep fried ice cream, oh that right there was sweet heaven!!  

Good deal & good times down at Chevys!
