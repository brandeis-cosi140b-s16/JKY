The first two times I came here the fish tacos were out of this world. The last two times- not so great. But everything else has always been top notch. This little mom and pop shop is like a chipotle in that everything you order is made right in front of you. Love that we can get a real Mexican coke here too. The best part about this place? A family of 3 can get a good meal for under $20.
