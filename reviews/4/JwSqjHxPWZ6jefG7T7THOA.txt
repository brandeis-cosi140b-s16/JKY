We went here for one of our monthly lunch places.  Plenty of parking in the lots or on the streets.  We sat in on the patio.  It was nice weather and great service.  I ordered the chicken quesada (red peppers, chicken, bacon, & cheese).  It was huge.   1/2 of the order was good enough for me.  Good lunch!  YUM!
