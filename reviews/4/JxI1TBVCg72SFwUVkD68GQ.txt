Same as the other Michoacans.  I came on a Sunday afternoon.  Not busy at all, so the service was great.  They bring you a bowl of tortilla chips with fried beans and salsa to always start you off.  My friend ordered the carne asada nachos while I ordered a pollo asada burrito.  The portions are just huge.  We were hungry, but this was too much for our first meal even though it was in the afternoon.  The burrito was simple, but had lots of chicken in it.  This is just good authentic Mexican food.  They also give you a free margarita, beer, or tequila slammer for saying "parangaricutirimicuaro" correctly without hesitation.  I attempted it, and she was shocked because I said it perfectly.  All thanks to four years of Spanish classes haha.
