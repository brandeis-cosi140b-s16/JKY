These tacos are amazeballs
I've been searching for a taco place that satisfies all of my taco needs(taste, location, price) & I think I found it
I thought there were no decent taco places in the nw & the chain one just don't cut it for me but I found this place here on yelp, & the reviews sold me, I wish I would've known about it sooner
I can't wait to try the rest of the menu which sounds delicious
