Love, love, love Carlitos!  I first tried Carlito's about 6 years ago when a coworker would bring me their breakfast burritos.  They are so good and huge!  I was hooked.  I love anything green chile so the whole menu is a hit with me but my absolute favorite is the BBQ they do on the weekends.  In the cooler months they fire up the grill a couple Saturdays a month.  Tri tip, ribs, chicken and prime rib are a few of their offerings.  They do one meat a day.  You can get it  as an entree with green chile cheddar mashed potatoes and calabacitas or as a sandwich with cheddar cheese and green chile on garlic bread.  OMG.  It is so good.  They sell out fast so if you can't make early it is best to order in advance.  Ordering in advance will save your food but they don't make it until you get there.  I recommend calling when you are on your way so it will be ready.  I learned that the hard way when we ordered a nacho bar and a few racks of ribs for fight night.  I ordered in advance and stated a pickup time but had to wait almost an hour when we got there for the food.   I wasn't expecting the wait but they were slammed.  I can appreciate they want their customers to have the best product possible and didn't make it early to just sit there.  The recently announced that they are moving to the Galaxy Theater complex and in addition to Carlito's they are opening a Santa Maria BBQ spot Live Fire Q!  Now I can get their BBQ whenever I want!  No more waiting for Saturdays or worrying about sell outs.  No firm date yet but they are shooting for October.  I can't wait!
