Quite a solid restaurant in the the Vegas Market! 

Cuisine is mostly Spanish themed and varies from tacos to fish dishes. It's a decent price range for the type of food and decor. Prices range from $12-25 for most entrees. 

I tried the marinated chicken quesadillas and they were crazy good! I know quesadillas are a basic food item, but I appreciate a good quesadilla and this was definitely really good. Served with sour cream, guacamole and salsa on the top. 

Also got the chicken tostada salad one day and they was pretty great as well. The chicken comes out with blackened skin, which was a turn off for me but I just didn't eat the skin. Salad itself is very flavorful served on a piece of tostada. 

Overall not a bad place to grab lunch when you're at the Vegas market, definitely one of the nicer places where you can sit down to have a business meeting. 

You have to make a reservation in person and be aware that they do get extremely crowded around lunch time. The dishes come out a little slow as well, but market is tiring so I don't mind getting more time to sit around, haha. But food can take 30+ minute to come out. :/
