Strange thing...been going to Aliante off and on for the last couple of years.  Didn't notice until now that Cabo has been replaced by the Salted Lime.  I figured it was the same type food with the same "just okay" taste.  I was right and wrong.  Same type food, but Salted Lime is definitely an upgrade.  

The Salted Lime reminds me of Pink Taco at the Hard Rock minus the crowds.  This restaurant has a bar on one side and the restaurant to the left.  With your meal you get a bottomless serving of chips.  These chips were airy, light, and fresh.  After after about 3 refills on our chips, we were ready for our main meals.  I got their beef chimichanga.  Because of the cheap price, expected a small bite sized chimichanga.  What I got was this mammoth of a burrito that was so good, crispy because it was deep fried, and juicy.  Who describes a chimichanga as juicy?  I just did and if you've had one from the Salted Lime, you would know what I am talking about.  I was a little disappointed in myself because for the first time in a long time, I did not finish my meal.  My mom didn't raise a quitter, but this was way too much food and quit is what I did.  Between 2 people our meals came up to $33, which is a bargain.  

I don't frequent sit down Mexican Restaurants too often.  I actually prefer your small stands/joints that you find in California.  However, the Salted Lime has quickly changed my mind.  If I learned anything about the Salted Lime, it's come here hungry, prepared to eat, and don't over chomp on the chips.  

PS:  Service here is great.  3 different employees stopped at our table just to chit chat and ask us about our meals.  Me and my boss (who happens to be a big Samoan) only ate half our meals.   Yes, the food portions were that big. 

Sorry...no pictures.  First, I was with the boss.  Second, the portions were so big a picture would have killed my phone's battery.
