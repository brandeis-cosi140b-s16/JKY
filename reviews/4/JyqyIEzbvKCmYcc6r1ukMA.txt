I really love Cafe Carumba! I came here for both a lunch and dinner on this trip to AZ. The service is great no matter what time of day. The food is consistently good. I had an awesome burger with portobello mushrooms, brie and pancetta...Yum! I also had the sweet potato fries which are so good! I washed it all down with some heavenly patron margaritas. For dinner I ordered the cobb salad...not my fave. The chicken was tossed in something that tasted like strawberry pancake syrup...it was really sweet. Our waitress was so nice and accommodating. She took my salad back and brought me one with plain chicken which was very good. I also had the beef churrasco-skewers of marinated beef tenderloin, which was delicious. Oh, and of course more patron margaritas.
