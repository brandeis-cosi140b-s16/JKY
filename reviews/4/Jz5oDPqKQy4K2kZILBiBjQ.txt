first time, have to return.  met friends for lunch on the back patio - great setting, very attentive service.  understand that the chef is French or French trained so the menu has an upscale unanticipated flair to lunch dishes that initially sound Mexican.  tableside guacamole was very good, salsa was good also.  chicken tacos were tasty and both friends liked their entrees - torta and more tacos with beef.  will definitely return for either lunch or dinner...looked like a nice selection of tequilas.
