I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review of El Mesquite. It's one of those neighborhood standbys that you love having around. We've eaten takeout several times and been thrilled with the carne asada, carnitas, and more. And while we've tried it several times already, I'll add that it could easily have been twice as many or more. But their hours are a frequent source of frustration. How does a restaurant surrounded by a mostly residential area close every night at 7:00 and have otherwise seemingly arbitrary hours? Given that it's family-owned, I give them a pass and will return again. Just make sure you call ahead if coming from a distance.
