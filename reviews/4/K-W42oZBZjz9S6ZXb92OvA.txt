We went for lunch after visiting Taliesin West.  We sat outside on the patio which was nice despite being in a parking lot.  I tried the peach sangria which was great.  We all were happy with our menu choices, altho i was surprised that the "soft" tacos were not rolled, but the ingredients were simply sitting on the tortillas.
We would definitely go back when next in the area.
