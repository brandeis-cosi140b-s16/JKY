It has been several years since I have visited Restaurant Mexico on Mill Ave.  The service was quick on a busy lunch time on a Thursday.

The food was good, I had a shredded beef taco and beans.  I love the crispy fried taco.  A few other reviews mentioned the chips are cold, they still are but, they are nice and crispy.
