I was surprised by the quality of service we received here!  My drink never had a chance to get empty, and we were checked on often enough but without feeling like our privacy was being invaded.  

I ordered the vegetarian combo with a cheese enchilada & a bean tostada with refried beans & rice.  All of it was way saltier than I like, but it wasn't inedible.  And consistency-wise, the enchiladas could learn something from the overly-pureed beans; I needed a knife for the former and could have used a spoon on the latter.  I had a bite of my boyfriend's chile relleno, and it was okay but not what I'm used to from taquerias in Chicago.  The complimentary chips and salsa were great.. perfectly light crispy chips and the salsa with pico de gallo in it was really good.  If the rest of the food was as good as the chips & salsa, they'd get a 5 star rating.  Everything was very reasonably priced.   

The restaurant itself was bright, colorful & clean.
