Not for the calorie counter. Get the sampler plate and try all three salsas; they're all spectacular.  Also be sure to sit on the patio; very pretty out there.  Service was good, margaritas were eh, but that's fine.  And yes, the Chicken Fundido is to die for.  Amazing.  The sauce was spectacular to the point we found ourselves digging for chips just to scrape every last bit of sauce off the plate.

We'll be back!
