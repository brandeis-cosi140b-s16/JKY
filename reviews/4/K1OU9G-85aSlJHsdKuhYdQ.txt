Great fresh lunch for cheap. I opted for the single taco plate ($5.99) that comes with rice and beans. It's real similar to Chipotle. Pick your style (burrito, enchilada, taco, salad, etc) then your filling (shredded chicken, beef, grilled chicken, veggie... Maybe two other choices). 

They slap a flour tortilla on the flat top grill and toss some cheese on it. It cooks till melty-goodness. Then they toss the chicken on and pico and lettuce. Choose black or pinto beans. Cilantro rice. Flavors were decent. Chipotle may have better flavors, but I can't say since this was my first time and I only had the shredded chicken. 

Taco was a really decent size, I Berniece it was a 7 inch tortilla, instead of those mini 5 inch tortillas (like at El Pollo Loco-YUMM BTW.....). 

There's was quite a lot of liquid in the bottom of my tin foil that the taco was wrapped in, liquid was from the chicken and maybe some from the pico. If I had taken it to-go, it would be soggy by the time I dug in. Since I ate there it wasn't much of a problem. 

Rice and beans were sufficiently flavored. Can't say it was AMAZEBALLS, but I also can't say they weren't flavorful. 

Trusty ol' chipotle Tabasco had my back.

Oh!! And the ice is the PERFECT ice in the world, crushes real nice and smooth. Like Sonic ice. Nom Nom. Took me a nice cup o ice to go. ;)

Overall, I will return. I'll update my review as needed.
