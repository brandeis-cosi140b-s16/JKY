I've only ever been one place that does what Amados does better than Amados does it. Cheap, delicious Mexican food that is available at any time you can dream of eating Mexican food. 

This isn't a place to go when you're looking for astronomical levels of quality; this is a place to go when you want solid food in big quantities for good prices at unreasonable hours. The Arizona burrito is awesome, the carne asada is awesome, the carnitas are awesome, and the rest is a step below but still good. I'm not a huge fan of the rolled tacos, but you may see it differently. The guacamole isn't great, either, but the hot sauce is pretty darn good so I don't really mind.

If you want cheap and convenient, this is your best bet, over the other competitors in the area. If you want more of a sit-down place to bring someone, you can find something else. Your call.

And don't wimp out and talk English here. The cooks are super friendly and talkative if you're just willing to use that kid-level Spanish you learned in middle school, no matter how gringo your accent is.
