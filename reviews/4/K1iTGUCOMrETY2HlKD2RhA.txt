On recommendation I dropped in for dinner.  The atmosphere was very nice.  An outdoor terrace was very cozy, and indoors the bar was relaxing and personal.   I ordered the Guacamole on recommendation which features a Gran Marinier reduction sauce atop a chunky mound of goodness in a generous sized portion.  Very nice.   I ended up using it along with the rest of my order, which consisted of the Muchaca and Cheese Flautas in a red sauce.  These were extra large and delicious.  I enjoyed having these with the guac and probably could have stopped there, but alas I also got the steak tacos which were perfectly cooked (seared) chunks of marinated steak with the normal fixings and came with an interesting tomato tortilla soup which was a little too "tomato soup" like for me, but still was good.  I paired it all with a Negro Modello that was on tap (nice!).   Heradura and Patron is available to those with a few extra dollars, but that wasn't for me this evening.   The ingredients were all very fresh and very well prepared.  I would definitely come again.
