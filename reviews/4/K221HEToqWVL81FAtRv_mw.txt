The smell once you walk in just screams authentic. The lime green walls and pictures of fresh meals set you up for a good vibe. 

I went with the tacos de pescado. The fish was tender and well prepared. But here's the kicker, the absolute best part wad the fresh lemonade. Seriously WOW. For the price you pay, the food portions are more then fair.
