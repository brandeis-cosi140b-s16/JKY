Drive thru is really all I use on the way to work, so I can't comment on the dining area. However the drive thru is always speedy and gets my order correct every time. Almost every person has a really great and friendly attitude at the window. Some of them have even recognized me and asked how I've been. This to me, is good service especially given the number of people they see each day. Love the country a.m. crunch wrap and steak scrambler to start the day.
