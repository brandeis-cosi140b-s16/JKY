My sister was right.  This place is pretty damn good!  They have a nightly special with prices that are unbelievably low.  Seriously!  I can't remember paying a $1.50 for a reasonably sized and tasty bean burrito anywhere in California, ever!

The bean and cheese burritos are cheesy!  So if you don't like cheese, definitely tell them to take it easy.  I did, and my bowels thank me.  The fish tacos were much better than I expected for Phoenix.  Hey, frozen fish goes a long way!

The salsa roja was so-so and very inconsistent.  One day it was spicy and the next, watered down.  The pickled hot carrots and jalapenos were on the money every time.  I could eat these all day, but I'm sure the heartburn would slow me down eventually.

Although I was only visiting for a week, I made it in there at least three times.  Upon every visit I was greeted with a smile; when I left, they were sure to thank me.  Kudos to the staff!  The little things really do go a long way to making customers feel welcomed and wanting to come back.
