Hmmm....I must of have hit them on a very good day, because we thought the food was really good! We were there between lunch and dinner, so no sloppy drunks around. Ok, so we only had the appetizer platter, but everything on it was delicious and had some unique tastes. They make their own tortillas and you could really tell the difference in flavor and texture. Yes, everything was overpriced, but that seems to be the norm now for Vegas. Oh yeah, the mango margarita was mucho bueno!
