I just have some tweaks on what others mentioned.

Ambiance--some people apparently wish negative scores were possible, but I found the look quaint and fun.

Service--I went at lunch and dinner today and had no problems.

Food.  I really liked the green corn chicken tamale and chile relleno with green chile.  I thought ordering one of each a la carte was the thing to do since the rice and beans were unappealing.  You still get some salad (i.e., lettuce) with it.  I've had much more intense green chile and/or poblano before, but by the time I'd finished I had developed a satisfying slow-warmth.

The dessert popover (fry bread/sopapilla with sugar and honey) was delicious.

I really enjoyed the cheese crisp ole to start.  Very little bread, so it just added a good starch/crisp to the cheese, tomato, and jalapeno that top it.
