Very good Mexican food. I tried the carne asada and it was well cooked with great flavored. I loved the hand made flour tortillas. Guacamole was a little plain but other than that it was a great meal.

You can tell they take great pride in their restaurant as the food was prepared well. Everything was fresh. I also enjoyed that they put up Christmas decorations during the holidays!
