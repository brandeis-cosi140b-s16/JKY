My wife and I ate here for lunch.  Had an overall very good experience.  Details:
Guacamole:  Super fresh and VERY good with just the right amount of "kick."
Tortilla Soup:  Was amazing!  We're tortilla soup fans and this was one of the best We've ever had!
Shrimp Tacos:  A lighter option with great flavor and with the rice/beans made for a great lunch for my wife.
Beef Brisket Enchiladas: This was very good served in a small cast iron skillet.  My only complaint here was that they were a little too salty and since cooked in the skillet they ended up very greasy as the oils had nowhere to escape to.  Good but a very heavy option and not for the person wanting a low-fat option.
Service:  Was great.  Can't speak to their service on a busy day.  We were one of three tables seated for lunch.
