I went here on Monday night after a quick trip to the mall. It was the best Mexican restaurant I have eaten at.. lots of menu items that are Mexican themed. I had a awesome pulled pork sandwhich thing that had avacado and jalapano peppers on it, with a side of fries. the  white cheese dip is so fresh and amazing. I couldn't stop dipping my fries in it. My friend had the big burrito and a salad that came with an avocado dressing.  The dressing was good too ( as I was dipping my fries in it :P) The watress was great and loved interacting with us. she really made the meal awesome. the portions are big so we had leftovers which I ended up devouring later that night.
