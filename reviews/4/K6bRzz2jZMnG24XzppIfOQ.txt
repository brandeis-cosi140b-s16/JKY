First, you should know this Baja is inside the Texas Station casino, in the food court near the movie theater. It's not a quicker Baja... 

Having said that, I love the food here. I really like their steak burritos, and their chips and guacamole never really disappoint. Their servings are generous, and I never feel like I paid too much for too little food here. The bang-to-buck ratio is good here. 

One of my favorite things about Baja is their salsa bar. They have an assortment of like 5 or 6 different types of salsas you can serve yourself. I like the pineapple one, though there's nothing wrong with the pico de gallo here! They also allow you to phone your order in ahead of time, which is a pretty cool little time-saver if you're in a rush!

The only reason I give this place four stars instead of 5? I feel like their food is slightly less awesome than Chipotle's, though they are priced similarly. I want to say Chipotle is better food, but Baja has more variety. If it weren't for the fact that I drive by Chipotle every day, I would probably eat more at Baja!
