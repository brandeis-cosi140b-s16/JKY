Funny that after all these years visting Las Vegas I had never been here before. My friend YM from Lyon France suggested it. They have a killer happy hour with excellent margaritas and really cheap eats. The 3$ tacos looked excellent. 

We had dinner the night we were there and the guacamole was worth the extra $$ its fantastic. All the food was great and the portions were huge. El Segundo is an oasis of value and excellent service in a sea of overpriced casino restaurants add it to your list next time your in LV.
