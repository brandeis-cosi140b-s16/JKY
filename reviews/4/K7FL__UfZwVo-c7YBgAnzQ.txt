Go here for happy hour... which I believe is until 6:30pm? Great deals on drinks and the food selection isn't too shabby either. 

We (me & the  BF) ordered the chicken quesadilla per recommendation of the bartendress- great recommendation. That lil pocket of deliciousness is STUFFED with chicken and cheese plus you get all the naughty fixin's on the side (guac, sour cream, salsa...) as well.

All of the other food is still your standard, delicious Mexican... still very reasonably priced.

Ditching your vehicle is very convenient, plenty of parking in the back. Air conditioning is always 'full-blast.' Can order pitchers of margs frozen or on the rocks during happy hour.  

Couldn't ask for more on a 115 degree day :)
