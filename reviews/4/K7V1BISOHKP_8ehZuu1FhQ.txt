I really love this spot.  It's one of my go-to places for lunch on the weekends.  The El Pastor (pork) burrito is fantastic.  I've always had great service here and the quality and freshness of the food is terrific.

At times, when they are busy, the service can be a little on the slower side every now and then but overall I like this place a lot.
