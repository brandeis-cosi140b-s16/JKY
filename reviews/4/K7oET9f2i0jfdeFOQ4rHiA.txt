I love avocados so of course I love El Pollo Loco.  Their chicken is very well seasoned and they have a great variety of menu items.  I especially like their kids meal options.  It is a great break from the normal chicken nugget and french fries at other fast food places.  My son usually gets the 2 chicken leg meal with a side of mac & cheese.

I also love their spicy avocado salsa:)
