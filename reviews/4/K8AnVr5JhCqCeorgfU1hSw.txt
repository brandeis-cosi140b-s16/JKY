I hate strip mall restaurants.  But - I forgive this little place.  Nothing fancy. Very simple.  Very ethnic. So much that the menu is completely in Spanish.  But don't let that scare you ... there are pictures on the menu! Lots of pictures!

I guess they are mainly known for their Tortas (which are sandwiches).  And their tortas are HUGE! And, yummy.  Some combinations are a bit unusual.  I recommend, unless you are REALLY hungry - start with the little sandwich (I like to call them "tortita" - don't quote me - that's my expression and the waiter will NOT understand you).

But my husband and I always get tacos.  He orders Tacos de Alhambra de Res - strip steak with chopped ham and bacon (I think).  I order a cheese quesadilla de maiz (Maiz instead of flour - much better!).  The quesadilla is served with a  green chile salsa sauce inside - spicy - but not to make your eyes water.  You can get quesadillas stuffed with other fillings too.

They have different flavor Horchata's as well  (I love to say Orrrrrrr -CHA-ta).

I'll tell you what....my mom is from Mexico City.  She says that the tacos are like what you can buy on the streets in Mexico (which is a good thing).  I think you should take a chance and trust my mom on this.
 She owned a Mexican restaurantt in Upstate NY before Mexican food was "in."  

If you read this and do give it a go - let me know what you think!
