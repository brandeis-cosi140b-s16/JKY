Honestly they look pretty bare inside, no frills but they offer an extensive snack bar type menu of Mexican and some Central American favorites/antojitos.  

They have a limited selection of ice cream and a few paletas, but my  favorite items to get here are the  Escamochas (fruit salad with sweetened cream, like melted vanilla ice cream), topped with pecans, coconut or granola.  My other favorite are the Raspados, a snow cone like treat with fresh fruit syrups (most with whole pieces of fruit) or the Obispo which is a raspado with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  

These made my summer very tolerable.
