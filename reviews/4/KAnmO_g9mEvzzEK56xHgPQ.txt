Basically, this place is the same as Filibertos.   In fact, I think the owner started as a Filibertos franchisee, then went indy.  Pretty much the same menu, and quality, which is to say better than Taco Hell.  it is somewhere between fast food and a full on sit down restaurant. This particular location is kept pretty clean and I like the carne asada nachos and burros, as well as the breakfast burros.  The only real complaint I have is the drive-thru speaker sucks, and the cramped turn and tight space you have to have to get through.
