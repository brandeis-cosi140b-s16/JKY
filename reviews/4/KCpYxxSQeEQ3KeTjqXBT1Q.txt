I went here for brunch on a Sunday, and though the place looks like a dive gaming bar from the outside, the inside is welcoming and the food is tasty and reasonably priced. They've managed to hang on for about as long as I've been alive, so they're probably doing something right.

On Sundays you can take advantage of a real bargain with the aforementioned buffet ($7.95). I'm not usually a fan of all-you-can-eat since I usually end up spending more than I consume, but this is a good one. For eight bones, you cant go wrong.

Selections included; shrimp ceviche; mole; chile verde; hominy soup; and cheesy roasted potato skins, amongst a handful of other more ordinary dishes. Everything was much better than I had expected. The ceviche was full of avocado and wonderfully fresh shrimp and the mole was fall-apart tender. The pork chile verde was probably my favorite.

Dessert wasn't as impressive as the flan was mediocre at best. There was also something that reminded me of a caramel turtle pie. This was good, but so thick and sweet it was like eating candy. Next time I might splurge a little and get the tempting fried ice cream.

Even with a do-it-yourself buffet, the service was attentive and kind. The experience overall was one I'd like to repeat, so I'll be coming here on any given Sunday to save some money, eat good food, and support our local mom and pop's.
