Galerias is on our way home, so we see it every day, saying we should try it out. Today we finally went. 

Totally not what we expected. We thought it would be another Tamales or Mexican cafeteria. But it was more dining. 

We started with the chips, served with two salsas, one creamy red and one green. Neither were too spicy. 

I had the Luis Barragan chile and my bf had the Enchiladas de Chipotle with shredded beef. Maybe another day bf's enchilada would've been good, but today it was eclipsed by my most excellent chile. 

We also shared the orange flan. It was just ... meh. 

The portions weren't too big and the prices weren't exhorbent -- they fit the quality and quantity. 

Or server was sort of friendly and knew his way around the menu. I had problems ordering because every thing looked good. 
The service was a little slow, but I give them a break because they're so new. 

I like that the restaurant was broken up into smaller areas. I don't like to feel lost in a large restaurant. It seemed more intimate and when places get crowed, broken up space helps keep the volume low. 

After eating here, I'm excited to see this place flourish, but I'm skeptical that it will, given its location. 

Oh, yeah, and the logo is really ugly and it really bothers me.
