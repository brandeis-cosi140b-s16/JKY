Cafe rio been here plenty of times and I just love it. Better than Chipotle or rubios ect.. I always get a salad never disappointed maybe one day I'll venture off and get something else but the salad is to good to give up.  But yesterday I came in and wanted steak they had none left and I had to wait about 15 minutes for some when talking about good customer service they didn't charge for my double meat on both salads!!! Gave me a free drink and extra stamps on the frequency card and continually apologized they made me feel important i would give that 5 stars alone. I'll be back soon.
