Again, a place that doesnt look like much from the outside but I assure you, this place is the bees knees!!  Their breakfast burritos are the best I have ever had!  I am a huge fan and go here a couple times a month.  Great rolled tacos and enchiladas as well.  Their green salsa is to die for.  Go here and get a breakfast burrito, you wont be disappointed!!
