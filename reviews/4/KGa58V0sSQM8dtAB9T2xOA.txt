Well it's date night. Of course i'm exhausted!! My Fiance and I have visited before. The Location is easy to find. Everyone here is super friendly and quick. It's Never crowded here, you're  always guaranteed a seat.
 
Considering I've had a REALLY long day, of coures I started with a classic Margarita (medium size) The drink menu includes the  Prices. I love the Margaritas here, you certainly get your moneys worth.  Once again I  ordered the Steak Quesadilla (you get 2) Amazing! This is my personal favorite dish, comes with a slice of tomatoe, iceberg lettuce and sour cream.....needless to say I didnt use any of the added toppings lol. We ordered Guacamole (small order) it was literally OKAY. Overall i look forward to having many more quesadillas here lol.
