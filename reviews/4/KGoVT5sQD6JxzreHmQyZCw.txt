Stopped by the first afternoon we were in Scottsdale for snacks and beverages on the recommendation from our hotel staff.  The beer was cold and the happy hour half priced apps made it a cool place to spend an hour or so.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  I think the music can get a bit loud, not when we were there but driving by later in the evening there is a definite THUMP THUMP THUMP!  Overall, a youngish crowd but we would still return if we are in the area.
