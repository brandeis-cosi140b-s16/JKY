Can you say awesome beans and rice, wonderful hot sauce, and lots of mormons?!? 
Normally, I would never eat at a place that looks the way El Charro does on the outside and on the inside. But ever since trying to impress an ex boyfriends parents by eating there with them, I have been a fan and can now zone out the atmosphere. 
They have really good bean burrito's and tacos, but what I really go there for is the rice and beans which are usually mediocre and are simply there in case you need a little somethin more at other restaurants. I can't describe what makes them so great at El Charro but they just are! The beans are the perfect consistency (not too runny, not too thick) and the rice has great flavor and big chunks of tomato and onion. 
Also worth of a shoutout are the salsa (chunky with really good flavor) and the macaroni salad that you can get with certain meals (its home made I believe). 
Downsides are that they charge you for more than one bowl of chips and salsa sometimes (I think if you are on their good side, they will not charge you), and their chili rellenos suck!!! Whatever you do, don't order them. I guess the inside and outside of the building could use some spucing up as well. 
This place is an institution in AZ and in our family.
