As usual, this place always delivers good food! Enchiladas, tamales, chips, salsa...whatever I have ever gotten has always been great. The rice is a good blend and the fideo soup that is served pre-entree is always delicious. We got desserts on our last visit, and those were SSOOO good! The churros, lava cake, and the sopapillas (sp?)  were yum!
