I enjoyed the chopped salad very much. We got the shrimp appetizer and it was spicy but very good. The service is precise and not pushy or rushed. The music is nice, the faculties are clean and overall the restaurant feels like it's new.  I would like to go here for dinner and see what the crowd is like. I will definitely be back.
