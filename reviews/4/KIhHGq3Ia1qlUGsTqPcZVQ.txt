yuh yeah.

Taco El Compita is like Mexican spots in LA, offsetting appearance, shady business plaza, and smells like chlorine when you enter. Its going to take some guts to jump in and give it a try if you're used to spots like Baja Fresh or Qdoba. Once you're in though, YOU'RE IN... assuming that you like more authentic Mexican food and have no intentions of ordering carne asada fries. 

From my experience with the carnitas, carne asada , and pollo they are a bit spicy and kind of have a tomato taste. The tacos are tiny, but they are soft, have intense flavor, and only cost 12 pesos (1 USD)! The burrito however is not tiny, you could probably fit a Taco Bell grilled stuffed burrito in it. Anyways my carne asada burrito was filled with rice, beans, onions and well carne asada, none of that sour cream and guacamole nonsense. 

The salsa bar is pretty small, but definitely has all the essentials, pico di gallo, lime wedges, green salsa, and red salsa. Service was quick and prompt.

If it adds to anything I always see Hispanic customers here, so maybe they think its legit too. 

SMALL SMALL SMALL thing that bothers me though is that the menu board facing the cooks and not where the customers are facing.
