Great Lunch prices - includes Drink too.
Good food and decent service - never had a bad meal.

The salsa is tasty and the chips got some bite.  If you got a weak tongue save it for some tasteless English food. 

I still haven't figured out which of the 3 sauces I like more on the burritos and chimichangas but I'm leaning towards the green sauce.
