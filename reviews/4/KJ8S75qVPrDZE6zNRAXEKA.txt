This Chipotle is quickly becoming a regular lunch spot for me. The lines are long, but the people working there are fast, efficient and friendly. Even if there are 30 people in line ahead of you (and there often are), you're typically ordering within 5-10 minutes. Steve Ells would be so proud of this location. 

I love the chicken tacos. Their grilled chicken is bomb, and the tortillas are tasty. Three chicken tacos with cheese, lettuce and hot salsa is my jam. The food is good, and it just feels fresher and better for you than any other fast food option. They also offer Coke Zero, which is good since I'm trying to give up non-diet soda (New Year's resolution...trying to "get healthier" and "drop pounds" so I don't have a "weight problem"...Sorry, just had to channel my inner Chris Farley for a minute).

Anyway...Rather than getting crappy fast food for lunch, or paying way too much for crappy food at a chain restaurant in Tempe, I'll hit up Chipotle a couple times a week and at least feel OK about my lunch choices.
