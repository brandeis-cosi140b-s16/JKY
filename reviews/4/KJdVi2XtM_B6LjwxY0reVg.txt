I've been about a half dozen times now. I thought the carne asada was meh, but the carnitas taco and ALL of the breakfast tacos are awesome. Nacho fires are tasty, too (definitely a 'fork' appetizer). 

Love the salsa bar, I usually go back twice. Tons of soda choices, too. Clean, super friendly, good place.
