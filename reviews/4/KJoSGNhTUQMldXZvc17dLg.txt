Great place for local Mexican food. Very popular place for State employees working on the Capitol Mall.  All the lunch specials are great and inexpensive (I love the rice and beans).  Regular combos are much larger than the lunch combos (food coma anyone?)

They have a salsa and chip bar for dine-in only.  If you want to take out, I suggest ordering over the phone.  Otherwise, service is slow.
