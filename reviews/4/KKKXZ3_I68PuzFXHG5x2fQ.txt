I love this little take away counter,  it's a good sign when they have to show you the menu in English and while waiting for your food you can watch yourself on the security camera above the register.  What more could you ask for?  I always get the same thing, pork soft tacos.  Their tacos Al Pastor are to die for.  They have juicy bites of pineapple and topped with onion and cilantro, YUM, it is served with a red chile sauce, but I ask for the verde, or sometimes both.
