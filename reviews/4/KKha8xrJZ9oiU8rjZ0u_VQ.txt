Went to watch the UFC fight at the Arizona Room last night with my family and we all enjoyed the food, the comfortable seating, the nice staff (manager checked on us two times) and the prices were Great for the taste and portion sizing.  Can't complain about yummy quesadillas and nachos for about $6 each.  Burgers were great, too (my aunt and uncle said so).  We ordered the sopapillas for dessert (just ok) and the churros with ice cream (ok also).  Great place to watch sports on a big screen and eat and great food for a great value.
