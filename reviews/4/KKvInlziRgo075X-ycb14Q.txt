After waiting about 30 minutes for a table we were finally seated.  We had the Groupon for chonga margaritas.  I got the pina colada flavor.  So they brought out two giant margaritas with two beers sticking out of each of them!  I didn't see them on the menu so I don't know how much it normally is.  But the pina colada flavored one was so good!  I drank up the first one and I could definitely feel it!  The chips and salsa they bring are really good.  I loved the salsa verde!  To eat I got combo # 4 which included a beef taco, chilie relleno, and a chicken enchilada for $19.  The presentation is so nice!  The beef taco was amazing, the best beef taco I've ever had!  I would definitely go back!
