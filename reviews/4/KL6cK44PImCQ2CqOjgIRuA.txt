We stopped in for the Sunday buffet brunch and it was great! The shredded beef was my favorite along with the amazing omelet  station. I was happy to see that we have a great buffet for brunches in the west valley. It was not super busy either. My daughter enjoyed all the fresh fruit and my husband thought the enchiladas were great. The music began as we were leaving so we did not get to take part in that. I really enjoyed everything about the food especially the freshness!
