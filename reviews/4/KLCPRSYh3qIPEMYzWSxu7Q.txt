I was so satisfied with the ease of the experience of Verde that I suggest it to all my downtown colleagues. It's clean and simple from the easy to order menu options to the ladies flattening the dough in the window, it is a great atmosphere and great price. 

I'm addicted to the green chile with a side drink of horchata. I dream about it...literally. I have went back to Verde with intentions to order something else. Like, the chicken, which I hear is yummy or even get there in the early AM for a breakfast burrito. No, I keep coming back to the green chile and I continue to be satisfied. Warning! It's got a kick to it if you are sensitive to spicy foods but it's delicious.
