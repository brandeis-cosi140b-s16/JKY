Friendly service and great fresh ingredients, especially their homemade hot sauces (most places use the canned stuff, so A+ on this!).  Had a couple filled to the brim tacos and a Mexican Coke and walked out stuffed for less than $7.  I'd like to see a little better seasoning on the carnitas (or even better, some pastor tacos!), but overall a good traditional taco- or if you want to go the American way they build right in front of you, so you can sour cream and lettuce your heart out.  It's in a funky old building in an awkward spot on South Park street, but is a super clean and well kept place. I'll be back for sure!

EDIT: they do have tacos al pastor!  They'll be updating the menu soon, until then you'll have to request it.
