I generally go to Filibertos for a quick carne asada fix. Not that I believe that it is the only good place to go, there is a bit of tradition and a slight addiction dating back to my youth that brings me back to Filibertos. That said, I tried Los Favoritos on a recommendation from a friend that said that it was the new Filibertos.

I thought it was good. It has a different taste, but it was still good. I think I prefer that tortillas at Filibertos, but the carne asada itself was a toss-up between the two. Having had fresh carne asada at Mexican picnics, I recognize that neither are true carne asada, but it serves it's purpose.

I did appreciate the cleanliness of Los Favoritos over Filibertos. I don't think I have ever been to a Filibertos and not felt like there was probably a health code violation or two occurring. That won't stop me from eating there, but it always gets the voice in the back of my head talking.

It is important for me to add here that I don't just simply order the carne asada burrito. I make it my own anywhere I order it. I like mine with the meat, cheese, beans, rice, and sour cream all wrapped up in the burrito. It's the only way to eat it if you ask me.
