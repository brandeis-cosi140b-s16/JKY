Okay, so it is HARD to find mexican food in tempe that is like what I have with family in Mexico. Every time I'm craving some plain frijolles de la olla (beans, whole) I go here. I keep coming back for the burro clare. Don't come expecting some fancy restaurant but it's great for a yummy lunch. 

One thing is that their salsa is kind of lacking and a side of guac will cost you your first born, but other than that everything I've had is delicious, including their margaritas.

Once we went and I met once of my favorite artists, Crystal Castles, hanging out having some margaritas before their show at the marquee! I figure this is probably a rarity as usually the place is pretty empty. The service is awesome, the girls there are SO nice and helpful.
