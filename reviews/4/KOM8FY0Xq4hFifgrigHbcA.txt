The sign on the door said including soft drink on lunch menu.  They said it no longer is included but because I mentioned the sign they honored beverage.  Had potato and chicken soup - wonderful. Taco salad with ground beef-exceptional. Beef & chicken enchiladas-fantastic, although I wanted them without sauce. All for $23.
