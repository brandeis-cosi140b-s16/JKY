We live right down the street from Tia Rosa, and so we stopped in for lunch. The chips are not the best I have ever had, but the salsa is amazing! It is spicy and fresh. I ordered the Spinach Enchiladas and they were delicious. It is pricy for Mexican food. I think my enchiladas were $14. All in all, I would eat there all the time if someone else was paying.
