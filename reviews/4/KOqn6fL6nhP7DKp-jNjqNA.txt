So there is an argument about this particular establishment at my job. 

One Camp states if you need to be um more....regular....go here.
The other camp loves this place.

I watched this argument for about a year before I decided to try Riva's.
I was glad I did. The portions are very large and tasty. 

I had the chorizo breakfast burrito with cheese and potatoes. I was extremely pleased to see that the burrito didn't eat its way out of the paper bag via grease. 

I have joined the love it camp here at work and for a quick bite I think you will too!
