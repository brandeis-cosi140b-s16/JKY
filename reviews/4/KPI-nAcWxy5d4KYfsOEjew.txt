We had a great mid-week lunch experience at the C4. The weather had warmed enough to sit out on the North patio in the shade.  We each had a starter, sandwich and desert and received attentive food service from Armon and beverage service from Stacey.  As explained to us the chefs specialize in their native style so for starters we had the "Tres Queso" Quesadilla with chicken and the Baja Crab Cakes.  Each was a cut above the norm from our experience plus smaller to fit our appetites.  The crab cake sauce and guacamole were outstanding accompaniments.  We then chose sandwiches as our next  course.  The chicken "Cordon Blue" with capicola ham and sharp cheddar was not fried as one might anticipate but rather a toasted whole grain bread.  Very tasty and worth experiencing again.  The California club was nothing to write home about but an enhancement would have been fresh sliced warm turkey vs. cold turkey (hint to owner).  We don't normally order desert but couldn't resist trying the frozen lime tart and the house churned ice cream of the day (pina colada).  Both would be very good with a drink overlooking a sunset but it was only 1 PM and we were in the shade...  
We took a self-guided tour of the enchanting hotel pool and discovered the roof patio which looks inviting in the evening.  As a an early riser (see my sunrises) I can tell we will have to return for an unobstructed sunset in the future with light cloud cover.   As locals we probably wouldn't stay at the Boutique Hotel but noted the covered parking plus relative proximity to downtown for short walks to Steele Indian School Park and the high rises along Central.
