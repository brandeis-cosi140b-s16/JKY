So I'm writing another update.  This has become one of my favorite local restaurants.  I told my daughter she could pick a restaurant for dinner and she picked El Ranchero.  We were just there 2 days ago!  Tonight I talked with the owner, Elias a little.  Very nice guy.

I tried something different-Chili Rellenos.  It was a whole roasted poblano pepper filled with a blend of 4 cheeses, dipped in an egg batter and cooked, then smothered in a light and flavorful tomato and onion based sauce.  Awesome!  It was somewhat similar to an omelet and Elias said they could make it for breakfast if I wanted to come by any morning.  

I think updates are limited to 5.  Before long I will be able to write a review of each and every menu item.  So far I've only tried about 6 different things.  My daughter had tamales for like the third trip to El Ranchero in a row...
