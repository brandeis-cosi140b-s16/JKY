Nearly every time i'm in Madison to visit my sister and her family, at least one dinner is at or from Laredo's. And I always end up getting the same thing- the Beef Chimmichanga. 

I will admit that I'm not an expert on Mexican food, but i think this place does well if you're having a craving and as with all things, you always have to temper your expectations. It won't blow you away, but it'll be enough to satisfy that Mexican-itch in your tummy.
