When shopping at Sun Vally Quilts we often stop at Don Jose. The restaurant is a part of a rather dismal strip mall and the inside of this place is pretty much what you would expect. 

But it is inexpensive with decent food and a lot of it. 

The guy taking orders is very nice and concerned for his customers. He deals with the older crowd from Sun City very well. Helpful does not say enough.

It is too bad they can not control the other customers conversations as we had the luck to overhear about eight bovine brained men making fun of the now married gay folks in California and the current situation.
