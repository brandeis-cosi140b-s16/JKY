This is an emotional review. We have gone on vacation to Sedona twice and both times we have come here for Mexican and a pitcher of margaritas before we drive from phoenix to Sedona. It is the start of a wonderful week. 

The food has been a solid 3 stars both times but the pitchers of margaritas are cheap and pretty damn good. They have a decent patio. 

This place makes me happy lol.
