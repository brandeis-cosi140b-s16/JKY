Saw this place for the first time and  the sign definitely got my attention, so i decided to try it and got a Torta of Pastor and a quesadilla. I must admit I am extremely picky when it comes to good mexican food, but this place is definitely good. I cannot give it a 5 star rating yet based on the fact that i have not had the tacos, but if the tacos are as good as the Torta and the Quesadilla were then consider my next rating a 5 star. Great food + Great Service = Great first impression and definitely will be coming back!
