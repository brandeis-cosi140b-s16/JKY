This was a delicious choice for dinner last night.  Based on recommendations from other Yelpers, we ordered the fresh made guacamole (which was delicious!  Maybe it's the poblano peppers?) and the "hot" salsa (which we didn't find very hot).  Our server was very friendly and when we mentioned it was our first visit, she walked us through the menu and made some great recommendations based on what we were in the mood for.  We weren't prepared for the half price pitchers on Mondays, but I did have a very tasty frozen margarita.

We ordered things from the "Authentic" side of the menu and were not disappointed. The Camarones Mojo y Ajo had a delicious unique flavor.  The Enchiladas Sulzas were very tasty, and the side of beans are AWESOME.  We also each enjoyed a taco on the side - I recommend avoiding the crispy shell (with so much stuffing it broke fairly quickly) but the Carne Asada and Carnitas Johnny tacos both were delicious.

We had enough food to feel super full (even though their desserts sound tasty too!) and I have some leftovers, too.  It was a bit pricier than we're used to paying for Mexican food which may prevent us from going all the time, but we'll definately be back!
