Whenever I'm craving chipotle I always come here(mainly because it's closest)! As others have said there isn't much of a difference over the others. I would suggest going to any chipotle during the week vs. The weekend because they tend to give you more meat! Sometimes I go to chipotle and I end up getting a "sloppy wrapper" and my whole burrito ends up falling apart:( but overall the food is amazing and the service is grood! It's nice when the cashier makes small talk!:)
