Their guacamole will leave you speechless! I ordered the full size portion and they brought out all the fresh ingredients and made it right in front of me.

Overall their food is pretty standard and what you expect from a Mexican restaurant. 

They have great drink specials around happy hour so I definitely recommend taking advantage of them to unwind from work. 

Enjoy!
