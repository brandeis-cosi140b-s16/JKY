Tried their al pastor tacos earlier this evening. My fiance and I have tried al pastor all over phoenix and this restaurant has by far the best. What caught our attention is that the al pastor is cooked outside and directly from the spit grill which is how it should be cooked!! The flavor is great. We waited quite a bit which is why I rated 4 stars. The corn in a cup I ordered took even longer. They  need more staff.
