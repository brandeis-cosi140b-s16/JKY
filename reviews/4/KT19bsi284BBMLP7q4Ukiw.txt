well the price was definitely great!! we got the free burrito/taco coupons at the red bull vegas am jam skate competition. after watching all the excitement we worked up an appetite. we had takeout so we can't really judge the service but the place was very stylish and the service was very quick-less then 5 minutes in & out. the tacos were great-the steak was marinated & grilled so it had great flavor. the pico & cheese were fresh & tasty. the shells got a little limp from the ride home but overall they were very good-a little better than qdoba. we will return
