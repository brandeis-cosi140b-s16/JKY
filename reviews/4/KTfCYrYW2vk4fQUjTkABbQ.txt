We had a happy hour event on the spacious, airy patio last night at Flicka's. Great turn out, perfect weather, good company, good service, great night!

I forgot all about the free "Friday happy hour" buffet indoors and ordered the spinach and shrimp salad. I was was pleasantly surprised by the price of the salad, which was MUCH more reasonable than other restaurants I have been too lately ($5 for a small bowl of shoestring fries at that other place?!) The shrimp was grilled and good! I had enough leftover for a late night snack. That's what I'm talking about!

I just read a previous review about the horrible sewer ladies bathroom smell. Yup...still there. The toilet had clogged (if that happens all the time, why not install industrial toilets?!...duh) and water was all over the floor. There was a Hawaiian air freshener (the same one I have in my bathroom at the moment) in there that smelled awful mixed with foul sewer smell. I know I can never buy THAT air freshener again.

Flicka's- you would have had a five star rating without the sewer-smelling, wet floor bathroom, with the bathroom door propped open while I used the toilet....but thanks for the offer to use the employee bathroom.

Has Captain Morgan flown the coop? I didn't see him inside on bathroom runs.
