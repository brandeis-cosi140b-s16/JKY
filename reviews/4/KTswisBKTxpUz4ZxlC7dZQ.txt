Unless it's a chain restaurant with crappy food to begin with, I generally start my base rating of chains with 3 stars and then add or subtract depending on various factors such as cleanliness, service, etc.  I like Chipotle because they focus on getting their meat from sources that place an emphasis on the welfare of the animals.  I feel that when the animals are treated humanely during their life (not stuffed in a tiny box all their lives and walking around in their own waste) it reflects upon the taste of the meat.  As a result, I'm a big fan of their carnitas.  I feel you can really taste the difference, and if it's a few dollars more for it, it's worth it to me.  When I went here they really loaded up my burrito so I got a lot for my money, and everyone was very friendly and provided great service.  Would go here again!
