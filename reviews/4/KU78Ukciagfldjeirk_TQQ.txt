Micheladas and ceviche. 2 items that will make me come back to this restaurant. Both are made from scratch here and can be found on every other table when we were there. Sit outside after the sunsets for a good experience.  The restaurant is not quiet, but alive with energy. Good staff and clean restrooms. Half doors, wild west style make you think twice about blowing up the toilet. Good play management,  good play. Kinda hipster,  but the food makes up for it.
