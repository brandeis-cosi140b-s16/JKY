I Yelped Best Mexican Food in Las Vegas, and ended up here. Lucky!!! I know remember this joint from Tijuana and I shall say that it is indeed a true and authentic Tijuana street taco. No way!! Not in the states, ok, cause I never, ever ran into a taco joint that makes "those" type of tacos. The tacos are all pretty much$ 2.00 a piece and there small and have that crazy guacamole like in Tijuana. They also will offer you grilled onions, grilled jalapenos and have a salsa bar off to the side at no charge. Cool. Plus they have free refills. But like I said, it's the same taco they sell in Tijuana so why change it right? The neighborhood it's in is kinda shady . FYI..... that's the star that's missing on my review. Go and eat some delicious tacos, it'll be worth it.
