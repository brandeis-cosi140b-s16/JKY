The food here may not be the best or most authentic in the Valley but it is pretty good and fresh and, once you factor in the great prices, an excellent value!  The chips and salsa were fresh and tasted great.  I ordered the Steak Picado and it was really good!  The inside might have been a little run down, but the atmosphere was bright and cheery and the staff, though hurried, were very friendly.  The food came out hot and quick.  I definitely plan on going here again!
