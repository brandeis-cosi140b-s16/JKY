Best chips and salsa in town! The chicken Taquitos are AWESOME!!! Always a friendly staff when we go.. I'm a HUGE guacamole fan and this place just doesn't meet the mark... Clean and nicely decorated.. I always take friends and family there for good Mexican food! Good spot for large groups or families with kids! The food comes out fast, and if you're on a diet, they'll make it however you request it!
