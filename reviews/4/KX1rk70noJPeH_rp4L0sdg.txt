Finally put a restaurant that wont go out of business in this spot.  This location is smaller than the other places here but it still good size for this area.  I love this corner with all the upscale food and shopping.  Chipotle will do well here and as always the food is consistently good quality and fast service.  I always get a burrito or burrito bowl with chicken or steak but you cant go wrong with anything here.
