Just got the carnita special (with corn tortillas) from the food cart on the Capitol square.  The price was $8.

The señorita taking my order was attentive and polite.  A couple customers stopped by and chatted with her briefly, so they must get regulars.

The carnita meat, hot sauce, cilantro and guacamole were really good.  No radishes or salsa verde like I'm used to, which is fine - might just be a regional thing.  However, the tortillas were a bit stiff, like they were taken straight from the packaging or were just microwaved, not heated up on the griddle. In any case they stuck together in a way that it was clear that if they were heated up, they weren't heated separately. The beans tasted exactly like the Rosarita "spicy jalapeño" brand you get out of a can, and didn't have any cheese on top.  The rice was good, but was just regular Mexican rice - for $8 would be nice if they went a little further and put some veggies in there like onions, potatoes, carrots, peas or something.

I'd give the experience about 3.5 / 5 stars on the whole.  I'll stop by again some time and try a different menu item.
