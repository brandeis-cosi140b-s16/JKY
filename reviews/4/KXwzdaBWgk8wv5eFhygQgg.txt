The only reason this place is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the location. It's in the same building as Sapphire Gentlemen's Club, which I got from reading let reviews, but even knowing this I was still super confused. They don't even have a sign anywhere near the road or anything to help people out so if you don't know it's in the same building you're kind of screwed. 

But other than that, it was amazing. I only eat organic so this place was awesome. From all local farms with no added anything. Had the table side guac (except we didn't have it made table side since there were only 2 servers on and it was pretty busy, they might want to staff better) but none the less it was amazing and then we all had enchiladas, so good! and the house margarita was huge and delicious! definitely will be going back soon since they are open 24 hours!
