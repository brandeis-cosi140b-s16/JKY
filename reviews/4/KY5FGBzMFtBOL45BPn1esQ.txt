I've been a longtime fan of Macayo's so I decided to finally write a review for them. I came here last Friday (7/29/11) for a Birthday dinner and as usual the service and food were stellar. It was really packed on Friday night yet the team still manage to efficiently serve my party of 8 as well as bring out our orders in a timely fashion. My favorites here are the Taquitos enchilada style and if you don't mind calories the Baja Chimi is delicious (one of my favorite guilty pleasures!).  Everything comes with free chips and salsa (there are two or three different salsas, make sure to ask for the spicy one if you're into heat!). Really good Happy Hour too! I haven't been to any other Macayo's location so I am only speaking on behalf of this Ahwatukee location.
