How could you not love it here!? Great atmosphere  great location, great food and drinks. Just a fun escape, feels like you're lounging at some beach cantina - you forget you're in Vegas. Good music and overall feel.

(Tip - if you sit outside, ask for a table in the shade - it's well-worth the longer wait. If you're in the direct sun, like we were, you'll roast and sweat if you don't ask and once you lock into your seat, it's tough to move because apparently those seats in the shade are locked up by those waiting in line. We eventually got to move though (since they realized we were in for the long haul that afternoon, haha... many, many drinks.) 

PS - Swear this is true but that night after Cabo I had a dream like Point Break where I was in charge of finding the head of a surfer crew who was robbing banks, lead by Sammy Hagar. I found them surfing at a cove in Mexico, chased him up a mountain side to the edge of a cliff where he jumped, turned in the air, flipped me off while smiling, pulled a ripcord and base jumped. He cut the cord in the air, tucked and rolled, yelled and took off in an awaiting jeep.

Um... yeah. That dream was probably because of the combo of Sammy' music, too much sun and too many drinks, haha.
