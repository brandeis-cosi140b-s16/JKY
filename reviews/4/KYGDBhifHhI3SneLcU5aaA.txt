I tried out this place for lunch yesterday and after ambitiously deciding to walk there and back, it was very rewarding. The owner/manager recognized me even though I was sporting my sweaty-overworked look that afternoon.

Because of my famished and starry state of mind, I didn't analyze the menu or the diggs, I got my vegetarian bowl and dipped out.. Tisk Tisk, I know. 

The vegetarian comes with guacamole so I have no price complaints. They offer brown rice, which makes them stand apart in my mind from the other Southwestern burrito chains. Everything look really fresh and well-stocked, that includes the staff... I believe my compostable to-go bowl passed through a total of six pairs hands. Honestly, 12 hands. Now that's service!

My total was $5, with a coupon which wasn't hard to come by. And yes, their interior designer also chose to go with the industrial tin-can theme, but they do have an outdoor patio with umbrellas!
