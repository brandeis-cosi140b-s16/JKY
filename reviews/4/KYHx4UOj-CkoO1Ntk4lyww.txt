Very good food, the ladies who serve it up are also very nice.  They have beer which is a nice touch for such a small place.  I have been here probably about 6 times as it is nearby my office.  The first 2-3 times I went it was so good! I recommended everyone went there.  So good in fact, the line was out and around the building! But, then it wasn't so good.  I am happy to report they are yummy again!! I tried a shrimp and mahi taco today and it was awesome!! Definitely recommend!
