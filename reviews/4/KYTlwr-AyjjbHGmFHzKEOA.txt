So a group of friends and I went here on a Sunday afternoon after church . To be honest I have seen this place before, but live in the city... Sad  I know. The customer service was great and the food came out pretty quick. The taste was better than most generic Mexican restaurants out in Arizona. I had the cardne asada burrito, but I need to try other things. I recommend coming here.
