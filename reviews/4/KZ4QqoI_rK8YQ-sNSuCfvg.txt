A good place to go to get out of the venetian for some mexican food.  Had the guacamole and queso dip for the chips.  Apparently we had too much dishes and a table meant for 4 seating 6, so things were a bit tight.

I had the Isla Asada which was an asada steak served with some vegetable sides.  Pretty much a steak fajita with meat that has not been precut.
