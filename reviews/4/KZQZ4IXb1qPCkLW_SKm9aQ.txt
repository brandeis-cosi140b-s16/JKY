I stopped in here today and tried the 5 tacos for $5 special. I had the adobada tacos and I thought they were very good. The chips they gave me for free looked like standard out of the bag but the salsa was home made and I liked it. Gave me a little nostalgia of eating at a taco stand in downtown LA when I was a kid so I had a good time.  I'll definitely eat here again if I'm in the area.
