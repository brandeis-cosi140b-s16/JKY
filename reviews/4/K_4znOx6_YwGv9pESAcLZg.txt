Four stars because of the food. Its fresh mexican food, everything I've ever ordered from there is the bomb. Highly recommend it for the food. 

Service, not so great. The server was busy but walked passed my table many many times like 10 times within 10 minutes without asking if I was ready to order or anything but was attending all of her other tables. I started with an appetizer. Then another 20 mins went by before she got my order. Spent a lot longer to dine than what I planned on. I planned on a quick stop for some street tacos and guac. Two hours later, I was finally paying my bill.
