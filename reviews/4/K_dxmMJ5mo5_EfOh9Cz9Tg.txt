We went to Garcia's for a dinner.  Our party was large---6 adults, 2 toddlers and a newborn.  The restaurant gladly accomodated us.  They had high chairs for the toddlers but no sling for the baby carrier.  However, that was resolved by putting the baby carrier on a chair.

The restaurant is typical of Mexican restaurants in that they bring out the tortilla chips and salsa.  What was different, however, is that in addition to the salsa, a bean dip is also brought out.  Both were quite spicy---not spicy enough to burn your mouth but still noticeable.

The portions for the main courses were huge.  I ordered a make your own combo platter with a chile relleno and a shredded beef taco.  The taco was good.  The chile relleno was unusual in that it was the spiciest one I've ever had!   Chile rellenos are--as a rule-- a mild dish.  I asked others in our party what they thought about their meals and they, too, found theirs to be spicier than usual.  

Service was excellent.  The waiter was very attentive and patient.  We would go again next time we're in town but now know to expect food that's uniformly spicier than usual.
