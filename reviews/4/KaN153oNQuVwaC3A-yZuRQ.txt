Tip: When it says 3.99 a la carte, it's actually only 1 taco. Only the taco plate has 2 tacos. We made that mistake and our bill ended up tripling in price. 

On a brighter note, the horchata was fantastic! This is the first time I've seen horchata filled with so much fruit and it was such a large size, perfect for sharing. We ordered the slow cooked pork taco and I thought it was a little too messy. I enjoyed the fish tacos the most, light and crispy.

Also loved the extensive salsa bar and the fact there is cilantro salsa!
