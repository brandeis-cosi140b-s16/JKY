The best Mexican food I've tried so far in the area. I ordered the Carne Asada meal which came with 8 oz of meat a cheese enchilada and rice and beans. The carne asada was the best I've had. Sometimes it gets dry and chewy at other places, but here it was juicy and the perfect balance of meat and fat. My wife even like it and she doesn't really eat beef. My wife liked her food and had a tostada left for lunch the next day, she said the house margarita was great too. Our 18 month old had a cheese enchilada and rice and beans, her favorite and was very happy. Only negative was it looked like they were short staffed. Our server was running all over the place and forgot a couple things at times but always apologized, looked like more of a staffing issue not his fault. Definitely will be back and we will recommend Manuel's.
