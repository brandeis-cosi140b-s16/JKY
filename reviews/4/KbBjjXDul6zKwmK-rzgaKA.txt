It's hard to say much more after so many people have raved about the place before you, so let's keep it short and sweet. Good food and drink at great prices, served by really gracious staff in a comfortable, casual atmosphere. In a city where good Mexican food is found in abundance, the fare here easily stands above the rest. I'm getting a really strong craving for their tacos and elote  even as I type this review, so I presume there will be yet  another visit to Gallo Blanco real soon.
