I've been looking for a real, "authentic" mexican food place in Phoenix since I moved here a year and a half ago, and this place is the best I've been able to find. The fact that it's about 3 minutes away from my house makes it even better!

The first thing I love about this place is the albondigas soup. It's AMAZING. It's just your basic vegetable soup with carrots, potatoes, celery and squash and best of all, MEATBALLS! The broth is very flavorful and always super hot!

There are whole bunch of things I haven't tried on the menu because I always go for one of the combination plates. I get a mixture of either the enchiladas, tamales, tacos or burros because they're all so equally good! The plate is served with a hefty serving of rice and beans (the rice could maybe use a little work but the beans are great!) 

Get an order of chips and salsa! The salsa has this hint of mint to it that I've never tasted before and sometimes I go here just to get chips!!  All in all, great food, GREAT PRICES and great service.
