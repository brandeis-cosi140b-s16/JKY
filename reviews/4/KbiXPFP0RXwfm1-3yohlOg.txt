Can't go on a trip without Mexican food! And Deigos hit the spot!.... Nice place, with a great decor. Everyone is very friendly and attentive. We made reservations, which I highly recommend. We had a group of about of 6 and they set us in a red room in the back. It was nice aand quiet, only a couple more tables around us. 

This can be causal or semi dressy. But it's vegas, come on! :) You have to always be in style! 

My friends had the tortilla soup, which they enjoyed. 
Empanadas
Braised Chicken with Red Chile and Roasted Tomatoes with Guacamole and Ancho Tomatillo Salsa , You dont get many, bc this is considered a small plate. Plus with the margaritas you will be drinking, I repeat you will be drinking, small plates are the way to go.

I also had: Diego Seafood Cocktail
Grilled Lobster Tail, Citrus Poached Shrimp & Scallops, and Lump Crab, with a Chipotle Cocktail Sauce. The portion for this was perfect! I was a bit full, barely could finish my drink. But they did a great job!

Everything cooked well and great flavors.
