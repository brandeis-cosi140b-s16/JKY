Nothing says late night good eats like a taco stand.  i would feel somewhat defeated if I were to return home without the satisfying feeling of having had a good meal.  i am not referring to a greasy mess of available at a local college hangout or a dingy drive-thru.  I am talking about some well priced, made-with-care food.  Tacos La Hacienda provides this.  Nothing but outdoor seating, so I don't know if I would show up in the winter time, but when the weather is warm and inviting, this is a certain destination for me.  I opted for the tacos, carne asada, lengua, and chicken, with everything of course.  I was so close to ordering the breakfast items, which are available all day.  But I was quite happy with my selection.  Good amount of meat and pico de gallo stuffed in.  Bottles of guac and savory hot sauce are available when dining in, in as in outside.
