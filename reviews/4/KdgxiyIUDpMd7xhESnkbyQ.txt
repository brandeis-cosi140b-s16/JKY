If you like taco salads, go to this place. Wicked good taco shell salads.  SO fresh and SO good. Pretty good variety of ingredients, and tasty. Plus, they serve beer. Definitely not attempting to be authentic Mexican, so if that's what you want, go somewhere else. But, they're really good for what they specialize in. Also have lots of options being my gf is vegan they have a all vegetable burrito and you can add potatoes or even sweet potatoes. They also have an option for fish tacos or fish burrito which is great. I usually got to chipotle but this is a great second option esp if your looking for fish or potato tacos.

Atmosphere is relaxing, and it's a clean place and is decorated brightly.

I've never had a bad experience here. (knock on wood)
