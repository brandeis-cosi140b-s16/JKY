The hostess was a little rude when we first showed up, but our waitress was great and so was the food.
They have a whole entire page dedicated to Vegan food, which really surprised me and also made me like this place a whole lot more. I got the vegan nachos which were great. The pricing is decent, I'd definitely return.
