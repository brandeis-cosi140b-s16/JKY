We took online advice and made an early ish reservation for 6:45. We arrived on time but did not get seated until 7:05 even though there were at least 6 empty tables in the main dining room alone. Once seated we were quickly greeted and we put in a drink and guac order right away. The drinks seemed to take forever to come out. My only complaints would be that our drinks went empty and we waited and waited for refills and the lobster crab dynamite is disgusting. Everything else we tried was delicious and we ended with an amazing chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream. The dessert redeemed everything! The food is unique and the atmosphere is fun and great for people watching (we sat between a table full of women who have had too much plastic surgery and a table with really young girls with much older men). Try it. You will either love it or hate it just like the rest of Scottsdale.
