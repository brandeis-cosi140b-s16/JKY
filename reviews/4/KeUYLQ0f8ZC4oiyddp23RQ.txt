Great little restaurant with family style mexican food. Their chips and salsa are always good and they are quick to refill it. The service is great but gets a little hectic around normal lunch hours M-F so I try to go earlier or later.

I recommend their chimichanga and their carnitas plate. Very good portions too, enough where you can probably share.

I think the food is way better here than overpriced places like Agave.
