My quest for the perfect breakfast burrito near my hood led me to Poliberto's this morning. At $3.25/breafastirito, their prices are good.

My potato/egg/cheese burrito was tasty & so was their hot sauce. The green is hotter than the red.

I added guacamole to my rito when I ordered, but when I got home and started gouging myself & chowing down, I was a bit disappointed to find that the bit of guac was concentrated almost entirely near the bottom of the burrito. Other than the guac skimping, I thoroughly enjoyed the burrito & will most likely be back. The quest continues!
