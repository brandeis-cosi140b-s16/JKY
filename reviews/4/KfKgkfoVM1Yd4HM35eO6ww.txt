What do "Hotel California", "Stairway To Heaven", easy listening music, and Spanish guitar have in common? Lindo Michoacan. There was a great assortment of reworked classic rock playing softly throughout the restaurant today. It was a nice touch to an already beautiful restaurant. There in no shortage of painting and carved wood at this place. And so the afternoon started well enough.

I began my lunch with the traditional chips and salsa with bean dip thrown in for good measure. So far so good.  Next came the sopa de fideo. Its like Lipton noodle soup only better and perfect on a cold day like today. For my meal I ordered chicken fajitas. They came out quick enough. My respect started waining when I saw only two under cooked tortillas for what looked like a large portion of fajita fixings. It turned out there was just enough chicken, rice and beans to wrap in two tortillas. Yet there was more than enough pepper and onion to go around. I ended up eating those plain with a fork after my chicken and tortillas were gone. The flavor was lacking. I like more citrus flavor in chicken fajitas so I squeezed the lemon from my iced tea over the sizzling skillet for that sour boost of flavor. During this meal I couldn't help but think of giving Michoacan a 3 star rating as much as it pained to do so. Then came dessert.

I ordered flan which, I was told by who appeared to be the manager, was "heavenly." I'll be the judge of that. I've had some good flan at many other restaurants in the past. This better be special. It  was.  It was firm and thick yet velvety soft. Rich. Decadent. Creamy. I don't know how to better describe it. It really was one of the best flans I've had anywhere. And there it was, the boost I so desperately needed to give them a deserved 4 stars.
