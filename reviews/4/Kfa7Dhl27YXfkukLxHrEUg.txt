Perhaps the best Filiberto's in town certainly superior to the any rivals around it. It may seem silly to rate a fast food joint that is part of a franchise but unlike Macdonald's, Wendy's, In and Out, etc. Filibertos are not all equal and it is important to know which berto's to go to at 3am; the one 3 miles west of your home or the one 3 miles north of your home.

But in general Filiberto's is well known among Phoenix locals, although everyone stands on either one extreme end of the spectrum or the other. For those who share my love for 24 hour taqueria this the best the north valley has to offer. 

For those of you that are new to filiberto's and are perhaps just visiting the valley for short time or are moving to one of our great cities i would use this rule: Treat Filibertos food like you would the tap water in Mexico avoid it if you aren't going to be around that long but if you are here for the long haul give it a few chances to let your stomach acclimate then enjoy.
