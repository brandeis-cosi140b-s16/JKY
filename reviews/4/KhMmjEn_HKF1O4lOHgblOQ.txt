So here we are, Tuesday night dinner and I'm not really hungry.  I mean I've normally got a healthy appetite (healthy appetite -you know, something more than just a salad or a nibble of something)  but tonight I'm not so hungry so I ask if I can split a quesadilla with hubby.   Steak please.  He comes home with that thing and at first I'm thinking this isn't right cuz the container is too light.  Yes I know a tortilla, cheese, and beef really shouldn't weigh a lot.  Don't ask me what I was thinking.  Besides, by then it was probably my stomach talking.
Opened it up and revealed the toasty, fragrant tortilla with Mexican cheese and chunks of beef.  *inhale*  A small nibble and my taste buds were telling me to stop multi tasking and just eat.  The tortilla was darn near perfect tonight.  The cheese was buttery, and not too much either.  And the ideal amount of tender beef was included.  The green salsa caught me by surprise tonight.  A little fire there.  I used almost an entire bullet for a half of my meal.  I don't understand, I really wasn't that Hungry tonight.
I still had to have some red salsa.  I was torn.  The quesadilla was delicious by itself.  Warm, toasty tortilla with cheese and beef.   Mmm mmm.
And here I wasn't very hungry.
This place is consistently good.  
Fresh salsas.
Green Chile Burritos.
Breakfast Burritos.
Thin, crispy, tortilla chips.
And the staff is courteous,  knowledgeable,  and have been pleasant every time I've been there.
It all keeps me (us) coming back for more.
