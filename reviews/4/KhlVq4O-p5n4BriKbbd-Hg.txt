Since I have not had the chance to partake in their happy hour, my review will be based solely on the food and service.

Probably the best thing about this place is value for your money.  Yes, you do have to pay $1.75 for chips and salsa, but when you can get a burrito for $6.95, it ends up being a great value.  With a few sprinkles of salt, the chips were good and the salsa bar gives you the chance to enjoy different flavors with your chips (and meal.)

I had the carnitas burrito which was tasty, but was made unevenly such that all the rice was on one side and all of the carnitas and beans were on the other side.  Not too big of a deal; I just had to be strategic in piecing together my bites.  The nice thing is that it was a good size burrito; not some "as big as your head" monstrosity.

I was full after the meal so I didn't get a chance to try any of their desserts, but the Kahlua brownie with ice cream sounded delicious.  Maybe next time...
