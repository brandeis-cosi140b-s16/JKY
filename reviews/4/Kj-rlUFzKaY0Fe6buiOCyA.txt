Was there for brunch today and my overall experience was good!! I ordered red menudo and it was delicious!! 
My daughter order a breakfast burrito (eggs, bacon, potatoes and cheese) which was huge and good (so she said). My wife ordered Green Sour cream enchiladas which come with rice and beans. Wife liked her food as well. I tried her meal and I liked rice and beans, but the enchiladas not so much. 
Loved the ice tea. It tasted fresh and best of all was not cloudy like it usually is in many restaurants. 
I would definitely come back and try something else from their menu.
