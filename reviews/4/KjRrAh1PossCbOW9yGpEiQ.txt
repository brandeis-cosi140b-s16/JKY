I am going to give Del a bump up to 4 stars today.  Service was strong and fast.  More importantly it was accurate.  Del Taco has updated their menu adding many new items like the Jacked-up BRC Burrito, the Spicy Crunch Burrito and the Chili Cheese Fries Burrito.  Way to go Del Taco.  You have some awesome new food and I am now encouraged to come back and try it all.
