OK Chipotle is pretty much fast food and I have heard it's owned by McDonald's (EWW), but I'm in love with it! My favorite thing to get is a burrito bowl. I get lettuce, cheese, black and re-fried beans, spicy beef, sour cream, corn, and rice. Deliciouso! You can also get a burrito, tacos, salads, and they will make cheese crisp for your little ones or you if you ask. Also they make vegetarian options with guacamole instead of meat. The portions are huge for a great steal so you will never leave hungry. A great place for a filling lunch or dinner, and you can get it to go as well. This location gets pretty packed at dinner time, but it's worth eating on the patio once the hot day is cooling down.
