It is a pretty authentic place. It's good that it is around the corner from my house. The serving staff is great, the food is good as well. The owner and the managers are always around, which is most likely why the service is soo good. My favorite is the Carnitas al la Coca Cola. It has a sweet and smokey favor to it. Will we go back? Hey, it is around the corner from my house, of course we will.
