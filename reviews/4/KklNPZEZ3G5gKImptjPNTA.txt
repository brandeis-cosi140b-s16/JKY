Had a great time here.  The nachos were huge and delicious, they had a good selection of beer, and the margaritas were enormous (when they ask you if you want small or large, consider carefully)!

After four of us split the nachos we weren't very hungry, so we ended up splitting two orders of fish tacos amongst three of us; and even that we couldn't finish.  But the tacos were delicious and the seating area (up front) was perfectly pleasant and not overly loud.

Will definitely return if I'm in the area.
