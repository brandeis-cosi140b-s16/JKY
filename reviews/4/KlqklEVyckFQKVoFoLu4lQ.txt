Love this place! If you love Mexican food you definitely have to try this place out! My favorite is hands down the flour tortilla chicken flautas! This is a great mixture with the complimentary chips salsa and beans that you get before you order! Also they have a Sunday brunch buffet that is always a great deal. From the homemade tortillas to the Mexican favorites for breakfast. Juevos con hamon, chile verde con pollo, bacon! Always got to have bacon! It's just a great atmosphere with live music playing
