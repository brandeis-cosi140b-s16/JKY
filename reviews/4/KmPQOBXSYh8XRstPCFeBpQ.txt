Why did the gurlpren and I decide to eat at Carlito's Burritos?
A)  We were starving and looking for something close
B)  Because Alicia R (aka Yes) said this place was good and we had to try them
C)  We haven't had Mexican food in a while
D)  Most of our Yelp friends gave them solid reviews
E)  All of the above.

If you answered E, you're the 2nd smartest Yelper I know.  

Carlito's is located on the southeast side of town and I have to admit, I'm a snob when it comes to Mexican food out here in the valley. Coming from San Diego, I never thought anyone out here would come close. Carlito's has changed my mind really quick.  But let me get one thing out of the way first.  When you drive up to this place, you see their sign that reads "Carlito's Burritos, New Mexican Restaurant".  That doesn't mean that this is a new establishment that serves Mexican food. It means that this is a restaurant that serves Mexican food from New Mexico.  Hah...I was one of those fools that misread their sign. 

Read the reviews, it's all about their burritos and tacos. But for me, it's all about their sopapillas, which is fry bread stuffed with chicken, shrimp, pork, or steak. Being the meat lover I am, I chose steak.  First impression...Man, this is a lot of food. I estimate around 8 oz of well prepared, well seasoned meat, stuffed into the fluffiest fry bread that I ever had. Top it off, it was literally topped off when red sauce. My meal was huge, but so good that my belly wouldn't allow me to quit until it was all gone.  Long story semi-long, try their sopapillas.  You won't be disappointed. 

Price is about average for most of their items. But the tacos and enchiladas are a steal of a price.  Big plus for service here. You get it with a smile, some convo, and of course, good food. 


PS: I also tried their chicken tamale and thought it was just okay. But that's just me.
