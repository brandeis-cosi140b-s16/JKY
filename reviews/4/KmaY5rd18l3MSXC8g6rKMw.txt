I just walked in--OK 15 minutes now--from Birthday Meal. I hadn't eaten at LPS in years; we haven't gone out to dinner in months, for that matter. I don't know why all the planets aligned, but my meal was incredible. I got the Shrimp Enchiladas, which were good. Red sauce pleasantly spicy. But what really took my breath away was the simple but delicious cole slaw and the rice. I always love a good Mex rice, and LPS' looked really good. But mine was white--and saturated with chicken taste. Moist, yet still the correct consistency for rice, and fantastic. Good stuff, and a fair price.
