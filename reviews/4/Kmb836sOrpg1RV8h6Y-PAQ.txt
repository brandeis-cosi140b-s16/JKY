OK, I found this place with my family a couple of months ago.  We have been there about 5 times since then.  It's not fancy, definetly needs an update on the decor.  But-has arguably the best cheese enchilada I have ever had.  Great chips and salsa, great serice, and excellent for a family dinner.  If you want to pig out on chips and salsa, great place to do it.
