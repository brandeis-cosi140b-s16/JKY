Not much to look at outside in a grim strip mall but surprisingly the inside is clean and has a nice charm. Server was very attentive and food was served hot and quick. I had the chorizo and eggs which was maybe a little salty but the spices were spot on. The beans were as good as I have had, the rice was fresh and the grilled jalapeno along with the avocado slices were the perfect garnish. I can't wait to try more of the menu as all dishes I saw looked great! Don't let the outside scare you as the inside and food is the real deal and worth the visit.
