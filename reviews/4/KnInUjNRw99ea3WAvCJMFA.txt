I don't normally give fast food this high of a rating, but I was very entertained the other night when I pulled up to the drive thru.  The guy who took my order was beyond funny.  I told him he missed his calling down on The Strip.  And the other guy that was working the kitchen that night was just as entertaining.  They got my order correct.  And it was good.  Definitely some of the best service I've ever had at a fast food restaurant.
