Yes I know it a fast food place so the food might not deserve 4 stars but this place is really satisfying! It's the only place I can go at 12:00 at night or later and get just made food that isn't just burgers and fries. The workers are always really nice, and that's not easy when working an all-nighter. One person there named Aaron used to always work at night and knew us cause we always dropped by super late. He was a prime example of their good service. My boyfriend and I have gone a bazillion times and they never get the order wrong or leave something out (as often happens at most fast food chains). The churros are one of the better ones you can get outside of Disneyland-cause Disney's are the best! And the shrimp tacos they sometimes offer are delicious. The cheese quesadillas are greasy but irresistible. I just don't iike how messy they are since my bf insist on not ever putting it on a plate...
