For some reason I only come here when I'm angry at the world.
And by world I mean my wife. And by angry, I mean eye daggers, not Ak-47's..

Yes, whenever I find myself in that weird place, too tired for a lingering sit-down dining experience, yet not hungry enough for a double Whopper with cheese, I come here.
But not before a series of long and drawn-out interrogatories from my wife.

Her:  "What are you in the mood for?"

Me: "Nothing, I want to go home, have a drink and crash."

Her: "How's Mexican sound?"

Me: "Not as good as a Crown and soda."

Her: "Italian?"

Me: [tightening up like a little kid, facial muscles now squinched] "I want to go home."

Her: "What about, I know, Thai...you love Thai."

Me: [with all the aplomb I can muster] "Can we please just go home?" 

Her: [not talking now, whipping her car into the Chipotle parking lot]

Me: [to cashier] Uh, yeah, give me three Dos Equis Ambers, a bag of chips and some guac."

Her: "Seriously?"

As I said, I only come here when I'm angry. 
Three Dos Equis Amber, guac, chips, and three tacos...twenty three bucks.
The look on her face throughout 'dinner'....not so priceless.
