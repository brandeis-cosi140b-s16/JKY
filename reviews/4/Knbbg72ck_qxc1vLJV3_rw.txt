Been wanting to try this place for a while now since I drive by it often.  Had dinner there last night.  Their Torta Cubana was AMAZING.... paired with a pretty strong mojito and a even stronger margarita... I had a pretty good meal.  

A lot of people were having birthdays that night so the waitstaff came out with gorilla masks on and banging pot lids (quite loud)... but the bday parties looked like they were having a good time.

I'm excited to come try this place in the summer when the garage doors come up and you can enjoy the weather while eating good food.

Just be careful, looks like menu items are on the pricey side as well as their drinks.
