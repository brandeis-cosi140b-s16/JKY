I am giving La Canasta 4 stars mainly because of location and their chips.  

I work in the Executive Tower at the Capitol and if you have been in that area, then you know that there are like no options for lunch other than the cafeteria at the DES building or the cafeteria in the basement of the Executive Tower. Frankly, there are some days where we want to escape the building but don't want to risk going downtown, which makes La Canasta a great option for those days.  Also, if you want political gossip, La Canasta is a great place because you can see the whos-who in politics at lunch and possibly overhear some good tidbits. Or you'll just hear staffers like myself and co-workers complaining about our jobs!

As I mentioned previously, the chips and salsa are delicious at La Canasta, but the rest of the food is just OK. It's nothing spectacular that warrants a special trip.  Soda and iced tea are $2.25 (unlimited refills) which is a tad high in my book.  The patio is nice to sit on especially when your office has no windows.  However, today upon leaving, we saw three birds on a table eating off some plates that were sitting on an empty table. I could have done without seeing that.
