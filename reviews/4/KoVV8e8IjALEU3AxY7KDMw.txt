I happened to stumble into Don P's late on a Sunday night accidentally with my brother when I first came to Charlotte
We both ordered the steak burrito dish with peppers, can't remember the name they call it on the menu, and we were thrilled. 
What we got was a Massive portion of fresh goodness, which is ridiculous because restaurants are notorious for low quality at the end of the night. But not at Don P's.

On my second visit, we all got treated to the man with the cart. He hooked up a preparation of made-to-order tableside Guac! If you haven't tried it yet, do so, you will not be disappointed.

Overall, Don P's is a fun experience and I've never been disappointed as a repeat customer. Word to the wise - ask them for some of their homemade hot sauce they have in the kitchen...it's damn good.

You simply can't go wrong with any of the combo plates, or the pork chimichanga if you want an interesting change of pace...
