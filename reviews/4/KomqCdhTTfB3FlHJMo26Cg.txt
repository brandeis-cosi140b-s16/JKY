I got props again from my boss for suggesting we eat here at Burrito's Juarez.  I was reading a review my cousin wrote on a Mexican restaurant and made me want to eat their food.  However, it was way too far from where I was at and didn't feel like driving all that way.  Luckily I found this location that was much closer.

We ordered two Fish (Tilapia) Tacos each, and shared Tortilla Chips with pico degallo and ordered guacamole.  How did my boss describe their fish tacos?  "like California Fish Taco's"  and supposedly by her standards, California makes the best fish tacos.  I did agree that the fish tacos were awesome.  The combination between the crunch of the fish and cabbage, to the soft tortilla married well.  They're huge and two was more than enough for each person.  

As for the Tortilla Chips, they were different and crunchier than most places I've had them from.  Their pico degallo were the best I've had and the guacamole, well that was just mushed avocado.  I'm used to having it with onions, a little tomato, and jalapeno.  But it was still good.

Tonight, I decided to eat there again and tried their Chico's Tacos.  This is a Taquito drenched in their red spicy sauce.  It wasn't too spicy.  It had enough kick to it.  If you wanted it hotter, they provide you with the hot sauce to add to it.  I didn't need it. It was perfect the way it was.

I'm definitely coming back because I really want to try the corn concoction.  I think it's called Elcote.  I'm not sure.  I'll probably have to come back to this review and make corrections.
