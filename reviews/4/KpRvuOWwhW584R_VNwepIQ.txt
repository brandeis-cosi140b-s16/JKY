This place reminds me of LA street taco stands but not as dirty and not in a shady alley. The restaurant is clean and very colorful. The service was fast and the food is very good in comparison to other Mexican fast food in LV.

We ordered the wet carne asada burrito and the shrimp taco. Overall we are very satisfied we will be coming back.
