I'm updating my review from 3 stars to 4.

Once again, service was great. Very attentive. Friendly. Professional. 

 Entertainment again tonight.

Taquito sampler was good. My kids devoured it. Burrito was amazing again.

I got the enchiladas again, but asked for red sauce this time instead of green.. much better. 

Tex mex salad wasn't great, but everything else was. 

Servers Sigy and Cecelia are great!!!
