I tried the steak which was cooked and seasoned just fine. The rice and beans were plain.
 The cheese crisp kid meal was completely covered in cheese. I was half expecting it to be sparsely covered. They did a fine job.
My kid was fussy and the server didn't make me feel rushed to get on my way.

The big win was that our server was on it. Good job with friendly service.
