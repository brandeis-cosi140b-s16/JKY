Went there for lunch on Sunday. Sat at the bar and received chips and salsa immediately. The salsa was really good, spicy the way I like it. I ordered 1 chicken taco, 1 carne asada and 1 grilled fish taco. My friend ordered the shrimp tacos. We received tacos, like taco bell fast, I was impressed. All 3 of my tacos tasted good. But as previous reviews mentioned, the carne asada is a little dry not sure why. My friends shrimp tacos looked awesome. I wish I would've ordered one. He said they were good and he would order them again. The staff was really friendly and the restaurant has a great vibe and feel. I love the patios. I will be back.
