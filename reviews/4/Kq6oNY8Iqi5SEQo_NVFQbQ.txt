On the way to dinner last night, my boyfriend and I ran into an old friend. We told him we were going out to eat and he said we should get burritos. My boyfriend was all over this idea and suggested we go to Qdoba at Stonecrest. 

Wow! Where have I been? I havent been to Qdoba since high school and I have no idea why!
We ordered our burritos... The line was a little slow but nothing major.... And then saw their $1 beer promo! Um yes please. We got a couple beers with our burritos and sat by the windows. 2 burritos and 4 beers only came to $20! Not too shabby.

It was so nice to have a great priced beer with a huge delicious burrito in a cool & comfortable atmosphere! 

Thanks Qdoba!

We will be back very soon!!! 

Definitely a fan! :) :)
