I didn't need to eat here to give it at least 3 stars because when I walked in I was woo'ed with the views.  As long as they had a good margarita and chips and salsa I was in!

Food was amazing, entire strip view was incredible, margaritas were tasty, chips were perfect, salsa was superb, and the staff was outstanding (that being said after both of my kids spilled a drink on the carpeted floor).
