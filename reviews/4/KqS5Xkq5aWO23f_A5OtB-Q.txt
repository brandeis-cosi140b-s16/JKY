I went there today for lunch and had the Mole Verde which was very good with nice heat and fall off the bone chicken. I had a tamarin soda, not quite sure what it was but it tasted good. I really like the low key local feel. The staff was very nice and it took about an hour for lunch, might of been shorter but it took Papa and me a while to figure out to pay at the counter. We tend to be chatty so there was no surprise on that one. It was fun to cruise around the mercado and listen to Papa question the staff on how to say certain things in espanol. I am looking forward to going back and trying more stuff, maybe I'll find another flavor of soda I can't identified and be delighted by it.
