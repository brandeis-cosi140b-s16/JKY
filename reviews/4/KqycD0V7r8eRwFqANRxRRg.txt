I am very surprised at the average rating for La Paz. I have been there many times and left impressed (and very full) each time. This is my first time posting a review for them, so I will try to summarize my experiences there. 

The food quality is definitely above average for Mexican restaurants. I would say it is quite on par with 1900 Mexican Grille and Cantina 15-11. 

The cocktails are very good as well. I am not much of a liquor drinker myself but my date loved their margaritas. 

The customer service was excellent. I believe I have had a different waiter/waitress each time and they each seemed very knowledgeable about their dinner and drinks menu and also very friendly and attentive. It is usually very crowded, especially for dinner, so being waited on rather than having to wait is crucial. 

Each time the store owner has made a point to greet us and ask how our experience has been. He even shared his business card with me (which had his personal cell number on it) so that we can call ahead and get the prime seats. 

I recommend this place to anyone who likes good quality Mexican food.
