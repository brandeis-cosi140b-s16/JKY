Very pleased with this place. I heard mixed reviews but we had a great experience here. Bright pastel colors gave it a south of the border feel - a stark contrast to the grunge of Main St outside.
Parking was decent, small lot but we had no problem finding a spot. Excellent service, the food was awesome. Tecate beer came in a can, unopened with a lime on top. 
The chips were a little bland though, but the salsa was good and had a nice kick to it and the bean dip was good too.
We had the chicken tacos and beef enchiladas and it was awesome. The rice was really good too. Much better then I've had elsewhere around town. 
Definitely will go back again.
