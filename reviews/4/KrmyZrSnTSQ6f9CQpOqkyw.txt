Was in the area and decided to stop by for lunch.  It's a small, casual dining restaurant with seating for about 20 people.  It has a small salsa bar, which is always a plus to me.

After browsing the menu for a while, I decided to order a Carne Asada Burrito ($5.25) and a Carnitas Taco ($2.65).  I asked the guy taking my order if they had a spicier Salsa than what they had on the Salsa Bar.  To my surprise, he said they had a Habanero Salsa that they make in the kitchen but it has to be a special request because it's that hot.....perfect!  I asked for a side of that too.

After a few minutes, it was ready and I picked up my order from the counter.  The Burrito was huge!  I eagerly took a bite with a little Habanero Salsa.....yum!  Very tasty and spicy!  The Carne Asada had a good flavor to it and was slightly dry, but that's ok with me.  There was a good ratio of Guacamole and Beans in the Burrito and the Tortilla held up well.....it didn't fall apart, which I don't enjoy.

The Carnitas Taco was just OK.  I thought the Carnitas lacked flavor.  I won't order this next time.

Overall, it was a good meal.

Will I return?  You bet.
