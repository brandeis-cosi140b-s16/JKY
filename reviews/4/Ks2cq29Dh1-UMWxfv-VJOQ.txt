You can tell that they are using fresh ingredients that are of higher quality than their competition's.  I've tried a few of the tortas.  All have been good.  Try the fish tacos.  Dressed up w/a few different salsas, onions, fresh tomatoes and slices of avacado, they have been consistent, fresh and sufficiently sized to fit the 2.99 pricetag.  

I recommend going in over the drive-thru, as they have a tendency to throw in a bag of tortilla chips with your order after they see you load up on a few of the salsa bar selections, which vary.  You have some time to browse the salsa bar as everything is made to order.  

The staff has always been friendly.  Several times, they have been over the top friendly and accommodating, throwing in samples of various items.
