Went here for breakfast with the family. I love their breakfast options, they have everything from huevos rancheros, to breakfast burritos, to pancakes! The breakfast burrito with asada was really good, and my daughter was able to get french toast. The chips and salsa were also good. The chilaquiles weren't actually my favorite, too much sauce, not enough egg, but overall I'd say it was decent. 

The decor is cute, very bright and colorful. Our waitress was very friendly and sweet. The location in my opinion isn't the best place to get a lot of business, you'd never see it from the street, but maybe if they advertise more it can become more popular. My only complaint was the amount of time it took to get our food. There were maybe 4  or 5 other groups eating when we were there and we waited a good 20 minutes to get our food.
