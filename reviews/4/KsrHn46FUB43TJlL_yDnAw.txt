I loved Gallo Blanco, I ate there 4 times while staying at the Clarendon.

Lunch: We tried various tacos and each one was delicious.  The pork quesadillas are outstanding.  The pork is so incredibly tender and flavorful.  The guacamole is none like I've had.  It includes oranges and it was divine.

Breakfast:  Breakfast is wonderful.  Much of the menu is Mexican inspired, I tasted the choizo & eggs and the breakfast burritto, they were very good.  The flapjacks are amazing, fluffy and tender with a hint of tang from the sour cream and buttermilk, served with warm butter and maple syrup, mmmm so good.  My favorite breakfast was the yogurt, with granola and fruit.  The best I've ever had.  The yogurt is from a local producer and the granola is homemade and included nuts. It was excellent.

Service.  Was good for the most part, but a couple of mornings when they were busier it lacked a little, but the staff was always friendly.  

It's amazing that such a great place is located within a hotel.
