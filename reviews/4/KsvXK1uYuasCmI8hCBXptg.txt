The Pollo Fundido is outrageously good.  Light and flaky shell, well seasoned chicken...spot on all around.  I also occasionally will pop in just to get a taco or two if I need to take care of a crunch fix.  Great salsa and I love that it's authentic Sonoran Mexican food without having to commit to a sit down restaurant.  I do have a little hole in the wall Sonoran Mexican joint that's been in Phoenix for 40 years that is slightly better (if not just because of childhood nostalgia), but to cover my bases all over the rest of the Phoenix Rural/Metro area, Someburros gets my vote.
