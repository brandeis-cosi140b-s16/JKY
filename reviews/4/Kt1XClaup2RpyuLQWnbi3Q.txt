A tiny hole in the wall that only some people know about, I was taken here by one of my fathers employees and initially I was a little uncertain, but having traveled in many countries taught me that some of the best places were hidden in very low key fashions... Got the steak tacos and they were excellent... Given it's pretty good location right off Thomas and Scottsdale road I am sure this place will be around for a while.... Definitely stop in if you are ever in the area!
