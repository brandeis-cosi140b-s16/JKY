In Phoenix on a business trip and I came here for dinner.

I wanted to get the Serranos Special Combination which comes with a beef taco, cheese enchilada and bean tostada. However, I wanted a tamale instead of the tostada. They wouldn't let me even for an extra charge. They lost a star over this. Instead I ordered the carne asada burrito enchilada style with the red enchilada sauce. The flavors were perfect. They did the red enchilada sauce right, using chilis (something you can't find in Miami) and the meat was tender and well seasoned.

The service was excellent (except for not allowing substitutions). They were very friendly and constantly checking in on me.

The ambiance was nice with plenty of seating.
