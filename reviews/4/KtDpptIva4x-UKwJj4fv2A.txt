This place is pretty cool, you come in and you get to choose what you want to put in your burrito; much better than those other mystery meat burritos I'm used to.

Mostly college kids from across the street, even on weekends.

Pretty basic and clean chipotle. Parking lot is shared with a strip mall and looks a bit shady, but hey, there's a coffee bean right across so I really can't complain much.
