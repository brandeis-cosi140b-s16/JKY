Love this place. I have never had a bad meal. Fajitas great. Enchiladas
rock. Carne Asada is out of this world. They catered a meal for 20 in January and we got tons of high fives. Wait staff is superb friendly ask for Miguel. We NEVER go to Laredos anymore with Casa in our backyard. Prices are reasonable as well. Juan runs a great operation.
