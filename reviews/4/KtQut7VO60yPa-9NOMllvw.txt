This business started in a dumpy little building South of the tracks.  They survived by serving great food.  As they have now moved to a much nicer location, their prices seem to have gone up but I am sure that it is because of the rent that they have to pay..  I wish they had better combo meals.  The staff seems well trained, and it is clean as far as I can tell.
