Manuel's Mexican Restaurant on Southern Ave. has always offered good, quick Mexican food. I've visited here for more than 10 years, and the food is always consistently high quality. I particularly like the green corn tamale with rice and beans (AKA, "Mix and Match"). The shredded beef taco is also tasty. My husband always gets the Fiesta Platter, theoretically an appetizer, because it has a bunch of little items to sample. 

For the past 10 years or so, the same friendly gentleman has served us the chips and wonderful Manuel's salsa. I think it shows that Manuel's is a quality restaurant for someone to work there for so long! Manuel's isn't fancy, but their food and friendly service keeps my family coming back again and again. Try it!

UPDATE: This location has the best "balloon sculpture guy" I've ever seen! If you have a kid, call ahead to see what nights the guy works. Yes, he really is that good.

(Note that this review ONLY applies to the Southern Ave. location. We have been very disappointed by other locations...)
