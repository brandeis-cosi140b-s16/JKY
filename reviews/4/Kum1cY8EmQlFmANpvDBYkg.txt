If you can get past the sometimes not too great service, the food is awesome. Drinks are great too. Especially the frozen daiquiris. Could definitely have better drink specials throughout the week. I really love the taco salads. 

Only complaint of all of my multiple visits: Rushed us out on my birthday. Made us feel like we had overstayed our welcome. I'm a bartender and always tip based on time spent as well so I didn't appreciate feeling like I was being pushed out of the door.
