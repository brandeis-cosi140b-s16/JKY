My husband's coworkers always rave about how much they love this place but we had never been here until April.  We've been here twice.  

Monday is all day happy hour.  We ordered the guacamole.  It has mandarin oranges (I think) mixed in with the avocados.  It's different and it wasn't my thing but my husband enjoyed it a lot. 

My husband ordered 4 shrimp tacos and I had a shrimp taco and a fish taco.  (The shrimp tacos were so good that we came back for them the second time.)  They're on the small side so I could have easily eaten a third if we hadn't had the guacamole.  They were both very good.  The fish is not breaded.  

The restaurant is an open space on one end of The Clarendon Hotel.  You have to walk past the front desk (if you miss the actual door just past the hotel door like we did on our way in) and through a bar area to get to the hostess stand.  I recommend getting a table outside or up against the windows.  We were seated in the middle of the room and I could hear noise from the bar and lounge area so it was pretty loud for me.  (Full disclosure - I have trouble hearing conversation if there is background noise and people speak softly so what I think is loud may not be what you think is loud - although the hostess did hear 3 when we said 2 and put three menus on the table)  The second time we were able to get a table in the corner and the noise level was much better.

Our waitress was great and did not have to be asked to refill our waters and we didn't have to wait to get our bill when we were done.  And we never felt rushed either. I didn't catch her name but the name on my receipt says Mariah.  (The second time the waiter was also good.)

I can see us coming here fairly often.
