Was able to visit twice in the last couple of days, once for lunce and once for dinner.  The dinner menu is interesting and with very interesting choices for Mexico City style food.  Not your typical mexican fare at all.  The carnitas street tacos are very good and the corn on the sides menu was fantastic.  We also ordered the ribs which were also very good.  The portions are small, but tasty and personally I like being able to sample several dishes instead of simply feasting on one.  Finished with the churros and with the dulce de leche dipping sauce, they were very good.
The lunch menu was a trimmed down version of the dinner menu but with enough choices to satisfy most.  They do offer a special for $15 that gets you a starter, main dish and side.  Thought that was a very good deal.
Both visits were enjoyable and both times had a great waiter to take care of us. Very nice experience.  Can easily recommend for anyone looking for authentic mexican fare.
