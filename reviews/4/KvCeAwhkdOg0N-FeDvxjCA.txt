Compared to the America's Taco Shop on University, this location is newer, has plentiful parking, and is quite spacious. The quality of food is about the same, plus they also have a design-your-own soda machine! 

We stepped in on a Saturday night, and there weren't that many patrons here, but more trickled in after we ordered. We shared a veggie quesadilla, and I had a carne asada vampiro. The quesadilla was nicely grilled, and the veggie components were flavorful enough that I didn't miss the lack of meat at all. The vampiro was a crispy corn tortilla layered with carne asada, veggies, cheese, and guacamole. The guacamole in tubed form was kind of weird (Taste was OK), but for less than $4, who am I to complain? I got spicy salsa on the side. Overall, it was a good balance of textures and flavors. I tried some al pastor too, which had a great spice mixture on it. I appreciate that you can see the rotating spit the al pastor is on, so you know you are getting something freshly carved off the spit!

Service was cheerful and friendly. It did take a little longer for our food to be served, but we didn't mind since we had the make-your-own-drink station to keep ourselves occupied.

Overall, if I'm craving America's Taco Shop, this is the location I'll be at!
