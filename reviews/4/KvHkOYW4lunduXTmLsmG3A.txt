Stumbled upon this place while looking for a quick bite to eat on the way back to CA. Parking can be tight and making your way to the back lot is a it of a challenge due to the narrow road. Prices are great, because they give you fairly large portions. The drinks they offer are very tasty and come in these giant glass bowls. 

Three different staff members approached us and started speaking in Spanish. Only after the awkward silence did they begin to speak in English. I wasn't offended or angry at all though. I thought it was quite funny that they think everybody speaks Spanish. After the awkward silence and stares, all the servers who helped us were very friendly and always willing to help!
