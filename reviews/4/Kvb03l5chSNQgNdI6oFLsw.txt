Alright, So I do get the bean tostada. Its good. The red sauce IS warm, but it adds a nice flavor. 

On my first visit with my lovely wife, I tried to rolled tacos aka taquitos. They were a tad bit greasy and a little tough. 

We enjoy the place, just the right amount of food when you need something small!
