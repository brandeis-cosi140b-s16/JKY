We eat Mexican food on Sundays, no matter where we are! It's great hangover food for me, we walked by this nicely decorated colorful restaurant and bar after our High Roller ride, decided to give it a try, we were hungry and buzzed, nothing better than some mexican food for us at the moment!

Chose a big booth to sit down comfortably, had guacamole, chips and salsa to start, very fresh and flavorful guacamole with pomegranate seeds in it, so good, loved the spicy and salty red salsa sauce! The chips were lightly seasoned, very crispy and yummy, they didn't fill me up too much at all.

I had shrimp diablo, the shrimps were so tender in juicy flavorful sauce, very delicious! Hubby had steak fajita in medium rare, he loved the tender steak with red in the middle, it was bomb! I liked the street taco sized tortillas. 

Our food was great, I had a Chayo paloma, very strong and tasty. Our waitress was so attentive and fast, impressive service!  

Loved our casual Mexican dinner, relaxing and chill vibe at this restaurant was just what we needed on a Sunday night!
