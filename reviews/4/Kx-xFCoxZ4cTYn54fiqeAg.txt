This Chipotle, conveniently located at Charleston Festival, has over time made a fan out of me. 

Charleston Festival is a dinky strip mall located across the street from CSN Las Vegas anchored by a WalMart neighbourhood market store. 

Chipotle is a soulless chain of faux-Mexican, originally invested in by McDonald's, conceived by some guy from Colorado. 

All this shit is off the top of my head, so if it is incorrect, don't blame me. 

Blame yourself for not already knowing the correct story. 

I come in -- sometimes, I just skip passed the dumbasses studying the menu board -- and, a few minutes later, I am out with bag in hand on my way to jaywalking back to CSN. 

They hold promotions at the start of most semesters (buy one get one free) and for Hallow's Eve during fall (1$ or 2$ burrito when one wears a costume)(Medical/dental students: quit trying to fuck it up for everyone by arguing your dumbass uniform is a costume. Corny ass clowns).

This location has a lot of turnover (is it called that?) with its assembly line crew.  Perhaps -- similar to CSN students -- they graduate to bigger pastures. Or, even, more likely, drop out.

In any case, it is as dependable as CSN, and similarly makes one wonder why is it that the charges end up being so damn high. (Because, the rent is always ... too ... damn ... high!) - E
