There's a big rift in my circle of friends between the Chevys people and the Dos Reales people.  I have to say that I land firmly on the Chevys side, because I am never -- never -- disappointed with what I get here.

All the way through, Chevys is a delicious meal.  Frankly, I'm frequently too full to do anything more than nibble on my entree, because the chips and salsa are to die for -- I've never had anything quite like it.  The salsa is absolutely delicious, tastes like there's a little bit extra black pepper in it.

The entrees are great.  I usually get a pick-4 or pick-5 combo -- leaves me with leftovers so I can have lunch the next day.  Anything's good, but in particular, I want to recommend the flautas.  They're not traditional (when eaten with the sauce they come with, the term "Mexican egg roll" comes to mind), but they are, I think, the tastiest item on the menu.

Also, make sure you get the yellow corn stuff.  I'm not sure what it's called, but when eaten at the end of your meal, it's unbeatable.

The only downside I see to Chevys is that I think it's a bit overpriced.  I'm from Chicago, where Mexican food is cheap, and even though this isn't quite the same thing as the Burrito house, I find it odd to be paying as much as I do for this kind of food.  It's not a budget-buster or anything -- food+tax+tip usually comes out to about $17-18 for me -- but it's a bit pricier than most college town fare.

But, it's delicious.
