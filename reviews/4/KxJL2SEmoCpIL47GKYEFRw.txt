I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at the Border Grill in the forum shops. Our server Matthew from Boston was awesome. We were going to go with the short Rib enchiladas that I saw everyone raving about on Yelp, but he steered us to the Chicken Poblano Enchiladas instead with green sauce and shitake mushrooms. Awesome! Definitely a sleeper pick here. 

He also recommended I try the fresh squeezed watermelon lemonade and boy what a treat coming in from the Vegas heat. I also tried the carnitas which were moist and tasty, but didn't wow like the chicken Poblano enchiladas. 

The place is probably more expensive than your local mexican place, but considering where you are and how expensive everything else is, it's worth it.
