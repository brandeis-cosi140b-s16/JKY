I am new to Vegas and was craving Mexican food.  Decided to try Casa Don Juan at 1780 N Buffalo.   This restaurant is on a bus route and easy to get to.   The service was excellent.  The food was good and the atmosphere was great.   I noticed that they make their own tortillas.   I am from Texas and really miss Tex-Mex.   The food here was good but not as good as what I can get in Houston.   I will definitely be back.
