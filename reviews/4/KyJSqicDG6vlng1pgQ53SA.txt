I came on taco Tuesday ordered 2 tacos and got the 3rd one free. The tacos are so well served that I could only eat 2 tacos. The 3rd will have to wait for dinner.  I ordered one full one campechana and one barbacoa. The barbacoa was good but not the best I've had. The full is fish and shrimp it was very good. The fish was very tender melt in ur mouth. I loved it.
