I've been coming here for about seven years (before the Chuy's scandal!!!). I love it. There are a couple things I miss from the old menu (hot shrimp, Chuy's sampler), but everything is still great. I venture out once in a while and try the specials. This place can get pretty expensive quick (I usually drop 20 bucks on my lunch alone), but the food is good quality. Staff are very friendly and welcoming.
