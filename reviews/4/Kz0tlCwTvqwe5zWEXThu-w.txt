It was great to finally get Sonoran Mexican food that showcased Mexican flavors instead of Americanized, cheese-drowned versions of Mexican food.  The Patron margaritas are the real deal and a steal at only $9 as the glasses are enormous.  The Chili Colorado offered lots of meat and a good red chili sauce.  The Pablano Relleno was lightly battered and stuffed with flavorful shredded chicken with a light cheese sauce floating in a plate of red chili sauce, it was the right touch of cheese.  

One of the best parts of the meal was the beans.  They are authentic as you get the pork flavor you are supposed to get from beans when they are done right and made with ham hocks or other pork parts!  I didn't ask how the beans were prepared but they taste like they were made with an old school recipe.  

We liked the fried ice cream with the cinnamon shell over the sopapillas as they were a little to doughy.  This and the fundillo are the only reasons I am going with 4 instead of 5 stars.  The cheese fundillo was more of a thin Monterrey cheese than the traditional thick Mexican cheese, however, the chorizo on top was excellent.   It wasn't that it was bad it just wasn't what we were looking for in a fundillo.  

We are hard to please when it comes to authentic Mexican food and this will be our new go to place as it is unbelievably hard to find good Mexican food in Phoenix/Tempe and this was worth the drive.  

We can't wait to go back to try the seafood and grilled carne platters.
