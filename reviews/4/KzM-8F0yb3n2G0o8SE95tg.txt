Lots of good here.  Most important, the food is tasty and plentiful.  Good value, but more importantly, authentic and fresh.  The hook is the free cheese dip, if you value queso that is.  I liked the multi spicy salsas. The verde was just zippy enough, while the rojo was full of chunky veggies.  I didn't try the mild, why would I?  We didn't get the pico de gallo as advertised, but I was indulging the spicy stuff, so it wasn't missed much.  My cohorts had quesadillas, I had the flautas.  The pollo was good, flavorful, tender.  Guacamole was good, not great but rarely is in the states.  They advertise no refills, I'm guessing that was just for soda, sweet tea was refilled gratis.  They currently have 3 domestic beers at $2 a bottle, righteous.  Altogether, if you want good mex, reasonably priced, tasty and mostly authentic, bring it.  Atmosphere is what I like about most real Mexican places, bright colors, kinda thrift store furniture and not pretentious.  The wait staff is ok, not great, but friendly.  I recommend for those who want flavor at value, not surroundings.
