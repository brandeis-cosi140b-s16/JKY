Gave 4 stars because I would go 3 1/2 my husband would give 5. He always gets the same thing, Carne Asada wet burrito, no rice with enchilada sauce. Tonys and Viva Mercado are his two favorites, the burritos here are huge and he isn't very big but he puts it away every time. He is not a spice person so the enchilada sauce is the perfect "wet" for him. The asada is in little pieces, no grisle and the perfect amount of cilantro, beans and onion. I love that he loves tonys because I love mexican food and here he can get something he really likes. In fact he likes it so much we have been here the last 3 Fridays.  I usually get the Asada Chimichanga and it has been amazing and just okay. Guess it depends on who is cooking that night.  Tonight I got the two cheese enchilada combination and a asada taco on the side. Yes the enchiladas are small as was the taco but very flavorful and although I can put away the chimi which is huge the seemingly small looking plate filled me to perfection.  We personally have never had an issue with service. We get a smile, hello and how are you tonight every time we walk in, prompt with the drinks and food comes out rather quickly. May not be everyones cup of tea but for the price, quality and the full belly at the end I like it.
