Started with the Vasito de Elote. It was 3/5 okay. Wasn't bad, wasn't great, just decent. 

Moved on to have the carne asada y chile relleno taco and it was 4/5. The heat of the peppers sneak up on you but the flavor was fantastic. Only thing keeping it from a 5 is the tortillas are tiny so they can be difficult to eat. 

Their Barrio Pollo Burrito is the best chicken burrito I have ever had. 6 of 5. That sauce is incredible. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. 

Finished with the tres leches. It was more fruit and whipped cream than tres leches. The bites of cake I had were tasty but skimped for their strawberry counterpart. 2/5. 

While the food came out reasonably quick, the service is at a more relaxed pace. That being said, I always had drink in my glass and my waiter made great recommendations and was very attentive. 4 staff members asked how things were and quickly rushed away plates. It was a pleasant dining experience.
