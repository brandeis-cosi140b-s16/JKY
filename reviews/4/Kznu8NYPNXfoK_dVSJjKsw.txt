This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside is brightly painted and clean. This is on my way to the office, and occasionally I give into my craving for a bean and cheese burrito. I've gotta say, I've tried a lot of different places and this is my favorite!  Disclaimer: I haven't tried anything else on the menu. Both red and green salsas are great.
