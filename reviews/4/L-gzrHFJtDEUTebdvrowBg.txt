I never have a problem finding something good to eat at Someburros.  Some of my favorite items to eat here are the tacos.  The shell is perfectly crispy, with juicy shredded chicken (or beef), and even better when you put the hot sauce/salsa on it.  Another favorite is the rod burro, which is a huge burrito filled with chorizo and beef enchilada style.  In addition to tasty eats, they have refreshing horchata to go with your meal.
