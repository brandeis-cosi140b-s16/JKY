I will order one of the three things from any given Don Tortaco around town, usually when I'm
drunk on my way home or when I wake up feeling like death from drinking the night before. There is something special about this particular location though. Maybe it's the fact that they're always consistent, they are close to my house or that they made this super yummy green chili salsa at the salsa bar that I haven't ever seen at any other location. Either way, I love this place. 

My only gripe would be the employees aren't the most friendly. But the drive through access allows me over look that. lol
