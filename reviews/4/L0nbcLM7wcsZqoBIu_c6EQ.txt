I love Fausto's!!  I know it's pretty much the same as almost every other quick Mexican food place there is, but I think the quality of food here is a step up.  I usually go with the carne adada plate which also comes with rice, beans, pico, and two huge tortillas.  The Carne Asada is delicious.  As expected they have a salsa bar with a few selections and some vegetables.  I believe the cost is about the same as Roberto's or again any other similar places.  If Fausto's was closer to my house I would probably eat here more than all the others.  Unfortunately it's not too close to my house so I only eat here when in the area.  Also, it's a small dining area, so don't expect to comfortably eat with larger parties.  If you can take it to go, that would be the best options.
