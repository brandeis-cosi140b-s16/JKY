I'm so excited to find this place! I grew up in Oxnard, CA where the Mexican food is straight outta Mexico and you can find great authentic food on practically every corner.  So I'm happy to report that this place has awesome beans and rice (so many places make such bland beans) and wonderfully seasoned food.  I've only been here once so that's why I'm not giving them 5 stars yet, I'll report back after my next visit.  OH and I'm an avid chorizo breakfast burrito lover and theirs is delicious! They put potatoes in there (can't go wrong with potatoes) and I requested that beans be added in = YUMMY!
