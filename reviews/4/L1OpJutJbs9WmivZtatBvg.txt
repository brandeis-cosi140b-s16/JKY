Lucky for me the two women that I had a meeting with on the north side of town have eaten here..On the industrial side of Craig & I-15, chances of finding this on my own are slim.  I'm also very picky when it comes to Mexican food, not disappointed, this was a great find. 

Then again, that was obvious when we had to wait a few minutes for a table. The place was packed and the aroma filling the air was mouth watering. 

After being seated we were served chips with a bowl of salsa and a bowl of beans. 
The salsa was very flavorful and this is the first time I have ever had bean dip that was seasoned (very tasty) 

For lunch my client and I both ordered the Ensalad Marinara - large salad for less than $10, a great price for shrimp, avocado and pico de gallo. My business partner ordered the ceviche which she also said was very flavorful. 

Food was good, service was great and everyone was very friendly. 
Will definitely be back when on the north side of town!
