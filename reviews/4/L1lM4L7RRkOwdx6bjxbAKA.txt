Tasty tasty tacos!
Ingredients seem pretty fresh, and it's really really cheap. We're talking 6 or 7 bucks for tacos, beans, and rice, or whatever other combo plate you choose. They're also open 24 hours, and conveniently located next to a bar. The only downside to the place is it's ambiance. It's not a nice looking feeling place. It's a run down counter service shop with a few tables and chairs. It's a little on the trashy looking side, but the food's good, the service is friendly, and it's mostly a takeout kind of place anyways.
