Stopped in last night because it was close to my son's soccer practice. Very pleasantly surprised. Great service, clean atmosphere, and homemade food. The chips and sals were fresh and delicious as a starter. My wife and I had the Carne Asada plate and the Carne Asada Chimichanga and both were very solid and tasty. I would recommend this great hole in the wall to anyone looking for good Mexican food for a great value. All of the above for less than $20 out the door. Buen Provecho Amigos!!!
