NACHOS NACHOS NACHOS!!! GET THE NACHOS!

Walked in and it was packed. Managed to find a spot at the bar. 
It was just an average bar in Vegas.

I had some margaritas, which were good but the thing that caught my attention were the Nachos! One of the best nachos I've ever had. So big they need to be shared. It has a variety of cheeses, some damn good cheeses -- sour cream, chunky guacamole, salsa, chicken and some other good stuff. I recommend getting the nachos for anyone who visits Diablo's.

The atmosphere was pretty cool, a bit loud but not annoying. 
The service was friendly.

Will come back!
