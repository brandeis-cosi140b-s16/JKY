This place is great. First off as others have said the  music is a bit loud but didn't bother me too much, got used to it after a few minutes.
we started off with the mar y tierra appetizer which consisted of deep fried shrimp wrapped with bacon, butterfly shrimp, diced shrimp, octopus and crane asada.
My entree was a shrimp cocktail which had plenty of shrimp, usually most places will be scarce on the shrimp and load it with vegetables. it was really good.
My wife had Fish a la plancha which came with a side of rice and salad.
all accompanied by fresh chips and salsa.  we ordered horchata to drink which was pretty good.

Overall I will definitely come back here.
