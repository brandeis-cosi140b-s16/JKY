I can't believe this place is not packed on a Saturday night, the food is to die for! I'm visiting from California and I know good Mexican food.  This restaurant deserves your patronage! It is a "hole in the wall," so throw on some comfy clothes and come here!

The chicken mole is out if this world, very good sized portions, you will have leftovers for lunch the next day. We also had the shrimp dinner (I requested spicy).  I have never had anything like it. The shrimps were perfectly cooked, juicy and flavorful and the spicy sauce was just epic.  

My friend and I couldn't believe no one was here.  I will definitely be back each year when I'm out for spring training!
