Had to kill some time waiting for a place to open.  Stopped in at apache and got a enchilada plate, red, cheese, actually white cheese that was melted.  I was shocked to be honest.  The sauce did seem to be tomato based which I'm not a huge fan of but it tasted pretty good.  Also at 6 bucks for that plate cheaper than most.
