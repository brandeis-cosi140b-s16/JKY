Super fresh seafood!! How do I know? I developed a slight allergy for Shrimp when I moved to the US (everytime I eat shrimp I get hives on my face). Ate shrimp all my life back home (I grew up by the sea) and never had a problem. I go to this restaurant and eat shrimp... nothing happens and tastes delicious!!!

When you arrive and sit, the waitress brings you chips and salsa and a cup of hot steamy shrimp boullion. I always order Shrimp Aguachile ( raw shrimp cooked in lime juice and chile) or Cocktel Campechana (big cup of seafood variety). I tried the Pescado Empanizado today and it was delicious!!!!! I will order that next time. ALSO there are people selling stuff like mexican pastries and other mexican food you dont really find at the stores ( like queso from Chihuahua) so bring some extra cash with you !! 

Things I dislike about this place: 

Waitresses lack of customer service skills and take forever to aknowledge that you arrived and need to be seated. I have seated myself and waited 10 minutes for the menus and What would you like to drink? Question.
Music is EXTREMELY loud. I love the fact that you can go and listen to some live Banda music while you are enjoying your seafood.. however the place is too small and music too loud. I had to point my order to the waitress from the menu because she couldnt hear me so don't expect being able to conversate with your party. 

Those are my major issues however FOOD IS SO GOOD that I don't care..PLUS they are remodeling the restaurant and it looks like they are adding space!! 

Enjoy!!!!
