I really liked this place. First of all, the view was fantastic. The restaurant was not very packed when we decided to stroll in for dinner around 10pm on a Saturday night. It actually felt nice going somewhere more mellow on a weekend night where you can indulge in good food, drinks and conversation. I ordered the burrito "El Burro Bionico" which turned out to be the size of an infant. For $11.95 I could have easily shared it with my boyfriend and both been stuffed. I also ordered one of their speciality margaritas with dinner which also turned out to be a hit. The service was attentive and to the point. As our dinner was winding down our waiter let us know about their happy hour that starts at 11pm. We decided to move over to the bar and get a blue margarita. The bartender was friendly and made good drinks. We stayed until about 1am just enjoying some drinks, conversation and amazing view. I will definitely be returning.
