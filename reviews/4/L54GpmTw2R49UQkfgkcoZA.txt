Funky decor, low lights, lively bar. Delicious Mexican food. I had been eating poorly the previous days, so I ordered a kale with autumn veggies salad with chicken. It was huge and involved some other greens so it wasn't too rough as kale can be. We got the trio of dips. Watch out for the queso if you don't like spicy. I happen to like spicy. Definitely caters to vegetarians and special needs eaters. Tofu is an option. I ordered a tortilla soup, but they forgot it. Still, the service was pretty good -- attentive. This restaurant is part of a small chain which also includes Kaya, at which I ate the night before. Pretty happy with both places. The only thing I didn't like was that I didn't see if corn tortillas were offered, which I prefer 99% of the time.
