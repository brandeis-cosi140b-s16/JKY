We've eaten here before multiple times and the food is really good and different. The Bulgogi fries and the flautAs are my favorites only thing bad is the wait times for food can be pretty long at times. 
Today however our food came quickly and was delicious flautAs, sliders, and a mini quesadilla. Definitely need a kids menu here though.
