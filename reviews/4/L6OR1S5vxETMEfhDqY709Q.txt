I'm working my way through the menu and I must say I'm thrilled to finally have found a place that cooks New Mexican style just like my mom does..there is a HUGE difference between New Mexican vs. Mexican food. New Mexican style is unique and so flavorful. I'm so happy to get the comfort food from my childhood right here in chandler..5 stars once I complete the menu :) Thank you New Mexican grill for making this gal feel like she's home away from home, finally!
