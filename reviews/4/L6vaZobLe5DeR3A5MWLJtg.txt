I must say for a chain this place is bomb! I have not been disappointed once and that's hard to do honestly! The staff here are so friendly! I love coming here and not being rushed to get my order in. They smile answer any questions that I have about their menu and do it with a smile. 

Keep in mind this review is only for this location. I don't know how friendly other locations are, but this one is awesome! Parking is good never have a problem there. They have tons of seating so you won't have a problem finding somewhere to sit if you dine in. 

To the food.... Oh man!!! The chicken enchiladas are so so good!! They pack it full of chicken too! I hate when I order from other places and I get tortilla with sauce basically. You won't have to worry about that here. If you get a taco craving this place is the place to go late at night especially you know when you cannot get that craving out of your head! Their chicken tacos.... Ohhhweee so so good! You have to try one you won't regret it!! 

Overall probably my favorite place to come get some tacos without costing me an arm an a leg.
