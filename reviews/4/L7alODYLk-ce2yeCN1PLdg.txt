In trying all of the LV Weekly's top 10, I came to this place.  It closes at 7, which I frustratingly found out on a Saturday evening at about 7:20.  When I got there on Sunday, the place was packed and people were standing waiting.  Always a good sign.  So, I ordered to go.  Had the torta ahogado.  Fantastic.  Since I got it to go, they put the sauce and the onions in a little baggy for me.  So, I got home, drenched it and ate.  Had to finish with a fork, but the bread stood up well to the sauce, which is liquidy.  The onion/salsa mixture is HOT, but great.  Basically, it was Mexican pulled pork with the sauce and onions.  Recommended, but be prepared since it's a small place.  I was very pleased how the sandwich stood up even with driving home.  Still warm and delicious.
