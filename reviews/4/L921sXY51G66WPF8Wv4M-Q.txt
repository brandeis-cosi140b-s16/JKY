There is something to be said for this location. I've tried other Roberto's in the Valley but always like coming back to this one on Durango and DI. What more could you ask for as it's cheap, filling and tastes great. I always get the Carne Asada nachos minus the beans (I don't care for the beans). Mucho pico de gallo as well. Can't go wrong.
