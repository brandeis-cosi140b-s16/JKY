A throwback to nostalgic 80's mexican cuisine. Don't let the dated decor fool or mislead you- Rosita's serves great food at affordable prices. Lunch specials are great. Our server was friendly, service was snappy, and the little kids menu was full of options ($0.99 for cheese enchilada rice & beans!). Overall a great experience, come and enjoy!!
