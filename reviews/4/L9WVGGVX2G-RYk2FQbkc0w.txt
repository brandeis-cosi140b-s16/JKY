Viva El Taco may just be my new taco hot spot.  Not only is it closer to me than the nearest Roberto's I get my $0.99 chicken tacos from on Wednesday nights but it also has the same special to include Tuesday as well.  That's right, I said Viva El Taco has $0.99 chicken tacos on Tuesday AND Wednesday.  Awesome!  I was there recently and while I did not get the chicken tacos I did get the beef version.  They were pretty darned good.  A lot of beef.  A lot of cheese.  A crunchy shell. I also got my other Roberto's favorite.  3 rolled beef tacos with guacamole.  These are a very close match to what I have craved for many years.  My dad got his standard carne asada burrito.  It was loaded with beef and salsa and no filler.  Just the way my dad likes.  I believe the price was better too. Roberto's has some competition now.
