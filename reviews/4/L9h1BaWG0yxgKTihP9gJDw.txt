Let me just start by saying OMG.... best Tortas and burritos I have had here. The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts was purely for the location. Its located it what looks like an old indoor strip mall, once inside there are places to buy party supplies, medicine, I believe there's even some sort of salon in the corner as well ... but don't let that fool you because straight back is the restaurant with the most amazing food. Their burritos are the big enough to feed the hungriest man or a two people at around $6-$7 each, their carnitas Tortas is my favorite the pork is cooked perfectly and has such great flavor you can even order a fresca in a glass bottle to wash it all down with.. If you are on this side of town its definitely worth stopping by and trying it.
