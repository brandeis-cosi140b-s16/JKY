Very affordable.   I love the corn tamales and the fried bananas.  The ham and eggs is also well done.  However, try the pupusas.   It's a thick tortilla with beans and cheese or mixed with pork.  I think this place has some of the better ones in Vegas.   The service is slow because it's not too full and obviously trying to save on help but I think the food is fantastic and as this place grows, so will it's service.
