OH MY. San Diego-style Mexican food in Arizona?!?!?

That's not a mirage from heat exhaustion (or dehydration from too much alcohol). It is true! I was taken here by a former Socal native and I was in heaven.

Carne Asada fries: tasty-marinated carne asada, skinny fries, legit cheese (both yellow and white), sour cream, and plenty of guac. Mmm Mmm good.

Arizona burrito (aka wanna-be California burrito): heavy on the potatos and needed more cheese... but better than anything in San Jose.

Hot sauce? Spot-on. Could be hotter, but it is just the way I like it: NOT salsa, more hot.

Spongebob Awesomeness: The carne asada burrito looked really tasty. When I go back to Tempe, I am definitely coming back here.
