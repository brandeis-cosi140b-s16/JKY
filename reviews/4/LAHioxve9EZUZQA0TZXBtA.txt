I stopped in to pick up dinner one night after the line for Chipotle was nearly out the door. I'm doing a low carb thing so I opted to try their naked salad bowl - lettuce, chicken, black beans, cheese, guacamole, and hot salsa. It was good - a different variety than the Chipotle salads. I would come back, though probably not for their burritos. I would like to try the other items on their menu
