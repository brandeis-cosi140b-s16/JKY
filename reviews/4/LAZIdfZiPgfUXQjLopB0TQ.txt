Solid average in terms of food. You will get exactly what you want from this place. It might not be in a normal time frame. Do not worry, it will eventually come. I wish I had the job of the person who bags the food and turns around to grab a bag of chips. That seems like such a bomb a$$ job. I had a lot of time to watch the lucky girl who was assigned that job today. Every time I come in the line is to the door. One would think it's because of the quality of the food, sadly that is not the reason. They're just always so slow, all of their employees. My love of chipotle food always wins over my hatred of waiting in the long, slow line that always comes with eating at this location. Full disclosure, I will be eating here again soon, once I block a portion of my day off.
