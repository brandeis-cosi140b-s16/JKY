I just have to say, if there was a Braddah's closer to home in SoCal, we'd be frequent customers. The set-up is taken right out of the Chipotle playbook, & why not, it's a great formula! We made sure to sample the meats that they had available especially since the guys are sensitive to spices. My Huz and oldest son had such a difficult time deciding between the Kahlua pig and the chicken, they went ahead & just got the mix in their burrito! I chose the chicken on a salad base & asked the counter server for suggestions on toppings. She was so friendly and my salad looked amazing & tasted just as well. My 9 year old stuck to a simple chicken burrito with beans & rice.  Like I said, the set-up is much like a beloved franchise, but it had a flare of its own. I felt like I was dining among the locals. And an added bonus, they are part of the eScrip program (you must register your credit card) & by dining here, you help raise a bit of money for the school of your choice (yay for my boys' school!) Thanks for the awesome meal, Bruddah's! We'll see you again when we come back to Vegas!
