If you're hungry for lunch and you're one of the many people looking for good, fast, CHEAP Mexican food that ISN'T Roberto's or Don Tortaco, THIS is your place.  I'm not sure why there are negative reviews at all.  The service is always great, the food is always delicious -- specifically the street tacos and sopes with al pastor -- and their selection of fresh salsas is vibrantly spicy (the green stuff) and refreshingly bright (the Pico de Gallo).  I hope more people try this place out, it's become a favorite for our nearby office, and it's always full for lunch!

The only negative things I would say is they often run out of popular items (carne asada, al pastor).  And their tables aren't usually very clean for lunch, simply due to how busy they are and you need to snatch a table as soon as it opens up.  The restaurant itself is really small, so grabbing your food to go isn't a bad idea.  I wouldn't try coming here with a large group.
