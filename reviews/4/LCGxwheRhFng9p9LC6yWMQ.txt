We had dinner as a family. Two people had chimichangas and really enjoyed them. One person had the pork tacos with pineapple and they chowed them down. I had a small bite and they were really good. I ate the chicken enchiladas. I had a choice of red, green or mole sauce. I chose mole. It was a bit sweet. I would try the green next time. The bummer was that they don't give you chips and salsa like most Mexican restaurants do. Plus they were very skimpy on the guacamole that came with the chimichanga. Good food and good service. We will be back.
