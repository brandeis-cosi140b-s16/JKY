This real traditional Mexican  not Tex-Mex at all. You can order to go or sit in. My husband had the nacho supreme it had a nice spicy flavor, lots of cilantro, they could use a bit less if the sauce they use to cook the chicken in nachos because it made the chips soggy. He also had the mango quesadilla with steak they used fresh mango and very great tasting steak! I had the beef burrito which had rice and beans, it came with quacamole and a side salad, the salad was a bit to spicy with lots of yummy cilantro, the quacamole was made fresh and tasted like the one I make at home! Portions were great, the dining room was nice and simple but very clean. The servers were friendly, helpful with all my questions and accommodated a quesadilla for my 4yr old. Kids friendly most def.
