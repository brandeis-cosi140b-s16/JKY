Using the pointing fingers of my left and right hands I will type Phoenix sacrilege here.  Poblano serves food a lot like Barrio Cafe's for about half the price.  Sophisticated Mexican menu.  No bar with 100 Tequilas, no table cloths.

No art/music/mural scene.  

Too bad.  The 19th Ave and Osborne area could use an art and music scene.  There's certainly plenty of diversity.  We couldn't have art, music and murals everwhere in the Valley could we?  That's probably way too much of a good and spirited thing.
