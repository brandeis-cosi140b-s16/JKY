Wish Tracy was here ;) I'm trying something new today,  it's the chicken tosada salad. It's the special today and worth the price. I usually am a creature of habit and get the sweet pork barbacoa salad that's fantastic!  They have kid choices if that suits your needs and there are always kids in this place.  I find it over stimulating at times with kid noise. So definitely not a peaceful meal if that's what you need. Food quality is very good and certainly worth it!
