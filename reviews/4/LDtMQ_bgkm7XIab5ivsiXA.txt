Grabbed a quick bite here for lunch with some family who were in from out of town. It's conveniently located just a short ways off the freeway (and among a bunch of other shopping options, if you need to hop off the freeway and take care of both food and shopping). 

The inside is decorated wonderfully - lots of color and interesting things to look at. Service was good, food was pretty good, price was reasonable. I'd definitely stop by again if I'm in the area!
