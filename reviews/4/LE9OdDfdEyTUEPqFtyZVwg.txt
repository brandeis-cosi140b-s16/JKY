Quick pointers for the drivers-
The best Pastor. Cheap Prices, Open till around 10 and Very Friendly family. 

So lately Ive been on a tear for good Pastor in Vegas. Im on a burrito a day. Im pretty much the mexican Jared. (Yared?)...Anyway I ordered a Pastor burrito here and the woman was very excited to tell me that this was indeed special pastor, and that if I was actually ordering it on purpose, and not just another gringo who got lost outside of Wal Mart, then I would be very impressed. I explained I am a very appreciative eater and had an eye for Pastor since I was from California...They asked and when I did not say LA they were dissapointed, which saddened me and lowered my expectations a bit.  
The woman was very friendly, but it was so quiet in there, and her being the talkative type, I decided to wait in my car. I never like to chill staring at the spanish programming, while someone slaves away on my 6 dollar purchase. Ultimately, I think this helped. 
The Pastor was indeed amazing. Its chopped small, roasted and then grilled for a crispy texture. The seasoning is top notch, and not coincidentally I assume, it tasted exactly like the only other Pastor I have seen cooked like this. A place in Santa Cruz called Tacos Morenos, whose own legend can be heard on the wind of a warm October night. 
Unlike morenos, who uses pintos and a thin layer of melted cheese on the burrito, this one contained rice and refried beans. Pretty bland. What saved the day was the salsa. its got a major kick, but more to your brow than your tongue. So consumption can continue :) 

Bottom line: They were very friendly and I say the Pastor is a MUST try. If you are simple, get the soft tacos, dont forget the salsa and if you like, remember to let em know.
