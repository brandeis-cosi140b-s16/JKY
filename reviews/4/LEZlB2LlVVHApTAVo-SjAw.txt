First and probably the most important thing at this restaurant, is the perfect margaritas, authentically made and one of the best in town.  The food is a mixed bag, the best item are their tortillas, large and delicious, followed by the chips and salsa where you will want to order more of, however, the chicken street tacos were salt bombs that I would not eat again.  Fish tacos are made with Talapia, order the fish fried, the baked version is terrible.  The beans and rice are outstanding, and with the great tortillas you can not go wrong with any burro.  The cheese crisp was good, considering the prices here it is hard to complain about anything.  The bar is beautiful, with perfectly placed televisions inviting you back to watch your favorite game.  If there is a weakness here, it is the service which seemed out of sorts.  Luckily, Cory was bartending and able to jump in to make things work, while it was clear that the clueless staff must have been owners or family members by their complete lack of interest in their customers. We are going back for sure, this is the perfect casual hangout and the overall experience was very good. Hope they get the service issue resolved, it will ruin their business if not.
