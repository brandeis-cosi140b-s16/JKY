Presentation was awesome, food was great, service excellent, and priced well!  Hubby ordered the California chicken enchilada with artichokes and smoked gouda, tasty rice and yummy black bean salad on a fried tortilla.  I ordered the fried calamari with mixed green salad and balsamic dressing.  Must try!
