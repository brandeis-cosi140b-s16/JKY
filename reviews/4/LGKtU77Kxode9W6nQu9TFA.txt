So i was driving down the street saw this place and decided to try it. First impression...VERY clean and well maintained. Very friendly and welcoming staff. This is probably the cleanest mexican restaurant i have ever been to. I ordered the carne asada burrito. Was solid ,nice pieces of meat i added my gringo guacamole and cheese. The only reason im not giving them a 5 is because the rice was bad. I hate when im trying to eat and i have to be careful i don't break a tooth on a stale piece of rice. If the rice had been fresh this would have been a 5. I will give them a pass on this as it was about 4 pm and i think they just didnt realize that it needed to be made again. I mentioned it to the lady and she was very professional and apologetic. I will definetly be back I am sure the rice was a miscue that rarely happens.
