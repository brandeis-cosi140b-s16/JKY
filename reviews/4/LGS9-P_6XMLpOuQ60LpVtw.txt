Good hole-in-the-wall place. Was recommended by some new friends I met in Arizona. They knew the owner and was highly-recommended. We went for dinner on a Monday night so it wasn't packed at all. Service was good, a tad slow, but we weren't in a rush.

Food: was good. ordered a shrimp cerviche, fresh and tasty. 7 Mares, a flavorful and seafood meaty soup. To quench the thirst, I tried the Micheladas, a bloody mary type drink mixed with beer, a spicy treat. 

From the look of the local feel, this place seems like it'll be a great happy hour location to. Hope to find out one day when I visit AZ again.
