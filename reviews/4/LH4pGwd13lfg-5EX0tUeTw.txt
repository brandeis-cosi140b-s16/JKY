This has got to be my favorite place to get breakfast at Sky Harbor. I literally walked all the way from a C Gate to get here and have a breakfast burrito before my last flight.

I get an egg and cheese burrito and add avocado, for 50 cents, it is SO worth the extra cost. The eggs are seasoned well, the pico del gallo is fresh and the papas (potatoes) are so tasty!! It's an amazing combination.

The past three visits to Los Taquitos, the same girl has been working the register and she is the nicest. She offers a lot of suggestions to travelers who have no clue what to get and is so friendly to everyone.

Highly recommend for a breakfast that will leave you full and happy for your next morning flight :)
