this place was pretty tasty. had no idea the chandler location had been around for 6-7 years. as a first timer, i was allowed to try samples just like other reviewers said. the cashier also helped me to fill out the order form. Emerald chicken, Red June chicken, and the jerk chicken were deee-lish. 

if you're curious, give this place a try. you will be rewarded with a delicious snickerdoodle that comes with your meal =)
