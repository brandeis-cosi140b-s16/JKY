At just a dollar a pound, this are the best and freshest tortillas that you can find in Charlotte. Forget store brand tortillas, these is where the local Mexican community buys the equivalent of their daily bread. Having grown in a household where tortillas were made fresh by hand by either Mom or Grandma, I would say my standards are pretty high. The tortillas here are made in the same style as they are sold in Mexico City, made from a dry corn flour, mixed and then baked. I prefer tortillas made from (Nixtamal) corn kernels that are cooked and cured with lime, then ground into fresh corn masa that is used to make tortillas. However, this will have to do for now until Mexican food in general evolves in Charlotte, and we can find Tortillas and authentic Mexican food as it is available in places like California. You can also find a few ready to eat meat classics such as carnitas, barbacoa, and chicharrones. Just know that these are sold individually by the pound as take out. You can definitely build yourself a nice lunch or dinner by making your own tacos at home.
