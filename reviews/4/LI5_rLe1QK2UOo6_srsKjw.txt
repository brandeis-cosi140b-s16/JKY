Excellent Fried Snapper!

I had listened to a good friend talk about this place for years. Although he had eaten other things from their menu, he absolutely raved about the fried snapper whenever he had it. 

Well, last week I was in the area, with time to kill before a meeting downtown, and a pretty good appetite. I decided it was the perfect time to try San Carlos Bay's snapper for myself.

I was welcomed to sit anywhere I pleased, and was very shortly brought chips, salsa, water and a menu. The salsa was on the hot side, but delicious with the fresh taco chips. I ordered the whole (head included) fried red snapper (small - you have a choice of small, medium or large) which came with refried beans, rice, and a lime.

My food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and looked wonderful. The fish was still piping hot, and had been scored on both sides to ensure even cooking. What I loved about the preparation was that I ended up with so much nice crispy fish! It came away from the bone easily and I only had to be careful about the tiny bones along the fins. 

My fish was un-breaded, nicely seasoned, and perfectly cooked. The "small" fish was the perfect size for me, and left me completely full. I didn't add any hot sauce or salt, but enjoyed eating the hot salsa with it, along with juice from the lime. The refried beans were good too. I've never been a fan of that red Mexican rice. I tasted it, but left it alone after that.

I completely enjoyed my meal, and also thought that it was appropriately priced. Service was friendly, and I intend to return the next time I need a fish fix.
