Think of this place like a Hawaiian style Chipotle. It's a little ways off the strip, but worth it if you need a break from all the lights and action. I found  a nice Groupon for this place so I thought we could try it out while we were on our trip. 

We were greeted and offered to sample their meats before we created our meal. All the meat was pretty yummy but for hubs and I the steak really stood out. We got a bowl and a burrito, some chips, and coconut bark. The seaweed rice was yummy and overall I really enjoyed my burrito. They were really generous with the guac which made my food taste even better! 

The coconut bark was really sweet and definitely an extra treat. I probably wouldn't get this everytime but maybe once in a while. 

Thanks Braddah's! Hope to see you next time we're in Vegas.
