This is one of those places that you see everyday as you drive by. It's also one of those places that you kick yourself for not coming here sooner! 
I ordered the Carne Asada burrito, which is my usual when I'm in a new place. It was good sized, I could tell it was going to fill me up. It had the meat, guacamole, beans and Pico de gallo. It is unusual that it came with beans inside, but the were really good so i didnt mind. But it made it a little light on thr meat. Again, i didnt mind because it was reall good. I asked for the Pico on the side. They brought green and red salsa with the burro (different from the one with the chips) I liked the green alot but not the red, I liked the chips' salsa better. The cook himself brought my plate out which was cool. But was a little put off when I asked for more chips and salsa. The server brought them. She was really nice, and the cook was probably just busy...
Once I started to eat the burrito I only put it down once before I finished it, it was that good lol.
The tea had a funny taste I drank my water instead. The have pepsi products  (dislike). 
I'll be back, and if you haven't been here you should definitely give it a try!
