I want to preface this review by stating that I visited Chayo with a large group of people for a business function and we were seated upstairs in a private dining room, so I can't really comment on the ambiance of the place overall; however, it looked awesome from the way in - nice dark wood, great outdoor seating, and a mechanical bull (that unfortunately I didn't get to try!). The cilantro cream soup with pine nuts was awesome, and the sweet corn enchiladas were AMAZING. Unfortunately I didn't get to finish them due to the sheer amount of food we had gotten with our appetizers, but I would have taken them home with me if I hadn't had plans later that evening. Overall, an awesome Mexican restaurant that I won't hesitate to go back to the next time I am in Vegas.
