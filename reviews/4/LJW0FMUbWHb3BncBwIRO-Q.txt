First of all, the shredded beef on hard shell taco's are awesome.   The Burritos are pretty good but I think Qdoba's down the street are better because the tortilla is steamed.  The main difference here is just how good the baja garlic sauce tastes in conjunction with the Butt Burning Sauce that is at every table.  I love hot sauce and this one doesn't pack much of a punch but the flavor is as good as it gets.  The taco's are only $1.99 and there are way more options on the menu than the place down the street.  The shrimp Tempura taco's are probably the best deal on the menu and are super tasty.   Overall, for the price, I give it a 4.5/5.  I'm really happy this place is in town!
