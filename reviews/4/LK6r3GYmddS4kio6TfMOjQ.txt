Our first choice was kilroy's for a burger, they had a sign saying kitchen closed till further notice ? Anyway, decided to ck out out Frank & Fina's for our burger craving, jus kidding I know Mexican .  I had the special which was choice of two tamales , I chose the colorado and the chix mole tamale. The colorado was good but the flavors of the chix mole drowned out the colorado tamale . The mole sauce was deeply flavored u could taste the chocolate.  I'm jus begining to appreciate mole, before could not stand it now that I know the skill and many ingredients that make a mole I'm a fan . I also had to try the sweet potato enchilada, based on other yelpers recomendations, and besides I  luv sweet potato . The idea is promising , I did not care for the red sauce , IMHO  it was better suited for a savory enchilada . I like sweet potato w/ vanilla sauce or a caramel sauce like other places serve their sweet potato fries .  I think it would b great with their chocolaty flavored mole sauce just drizzled, not drenched.   Chocolate and sweet potato , I think it would b a winner, maybe next time I'll ask, u should too ;). The plating was nice not just thrown on hap hazardly. Rice and beans were good not dry or crusty. Chips and salsa alright , nothing special . I don't know what took us so long to go back last time we went they were on charlston blvd, over 5 years ago, I promise we won't wait that long again .
