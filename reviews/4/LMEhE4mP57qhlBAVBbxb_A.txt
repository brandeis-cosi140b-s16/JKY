While visiting PA some friends took me here for some authentic Mexican food and it was great!  The guacamole dip is yum and the burritos are HUGE!  The chips are a bit small and broken which makes it horrible for dipping.  On Fridays they serve what they call Big AZZ margaritas that are pretty good and compliment the meal.   Everything was great and I will return!
