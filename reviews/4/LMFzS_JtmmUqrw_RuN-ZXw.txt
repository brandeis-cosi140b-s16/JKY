Had the infamous Torta Del Rey. Very solid. Good amount of meat and cheese. Only complaint is that by the end of the sandwich much of the good meat was gone and it was very difficult to keep it all together ( not quite enough cheese or sauce to hold it in place). Torta was pretty big, but I expected far more mammoth of a creation after reading so many people saying they couldn't finish it. 

If you are hungry it is really pretty easy to put away (of course if you get drinks or apps, or eat the generic ruffles chips, you may get full). 

Good price for good quality sandwich to go with good service. Four stars!
