Me and the bf's to go place for a late night hunger. Lol out of all roberto's location we tried, this is the one we like because they are generous in giving meat and everything else (specifically speaking for carne asada fries and carne asada burrito) 

Staff: They're ok. Friendly but not too approachable. Doesnt smile lol but its ok for me(maybe they're tired or sleepy) coz we always go there like around 10pm literally only for a late night craving/hunger so understood if they dont want or not able to smile... 

Place: no complaints... We dont eat at their dining room coz we always take our food to go.

Food: big portion for the price. Sometimes they forget to put beans on my burrito tho!!!! Lol

All in all, 4 stars!
