If Taco Bell did everything better, this is what you'd get. They have more authentic Mexican soft drinks, and the food comes in larger portions and is of noticeably better quality. No good Mexican restaurant is complete with a solid condiment bar and here you will find pico, spicy carrot and radishes, as well as a few sauces ranging from mild to hot. What to get? Can't go wrong with a fish or beef burrito and I'd advise getting the horchatta.
