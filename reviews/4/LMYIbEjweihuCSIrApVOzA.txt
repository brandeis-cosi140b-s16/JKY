Point of clarification regarding Jen's review, Casa Del Sol (as it is now known) has no legal ties, nor has it ever, to the Casa De Lara downtown. It's likely the decision to change names had a lot to do with this fact, although I'm not certain.

I'm a big fan of authentic Mexican cuisine, and for the price, this place was outstanding. We were started off with a small basket of spicy tortilla chips and an authentic salsa with just enough kick to let us know the kitchen here doesn't fool around and won't be placating weak gringo palates. Along with our drink order, we took an order of guacamole, served in the traditional stone bowl. DAMN! that was good! It had a perfect texture, not excessively blended nor impossibly chunky, and a fresh flavor that I wanted to savor as long as I could. I ordered the Carne Asada a la Tampique√±a, but I could have ordered literally anything on the menu and have been just as satisfied.

We came on a Friday night and were sat immediately. This place is a sleeper. By that I mean, you'd never know the food was as good as it is judging by the dinning room furniture. This food is easily of high enough caliber to be served at a far more expensive joint. It's not an ugly or horribly cheap dining room, although the atmosphere may be holding there success back a bit. To get that coveted 5th star, I suggest replacing the metal (yet, comfortably upholstered) chairs and matching tables, with handcrafted wooden furniture. Anything to separate this experience from La Hacienda's cafeteria-esque appearance will be a step in the right direction.

The only (minor) complaint I have is that when I ordered a Negro Modelo, I got a Dos Equis Amber... our conversation was so engaging, I didn't notice until it was time to go.
