I came here about a week ago when it was almost 10pm and a lot of places were closed, looking for a light meal to keep me from getting hungry later in the evening since I'm a night owl.  I ordered a small bowl of soup which happened to be on sale for about $1.59, a chicken tamale to try for $1.29 I think, and a drumstick off their value (99 cent) menu.  All three were delicious, hit the spot, and were the perfect amount of food for under $5 to tide me over.  I was especially impressed with the flavor of the soup, though it was served way to hot and I had to wait a long time for it to cool down enough to eat.

I went there again a few nights later because I got a craving for more of that chicken tortilla soup, this time ordering the larger size, still on sale, about $3.69 for a pretty big container.  I asked if they could not make it so hot this time, so it was my fault it cooled down to barely warm by the time I'd finished the $2.50 steak taco I got on the side.  I only intended to eat half the soup but it was so good I couldn't stop till I'd wiped out three fourths of it.  

It's handy having this place be so close to my motel.  Now that the weather is turning chilly I'll probably be back for more of that soup!

For the second time in one day I encountered a restroom that was out of TP, but here they responded quickly, with concern and apologies, with one of the clerks hurrying back immediately to remedy the problem, a far better reaction than I got at Stein Mart at Tempe Marketplace earlier in the day.
