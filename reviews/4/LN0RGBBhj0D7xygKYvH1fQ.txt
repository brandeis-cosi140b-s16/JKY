I absolutely love Los Cabos.  Both the food and atmosphere are a mixture of SoCal (i assume) and Pittsburgh, which is a lot cooler than it sounds.  It is almost like a melting pot of freshness, cheaposity, and choice.  Liberawesome! 

I have had the shredded chicken burrito, the bean tostada, the quesadilla, and the California Burrito. So far California Burrito is my absolute favorite. Carne asada, fries, and a sour cream sauce make a super-filling and super-tasty dinner.  Since sizes are so huge, i usually cut it in half and have my lunch for the next day.  I am looking forward to trying the Pittsburgh Burrito which has fries and coleslaw! 

Service is fast and friendly and in the case of the hostess, SUPER CUTE.  They never rush you to place your order and are willing to make substitutions. I always leave a nice tip because i enjoy eating there.  

I plan to come here even more often once i wean the husband off of Qdoba and Chipotle!  I LUVZ U, LOS CABOS!
