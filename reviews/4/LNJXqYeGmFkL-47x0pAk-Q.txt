Great mix between Mexican fast food and dine-in restaurant. Very casual atmosphere. There are TVs, but they aren't too loud to bother your dining experience. 

I went with my family and we were greeted at the door. After we chose our own place to sit (outside or inside), we were given menus and had our drink and food orders taken. Chips and salsa were complimentary and the food arrived in record time! The food was good, but don't expect fine dining quality.

Our waitress gave us great service! We will be back.
