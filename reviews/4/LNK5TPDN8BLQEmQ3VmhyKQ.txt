Kelley is Awesome. I gave her a text as we rolled up, we were met at the door, and cruised in with no cover. This place was popping! Not really my thing anymore...too young, and too much volume (not the music, just the flow of drinks and people). We went to the bar and right as we were ready to order, a young woman asked me what my name was, I said Toby, and she replied to her friend to her left...It is him! Crazy I knew her friend from 10 years earlier. She goes remember me, I said yes, married to Andre, 2 kids, and nice to see you again. She replied, Divorced, Andre is an asshole, and great to see you again. We met up with Kelley again in the sand, by the water, to hook her up with a shot for being so cordial. Like I sais...not my scene any longer. My buddies had some good drinks, we left one there, and we moved on. Overall it was good. We had a few tacos from the taco dude, they were very taste at 12am.
