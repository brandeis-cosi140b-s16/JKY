Came here the other night with my best friend's family. The first thing I noticed was how accommodating the restaurant is for those in wheelchairs. The hostess immediately directed us to every single ramp and moved obstacles out of the way ahead of our group. 

We had the chips, guacamole, and salsa trio to start. The guacamole is very oniony but we all like onions so we loved it. Amongst us we had the beef enchiladas, pork special, chicken enchiladas, and the chicken nugget kids meal. My little friend Dustin was well supplied with sheets for coloring. 

While the chicken tortilla soup that came with my entree was a little brothier than I'm used to and a little more bland, it was still pretty okay. All of our entrees were good (I loved the rice that accompanied my enchiladas) and the sweet potato tots that I kept snagging from Dustin's plate were delightful. He was also plied with bowls of ice cream which he seemed to really enjoy. We had the friend banana for dessert and couldn't even finish it because we were so full.

The food was good, our server was fantastic, and while the prices seemed a bit high, the restaurant.com coupon made it pretty reasonable considering the food and service was great. The restaurant also has a nice look to it; a bit darker and quiet as well as roomy. It made for a great dinner with great friends!
