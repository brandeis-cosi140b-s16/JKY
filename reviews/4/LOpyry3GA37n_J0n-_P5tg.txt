A fan of the original THBH on Camelback, I was thrilled to see one opening very close to home. Not only is this a great addition to the neighborhood, but it will bring the addition of several inches to my waistline. 

The owner of this branch, Cindy, was working the register and couldn't have been nicer. And, a 3-pack of tacos for $5.00 was a deal I couldn't pass up. Carne Asada, Chicken and Fish were my choices. 

These are all well-sized tacos, making this more than a meal at a great price. All 3 were tasty and I look forward to getting back soon to try their wide variety of hot dogs. 

I never thought I'd be so happy to see hippies move into the neighborhood.
