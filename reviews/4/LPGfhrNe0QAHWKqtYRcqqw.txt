Alright, first off I have not been to this establishment. However, I am from Lincoln Nebraska, where I lived a few blocks from Mr Lenos (Same People). I am going so far as to write this review because the food that I had on a very regular basis (at least twice a week) was so consistently good. From the chile rellenos to my favorite fish burrito, this place does it. I do plan on getting to this location and updating this review soon. My only issue is driving from Scottsdale.
