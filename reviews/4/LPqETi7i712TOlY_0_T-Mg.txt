For lunch, dinner, or brunch, you really can't beat the Steel Cactus.  My favorite lunch/dinner item are the tofu tacos.  For brunch, definitely a couple $2 mimosas and either the chorizo burrito or a standard scrambled eggs and bacon.  The breakfast nachos are special, I wish I could eat those everyday.  Also worth mentioning is the decor, it's very interesting and fun to look at.  The rooftop bar looks nice, although I've never sat out there.  You must give the Steel Cactus a try!
