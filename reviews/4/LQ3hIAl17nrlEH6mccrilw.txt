Like some of the other reviewers, I am also from Southern California and it has changed my view of Mexican food forever. I've tried quite a few Mexican food places since I've been in Pittsburgh and Los Cabos is one of my favorites. The people who work there are always friendly, and they offer free chips and salsa when you dine-in. The fish tacos are AWESOME and the enchiladas, quesadillas, and all other tacos are great as well. I'm sure I could recommend more, but I usually get the fish tacos and only occasionally try other food options.
