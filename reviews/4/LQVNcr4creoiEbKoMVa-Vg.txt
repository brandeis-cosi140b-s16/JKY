Empanadas!! I can't remember the last time I saw empanadas on a menu in AZ so I'm thrilled to have them in my 'hood now. In fact, the last time I had an empanada was in LA. I would say these are the star of the menu and they have over a dozen sweet and savory to choose from. 

I also had the green chili chicken enchiladas which was really good but they forgot to put the side of rice with my order and since I ordered to go I didn't notice until I was home. 

This place is new and still working out the kinks. I agree with the other reviews that its not really designed to be a dine in experience unless you're solo or maybe a party of two. The girl running the counter seemed a bit overwhelmed with 3 people in the place. 

But the concept is great and there's nothing like it around. I will probably call in my order in the future. But I'm so happy to have empanadas!!!
