The tortillas at Carolina's are legendary.  Everyone in AZ knows that.  I am a bean expert and I think Carolina's has some amazing beans; not too salty and not too bacon-y flavored.  The one problem I have with Carolina's is the use of SO MUCH packaging!!  They use Styrofoam everything which is horrible for the environment and also horrible to put hot food in because the chemicals leach into the food.  Each item is wrapped in multiple layers of paper and I feel like we can fill a landfill with just the trash from a meal from two people.  They have got to put some recycle bins in here and change their packaging.  Would it be so hard to put combination meals on washable plates?
