This is a place for hot food nuts.  It is the only place I have been that when I requested their hottest hot sauce they gave me a habanero pur√©e.  Everything I have had has been spicy with a clean strong flavor.  My only complaint is that the staff can be a bit slow and a bit under staffed.  Despite that this is still my favorite Mexican place in Pittsburgh.
