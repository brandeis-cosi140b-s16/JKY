Last week, after watching the Suns warm up before a game, we left the arena in search of food. I spotted something new right down the street. Vitamin T. I had heard of this place before, though I couldn't remember what I had heard. Was it a smoothie shop?

We peeked inside to see a few wooden tables with stools, an extensive salsa bar and small open kitchen. Another taco shop! Venturing further inside, bumping into The Most Interesting Man in the World (or his cardboard twin), we took a look at the menu, a flat screen TV mounted to the wall. A little out of place here, but I digress.

We ordered a variety of tacos: barbacoa, chicken and veggie. And we couldn't turn down the Dos Equis. On paper (or should I say, plasma) the barbacoa sounded the most amazing. Surprisingly, the chicken taco was my fave. And I usually hate chicken tacos. The small strip (not shredded, yay!) meat was perfectly cooked and expertly seasoned. I'm not even sure what was on it, some sort of cabbage and white sauce, but it hit the spot! The barbacoa had a very interesting flavor, but the meat was pretty dry. Maybe it was an off day.

We'll definitely be back when we're downtown and in the mood for some tacos. I'd also love to try their tortas. I just hope I remember that Vitamin T is a taco shop and not a health food store.

PS. Any place that serves sour cream at their salsa bar gets four stars in my book.
