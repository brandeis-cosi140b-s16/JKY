Well, I'm still coming to this Rubios after all this time. Mostly because it is pretty close to my house. Also, because I love fish tacos. However they have made huge improvements to both the quality of their service and their food. The entire Rubios chain revamped their menu a couple years ago and I have to say it was definitely for the better. They now have a lot more options and almost all of them are pretty healthy (I guess everything except the churros, really) as well as tasty. And I love, love, love the fact that they have started offering local beers in their restaurant. That is awesome. Most of the time I will pass on that since I am usually just picking up takeout on my way home from work. But I am always greeted with a smile by someone who is both friendly as well as intelligent. They always double check the order and no longer have the issue of forgetting to leave off the white sauce when I ask. That is more than I can say for most other locations.

I also like the fact that Rubios has an environmental conscience. Most of their packaging is bio degradable or recyclable. And they only use seafood that was sustainably harvested. You can read more about that on their website and you can also sign up for their emails. I get lots of coupons, especially when they launch a new menu item. It is pretty cool.

Only a couple small things are keeping them from 5 stars. First, their iced tea is terrible. They really need to up their game in that area. And my other complaint is that at this location the bin at the salsa bar with the carrots and jalape√±os is always out of carrots. A mi me gusta las zanahorias!
