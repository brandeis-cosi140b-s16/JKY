We were staying at The Venetian and around 11 a.m. most restaurants were closed but Cañonita was opening. What a pleasant surprise! The food was delicious for a casual restaurant and so were the margaritas. I had the enchiladas and a soup and went back the next day to get exactly the same because I couldn't have enough.We got a table close to the góndolas and we witnessed a wedding, it was a wonderful experience. I highly recommend it.
