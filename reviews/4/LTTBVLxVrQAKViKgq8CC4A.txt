Let's TACO 'bout this joint. 

Coming into the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they take the orders at the counter, as opposed to getting seated first. Advantages of this would be not having to wait for the server to come to you, and getting your food faster (of course?!!). The menu has a variety of items that range from street food, tacos, burritos, and more. I decided to get tacos, and they are priced at about $2.75 for one. For me, 3 filled me up. I got the grilled steak, chicken and al pastor tacos. I was a little skeptical about how good they would taste especially since the tacos only consisted of the protein, onion, cilantro and lime, but simple must be better in this case. 

Even better news, there is a salsa bar! There are many different types of salsa and I recommend trying as many as possible. Mixing the salsa together on my tacos actually tasted pretty good. Also, when you check in on yelp, you get an order of chips so don't forget to do that! They are very generous in how many chips they give you. Even with a party of 4, we didn't even finish the basket. I highly recommend trying this place out, you will not be disappointed!
