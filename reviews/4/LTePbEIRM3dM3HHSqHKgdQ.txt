Yes, I know it's not authentic... but this is my go to place to satisfy a craving for Mexican food.

I love the salsa. In terms of the Monterrey locations, this one has the best. For me, it's the perfect texture, flavor and heat combination. I also have to order the cheese dip every time. I'm not a huge fan of their guac. It's okay as a topping for my meal, but I would never make it a point to order a bowl for my chips.

I'm in a longstanding relationship with the chicken chimichangas... soft with rice instead of beans. You can't go wrong with anything that is drizzled in cheese. When I do cheat on the chimichangas, I go with chicken soft tacos or whatever the special is. My mom doesn't like Mexican food (I know, right? Don't even get me started on that), but she is a big fan of the taco salad.

Monterrey has decent drink specials. It's not terribly expensive to begin so don't expect to have to drop a ton of money on food and drinks.

Service is hit or miss. One constant though is that it never takes a long time for your food to come out of the kitchen.

Casual place. Nothing fancy. I like the fact that I can go in here with my pajamas on and feel like no one is judging me. What? Sometimes you get the urge for chips and salsa and don't feel like getting out of your pjs.
