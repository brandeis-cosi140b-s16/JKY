We decided to use a restaurant.com certificate here and was pleased. I had the "Carne Asada Platter" which was $15.99. It not only came with the Carne Asada and rice and beans, but also a "Cheese Enchilada" and a "Side Salad". It was very tasty.
My hubby had the "Fajita and Margarita" special which was $9.99 with a players card.
The only downside is at this location we both got just 5 flour tortillas to split between us and if you want more then it is $2.50 for 3. The server was very friendly and gave us 2 more complimentary but I do think that you should get more then 5 considering we both had meals that come with tortillas. We got the "Chili Con Queso" for an appetizer and it was $5.99. We loved it! It was thick and cheesy. Our total with the coupon came to only $22.30. That is a steal!

I know the area isn't the most glamorous but for the price and taste it is well worth it.
