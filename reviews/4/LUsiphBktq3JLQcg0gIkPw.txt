Ok, so I was walking around with nothing to do and hungry at breakfast time when I noticed they opened up two new restaurants. Which to choose, the Mexican, or the American so I just went to the one that looked the least busy and I'm glad I did.

It's a walk up and order at the counter place, nothing fancy, and they call your number when your food is ready. The hours were 7a-3p according to the sign on the door so yet another place that is only for breakfast and lunch... you'd think someone would want to be open for dinner to cater to the people living in the building, but oh well. The Chorizo burrito had to be one of the best chorizo burritos I'd ever had. I grew up in Maryvale for f*'s sake, I know my Mexican food. I didn't expect anything here to really be good, but this burrito was freakin' awesome. For $2.99 you get a shit ton of food, and with an orange juice only cost me $5.25 out the door. Cant beat that price either. I recommend anyone who works or lives in the are to give it a shot. It's probably not worth a drive from the suburbs, but damn, one hell of a breakfast.
