I've had two good dining experiences here and everyone I was with liked what they ordered. They also liked their margaritas, which were quite strong.

The house special La Tablita is a make-your-own-taco platter that "serves two." It easily could've served four. We ordered it with steak and carnitas. 

Some of the carnitas were ribs--I've never seen that before--it's usually pork shoulder or butt. I love carnitas, theirs was good, but would've been better if the meat had been broken into chunks before browning. Instead, it was served it in two solid chunks so most of the meat was dry and not crispy from being fried up in oil or fat before serving.

Summary: Really good Mexican at ridiculous Vegas prices. And of course the place is ridiculously loud, like everywhere you go on the wacko Strip.
