The Giant Carumba Burrito for $5.95 are you kidding me, this is 3 meals for me. Burrito takes up the entire aluminum tin with lettuce tomatoes and sauce. Even though it is huge still has good taste, I get the beef and it is served wet in the enchilada sauce. 

Also comes with chips and has a small good salsa bar.

You order at the counter and they call your number to pick up the food. 

If you are looking for a fast inexpensive good quality clean Mexican restaurant, this is it, They do live up to their motto "Where you don't PESO much!"

For the money you spend and the food you get it is a 5 star, but 5 star is an over the top restaurant for me.

Use to go to the one in Glendale, but with work have been coming for lunch to the one on Bell Road. Same good service and food
