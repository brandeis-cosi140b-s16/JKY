While I find the prices to be a tad on the high side for a place that's pretty divey, I will say that having a Mexican buffet is pretty unique to the area and well worth the price at $9.99. I did appreciate that they didn't charge me for my 2 year old to eat from the buffet but I didn't appreciate the lack of free refills. It doesn't say anything on the menu about not having free refills and our server didn't mention it.  The service is pleasant and friendly though, the restaurant is C-L-E-A-N, and the food is served hot and fresh. I guess I can suck it up on the lack of free refills or just order water in order to enjoy solid food with very nice service.
