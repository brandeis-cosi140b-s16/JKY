I'm in this area a lot for work and can't believe I never seen this place.  Zaba's is sort of hidden, but once you find it, it's on.  You can pretty much get the same dishes that a Chipotle carries, but in my opinion, it's fresher here.  I love restaurants like this where the service is good, the ambiance is chill, and the menu is easy.  Because it's my first time, I ended up getting their shredded beef taco, chicken taco, and steak taco.  All were wrapped in corn tortilla.  I kept my tacos basic, with just a hint of cheese on each and that's it.  No lettuce, no sauce, no guac, no anything else.  Okay, I lied.  I may have had some sour cream added.  My tacos were seasoned and full of flavor.  Out of the 3 tacos, I think that the steak held it's flavor best.  As for price and size, these aren't your small street tacos.  These tacos are bigger and the prices are well in my budget.  Lets be honest, I think I could have eaten 3 more not because of the size of these tacos, but because these tacos were so good.  One day I will be back to try their nachos loaded with chicken or one of their ginormous burritos. I think it's obvious, I am a fan. Need to thank the GF for this one.  If it wasn't for her, I'd still be missing out.
