El Jefe is a great place to hang out with the boys during the World Champion San Francisco Giants Spring Training.    It is a stone's throw away from Scottsdale Stadium and the place has a fine selection of beers and margaritas.  El Hefe would be a 5 star in my book if they served more Budweiser products, but it is what it is.  I will definitely come back with Cella when she is invited to spring training.  Thanks El Hefe!
