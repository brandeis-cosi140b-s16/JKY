We have ate here a number of times. The food was always good however last night it was only far we got the #3 combo green or red chili burrito rice and beans we got the green it did not have a good flaver had much better before. The beans tasted burnt the rice was good.  This was the first time it was not good.  Will try again but not the green burrito.
