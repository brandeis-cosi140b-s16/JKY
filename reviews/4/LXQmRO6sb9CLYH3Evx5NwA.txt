Let's start by stating the obvious: Pittsburgh is a Mexican-food desert. (Note to the 'Burgh: hard shell 'tacos' are not tacos, guys.) Time and time again, I have been disappointed in the American-inspired Tex-Mex being paddled here as authentic Mexican food. 

But La Palapa gives me hope, they have the most authentic - and delicious - Mexican food in town, the service is super friendly, and the space is lovely too. Highly recommend if you want some real Mexican food for a change while in PGH.
