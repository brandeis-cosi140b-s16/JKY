I had to knock this place down a star for being overly loud...with speakers above each booth it was a little obnoxious how loud this place was while the game was on. My table of 6 could barely carry a conversation without yelling across the table over the speakers.

The chips and salsa were mediocre but they did continue replenishing the chips until the salsa was gone thankfully. The tacos were amazing on the other hand. Definitely worth four stars on their own. I tried the Duck Carnitas, the Al Pastor, their Carne Asada and the Beef Cheek taco. I'd recommend each of them and twice on days ending in a Y. 

The drinks were a little weak for the prices. I had the Bulldog-Garita with the mini bottle of Sol tipped upside down in the chalice....not very strong for a 32oz. marg....the Mexican Mule wasn't my favorite either. At $10 each just order beer or tequila or both.

All that aside service was tip top and the servers here are all attractive with ASU down the block. Worth a stop in for some great tacos outside the norm.
