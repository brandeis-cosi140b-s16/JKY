Yummy Mexican. I had a burrito bowl with chicken, black beans, pick, cheese, cilantro, and jalape√±os. It was a ton of food. I also ordered the chips and queso. I like how thing the chips are but I didn't love their queso. They have good sweet tea and coke machine that gives a bunch of options. Easy to access from the parking lot.
