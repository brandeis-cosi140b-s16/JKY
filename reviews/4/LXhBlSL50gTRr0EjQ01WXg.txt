The food is tasty. It's nothing that's incredibly unique compared to other americanized mexican restaurants, but they serve a pretty scrumptious bean dip with the salsa and they have a billion flavors of margarita. The atmosphere is ok, Oh, and they're open late! Its a great place to keep in mind when you're super hungry, and its after most restaurants have closed. A good back pocket restaurant for sure!
