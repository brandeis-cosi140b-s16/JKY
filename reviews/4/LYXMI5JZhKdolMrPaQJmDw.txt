Food was great.  I got the dos compadres which has steak and chicken.  I really enjoyed the food.   Also they sang to other tables for birthdays and it was different because they had instruments like they were in a band.  I was staying in the hotel next door and as I came out another guest in the hotel ask me about the food and I did recommend him to go there
