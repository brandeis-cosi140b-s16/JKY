Definitely a fan of this place. They really know how to wine and dine you here.

1. There's a lovely hostess greeting you at the front (top 1 girl I've seen in CLT thus far)
2. The wait staff is friendly, fast, and graceful
3. Their bar is ideal if you want a quiet environment to watch a football game.
4. Their food is pretty phenomenal as well.
5. Enchiladas de Mole are top chart.

Didn't really pay attention to anything else as I was trying to make sure my gf didn't catch me sneaking that peek kiddddd.

LBD scale: 8.5. Definitely a really good Mexican place that everybody should try.
