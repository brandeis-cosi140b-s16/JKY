This is my go to spot after a night of clubbing when I'm craving tacos. They are open until 5am on Saturday,  which really is EARLY Sunday morning. They are usually very busy but are efficient in getting your food out asap. There are separate lines designated for which tacos you want. I love how they also accept credit cards including AMEX.
Their tacos are good! I get the Taco de Adobado which is their pastor. They shave the pork off the spindle and even cut a piece of pineapple. It's absolutely delish and you must try it!
