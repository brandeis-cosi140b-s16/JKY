Just drove by yesterday and noticed that this location finally opened--it's Chipotle so I had to stop in to see it. The line was out the door, but it was definitely worth the wait. One thing I noticed about this particular location, it has a small area for people to wait. The downtown Scottsdale location has a designated line-waiting area that wraps around half of the restaurant.  Not a huge deal, just an observation on the setup of the space.

The staff was fast and super excited to serve--most likely because they just opened.  Hopefully that keeps up. Even for being new, there were no hiccups on my order or none that I noticed on other orders.  Food, as always, was delicious and disappeared quickly.
