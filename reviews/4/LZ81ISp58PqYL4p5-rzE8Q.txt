Saw it on Triple D & couldn't wait to try it. Had lunch & the free chips & salsa very good, corn based salsa with a kick. Guacamole was extremely good @ fresh. Has the taco's, one of each, BBQ Mahi Mahi & Tavarua (wahoo) with a drizzled wasabi sauce, unbelievable. The service was right on, got us in @ out while still being very personable.
