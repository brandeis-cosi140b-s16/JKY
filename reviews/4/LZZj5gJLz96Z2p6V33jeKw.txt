When asked about a good Mexican restaurant in town, our friend immediately recommended the original Lindo Michoacan. He sited it as authentic and the most noted in Vegas. 

We enjoyed the atmosphere and wide variety on the menu. We were thrilled to learn it was happy hour (at 3pm), margaritas and beer were only half price, and that the lunch menu was still going. 

Half the menu had English translations and half did not but our server was very good at explaining the unique parts of each dish and we had a hard time deciding!

We appreciated that the flavors were rich and dishes somewhat unique from other Mexican popular restaurants. I felt like something fresh so ordered the fish tacos (unoriginal, I know). The fish was high quality, grilled (I had the choice of that or fried), and very juicy! The sauces were also yummy and different than others I've had.

My friends got the Pescado Ajillo (garlic fish) and Beef in Chili Sauce and found both to be unique. The garlic in the fish sauce was a little burnt tasting. The beef was lean and served in hearty portion.

The margaritas we tried were delicious and my friend really enjoyed the spicy rim on his michelada! Another best were the fresh, hot, handmade corn tortillas we were served straight from the oven!

Our bill for 3 people for hearty lunch and drinks was $50 and we were happy with the quality and taste.
