I thought this place was pretty damn good. We were actually trying to eat someplace else and ended up here because the sushi place we wanted to go to wasn't open for lunch. I'm glad we stumbled in here. I think it suffers because of its location in the forum shops; I'm sure they get very little foot traffic walking by. 

Good drinks, very good chips and salsa and guac, and the enchiladas, tacos, and quesadillas were all quite good - a step above your typical tex-mex fare. The whole menu was texmex essentially so nothing too exotic but what they do prepare they seem to prepare well.

The place is pretty small so it's not much of a "scene" but as far as strip restaurants go it's fairly affordable and definitely fills you up.
