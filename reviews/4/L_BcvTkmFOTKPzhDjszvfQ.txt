Situated on the side of a major commuter highway is this nondescript little brick building that would appear to house nothing but just another greasy Tex-Mex restaurant shelling out food just a cut above Taco Bell for quintuple the price.

And when you walk in that seems to be confirmed...pink walls, tile floors, mariachi music...everything about it will remind you of your typical suburban "Mexican" restaurant experience, so I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the food went far above and beyond my expectations. I thought I came in knowing exactly what I was getting myself into.

Instead for around $20 (and this includes tip+tax) my girlfriend and I were presented with a very high-quality lunch of fajitas and salad that I am more accustomed to expecting from a place that markets itself as upscale. The seasoning was excellent, the meat was juicy and high-quality, the salad was fresh and unique.
