When you walk in, you order off a menu at the counter like you would at McDonalds. 
But coming the first time, it would have been beneficial to look at the menu online first. LOL! 
I got the trio tacos, which has the traditional fried fish taco, shrimp taco and grilled Mahi Mahi. The grilled Mahi Mahi was my favorite, but all were good. 
We got an order of the guacamole and chips to share, but both filled up on tacos and ended up throwing the chips away. 
They have a small salsa bar that had many choices from chipotle, med salsa, tomatillo, to jalapeño citrus to name some.  I like the jalapeño mostly because of the spicy it added. What can I say, this Louisiana gal likes it hot!  ;)
I really enjoyed this place and will return to try some of the other choices.
