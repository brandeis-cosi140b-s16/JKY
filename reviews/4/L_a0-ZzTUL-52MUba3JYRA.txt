Came here with a friend for the first time on Taco Tuesday and was very pleasantly surprised! This business is actually under new ownership and in the process of transitioning their menu. I attempted to order a couple things from the menu, but my waiter told me they were no longer offering those items. Normally, this would be frustrating, but our waiter was extremely accommodating and proactive in getting the closest substitute. He even provided my friend and I with a free drink the restaurant wanted to test out. The tacos, (only $1 on Tuesday!) despite being tiny, were extremely flavorful and filling. I tried 3 different kinds, and each was more delicious than the last! Despite not being a huge tequila fan (but it was too cheap to pass up, and kind of mandatory on Taco Tuesday), I really enjoyed my watermelon margarita! With a great patio, delicious food and drinks, friendly staff, and crazy low prices (3 drinks, 4 tacos, and chips and salsa came out to less than $20...), I will most definitely be back! Can't wait for the grand re-opening festivities!
