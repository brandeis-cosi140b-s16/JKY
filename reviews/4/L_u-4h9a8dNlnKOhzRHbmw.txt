The one thing you will not do here is leave hungry - assuming you stay long enough to place your order, of course, and that is part of the problem.

Some restaurants you expect to not be terribly fancy, so you go in knowing that. In this case, the outside doesn't look like much, but it gives you hope that there is a quaint little joint on the inside. Be prepared for what lies within.

The floors are bare, the tables sparse - it's like a scene out of Pacific Heights, and not when Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine fix up the house. I'm talking after Michael Keaton removes all the fixtures, so all you have left is a bare floor and a card table.

This isn't to say it's bad - it's just completely unexpected, especially if you've been here before. The cute little Italian place that used to be here? No more.

If you make it this far, however, the service is solid, and the food good - and you get plenty of it, so sit back and enjoy. Just don't lean too far or the card table may collapse.
