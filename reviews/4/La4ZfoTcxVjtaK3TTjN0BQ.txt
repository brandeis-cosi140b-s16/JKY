So happy that we decided to eat dinner here before the Chris Angel show. We had a coupon so we went ahead for the full meal, but they also have great Happy Hour deals as well. Such as the Sies y Sies with six tacos and six beers for only $29...What A Deal!!!

Anyhow, we ordered a variety of tacos, including the baja style crisy fish tacos, the "best in vegas" wich had beef and a bit of bacon and of course the pulled pork. All were served on fresh corn tortillas with sauces and cilantro and onions. Ev erything was fresh and tender, and full of flavor. Tacos were on the small side, otherwise we were very happy. The atmosphere is fun and the location is great as well. Easy to find in the middle of Luxor.

Great meal in Vegas for sure.
