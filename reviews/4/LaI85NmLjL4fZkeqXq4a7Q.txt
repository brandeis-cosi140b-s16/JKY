One word. Carnitas. 

Lunch break on a Friday and I was headed out with a coupon in hand to Taters and Salads down the street. Well, that must have been a bust concept. Closed. Backup LVB to try and find a place along the way back to the office. Frantically doing Yelp Mobile search. Hmm...this place looks good and original. 

Ordered to go: 4 Carnitas Tacos, side of beans and rice. 

Back at the office: OMG those tacos are HUGE. 2 corn tortillas, LOADED with really lean pork with a nice helping of the "crunchy" part of the meat, topped with a healthy dollop (love that word!) of avocado and some pico de gallo. HUGE cups of beans and rice and a complimentary bag of chips and salsa. 

Chips and Salsa: thick chips, very lightly salted. Yum. Salsa, not the thick and chunky kind, good flavor (needed more!) 

Tacos: I could only eat two! They were amazing, full of flavor, very lean pork, fresh avocado. Wonderful! 

Beans and Rice: I ate these on Saturday for lunch along with the left over meat from the other two tacos. Good flavor on both beans and rice. 

I'll be back to try out some other items but seems like a great local, authentic Mexican place. From what I had the portions are liberal, ingredients are fresh and flavor is great! 

Worth checking out if you are in the area.
