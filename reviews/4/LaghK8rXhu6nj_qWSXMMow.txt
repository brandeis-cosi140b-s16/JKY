A little patio with a little waterfall and little birds flitting about.
A little bit different than your average local mexican, since it's NEW mexican style.
A little bit of $ for a little more food than I could eat at once.
A lot is how much I like Gil's food and service.
A lot is how much effort the proprietor seems to have put into creating a unique, quaint, homey, and comforting menu and atmosphere.
A lot is how much effort you should put into finding this little gem.
