Okay so the only reason I'm giving Rigoberto's 4 out of 5 stars is because I'm currently on a diet and it's not diet friendly. So I'll write the rest of the review based on my pre-diet dining. 

This place is some serious mexican food. Not the fancy stuff, the good, mexican-at-home style. It's good at 6am, lunch, dinner, midnight, and even the 2am drunk-I'm-hungry meal. I have three favorites here.

1. Bean and cheese burrito w/sour cream - the beans are refried with good ol' grease. It's delicious and the cheese is legit cheddar.

2. Super Nachos - I don't understand how you can not finish this one. They give you a ridiculous amount of chips with a mexican buffet on top, but once you get the hot sauce on it, you can't stop.

3. Carne Asada burrito, no pico, with sour cream and Guacamole - Cooked fresh on the grill and wrapped in the biggest tastiest flour tortilla. They even will sell you the tortillas by themselves if you ask. 

Enjoy!
