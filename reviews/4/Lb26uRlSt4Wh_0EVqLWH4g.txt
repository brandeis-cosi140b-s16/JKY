Great place to go for lunch. If you order from the lunch menu, you'll spend less than $7! Normally I get the #3 - red. The service is spotty. During the busy lunch hour, sometimes I've had to ask for more chips 2-3 times before I get some. Sometime we have to wait a long time for the check too. 

The food, though, pretty good. Try the hot salsa with your chips - it's some of the best salsa that I've ever had. They're also open early and it's a good place to swing by for a breakfast burrito or two. 

Parking is not too bad - they have two separate parking lots which fill up during the lunch hour.
