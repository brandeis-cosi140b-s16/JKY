When I lived in CA, you couldn't throw a rock without finding a 24 Hour Mexican drive thru place that was literally the most delicious food you could ever imagine stuffing into your maw. Moving to AZ, I had a REALLY hard time finding one that was even passable within a five mile radius of my house.

Luckily, I went to Polibertos one day because it was there and I was hungry after a trip at Fry's, and it's mostly filled  that hole in my heart. I do wish there was a drive thru, but c'est la vie.

The food is pretty good, I always like the roll tacos and they give you a good amount of guacamole. I particularly like the Fajita burrito and the Ranchera burrito. It is really slow getting your food, in part because there are a decent amount of patrons (probably because the food is good), and in part because there are only like two people working here at any given time. 

The hot sauce/other accouterments bar has a good variety, and I appreciate the little sandwich baggies for your jalapenos/limes/etc. I do wish people wouldn't constantly hover over this, and I will never forget seeing some ASU frat boy clean out 1/2 the bar even though he ordered one measly burrito, but that's nothing I can fault the restaurant for.

Four stars because it's good and satisfies my need when I want Mexican fast food.
