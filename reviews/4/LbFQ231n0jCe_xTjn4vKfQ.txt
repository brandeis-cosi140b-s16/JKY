I am an absolute lover of Mexican food. Verdes food is incredible, and by request you can a lot of options vegan! All the staff is super friendly and inviting. On Tuesday their tacos are 20% off, but food and drinks are on the pricey side, but this is one of my favorite places to hang out with friends, and get some food and drinks. They have one of the best selections of tequila and the staff are very knowledgable on the alcohol selection. They also have outdoor seating which is nice in warm weather!
