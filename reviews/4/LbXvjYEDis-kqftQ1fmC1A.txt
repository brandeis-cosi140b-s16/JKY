Wow, I really fell in love with Cien Agave because of their awesome selection of exotic Mexican veg options!  I can usually find a few vegetarian items at most restaurants but they're usually just OK.  What I had at this place was phenomenal!  For example their Pappas Con Queso (seasoned potatoes and cheese) and their grilled veggie tacos were can you say mouthwateringly awesome?! Also, they have the most deliciously fresh and exotic salad dressing made of a prickly pear vinaigrette.  But, my fave of all was their creamy poblano soup, was just the perfect amount of spicy mixed with creamy that has your mouth saying "ahhhh" and "mmmmm" after each spoonful.  Looking forward to trying some of their other tasty food creations and drinks at my fabulously new food crush place!
