I have been driving by this place seeing the 24 hr sign and never caring to stop until tonight. Around midnight I went into this unsuspecting building to find a great taco shop. The inside is not your typical surgical lights and dirty tile motif. Its very tastefully done inside and  I was greeted by the guy running the counter fairly quick. I saw the grilled chicken special and couldn't pass it up. Only *6.99 for 2 pieces of very well seasoned and marinated chicken breast served with rice, beans, and fresh avocado, tomato, and your choice of flour or corn tortillas. I was very happy with the beans and rice too very flavorful and well seasoned once again. I got the green and red salsa and have to say they are some of the better green and red sauces, very good with the food and adequately spicy. I also got a bean and cheese burrito for tomorrow and everything on my bill came to less than $10. Great job for midnight, 10/10 will have again.
