Felt compelled to write a quick review after having a phenomenal burrito here today. I've been going here for about three years and had some fine meals, but today was over the top. 

I usually get the regular size, but this time went for the big, along with the spicy chicken in green chile sauce. Since I was in a hurry, I just told them to load it with "everything". That included, rice, black beans, three kinds of salsa, cilantro, onions, sour cream, guac, chopped jalapenos, lettuce, and tomato - it was monstrously large! Still not sure how they wrapped it but they did. 

The taste was perfect - spicy, smooth, crunchy, warm. A lot of different flavors that together were a symphony in my mouth! Utterly and totally hit the spot. Added bonus - local place with local owners just putting out great product. 

Thumbs up Johnny B's!
