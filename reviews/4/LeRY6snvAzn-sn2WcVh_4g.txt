This is our regular Mexican food place. I'm surprised the Yelp rating is so low--we've never had any problems here. The food is good, not gourmet by any means, but good.

We visited on a Sunday. We could have gotten a free kids meal for our son, but when we informed our waiter that our son only eats tortilla chips, he made sure our tortilla chip bowl stayed full. That was greatly appreciated!

I always get the tacos al carbon, usually with beef. The leftovers are great the next day. My husband enjoys the flaming beef fajitas with rice.

A very pleasant clown visited our table and made our son a balloon archery set. That was a nice surprise!
