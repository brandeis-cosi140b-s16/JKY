We were looking for a good Mexican restaurant and came across this one because of some of the yelp reviews. Anyways, we had a hard time finding this place because its hidden in the corner of the Fry's shopping center. 

When we walked in the restaurant it had a Mexican theme but they do have a lot of family pictures. I like it cause this is a family owned restaurant. I can see their kids hanging out and standing by the carts as they serve which I think is fine. 

We asked the serve a lot of questions and she knew everything about the menu. Since she knew this was our first time here she gave us little bowls of their green and red chili so we could decide what to order. Oh my goodness. Both of their chili was so good. The green was a little more spicy than the red. 

I had the Gallo Burro and a machaca taco. I would have to say the taco was one of the best I've had. Very good. Their Gallo Burro was rated #1 so that's why I ordered it and it was very good green chili burro. Everyone cleaned up their plate so the food was very good. 

The service was very good too. Our server was helpful and friendly. Always keeping tabs on us to make sure everything was okay. They also reminded us before the food came out that the plates are very hot and they were. Since the plates are so hot they put the plates on a plastic cart. Haven't seen this style of service in a long time. 

Overall, I really enjoyed the meal at this family owned restaurant. This place will be our Tempe hangout whenever we have that  Mexican food craving.
