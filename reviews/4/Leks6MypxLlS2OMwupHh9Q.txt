I live right down the road from here been here a handful of times usually at night on the weekend I do like the outside setting the drinks are decent if u go in the winter it does kinda suck if its chilly out.  The only thing I've had here food wise are the carne asada tacos and wow were they good didn't expect it. Atmosphere is up and down as well sometimes its easy to find a table other times it sucks. I haven't been here for a while so I don't know if anything has changed.
