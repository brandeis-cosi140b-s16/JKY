Always busy at this location. The staff is friendly, polite, and helpful. Love when people make eye contact with me when I'm talking to them. I realize that's probably a little thing but it makes a big difference to me. This location is always clean, bright, and even the bathrooms are clean too.

The food is good enough.  I usually get a salad and its pretty yum. The guacamole is worth the price of admission. All in all, a good go-to place for lunch! :) Wish they had a drive thru!
