very excellent salsa that comes with your chips :)

food is very good, very traditional mexican place without any of those fancy gorditas or cornitas or whatever they try to put together at taco hell !   i will keep this short as others have more details and everytime I am here, its a good experienc- food wise.  Customer service is decent too, they are not very fast at seating you, but I guess if you have an endless crowd at the door, it tends to tire out the servers too.  they do try to bring the food out as soon as u ordered, thats for sure.
