First off...it's a burrito place.  Sorta like Chipotle.  One big difference is that they start with a ball of dough.  They pop it into a press and out comes a tortilla.  Very fresh.  Then the usual rice and beans and filling.  Etc.

I give it four stars as a burrito place.  I'm not comparing it to a steak house or a full Mexican place.  For what it is it's very good.  Very tasty, very fresh.  They even have a stamp card for frequent diners.
