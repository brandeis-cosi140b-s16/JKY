Another great place to take a group of people. Good food and drink! Then we go across the street to another bar usually. I enjoy the burritos here especially. I've never had bad service either. The pace is huge, too so when we take a group there is usually seating for all of us. Definitely try the fast lunch special menu. FAST!
