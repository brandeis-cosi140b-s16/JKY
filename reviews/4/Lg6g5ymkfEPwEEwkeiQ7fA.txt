It really depends on the day for this location.

Some days your burrito comes out HUGE, others they seem much smaller than usual. This time, they had run out of steak and had to quickly prepare it- a lot of it came out quite rare. I like rare steak, but I can see how some people may not enjoy it. Also, the girl helping at the register seemed a little frazzled; there was a cup of hot salsa that she had forgotten to put onto someone else's tray, she put it on ours. When we told her it didn't belong to us, she picked it up, and a few seconds later put it back on our tray. She also forgot to put my burrito in a small tray, so I asked her for one.. Hopefully she was new.

Even when the line is long, they always manage to get people through relatively quickly, which I always appreciate.
