The margaritas here are good and strong.  I enjoyed it with the complimentary chips and salsa.  The tacos were okay.  They seemed to be lacking some flavor to it.  I did enjoy the guacamole though.  I love avocados and veggies!  I totally walked out of there stuffed to the max.  I even took my drink to go in a cool Pink Taco cup.  Thank goodness we're allowed to do that in Vegas.
