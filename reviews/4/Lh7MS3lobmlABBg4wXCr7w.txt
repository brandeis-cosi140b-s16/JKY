I think I want to eat here every day this week. I came in on a slow Sunday night, and wanted to go back on Monday (but I finished my leftovers instead), then Tuesday, and I actually think I might go back tonight to try the Green Chili Chicken Enchilada. I got the Chicken Fajitas plate, and my husband got the tamale and taco combo.  Everything was fresh, not too greasy, and extremely delicious. This is my new quick and easy Mexican food restaurant. Yay!
