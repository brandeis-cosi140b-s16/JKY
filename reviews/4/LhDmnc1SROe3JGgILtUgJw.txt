Went in here around 12:45 today and the place was packed but the service was still good. I waited in line for less than five minutes, ordered, and waited less than ten minutes to receive my food. They handle the lunch rush with ease. In my opinion, the food in general is overpriced but that's the same at any location. It is literally right off the lightrail, which is super nice. I usually go to Subway by campus but stopping here might become a regular thing for me now.
