Wanted to try the new place after Tia Rosas closed. Our service was actually really good especially with the previous comments/posts stating that many had very poor service. Everyone was friendly and welcoming and our server was very bubbly. 
The decor has changed, the knick knacks are gone from the wall, fountains aren't on and paint needs to be added to outside walls. Main room is big and gets very loud when busy.
Next to the food, we had a group of 5 and everyone enjoyed their meals. Good taste and served hot not warm. Salsa and chips are free with the red salsa being my favorite. 
Drinks, we had no problem with either margarita that was ordered. They mixed a blend for us with no problems, believe it was a raspberry/mango mix. Good flavor too.
I would return here on my next visit to the Mesa/Phoenix area.
