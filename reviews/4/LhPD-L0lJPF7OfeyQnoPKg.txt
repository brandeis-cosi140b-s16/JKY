Great homemade chorizo! Non-pretentious place. Not a great location, but were steadily busy. My husbands chicken burrito plate with green sauce was freakin delicious! We can't wait to try more stuff. I was excited to see they had green chile cheese corn tamales, it's been a while since I had a good one, so high hopes to get my chompers on those. A little pricey on the dozen tamales ($18.99) but must be good, right? We were there early so they didn't have the chips made for the day, but their salsas packed a lot of flavor. Nice people, good food, solid place!
