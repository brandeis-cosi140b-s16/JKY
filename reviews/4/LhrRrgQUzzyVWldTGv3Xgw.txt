I am bummed.  Odd happening, been there twice, loved the food/margs - had the same waitress twice - and both times what I wrote on the credit card slip and what my bank statement reflected were different.  Like my server was tipping herself extra.  $3 the first visit, $1 the second visit.  I find that very odd.  Taking cash next time. :(  Food is too good to boycott.  Might have to speak with the owner. :(
