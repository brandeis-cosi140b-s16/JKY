I don't get all the negativity! We went there..  me, my guy, my son, and my daughter. 20 bucks. No joke. And it's not gross. Some of the enchilada sauce was a little closer to ketchup, but it really wasn't bad. I loved some of it, and the sopapillas in themselves bumped this place up a star. Mmmm with honey and sugar right there on the table for ya. This was a good idea, I'm glad we went. Oh, and the waiter was so nice. Everyone in there was super nice. The owner told me ways to try the sopapillas when I went up for more. 
I'm rating this as a BUFFET, because that's what it is. Did you really expect gourmet in a mexican buffet? come on..
