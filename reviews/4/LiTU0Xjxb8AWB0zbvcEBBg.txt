We needed a place cheap enough to be covered by our business expense account but fun enough to stand up as our only Sin City meal... and Hussong's fit the bill perfectly.

My friend W had the Skirt Steak Chile Relleno, which was a nice-sized entree for $16.  I had a bite, and the steak was tender and the pasilla sauce was flavorful.  I went with the Grilled Corn app to start - amazing char, creamy mayo-butter and cotija cheese, then a zippy punch of hot pepper flakes (get this damn app!!!) - and the Tortilla Soup.  My meal came to $14, and I was very, very pleased.

So, while we're sitting there in comes a couple women with Vegas showgirl headdresses and gowns, some fat cat businessmen, and 10 hot chicks in short, black dresses.  They flourish a Victoria tap handle and holler 'free Victoria beer for everyone!'... and the hot chicks start passing out tall glasses.  Woohoo!  It was a fun evening before that, but free beer (with a 2nd free beer brought out because my friend W sweet talked the closest hot chick) made for a great last memory before heading to the airport for our redeyes!
