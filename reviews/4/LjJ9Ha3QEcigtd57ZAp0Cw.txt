I can never quite pinpoint how I feel about this place. But, ultimately, I find it tasty. The salsas are yummy. The salads are a great lunch item. And their chicken enchiladas are a big fav of mine. Everything has a nice spice to it. It's a tad overpriced for what you get. But, hey, it's inside the Hard Rock - by definition, everything there is overpriced. The staff are usually friendly and attentive. The bar area is nice for solo dining. There's video poker at the bar. It's kinda cool to be able to watch them make tortillas. It's rarely too crowded. And the menu has lots of options. So, all in all, this is a pretty good spot for faux Mexican fare.
