I've been frequenting this Zaba's on Fridays during lent for my usual shrimp salad. Each visit has been consistently good! The food is food and has consistent good taste. On today's visit, the manager, Maria, was helping the line and she was very friendly and nice, which is always a plus. A co-worker was with me and we both ordered our shrimp at the same time because last week they had run out of the prepared shrimp, so we had to wait for it to grill. She said that she was on top of it this week and made sure that each store had enough fish ready at lunch time. And she definitely didn't skimp on the shrimp! The reason for four stars and not five is that I do feel sometimes they do skimp on the shrimp and that $9.50 for a salad that is a tad on the small is a bit steep. But I don't eat here daily. Other than that, the service is always great, the food is always fresh and delicious!
