This is one of my neighbor spots, the grilled chicken salad is awesome, which comes with soup.  This is a little different from the standard salad, the layers are refried beans, rice, much chicken, fresh veggies, limes on the side.  I had to take my daughter to speak the language.  The bar is awesome, the servings are great.
