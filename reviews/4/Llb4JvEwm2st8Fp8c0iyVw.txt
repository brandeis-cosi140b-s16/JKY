Very affordable for south of the strip!

I had the Milanesa Cazadores, which was breaded chicken with jumbo skrimpies on top. Delicious and the serving was gargantuan. 

Dude had the Parrillada del Norte, which was pork, steak and grilled chicken. BOMB BOMB BOMB! Serving size was also big.

We were served chips with salsa, guacamole and these wonderful beans! Yum!

Definitely coming back here when I want to get away from the buffets!
