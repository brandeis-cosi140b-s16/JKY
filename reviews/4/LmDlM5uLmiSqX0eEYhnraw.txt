I came here on my visit to Arizona and it was recommended to me by a family member. It was quite an interesting little place. I had their breakfast burrito with chips inside, carne asada fries, and a fish taco. 

I enjoyed the breakfast burrito very much, and for a little kick, they added chips inside the burrito for some much needed crunch. It had to right blend of textures in this dish with the standard delicious breakfast burrito taste. However, their carne asada fries was the real star of the meal. I've had many carne asada fries and I would say without a doubt that this was the best. The steak had such a good texture and a wonderful flavor, and the fries were not over cooked or under cooked, and they held up to the moisture of the dish pretty well. 

The reason I give it a 4 star instead of a 5 star was their fish taco. It had all the right flavors, but it did not come out crunchy at all. It was a disappointing moment because I love fish tacos.

P.S. You must try their red salsas. The mild one has a very bold flavor that makes it addicting with a nice kick of spice. If you want a more spicy version, just up for their spicy red sauce. You can feel the burn of that one in your mouth for a while.
