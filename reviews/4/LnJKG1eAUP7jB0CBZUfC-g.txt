In a world where anything but 5 stars is bad, this is 5 stars. In a world where 5 stars = incredible food, this is a solid 4-star spot.

Expansive menu, friendly service and excellent prices here. I had the cheese enchiladas (my baseline for Mexican places) and they were a bit bland but good. The chips and salsa are BOMB. After a few bites of the enchiladas, I covered them in salsa and NOM NOM NOM. 

They have fountain Coke products,which is a huge plus in my book.

I will be back again soon!
