I'll admit to my vices. I have a tendency to get pretty drunk on weekend nights and wake up with a raging hangover. I'm convinced that the only cure is a breakfast burrito from Filibertos, with a healthy side of the red hot sauce. I pretty much only make it to Fili's for breakfast, but they also have GIANT burritos that are cheap and filling. My favorite: Carne Asada with rice.
