I would say this place is similar to Chipolte. My work is close so i checked it out for lunch. I had the puled pork burrito and it was so good. I was not expecting it to be as good as it was. It had pulled pork, grilled red onion & green peppers, rice, pinto beans, sour cream, and hot sauce. These burritos are big enough to eat half and save half for later or split with someone but I ended up eating every single bit of that thing. They have salads and tacos as well. Check it out!!!
