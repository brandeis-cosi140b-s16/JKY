I'm a fajita guy. A good fajita with awesome tortillas is all that's needed to please me. They make the tortillas 50%. They are pre-baked from a local bakery and cooked to order afterwards. The food took 30 minutes to come but I forgave them after I took my first bite. 

The beans, guac, rice, and most importantly, veggies and steak tasted amazing. I would highly recommend coming here for lunch. It's priced well and made fresh. Can't beat it. Even better when you have a cute date.
