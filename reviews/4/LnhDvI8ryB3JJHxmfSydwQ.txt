$5 margaritas & palomas (among other drinks) during the happy hour were decent.  You HAVE to ask for the complimentary chips & salsa in the bar.  If you stop there, relax, talk, and watch the people go by, you'll probably have a great time.  The happy hour food was pricey, small, and not very tasty- get or split a meal instead.
