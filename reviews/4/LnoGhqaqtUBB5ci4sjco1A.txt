Cabo Fish Taco, in general, is a decent establishment. Although I have conflicting opinions on various food choices offered, the restaurant atmosphere usually makes up for any setback. 

First off, the fish tacos... very well crafted. If you're a fan of fish tacos, you really can't go wrong with these. I've been out to this place about three times now and have come to realize it's a safe bet. My favorite (although I really haven't tried any others) is the Wasabi Fish Taco, which as you may have figured, has that perfect combination of sweet and spicy flavor. In my opinion, it is still on the mild side.

Now contrary to the fish tacos, are their burritos. Fail. These are basically meals you could easily put together yourself- wrap, a can of re-fried beans, mixed with some other ingredients that just don't make up for the overpowering sense of eating at a Taco Bell. Not that there is anything wrong with Taco Bell, but simply put, you are basically paying Cabo $10.29 for a near synonymous $.99 bean burrito from Taco Bell. And burrito size? Probably less than half of what you'd expect an authentic Mexican restaurant to serve you. 

Lastly, atmosphere. The restaurant has a great layout and usually has a great crowd. Well decorated. The ambient noise can be a little much at times with the acoustics set up as such- a lot of hard wood, metal, etc.

Overall, I would REALLY rate a 3.5 if could. Ideally, if all your looking for is a place to go to have a few drinks with friends, get some food (knowing you want a fish taco, of course), this place is definitely worthy of your time.
