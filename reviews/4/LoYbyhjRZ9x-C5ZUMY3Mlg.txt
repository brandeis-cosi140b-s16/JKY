I love Qdoba! Their burrito bowls are great! They're pretty much the equivalent of Chipotle, but I love Chipotle so...it's all good! I like to build my own burrito bowl and have their chips and guac. Definitely a yummy Chipotle alternative, although to be completely honest - I don't know if there's much of a difference.
