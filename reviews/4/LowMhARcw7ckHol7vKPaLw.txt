This Mexican restaurant  offers all the usual combinations as well as much more upscale fare.   The usual complimentary chips and salsa were served along with a bean dip. Based on a Las Vegas Weekly review, I requested the excellent, though spicy, chipotle salsa. My wife ordered the cammarones dionisia - shrimp in a combination of green chilies blended with sour cream. I chose camarones sarandeados estillo "Tia Estther" pointing to the menu listing rather than challenge my Spanish 101 skills. This dish is not for those with acid reflux, it is shrimp basted in sarandeados sauce with a selection of dried chilies and secret spices blended with a touch of mayonnaise - spicy, but wonderful. Entrees include a cup of delicious sopa fideos (hearty broth laced with noodles), Mexican rice and refried beans. The use of cheese throughout was understated (amen). This is the best Mexican restaurant we have patronized in Las Vegas.
