Let me say I'd been to Cabo @ Palace Station and wasnt that impressed but was willing to try it again since we were in the area on this rare occasion. (I live in Hendo) 

SERVICE: they get one star deducted for service b/c this guy was a mute. I dont think he actually said more than" everything ok?" maybe once. If water was refilled, it was silent. Plates arrived, from someone else..and she warned Hot plate". maybe there was a 2-3 syllable rule we werent told about...

FOOD: this is where they earned the star back. wow. damn. it was good.
The chips first off were those super thick and delicious tostadas- which means u have to count each one you eat to not go overboard.Salsa came in the form of 3 types of salsa, 1 red, 1 molcajete brown salsa, 1 chile verde, and one bean dip. omg so freakin good

I ordered chicken fajitas, to die for. sheesh louise I ate all the chicken and veggies, no tortillas- but it came w/ guacamole and sour cream on the side w/ cilantro. so good. 

my bf ordereed the chile relleno - it was good too but nowhere near the realm of goodness as mine. wow. im getting hungry just thinking of them but I already ate a late lunch. 

Best part of this meal was the check. we had a $10 off coupon for any station casino they sent to us in the mail. Cant beat it. both our plates were around $12-14. so it was like a 2fer. Cant . beat. it.
