We visit Caramba's almost every Saturday night after church. We love the food there! Super fresh and great prices! We almost always get the Mexican pizza with shredded beef, taquitos, and have had the Giant Caramba many times. All are really good. The free chips with your order and fresh salsa bar are also a great plus. 

My only complaint with the restaurant is that the tables and chairs are really uncomfortable, hard to move to accommodate larger parties, and just plain ugly. If the seating were better I would give them 5 stars.

But obviously, since we visit almost weekly, the food is better than the decor!
