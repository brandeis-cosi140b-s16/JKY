I cannot talk bad about this place, now I have other favorite Mexican food spots but this place is open late and deliver fast. So for us late not munchers, us to tired to make a meal, and us I need something to soak up this liquir look no farther , this is the place. The meats , are actually well seasoned and taste fresh . I haven't had a bad experience in that department . its a great place price wise really cheap and you get a a lot for your buck. Now the only thing working against this place is the location. But trust me its safe for all my favorite snow flakes out there, the surrounding area is no longer bad. I also think a sign would help but the food , is great. Now the interior could use a redesign if I am being honest. I order to go based on this. Go get a meal and trust me its worth the order.
