RIP Macayo! You shall be missed. 

Those of you that are fans, you ought to get there before they close their doors in a few weeks:-(

So many memories, so many special events were celebrated there. 

At least the three other locations are remaining open. Not that I care -- the W. Charleston restaurant is very special and sentimental.

The Sonoran Beach tacos with the creamy cilantro dressing are out of this world. Pretty good TCTs and salsa as well.
