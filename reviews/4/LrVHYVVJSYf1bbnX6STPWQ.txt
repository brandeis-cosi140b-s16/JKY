My Husband and  I go to Rubio's often, he loves there fish tacos, and I love there salads, we usually visit the one on 101 and Frank Lloyd Wright,  but, sometimes go to this location, since my Mom lives near this location, she also loves there Fish Tacos !,   there was a young girl that was so sweet, and thoughtful, that she made my day, never have had this customer service from Rubio's before, I ordered to go, she offered a cup, so I could get water, while I waited, and also offered me larger container's for Salsa, she could probably see it in my eye, that I like it Hot ! was so impressed with her !
