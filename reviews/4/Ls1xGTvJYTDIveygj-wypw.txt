Quiet small place only three tables with patrons so service at first was fast, we got drinks and chips salsa and beans right away but our order was a bit slow coming out.

I got a couple of enchidalas and a taco combo plate. I wanted to try both red and green sauce, both were good but loved their green!

Very good food.
