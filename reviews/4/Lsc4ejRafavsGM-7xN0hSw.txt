In the style of Chipotle's and Cafe Rio, but I think I preferred Zaba's by a smidge. I had the burrito with the whole wheat tortilla which was much better than expected. Had the usual ratio of fillings and for me I wish all these places were heavier on the meat, but I guess that's the way it goes. It also got very messy which is why I guess people order it in a bowl instead! Very tasty overall, would have liked the hot sauce to actually be hot!
