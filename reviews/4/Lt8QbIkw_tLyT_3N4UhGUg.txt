Thanks, Yelpers, for reaquainting me with this establishment.!
This is really good TexMex, very inexpensive, and you get tons of food for very little money. 
I had the 2 item combo with a shredded beef taco (big, wonderful and filling) but didn't stop there, and ate the beef burrito too (oink, I am) ...and I managed to consume enough rice and beans and chips to blow myself into the next county (ok, I'll stop there)...
Good food, great prices, and it's casual and quick. 
Loved it!
