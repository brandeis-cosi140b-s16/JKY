Good, basic Mexican restaurant.  My margarita was good.  Lots of food for the price.  The "fusion" idea is on hold right now, we found out.  There's a new owner, sounds like, and still figuring out what the menu will be.  So, there's no Japanese or Italian food being offered (although the menu shows it as being available.)
