OMG the chicken bowl was great - I'm on the HGC diet & it's hard finding a place to eat out - so I figured Mexican - boy was I right! I ordered a chicken bowl with only pico .... it needed Nothing else ... really satisfying.  Place was clean & spacious modern... Staff was very friendly, gotta go back & try the beef one... keep you posted.
