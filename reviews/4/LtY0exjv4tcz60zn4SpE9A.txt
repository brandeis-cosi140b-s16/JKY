I came here twice and both times enjoyed myself. I love the boutique hotel atmosphere and the food is great. The guaq is rich in flavor and the citrus that's in it really adds a new twist. I've had the veggie tacos, the veggie torta and a couple of the salads...very nice!

I would have given this place 3 stars initially if I would have reviewed after my first visit - bc our waiter was terrible... he was not pleasant, rushed us out of there and my water glass sat empty many a time... but by the second time we had a much better experience... cute place and I like the art on the walls...caliente!
