It was my first visit to Bueno Burger on a mild October night. I live in N. Phoenix, but was in Glendale for a network event. I was looking for an interesting place, a unique place--different from the usual chains--to stop for dinner after 7:30. I passed BB, and immediately made a U-turn. I found the Mecca: bright, upbeat, contemporary, 'industrial' interior; large black & white photos & graphics on the walls; unique menu--putting a special twist on old favorites. Burgers, burritos and more, cooked on a wood-fired grill. I asked, 'What's the House favorite?', and was guided to the popular Arizona Green Chili Burger. OMG, big chunks of beef in slow simmered chili verde, on a big corn-dusted bun. You can mix the ingredients: I swapped the sour cream for horseradish aoli, to bring more bite. The fries were incredibly Fresh, thin and hot..with skin on. After my burger combo was delivered to my table, I asked for ranch dressing to enjoy with the fries. They were temporarily out, so they made a fresh homemade batch of ranch dressing in the kitchen, and brought it out with another fresh serving of hot fries...on the house. All for under $10! This is a GREAT place, only open four months, and they have a Winner on their hands. Looking for a second location. A laptop in the lobby invites you to sign up for email or text message specials. Smart marketing! I added myself and a friend to the list. And 'why not' ? It's definitely worth a 20 mile ride back to try something else on their awesome menu. I'm going for the Burrito Bowl next time. I want to compare it to the standby from Chipotle. I know I won't be disappointed, from the exceptional quality I experienced tonight. And you know what--I'll tell my friends they 'gotta try it!'
