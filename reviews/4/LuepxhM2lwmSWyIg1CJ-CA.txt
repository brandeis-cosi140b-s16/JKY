This place is amazing! My wife and I live in Las Vegas but went here with her family living in the San Tan Valley. Drove by this place a few times with her family and never really noticed, but we finally stopped in this time. Food was amazing, taste great, made fresh in the back, real good quality mexican food. Like the other reviews said, this place really is a little hole in the wall shack off the side of the road in farm land, but that's how you know it's good. From what I'm told, they just added that little covered outdoor area to sit at, and are now open on Sundays. If you live anywhere in Central Arizona you have to go try this place out! -1 star for the friendliness. The workers were a little reserved the whole time, the did freak out on me though for bringing in a QT drink even though it had like two ounces left. I understand the no outside drink policy, but I was going to order one anyway. Beside that, everything was great!
