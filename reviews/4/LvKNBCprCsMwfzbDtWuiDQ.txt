Rivas is my go-to Mexican eatery in the immediate area.  The food here is awesome and the staff is always nice and accommodating.  When I roll through, I usually jump on the shrimp torta or shrimp tacos, which I must admit can get a little pricey with my appetite.  However, they have a fantastic 2 for $6 chicken burrito deal that I frequent when I'm hungry or I need something to-go for the day.  Plus, they taste good so that's always a plus.  HEAD'S UP: I would definitely suggest that you phone your orders in before coming as it tends to get busy here and it might take a while to get your food.  Calling my order in 15-20 minutes ahead of time seems to be the trick here when I just want to pop in, get my food, and go.  Condiments in mind, the green sauce is pretty grubbin' but the real winner is the red sauce.  The red sauce made here is the best I've had in the area, if not the entire valley.  They are both a little spicy but that's how I like 'em.. make sure to pick-up a to-go cup of sauce on the way out.  You won't be disappointed.

Good food and a great option when I'm hungry and don't want to drive too far.  Definitely a frequent flyer here and will continue to be for a while.
