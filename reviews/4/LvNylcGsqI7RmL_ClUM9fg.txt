I haven't been to Las Margaritas since it was named something different (El Valle, if memory serves), and as I can recall, it's about the same, other than the name thing.  Of course, these days, the restaurants all look about the same - now I'm really starting to sound old!

On this particular night, I had a burrito, and the ingredients tasted fresh, as has been mentioned before, but I'll have to say that by the time we arrived, I was pretty beat, so I was just glad to be able to have something to eat.

I'll also concur with Tony C, and say that the service here was top-notch, and if there is anything that falters, it's probably the food.  It isn't that it's bad, it's just that it's not outstanding.
