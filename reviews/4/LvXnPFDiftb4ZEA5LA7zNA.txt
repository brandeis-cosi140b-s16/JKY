Let me just say, I haven't been to a Taco Bell in over a year. After reading these reviews, I almost didn't come here. But, it's the closest one to where we live, so I decided to just go for it.

My boyfriend and I just left this location and weren't disappointed at all. We ordered just over $50 worth of food - that's a lot of tacos and our order was complete with no issues at all.

The cashier, Tyler, was helpful. Mind you, I hadn't been to a Taco Bell in a while. Although, not much has changed, there was a few new items. He explained a few of them, which was nice. (Not that there's much difference in the items.)

I'd probably come here again for my yearly Taco Bell meal.
