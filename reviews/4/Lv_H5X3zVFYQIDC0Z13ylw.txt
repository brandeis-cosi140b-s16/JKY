El Charro is a little Mexican grocery and restaurant that makes up for lack of ambiance in flavor. The restaurant itself has authentic and cheap Mexican fast food- delicious tacos with succulent meat on tender tortillas with cilantro, giant burritos, and other delights like spicy tamales on the weekends. 

The grocery has staples like plain old salt mixed in with Mexican imports. The produce sections has avocados for all your guacamole-making needs. There are also lots of Mexican sauces, candy, pastries, and other snacks. Not too many people seem to know how much better this place is than other local competitors, so check it out.
