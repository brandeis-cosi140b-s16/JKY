We found this on a random list of things to eat in vegas.  The writer recommended the Bulgogi Fried Rice (Jim's Rice)....and it was so delicious. We also had the Fusion Chimichanga and it was just as tasty!  Atmosphere was just so so, but the food and friendly staff made up for anything that atmosphere lacked.  The portions were ample and the price was hard to beat.  We're in Vegas for a few more days and may just venture back for seconds!
