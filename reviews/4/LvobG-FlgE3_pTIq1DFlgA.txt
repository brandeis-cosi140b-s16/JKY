Had to do an update for Fat Boy.

This go-round I enjoyed their pizzas delivered! Yes indeedy, they do delivery... To my house anyway. ;)

Here's the scoop, we got 3 large pizzas and an order of mild wings. The delivery took just about 40 minutes. The guys delivering were super nice and the pizzas were damn good. I really liked the wings though. 

Would I order from them again? Yep! Especially gotta get those chicken wings!
