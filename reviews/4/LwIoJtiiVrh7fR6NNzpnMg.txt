Last night was my first time at this restaurant, as I live on the other side of town.  First, I must say that last night's background music was fantastic, a great mixture of 80s and 90s, which was nice, as I did not feel like I was dining in a club on the Strip.  Next, service was friendly and for the most part attentive.  And the food, well we ordered sliders (good), garlic shrimp (good), calamari (good).  The dish I liked the least was the potatoes, but I think that's just about preference.  I have read the other reviews about the bacon wrapped dates, and I must say that although I understand they don't include a nut in theirs, like those at Firefly or Jaleo, I prefer it with the nut.  Again, just preference.  I thought the portions were adequate to good, and I think their prices are not much higher and/or comparable to other tapas places.  Tapas places in general tend to be higher in price, and the bill does add up as you order plates and drinks.  Overall, I thought the place was good.
