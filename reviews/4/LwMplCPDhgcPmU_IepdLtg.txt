Been going there for years, I stuck by them when they got undeserving and inaccurate negative press, and I still love this place.
Keep making food I will keep eating it.  
My favorite is the Pizza Nortena extra crispy with extra green chilis and 4 sides of the very hot salsa verde (you must request the salsa verde)
Green & Red chili are good.  Tacos Morango are great and so are the loaded nachos.  My husband loves the Pollo Blanco Enchiladas.
Bring us a pitcher of Margaritas and we are set.
