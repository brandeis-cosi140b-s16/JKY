Decided to give a chance since it was close by. Decided on the Pollo Fundido based on the reviews and it did not disappoint. Very large portion and very tasty. I would not hesitate to order this again. Chips are OK, and there are multiple salsas to choose from. Refried beans are good. Based on one meal, I would give it a try.
