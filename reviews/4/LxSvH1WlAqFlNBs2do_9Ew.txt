Been coming here for YEARS (close to a decade).... still not sick of it.  I stick with the steak tacos, although burritos are good.  

Definitely "authentic mexicans" working here, without a doubt.  A lot of them don't speak the best english, so it's good to make sure you either a) tell them what you want in Spanish or b) repeat your order SEVERAL TIMES.  I had issues with them always putting onions on my tacos/burritos but now have it down to a science the best way to prevent this.  They tend to be a little forgetful and don't have fancy taco-bell-style video screens showing each order, so you gotta have a strategy if you're picky about your toppings.

Definitely not the best, and not really cheap either, but ... I'm hooked.  Open ridiculously late every night, too.
