Had lunch here last week.  The place was packed but we were seated right away.  Its a big restaurant.  Food was good.  Got the baja lunch burrito combo.  Chips and salsa were also good.  The service was fine,  quick and easy place to grab lunch.  I'm not much of a seafood person but this place has a huge seafood selection!!
