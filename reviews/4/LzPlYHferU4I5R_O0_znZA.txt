I am a super fan of Del Taco! This is the cheapest, yummiest place any time of day! Whenever my friend and I go traveling this is the place we miss the most. In Europe they dont have Mexican food (well they do kinda but for some reason there is no spice and it is all made of kidney beans and corn... yuck!) and the first thing we do when we get home is head to Del Taco for the comfort of their yummy, cheesy  Half Pound Bean and Cheese Burrito with Green Sauce for $.99 and the Chicken Spicy Jack Quesadilla for like $2.79 or something. When I went to visit friends on the other side of the country recently, they were talking about what they missed from back home and inevitably it was Mexican food... specifically Del Taco. I almost cried when I found out that Del Taco isnt national. I think I am addicted to the stuff because I just cant do without it. The best thing is that they are open like 24 hours a day. They have hot cinnamony Churros for $.99 too! If you are doing something like Weight Watchers too they have a regular Bean & Cheese Burrito that is like 6 point or something I think. I read it somewhere but you can check it out.

Even so If I die from a Del Taco heart attack I will die happy!

Hey one more thing DEL TACO EMPLOYEES PLEASE BE CONSISTANT! The portions and flavors lately have been inconsistant. Thank you!
