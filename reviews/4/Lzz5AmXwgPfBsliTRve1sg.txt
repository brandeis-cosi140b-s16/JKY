ROBERTOS. I don't know where I would be without this 24 hour joint! 

Depending on the location you go to, the cleanliness varies. This location is VERY CLEAN & maintained. 

My usual order consists of chile rellano, shrimp burrito & sometimes a cheese quesadilla. (Late night cravings FTW!) 

The chile rellano, I think is an acquired taste. It's very cheesy & saucy inside of a pepper, but it's delicious. Try with a side of horchata if "spice is life" isn't your life motto. 

The shrimp burrito is HUGE. It usually takes 2 people to finish it up, unless you have an appetite & in that case, this is still probably the only thing you'd need to order to feel satisfied. 

The cheese quesadilla is extremely cheesy & not to mention super greasy. *order with caution* 

Bottomline: If you are craving some decent food, even at late hours of the night, where you get a bang for your buck -- you might want to try this.
