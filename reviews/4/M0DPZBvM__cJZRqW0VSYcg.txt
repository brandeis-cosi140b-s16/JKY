Late night Mexican food is a nice change from regular fast food. I've had the shrimp cocktail, carne asada burrito and their enchiladas.  All good but the beans and enchiladas are a barely warm. Other that the heat issue, I get fast service and it's way better than grease filled burger drive throughs.
