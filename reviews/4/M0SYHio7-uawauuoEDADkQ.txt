I eat here regularly. I get the same exact thing. No need for deviation. 

Carnitas Burrito.  Black Beans. Rice. Sour Cream. Guacamole. Cheese. 

What the fuck is up with $1.80 guac? Only in America. And no one is going to complain, because they deliver a consistent product time and time again. 
Chipotle is the epitome of quick service food.
