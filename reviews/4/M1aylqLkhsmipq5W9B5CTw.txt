I haven't had Chipotle in a while, and suddenly found myself inside here waiting in a very long line to place my order.  It's been a while since I've eaten here, so I figured it was time!

When I entered, it was the dinner rush, so there was a very long line.  Ahead of me were 4 Phoenix fireman, along with a UPS driver.  Nice! 

Despite the line being painfully long, I placed my order.  I got the Fajita burrito with the shredded beef.  Tasty!  

I do have to give a kudos to the staff here.  Clearly, they were extremely busy, and despite that, I was treated with courtesy and a smilng face!  That goes a long way for me, as I know how frustrating it can be when you are looking at a line out the door.  

I also really like how thier menu's set up.  Fairly simple, with nice choices to choose from.  Not to complicated, easy to understand and a fair price point.

Really enjoyed my time here, and the staff was wonderful. Will return in the future!
