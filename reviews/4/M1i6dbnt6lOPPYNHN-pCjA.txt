A new Mexican restaurant opened in our neighborhood replacing the shuttered 
Restaurante Guadalajara which only lasted about 6 months.  We were not to hungry as we had a late lunch so we both choose the Taquitos from the app menu at $7.99.  We were brought some chips and salsa and bean dip.  Chips were standard restaurant style, nothing special and the bean dip could have used some more flavor.  Salsa was ok but, we asked if they had a hotter salsa and they brought us that which was quite an improvement over the other one.
We were surprised when they brought us out the fideo soup when we just ordered an appetizer.  The soup had a great flavor full of noodles and a delicious broth.  Our apps came and it was 4 taquiitos cut in half on a plate of diced greens and onions with sour cream and guac in the middle of the plate.
They also brought us a small complimentary toreados - 1 sliced grilled chili and onions.  That was more than enough for both of us and we were full and happy.
Service was top notch and very friendly as they kept the drink glasses full and removed unused plates as needed.  Our bill was $22.50 + a $5.00 tip.
It turns out we know the owner from the local Michoacan chain and he informed us him and his family opened this restaurant.
We wish them the best of luck and they will be seeing more of us soon as there were a couple items on the menu we want to try, especially the shrimp filled toreados.
Good luck guys!
