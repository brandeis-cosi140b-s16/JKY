Happy National Guacamole Day!

I'm a huge guac fan, so being that today really is National Guac Day, I knew I had to "get me some." Despite a crazy work schedule and very limited time, I made it happen with a quick visit to Rubio's!

Sure, they are a chain, but I do love their fast casual style, friendly employees, salsa bar, and best of all, great selection and quality food considering the prices.  I got myself a salad with shrimp, a large guac and chips to share with the fam, and a kids meal for my son... 

Not only was the food delicious, but the kids meal is a great deal.  For under $5, the meal includes your choice of entree (chicken quesadilla was my choice today), your choice of side (from applesauce, chips, beans or rice), a churro, and a small drink.  

Everything was a hit at my house, and I won't hesitate to return to Rubio's sooner than later when I'm in the mood for a quick fix of Mexican!
