Was kinda nervous when we pulled up and there was only a few cars. It got busier as we were eating. 

The music was a little too loud for us as we have children. But we still enjoyed it once we moved inside.

The food was delicious! My husband is usually anti-sushi but he actually ate almost half of mine and loved it. He got the nachos with beef, they were pretty good but for a Mexican place there was a lot of chips and not a lot of everything else. 

The service was ok. Not bad at all, but nothing to rant and rave over. 

Overall we really enjoyed it and will be back!
