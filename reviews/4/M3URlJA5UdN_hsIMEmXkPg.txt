Hostess seating us was a little disengaged, but that's my only complaint about this place. Started with a great margarita. Appetizer of sopecitos with cochinita pibil. Then had the chiles rellenos and the chicken enchiladas. Fresh, delicious and all prepared with a real homemade feel. Barely had room but made space for the plain flan which was a delight as well. Overall a great meal.
