EXCITED ABOUT EATING BY ERNIE HIERS
This edition of Excited about Eating takes us not far from home to On The Border Mexican Grill & Cantina in Concord.

According to the restaurant, "Border-style means mesquite-grilled meat, fresh ingredients, hand-pressed tortillas, and sauces made in small batches." 

Dora here. Definitely a kid friendly establishment. Visitors to their tortilla prep station at the back of the restaurant receive a ball of dough to take back to their table. Great strategy to entertain the kiddos.

I was looking forward to tasting the Grilled Mahi Tacos. A few minutes after ordering, though, the manager approached the table and informed us that they were out of Mahi. She apologized and offered the fried fish or salmon as a substitution. Salmon tacos? Hmmm. No thanks. I opted for the fried fish. 

The fish was good, crispy on the outside. The cabbage and red chile sauce complemented without taking away from the flavor. I liked the crunch of cabbage over ordinary lettuce. I'm on a healthy kick, though, and would've preferred the grilled Mahi over the fried alternative, but appreciated their coupon for a bowl of queso for the inconvenience.

Dora here. Good thing they had my Brisket Tacos. I didn't have a Plan B. :) 

Pretty, right? Just invites you to dig in. I don't know what's going on with hubby's plate, but they lost points for presentation.

My brisket was tender. The onion strings added a great textural element and the jalapeno in the BBQ sauce a little kick. The vegies were firm and colorful. Overall, I enjoyed the fresh, vibrant vibe, and I didn't leave stuffed like some Mexican restaurants. Maybe that's because hubby sampled one of my tacos? :)

We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food.
