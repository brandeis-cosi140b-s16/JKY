After a day of pool crashing at the Princess, my friends and I were hungry.  We drove down Scottsdale and ended up at Blanco.  We were still technically in our bathing suits and as the sun set I felt extremely under dressed for a Saturday night.  Don't mind me, my ass is only wet because I was at the pool all day... I swear I didn't pee my pants. 

We sat at one of those communal tables, which I always enjoy.  Some nosey old lady kept grilling my friends on things like iphones and tattoos.  It was entertaining. 

The service was great and the manager even got us a seat way before the quoted 30 minute wait.  

I had the short-rib enchiladas and highly enjoyed them.  They tasted a lot like the enchiladas my ex's mom used to make.  So, it's nice that I no longer have to date him just for his mother's delicious Mexican meals.  The rice is also pretty good, but a little different- it's creamy and corn adds a hint of sweetness that I really enjoy, even though it can be a bit salty for my taste.  

I won't hate on Fox restaurants just because it's a Fox restaurant.  I usually enjoy myself at all I've been to and if the food is just okay, well, at least there is plenty to look at.  Hell, I love Julio G's so you probably shouldn't listen to anything I say.
