My wife and I decided to take a detour through Charlotte on our way home to Augusta from Wilson, NC. We wanted to eat somewhere in Charlotte and decided to pick Cabo Fish Taco because they were featured on Diners, Driveins, and dives. Overall the atmosphere was nice and friendly. For some reason the same dumb song played multiple times during our time there. Not sure what that was about. We were seated in a section that looks like they might open it up to the outside in warmer months. Someone was smoking just on the other side and it was coming in the restaurant. 

We ordered cabo rolls and tuna tacos. The tacos and avocado pasta were amazing but the cabo rolls were too salty to eat. When we let our server know she immediately got us a menu to order something in place of the cabo rolls. We ordered the carne asada tacos and they were delicious! The chips weren't warm. I've never been to a good Mexican restaurant that doesn't serve warm chips. They did tasted good and the salsa was yummy and we will definitely return if we ever get to Charlotte again!
