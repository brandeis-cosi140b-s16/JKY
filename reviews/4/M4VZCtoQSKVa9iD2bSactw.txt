I eat here probably once a week. It is always clean, the staff are always friendly. I usually get a Mexican salad, which is always pretty good. I rotate between the double chicken and the Mexican Cobb salad. The cilantro dressing is tasty. Today's salad had a little too much lettuce, but otherwise tasty. I like that I can add cilantro, onions, salsa, etc to my salad at the little bar they have. I eat for less than 10 dollars which these days is really good. I would definitely recommend.
