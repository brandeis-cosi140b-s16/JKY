One of the perks of living in San Diego is that you're always within a block's distance of a Mexican taco shack that's open 24 hours. Being so close to the border, San Diego was always keen on delivering some great greasy drunk Mexican food. Nothing like carne asada fries to satisfy your cravings at 3 am in the morning. 

Well nowadays, I find myself roaming the suburban streets of Glendale, AZ, very much missing my Mexican food from southern California. And while AZ should boast some excellent Mexican food as well, Glendale in particular is lacking in yummy Mexican shacks with names that end in "-Berto's."

But then Se√±or Taco appeared from nowhere, as if my prayers had been answered. Lo and behold, their California burrito is one of the best I've had. 

But oh snap, their surf n turf burrito is godly. Packed with super yummy shrimp with fresh citrusy flavor, all against the backdrop of a powerful carne asada background, and everything smothered in wonderful secret sauce. This place is the real deal.

One more thing. Free hot carrots. YESSSSS!!!!
