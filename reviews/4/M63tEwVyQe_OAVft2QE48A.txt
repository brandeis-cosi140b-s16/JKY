Ok some hole in a wall places are worth taking a peak. This would be one. The one in Casa Grande and the one in Arizona City are very good.

Pros. As close to authentic as a Gringo like myself wants to get. Great quality, Large portions, and the flavors are well balanced.

Cons. Casa Grande has out door seating only, which means if its hot or cold so are you.
Arizona City its an half hour drive.
