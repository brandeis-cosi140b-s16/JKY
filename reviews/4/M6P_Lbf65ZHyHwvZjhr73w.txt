The adobada tacos  are phenomenal. The only thing that keeps me from giving them a 5 star review is they can sometimes be inconsistent.  Most of the time, you will have a great experience and the food will be fantastic, but every once in awhile you will go and just wont be that good.   I'm not sure what they do different on those days, but I'm always willing to go back some other time and try again because of how good it is when they are doing it right!
