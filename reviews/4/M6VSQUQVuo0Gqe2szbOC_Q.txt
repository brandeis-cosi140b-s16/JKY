YUM!!!!

The food is so amazing and you get so much for what you pay for. I will definitely be eating there again the next time I visit the Hard Rock Hotel. The atmosphere is fun and the bar is fully stocked with flat-screen televisions for watching sports games. 

The service was a little slow, but I can imagine that they get quite backed up with all the people that are in there ordering. Don't let it discourage your visit though, be patient and soak it all in. This is not a place to order your food, eat it quick, and get out. Stay a little while. Order a few beers and kick it.

Pink Taco is goooooood.
