Best kids meals in town! We always order the junior bean and cheese burritos &  yummy crinkle cut fries (but you can order chips instead). The kids meals also come with a cute mini-Churro and a bottled beverage--which is way too sweet for my taste so we ask for fountain drinks instead. And don't miss the ever-so-satisfying country breakfast burrito, which definitely feeds two!
