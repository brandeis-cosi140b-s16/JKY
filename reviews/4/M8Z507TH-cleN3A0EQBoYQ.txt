Hope, the waitress made it 4 stars for us!  Sopapias are amazing!  Cheese enchilada is good.  Don't get the chile releno... Yuk!  Salsa is good... Chips need to have the oil changed before they are fried.  Overall the experience we mediocre however the waitress named Hope made it great with her customer service!
