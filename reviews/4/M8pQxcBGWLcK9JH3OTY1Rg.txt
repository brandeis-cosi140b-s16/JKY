I love this place.  I've been going since I was a kid (I moved away but I'm back now) and I thought maybe my travels and eating "good food" would change my opinion of this place...nope!

Their salsa is so good, their food is wonderful.  I love their beef machaca and their fajitas are ridiculous.  

If you want good, legit mexian food come here.  

This place also has the best high chairs for kids (random thing I know).  I love places that actually invest in good things for family dining...
