Black Chile is not your standard Sonoran style Mexican food that we Arizonans (including myself) love and use as our benchmark, it is a bit more refined and every bit as delicious.  They have a great happy hour, that includes piles of nachos, cheese crisps with unique toppings (try the chorizo and olive) that even my cheese hating friend likes, guacamole and street style corn.  All are delicious, especially when paired with one of their amazing margaritas, I prefer mine with Chambord, but I hear the Strawberry Jalapeno is killer.

On the dinner side, the enchiladas are tasty as is the red chile burro.  While I am normally a bean fan, at Black Chile it is all about the rice, they call it honey rice or something, and it is by far the best rice I have ever had, even when I go for happy hour I can't resist ordering a side of it!

I love that you can bring a group here big or small and everyone can find something on the menu that they like.  I have just two issues when it comes to Black Chile: 1) They don't have shredded beef, just ground beef (makes it feel like Taco Bell) and 2) Happy Hour is only in the bar area, I think they should take a page from Z'Tejas book and offer it restaurant wide....because that would make me really happy :)
