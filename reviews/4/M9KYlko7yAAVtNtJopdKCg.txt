So I made it here yesterday for lunch and it was as good as I remember.  I am not sure why I haven't been here in sooo many years.  I used to come here all the time.  Anyway I am glad I made it back and will ensure it makes it into my work week lunch rotation:).  I decided on the cheese crisp an a shredded beef taco both were perfect and hit the spot.  My lunch companions had: shredded beef chimi special + rice + beans the other had a carne asada beef burrito.  Both entrees looked really tasty and they both were happy with their choices.  I will surely be back next week to try something new;)
