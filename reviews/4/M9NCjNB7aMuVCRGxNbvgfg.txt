Never let down by EPL!  Reliable for a quick, affordable, tasty, and potentially healthy (depending what you get) meal.  I always go with the 3 piece white meat combo: 2 whole breast, a wing, 2 sides, and a drink for less than 10 bones.  Can't beat it!  Why get a greasy fake burger at Icky Mickey's when you can have whole white meat that isn't cooked behind an iron curtain.  Love that they're grilling whole chickens in plain view!  We live nearby so they're our GoTo family spot when we need something quick and cheap.
