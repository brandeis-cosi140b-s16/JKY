I chose to come here, after not really deciding on where to go on a late Friday night. Its one of those places like Filibertos, or Amado's thats usually open late at night, and you can expect it to not disappoint! Well sure enough, it was one of those places. I was pleased with the service provided. They didn't have a HUGE bar selection...but their queso dip was awesome! The DJ that night (Friday) didn't have the best choices either (sorry dude). It wasn't packed either, but that's a plus in my book. Will probably go back here a few times.
