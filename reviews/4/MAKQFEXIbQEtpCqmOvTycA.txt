Stopped by here for lunch after a recommendation from a friend. Once I took a few minutes to review the menu options and choices, the process went fairly smooth. The homemade tortillas were fantastic and all of the food tasted great. It definitely will take a few visits to the hang of the place and try out more of the items and see what we like best but the tacos and burrito were great and the kids loved the quesadillas.
