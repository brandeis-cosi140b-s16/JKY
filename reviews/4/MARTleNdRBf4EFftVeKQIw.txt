Shortly after our arrival, Chef/owner Scott Sousa came to our table to welcome us and offer a few recommendations.  We started with complimentary housemade tortilla chips served with a trio of delicious dips - cilantro salsa, black bean and a chili sauce.  For an appetizer we chose to share a chicken mole tamale steamed in banana leaf.  Ann ordered the coconut crusted Ahi tuna served rare with a fresh coconut and pumpkin seed sauce, mint rice and broccoli.  I took the chef's suggestion and ordered Guajillo scallops; four sea scallops rubbed with quajillo (chile) before being saut√©ed and finished with roasted sweet corn, caramelized onions and sundried tomatoes.  We concluded the meal with a piece of flan accompanied by a rich and flavorful housemade caramel sauce.  This meal was probably a 4.5.
