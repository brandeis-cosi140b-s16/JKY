i went to this place after i checked out the pictures i have taken of vegas so far, and the sole decision to see the freemont street experience.

i went to freemont street a couple of days ahead, but i didnt see the canopy of lights, so i went back.

well, on first impression, the place looks very authentic. but the weird smell (i have super smelling powers) kinda turned me off. two girls walked in and i asked them if they ever ate there - they said no but it was highly recommended by the robocop (he was a cop on a segway.)

the service was a bit slow  - but there was only one waitress, and i dont really blame her. the food was good. it didnt taste americanized to me, but thats my opinion. its almost close to what i have back in queens, NY.

the food here is a welcome and homey change to the food they serve at the strip by the venetian. aaaah. it felt like home. the porkchops were good. 

i loved the waitress gisela because she was the only service person in vegas who didnt expect a tip.
