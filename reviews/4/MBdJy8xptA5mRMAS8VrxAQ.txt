Love cantina!  The service is always exceptional,  chips and salsa are amazing, and the Margarita's are the best!!  They are a bit pricey so I would highly recommend their happy hour ($3 margaritas) and their brunch on Sunday is very good.  This place is always my first choice for good Mexican food.
