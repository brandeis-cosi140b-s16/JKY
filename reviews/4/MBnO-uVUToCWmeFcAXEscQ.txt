L'Empira boasts the best authentic Latin American cuisine in the Central Ave. area. There a lot of similar restaurants within a mile of L'Empira, but L'Empira is by far the best. The food is very good. I've eaten here twice and my only complaint is that the chicken in the tamales had some bones in it. The rest of the food was very tasty. The portions are very generous and the presentation looks very nice. The attmosphere feels fancy, but the prices are very reasonable. Overall L'Empira provides an enjoyable eating experience and I am always glad I chose to go here.
