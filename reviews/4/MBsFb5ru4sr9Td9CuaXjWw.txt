Not a lot of decent choices for Mexican in Old Town anymore, but this was really good. Nice patio area, not too loud or pretentious, good vibe.

I ordered a house margarita, which can be chancy, but it was actually quite good. Margarita came in a big fish bowl, not some little 2 sip glass. Chips and salsa were tasty also.

I got the chicken tacos (hardshell of course) and they were very good - shell had good flavor, chicken was grilled, not pulled, and the blend of ingredients was just right. 

Overall, good choice for Mexican in Old Town and would return.
