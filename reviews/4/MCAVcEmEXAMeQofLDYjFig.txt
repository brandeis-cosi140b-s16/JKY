Salsarita's is a great dinner or lunch option if you are looking for something quick and reasonably priced in the University Area.

The giant, monster burritos are great.  I usually run the chicken with refried beans along with the other fresh and tasty fillings you'd expect to have at a burrito joint. I LOVE THE FACT THAT THERE ISN'T AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE FOR GUACAMOLE!  The chips are well, chips, although sometimes I feel they can be a bit salty at times.

Compared to the other burrito joints in Charlotte, Salsarita's falls somewhere in the middle.  For my money, its a better option than Qdoba's, and there isn't an additional charge for guacamole.  On the other hand, I wouldn't say Salsarita's is better than Johnny Burrito or even Chipolte.  The fillings options are better at Johnny Burrito and the meats at Chipolte seem to be full of more flavor and tenderness.

The staff at Salsarita's is always friendly, welcoming and gets you in and out without any problems.  Prices are always reasonable.  Parking is always plentiful.  

I've no complaints with Salsarita's and will continue to frequent Salsarita's when looking for a practical lunch or dinner option in the north Charlotte area.
