I am always interested to see if I like the Mexican food in the region I am visiting.  Being semi-close to Mexico I would imagine the food would be authentic... this place did not have the homemade taste.  Don't get me wrong, the beans were perfect and so was rice.  It just misses that one little taste I am always searching for.  I have to admit, the waitress messed up on one of the orders and to compensate she gave us some fried ice-cream.  That in itself propels this to a 4.
