Since I work at the airport I often am happy to have the chance to leave PHX occasionally and this place is unexpectedly a breath of aires fresca. It is a clean, small kitchen with a nice selection. I am always happy to support these locals and know my money is staying in town and not heading out of state when I pay my check. Watch out about the hours of operation, she'll close up early if it is slow. Good idea to  call ahead and let her know your plans.
