Aria has some great restaurants, and Javier's is no exception. 
We arrived around 7:00 on a Thursday night and our party of three was promptly seated even though the restaurant was quite full. 
The dark wooden tables, rope canopy over the bar and metal tree of tequila lends a dark and sexy feel. 
The chips and salsa are amazing, salsa is very hit or miss and this one was a hit. Food ordered was seafood (crap and lobster) enchiladas, one with red sauce, one with verde. Excellent. The chicken fajitas were good, they are not delivered on a sizzling platter as I think standard for fajitas, but whatever, they were still good. The chicken mole was commented as very good, too. Margaritas were bueno. 
The service was great, the server was friendly and he accommodated the no dairy requests, even double checking the order to make sure. 
I'd return to Javier's, even though I dread casinos in general. 
Total bill, minus tip, $85-ish.
