Honestly, who cares if this is an "Americanized" version of Mexican favorites? It's freaking delicious! The service is usually pretty good as well. I really enjoy the fish tacos with fried (yes, fried!) tilapia. I also particularly like the ultimate fajitas, live guacamole, and queso. They also have really fresh and flavorful salads. There are usually specials for their margaritas which are pretty inexpensive. The best thing: a FREE appetizer of chips and salsa.
