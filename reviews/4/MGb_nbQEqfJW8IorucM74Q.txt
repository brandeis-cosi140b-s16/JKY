The food here is really good. This place is probably one of the best taco shops in Las Vegas. All the ingredients are super flavorful. Definitely not bland at all. The atmosphere is pretty standard for a taco shop not great not bad. I would of gave five stars based on how good the food is but I still think they are a little pricy for what your are getting. Four tacos can set you back $27 easily.
