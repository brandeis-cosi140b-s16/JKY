Im like an alley cat in heat when it comes to sea food, & the shrimp a la diabla was all that I hoped for. Me likey it hot. The restaurent is quaint & utterly adorable. Its tucked in the middle of no where & is definetly locally owned. Im a practitioner of supporting local business's, I only eat @ corporate restareunts when treatened w/bodily  harm. They also serve that yummy starter soup here. The only reason this endearing little hole in the wall is not getting 5 stars is, im not sure if everything is from scratch. Either way, I could give a flying fluff, the food is great. It put a cat that swallowed a canary grin on my face.
