Came here so the wife could have a taco salad. This place was pretty darn good.  The 2 salsas (one green and one red fire roasted) were awesome, as was the bean dip.  I got a cup of tortilla soup and that filled me up (along with all the salsa and bean dip).  When my taco salad arrived I ate a little bit of it.  It was HUGE and darn good also.  We will be back.  Service was outstanding also.
