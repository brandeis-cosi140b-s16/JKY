Finally, North Scottsdale has a fast food Mexican place...something most other neighboring cities take for granted. The food and service is always consistently good, a great value, and definitely fills that Mexican craving you just seem to get every week or so. And it's drive-through that's open late!

The quesadillas are huge, filled with melty cheese and grilled meat of your choice. The combos are delicious, and the burritos include several breakfast options served all day. The food is freshly prepared at order time, and might take a few minutes. Everything I've tried I have liked and would (and have) order again, except for the Chile Relleno burrito...but then I'm not a real relleno fan to begin with. 

The Super Nachos are piled high with grilled carne asada and guacamole, and serve as a great shareable appetizer for several people. The pork Carnitas and Adobada combinations are very flavorful, and come with your choice of flour or corn tortilla with rice and beans. The Fish Tacos are a solid choice, as is the Fish Burrito, with a nice balance of fish, fresh pico, and tartar sauce. All of the breakfast burritos are worth trying, but my favorite is the Ham and Cheese with their green salsa on the side...simple and delicious all day long. 

A real find that adds to the neighborhood.
