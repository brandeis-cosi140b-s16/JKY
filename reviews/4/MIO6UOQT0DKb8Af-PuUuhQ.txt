Great craft beer menu, one of the better selections I've seen. Great food. Every taco is unique and it's fun to order several different tacos as a meal. Their cocktails are given special attention with homemade mixes and infused sweeteners like Serrano honey. Definitely a "I want to go back" kind of place.
