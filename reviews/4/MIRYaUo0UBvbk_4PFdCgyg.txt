First of all, I admit to eating 6 empanadas all by myself!  (They offer a discount if you buy 6)  I had 3 savory ones (spinach, mushroom, and rojas) and 3 sweet ones (chocolate, peach, and apple).  I don't consider myself an empanada connoisseur, but the crusts were flaky and the fillings offered a nice variety of flavors.  The spinach and rojas were by far my favorites.  I was somewhat disappointed by the sweet empanadas.  The apple was underwhelming and the peach was supposed to have a vanilla sauce in the filling which I could not detect at all.  I'm an ardent lover of rich, chocolate flavor, but the empanada was almost slightly salty without that deep chocolate flavor I was hoping for.
I think I'm just not a huge empanada fan, so I'll have to go back to try the enchiladas!
