I have been coming here with family for 5 yrs now and the food is always consistent. I consider myself an outstanding cook with pretty good judgement. This place has by far the best steak and chicken fajitas I have ever tasted outside of my kitchen. I do not care for their margaritas they are too sweet for me.
