As a Latino newer to the Charlotte area I've been searching for a while to find a authentic place that has some good food. 

They have some amazing authentic tacos the carne asada and carnitas are amazing! They have a avocado jalape√±o sauce that has a nice kick to it and is amazing on the tacos and with the chips. 

I take off one star because it would be nice if they served some grow up drinks. BUT this place is always packed so be prepared to have to wait a little but they are always good about getting people in quick. All in all it's a nice little spot that reminds me of grandmas cooking.
