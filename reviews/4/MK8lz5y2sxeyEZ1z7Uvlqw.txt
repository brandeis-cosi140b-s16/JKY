My favorite Taco shop. I love this place! Convenient, inexpensive and deliscious. Highly recommend the Machaca Breakfast Burrito, carne asada tacos and hubby loves the ground beef tacos. If you like hot, spicy food, try the shrimp diablo! Don't forget to ask for their salsas...esp the "brown" (medium heat)
