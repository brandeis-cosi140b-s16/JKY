I only go to Macayo's for one thing- the green chile tamales. It's like a girl on her period's dream come true. The salty and sweet is amazing. I am always satisfied when I leave. My husband always orders the beef chimichanga which is always stuffed full of moist shredded beef. It's huge! Macayo's is your typical Americanized Mexican food; heavy on the cheese and enchilada sauce. 

On the downside, I've never had a superior server. They've always seemed kind of distracted. I always blame it on the place being so busy.
