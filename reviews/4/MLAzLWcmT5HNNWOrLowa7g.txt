I had driven by this place for a long time due only to it's choice of name and location - I thought "Mucho Taco in a strip mall, how good could that really be?" A friend of mine recommended, so I suggested to my Pops and we checked it out on a weekend menudo outing. I was very pleasantly surprised.

That was some time ago - it is now our normal Mexican food choice. We have not gotten too adventurous (as have some other reviewers) but I can attest to the deliciousness of the menudo (red), carnitas, carne asada, caldo de res and caldo de pollo. The churro's are always fresh and piping hot! I love the Limonada too.

As others have mentioned - great staff - you will likely see the owner  working here. They are always friendly and attentive. The atmosphere - it's a real small place with no frills.
