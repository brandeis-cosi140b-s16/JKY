Great food, and good service. Ordered a chicken chimichanga and was tasty. Chips were served hot, salsa had a good flavor. I mixed the 2 served. Finished off with fried ice cream and was delicious. Cute atmosphere & front window opens to patio to enjoy Arizona's nice fall weather.  Prices are reasonable as well. The only reason I didn't rate a 5 was due to my chimichanga not being as crispy as I am use to. Still very good.
