The inside of this place looks nicer than your average Mexican restaurant. The menu is overwhelming with all the options they offer. They provide your typical chips and salsa. The salsa was a little watery. I got their large pina colada and it was massive. The waitress did a great job with customer service. The food was good. If you are wanting to take sometime on a date here and are considering getting Mexican food, you should definitely try this place. Expect to pay $10 per meal.
