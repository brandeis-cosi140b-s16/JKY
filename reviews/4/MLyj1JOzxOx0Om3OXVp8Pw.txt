Was in from out of town and read the great Yelp reviews so decided to walk over and try it out. Really cool atmosphere and great music (although a bit loud for conversation). Was seated right away at the bar at 9pm on a Tuesday night. Had the pepper and pistachio tuna tacos from the special menu. Flavor and texture was perfection although 2 tacos for $14 was a bit on the high side to me. Bartender was attentive so would give service 5 stars. Would try again next time I am in town.
