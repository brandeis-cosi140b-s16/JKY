Feeling like a burrito fix or craving anything off a "Bertos" type menu?  Senior Taco is your place if your in the area.  Consistency, huge portions, and affordable prices have made Senior Taco a stand out amongst Fillibertos and other Berto type joints.  My wife is a vegetarian and can always order custom burritos, her go to is Egg, Potato, cheese and guacamole.  I went with the Asada Nachos which is a monster portion, could easily feed 2 people.  Don't forget the caramel filled churro, best enjoyed hot!
