Been here numerous times when I'm at Vegas and by far is a hidden gem.  The quality of the food is just so yummy in my tummy.  There's no actual lines but everyone seems to follow the imaginary line which is great.  When I go; I always order Taco's (carne asada)  and definitely the price and the food is great.  The place is always clean.  I'll definitely be making my way back here every time we visit Las Vegas and recommend friends to go as well.
