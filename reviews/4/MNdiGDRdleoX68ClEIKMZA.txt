I"m going to get my one negative out of the way right now so there is nothing left but praise-their Margaritas are EXPENSIVE.
With that in mind-they are my favorite margaritas in town (the prickly pear one in particular).  My girlfriends and i love to go there on Tuesday nights because they do $1 Shredded Beef Tacos that are incredible and $2 Tecate Beer (however we always end up ordering the $14 Margaritas anyway, haha).  Never fails to be a fun time over there.
