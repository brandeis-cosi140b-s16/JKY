What a GREAT addition to Madison's near east side!  Even though the specialty pizzas get featured billing on the menu, and are pretty tasty, the more traditional pies - especially build your own - are spectacular because the tomato sauce is just amazing!  Everything about Salvatore's highlights locally sourced ingredients.  The crust is sturdy, crisp, and yummy.  I could make a meal of a plain pie - tomato sauce, mozzarella, Romano, basil.  Nothing else needed, although it's hard to resist adding from the long list of protein, veg, fruit, and cheese toppings.  The House salad features really good seasonal produce.  The only drawback:  the place is wicked loud.  Oh, and there are only a few tables, so be prepared to wait for one.  But the bottom line here is very, very good pizza, very good salad, very good, fresh, locally sourced food.
