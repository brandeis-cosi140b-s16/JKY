A dive that serves a variety of great foods! So, who would have thought the combinations of Mexican and Asian flavors would pair well? We were skeptical at first until one of the boys at the counter started dishing out samples to us. The ordering process is a bit tricky at first but, thankfully, the staff are friendly and walk you through it. 

There has not been one entree I haven't enjoyed. And the jade chicken. YUM!
