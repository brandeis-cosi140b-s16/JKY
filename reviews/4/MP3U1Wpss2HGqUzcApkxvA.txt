99 CENTS BEEF OR CHICKEN TACOS

Not to forget a $2.50 beef burrito.  If you compare my neighborhood taco shop to Taco Bell or Del Taco, I would give the edge to Santarosa Taco Stop. Yu-go chauffeur told me to order anything I wanted... like hey big spender with $10 gripped in my hand. LoL

What the heck, let's try the chicken, beef tacos and the their beef burrito. Ifs apparent that the method of pan frying the taco shells are different.  Beef is a flat stiff corn tortilla shell while the chicken is pan fried the old fashion way.  Beef is blended with a filler which I assume is bean.  Beef burrito is excellent in size and weight.  If you're interested in getting the most value for the meat content, I would recommend the beef burrito.

The complimentary pickled carrot and onions are cooked. I did notice that their condiment stand was stocked full while the Basic location was ignored and empty.

Most important: both locations have drive up window service.  They will accommodate your customer low rider or your Rolls Royce (Celine's).
