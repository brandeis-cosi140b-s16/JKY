This is one of the better Chipotles I have been to.

After dining at many of their location, this seems to be the healthiest one I have been to.  The rice is not too oily & the beans are not too salty.  Everything seems fresh, compared to other locations.

One big plus for me, when ordering a vegetarian burrito, I am NOT asked "what kind of meat".

As far as service goes, the people working here are very nice & they actually listen to you request.  If you want "a little" of something, they do not throw a wheelbarrow of it on your burrito.
