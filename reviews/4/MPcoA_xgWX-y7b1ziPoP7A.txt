Independent restaurants like Desnudo Tacos is why I come back to Las Vegas year after year. First off, let me say that from the second we walked into this place we were greeted politely and made to feel welcome. The food was delicious. I would rather hop in the car and drive 5 minutes to eat here than walk to any Mexican restaurant on the Strip. I had the Tinga poblano taco with braised pork shoulder and house-made chorizo as well as a chili infused goat taco. Both were very good. My wife had the torta de puerco which is a sandwich with pork belly carnitas. It was awesome. When I go back I'm getting a couple of those. Get the rice and beans on the side because they're infinitely better than any other Mexican restaurant. I really appreciated that the chef came out toward the middle of our meal and asked how everything tasted. A sign of pride and well deserved. See you guys soon. I hope. Keep it up.
