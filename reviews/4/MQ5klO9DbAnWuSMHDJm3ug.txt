I don't get to make it over to this side of town very often, but when I do I always try to stop in to the Sandbar. 

All Sandbar's are set up the same inside and out, mini pool by the from entrance, sand around the bar outside, private cabanas, and dance floor inside. The dance floor at this one is a bit bigger than the one in Scottsdale I think which is nice. 

They have tons of specials all the time, great DJ, and usually get the UFC and Boxing fights on pay-per-view. The staff is awesome and always takes care of everyone. They also through a pretty awesome party for Cinco De Mayo, with live bands and contests. 

If you are over their you should defiantly stop in, have some fish taco's and a corona and tell Kelly that Aimee H. sent you! :-)
