This is next to our daughter's Cheer gym, so we decided to try it. We had the carne asada fries & carne asada chimichanga. Both were pretty good. They were cooked fresh to order. The nachos had cheese sauce, although good, would have preferred real cheese. The meat was great! Burrito was tasty, would have like a little more sauce topped. We will definitely go back!
