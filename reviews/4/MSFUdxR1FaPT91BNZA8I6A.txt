I stumbled upon this place on a whim. No reviews or tips present, along with a cashier that spoke very little English. I was doing a blind buy, hoping for the best.

I had to go with my gut instinct for my first visit. Just by looking around the shop, they seem to really be pushing their tortas with all the posters around the spot-- so I went with that. One that particularly stood out to me was the Cubana: a hefty sandwich packed with beef, marinated pork, chicken, lengua, lamb, and all sorts of other barnyard animals and their parts. There's even a hot dog and a fried egg on top of everything. It was all an overwhelming and unexpected battle for me, but one I was happy to finish. It's a crazy sandwich that's a perfect match for a night of a little too much booze. I wasn't drunk at the time, but I still managed to stuff myself happily.

If you're a braver soul, they have tortas gigantes (gigantic sandwiches), that go for about $18. I'm assuming it's something large enough to feed a small village. Ordering one of these among a group of friends would probably make for a good time.

East side Vegas really has some surprises in the Mexican food scene. This place has turned into my go-to torta spot, which is especially convenient since it's open 24 hours.

Note: There's a $0.50 surcharge for credit/debit purchases.
