We were looking for authentic Mexican food and this place had great reviews. Most other restaurants on a weeknight closed at 9p but Serrano's closed at 10p which worked out for us. 

They bring your homemade chips & salsa (3 different kinds) to start off, while you look over the menu. There's a fair amount of options. They even have combinations where you can mix&match tacos/enchiladas and/or flautas. Most items cost about $10-12.

We asked for a spicy salsa and make the mistake of dipping too much. Our mouths were on fire! 

The service was fast and the waitress was really professional, courteous and smiley. 

Overall, it was a good dining experience.
