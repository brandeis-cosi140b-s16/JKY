I love going to this place because it's cheap good food.  Were talking fast food here, so don't think that 4 stars means this is gourmet dining...it's clearly not.  But, for the money and the amount of food, you can't go wrong.  I love the double beef double cheese tacos, and the macho nachos are awesome.  Way more cheese on the tacos here than Taco Bell.  Overall pretty good food, nothing special about the service because it's fast food what do you expect.
