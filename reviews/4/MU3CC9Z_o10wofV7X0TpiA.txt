I love Jalapenos! The service is nice. The food is decently priced, and delicious. They have tasty rice, carne asada burritos, and super nachos. The tamales plate is even good! 

Sometimes they do get a little carried away with the onions, but most of the time the food is pretty great. I usually take out. Dining in is so different now. 

This place has been through so many owners, but the quality of the food has never changed.
