Rigoberto's is another of those 24 hr. mexican food joints around the valley, this particular location has some great carnita and adobo tacos, we also had the chile relleno and it was fantastic. the tacos were very filling and big ($2.50 each). The horchata was just the regular drink you find at many other places, cold and the perfect amount of sweetness.
Hot sauce should have been spicier. Overall i would eat their food whether i was drunk of not, its the real deal!
