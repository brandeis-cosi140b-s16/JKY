The fiance heard about this place through Burger Brothers....same owner so we decided to check it out.  The rolled chicken tacos were delicious.  The crispy shell was fried to perfection with moist, succulent well flavored chicken inside.   Accompanied with fresh tomatoes and guac....yum! The lengua and the al pastor were just okay in my opinion.  The al pastor was a little drier than I prefer and the lengua was chopped very finely, when I prefer the large tender pieces.  But for a joint located inside a gas station....not bad at all.  No place to sit, just standing bar tables....best to get it to go.  Kinda sketchy neighborhood FYI.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4.
