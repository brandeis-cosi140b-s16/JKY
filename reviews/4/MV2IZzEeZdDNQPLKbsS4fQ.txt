My favorite restaurant at Sky Harbor.....  I've been meaning to check out the original El Bravo location in Phoenix, as I've been so happy with this little counter-service airport version of it.  They really have a great selection of burritos and other fast casual Mexican food items.  Even the bean and cheese burrito is tasty!  (Everyone who knows me knows that this is probably the first thing I'll try at any casual Mexican restaurant).  It was the perfect delivery mechanism for El Bravo's rich salsa roja (the red stuff).  El Bravo is an all around good place, and it's leaps and bounds above the rest of the chain options in the airport.

One little nitpicky note about this place..... I'm pretty sure the prices have gone up recently.  They didn't seem exorbitant, but competitive, which was a huge disappointment.  This place used to be pretty cheap.
