You can't argue with a restaurant that has been around for almost 60 years.  I believe if you asked my parents I've eaten here since before I can remember.  

The food is always good and the service friendly and efficient.  I love just about everything on the menu and it's hard to pick a favorite, if I had to it would probably be the San Marcos Enchiladas.

Pedro's is just a great place to go when you want good Mexican food that is not messed up by fads and trends.
