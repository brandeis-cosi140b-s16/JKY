We really enjoy Manny's and they not only have some really pretty good food, they have some cool specials during the week!  Tuesday is $1 Tuesdays, Wednesday $2 off combos and such specials thru the week.  There are plenty of regulars which also tells you that it is a place that is well liked.  They have a nice patio and good staff overall.  It may not be the best decor (not bad just a lot of red) within the restaurant but really you are there for the food!
