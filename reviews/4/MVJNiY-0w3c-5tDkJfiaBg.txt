Raul y Theresa's is a monument in the West Valley.  I grew up in Tolleson and went every Friday night when I was young.  My dad still goes every Wednesday for the all you can eat enchiladas.  We go for family occasions because we need A LOT of seating (usually 10-15 people), and this place can always accommodate.  Plus, everyone can find something on the menu that is an old favorite.  Try the Theresa's special.
