My GF and I decided to try this place for breakfast today and we were pleasantly surprised.  Upon being seated and our drink order taken, the waitress asked if we wanted some chips and salsa -- we were surprised that they offered chips and salsa even with breakfast, but we said, "sure".  The chips were fresh, crisp, and warm, and the two salsas were good.  Like some other reviewers have complained, the salsas were lacking in salt and not very spicy.  But I think that is a good thing since some people like my GF don't like spicy foods and some people cannot consume much salt.  Just add your own salt and hot sauce to your liking -- I think the restaurant makes their salsas this way on purpose.  We both ordered chicken fried steak and eggs, and this breakfast comes with a nice serving of hash browns and a nice fresh biscuit with sausage gravy over the biscuit and the steak.  The steak was a decent sized cut of meat and our "over easy" eggs were perfectly fried!  A very nice breakfast and big, too!  We were stuffed and will come back again to try their entree items for lunch or dinner.  This might become our "Go To" Mexican restaurant when we feel like spur of the moment Mexican food.
