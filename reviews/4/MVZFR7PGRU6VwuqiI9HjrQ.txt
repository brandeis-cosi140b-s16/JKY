Excellent authentic Mexican food.

I walked past the La Palapa stand three or four times in the strip without ever giving it a second look. Big mistake. This place is a hidden gem with incredible Mexican food. The tamales are great and the homemade mole they are topped with is packed with flavor. I also loved the black beans with bacon-- such a good side.

The price is a bit high for a food stand but I suppose the large portions and quality ingredients slightly justify the cost. I highly recommend trying La Palapa at least once.
