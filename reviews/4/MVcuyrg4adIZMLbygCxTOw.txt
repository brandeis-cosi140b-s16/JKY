Great service! Kimberly was our server and she was very knowledgeable of the menu. that was helpful since was our 1st visit. The food was flavorful and not the typical Sonoran-style Mexican many restaurants serve. Their prices were reasonable for the food you get. Even though the house margaritas are served in a Scotch glass, they packed a punch so a traditional margarita glass would've been too much. Desserts were original and delicious! We had a good time and we'll be back many times over!!
