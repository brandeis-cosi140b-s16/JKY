Had a lovely night at the new La Paz. So excited to have it back! Although with any new restaurant you can tell they have some problems to work out as any new place it appears the management is eager to get feedback and they were open to opinions. The food was so good, salsa was like old times only fresher. I had margaritas and was pleased with them also. It is a bit noisy but I am sure that will be addressed due to the high ceilings .  Seems to be busy and I am sure as time goes on it will only get better .  La Paz is a part of Charlotte's history, lots of memories and more to come
