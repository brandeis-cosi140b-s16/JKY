I've been here 2X, once last year and once this last weekend.  

It's a "fast casual" experience--e.g. order at the register, then they bring it out.  It's cheap also.

This last weekend, we had a Pastor Sope, Chicken Gordita, and Steak Taco, and some chips.  They provide a free basket of chips, more is extra.  They gave us a bowl of salsa, which was medium, OK tasting, but then two squirt bottles of a red and verde--those salsas were awesome.  The red was on the medium to hot site, slightly smoky (not Chipotle though, maybe Guijillo or some other dry peppers).  The chips were fresh made also.

Everything was excellent.  The Sope was a little different than those I've had, it was almost what I would call a huaracha rather than a sope, but it was delicious and had some great pastor.   The Chicken Gordita was the best of the three, the chicken was white meat but totally moist and full of flavor, and the taco was a basic steak taco, double corn tortillas, with onion and cilantro.

We finished every bit. 

They have 3 tables outside, we grabbed one, would recommend that if it's nice.

Stop out for sure, it is authentic mexican food.
