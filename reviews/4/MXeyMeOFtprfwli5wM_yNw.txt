Chorizo burrito was great  especially with potatoes in it but Hunny said bacon one was just okay. I love green salsa and theirs is very good. Price is good for the size of burrito as they are somewhat large and are very filling. 

Bonus is they are wrapped tight and right-you can eat them in the car as you head out to ride ATVs or go to lake on the weekend or  ... speed to work weekdays. ;)
