I'm not the biggest fan of Chipotle just because it's not that great and expensive. But I do on occasion when a friend who is addicted wants to go. I've never been to this location before until last week. It was a weekday evening and was PACKED. I was extremely surprised since it's location isn't very well known. I had what I usually order and it was good. I've never had a Margarita there until recently and it wasn't disappointing. Service was great and friendly. Thank god we beat the rush though. Will probably go again.


5/7/15 went on a weekday night again. Service was just ok. Not busy or anything. This woman who put the rice and meat on my burrito put barely anything on there. She globbed on my friends chicken but when it came my turn she skimped on my steak, bad. I was upset.
