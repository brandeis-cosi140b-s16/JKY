As a mexican myself, I can say this is very good americanized mexican food.

The waitress was very kind and prompt with everything.  The margaritas were great, not too strong but not weak either.  The chips, salsa, and beans are GOOD!

My gf had the fajitas and it's definitely a portion that can be shared by two.  I had the seafood stuffed chile rellno and was actually very pleased.

The atmosphere is laid back and feels like a true cantina.  

To everyone with the negative comments below, not sure what they were expecting for an off-strip casino lol.

Very pleased and will be going back!
