During a recent trip to Scottsdale, a few friends and I tried to make last second reservations here. Of course they had nothing available since we tried to reserve it at the last minute.  So we rolled the dice and just headed over to see if could wait it out.  We ended up waiting about 45 minutes for a table.  Not bad overall.  

We started with the chips, salsa, and guacamole.  Their guacamole is absolutely delicious.  Not cheap though.  And they prepare it right at your table so you can determine what goes in, and how spicy you want it.  One friend and I shared the pork shoulder with flour tortillas.  It was delicious.  I also ordered a mojito which was also very good.  We sat out on the patio and it was a beautiful night so it was perfect.  Service was also very good.  Food is a little pricey for what it is, but in the end you get what you pay for.  Overall a very good experience.
