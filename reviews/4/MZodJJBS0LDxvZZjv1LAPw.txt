WTF?  Seriously, WTF!?!?!

I was down in Phoenix for a training session when the trainer mentioned this place that did a fusion of Chinese and Mexican food.  Being the curious types, my co-worker and I agreed on giving it a try.  

The place is located in a non-descript strip mall in a pretty unassuming part of town.   Luckily, I know not to judge a restaurant by its cover and to trust a local's opinion....and boy I am glad we did.

I tried the jerk chicken rice, a quesadilla, and some sort of Chinese chow mein.  All of the items were great.  Not world class, but tasty and interesting.

A word of warning if you're not going with an expert.  Grab a menu to study as there seem to be a million variations of orders that can be placed on your order sheet.

Definitely a one of a kind place and a worthy stop if you're in that neck of the woods.
