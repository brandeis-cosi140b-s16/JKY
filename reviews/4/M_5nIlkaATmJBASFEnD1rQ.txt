Went here with my husband for the first time a few days ago, and I have to say I was impressed! However, I'm shocked to see so many comments about the atmosphere. It was okay...the fire places were beautiful however the walls are very bare, very paneled, very sterile.  Hang some art work! And the music did not match the decor at all. It was mariachi music that felt like I was at Filibertos...not classy at all. 
However, I was very impressed with the food. Great salsa and chips, good margarita (pomegranate) and excellent shrimp salad! Shrimp, jicama, walnuts, mango and goat cheese with a cirtus dressing. It was worth the $14 price tag! Would recommend to any salad fanatic. Husband had the fajitas and wasn't as impressed. Overall, good food and drinks, terrible art decor and lousy music playing, but 4/5 for that salad!
