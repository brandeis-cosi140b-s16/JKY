Fresh pressed tortillas are so chewy and flavorful that I bought two extra to take home to make breakfast burritos. I always order the cheese quesadilla with black beans. Rice.veggies and it is huge and costs somewhere around $4.50. Parking lot is always clear with few people inside. I think their rear facing sign and entrance are to blame- certainly not the food.
