Their chorizo burritos are delicious, and the tortillas are brought in from a local bakery. The carne asada fries are good, but Poliberto's in Glendale wins on the fries. 

I like the rolled tacos here as well... They are rolled small so they aren't filling up with a ton of oil when being fried. 

I've always had good service here, and we are here often.  Yes- it's a little run down...but it's clean.
