Enjoyed a late Cinco De Mayo dinner with margaritas.  We missed Eric Estrada, but saw Tamara (Orange county show?) and her friends dancing on the bar.  Also the half pint wrestlers from the Jacksass movies were hosting with some rowdy fun.  The whole scene would have made a great scene for a Hangover movie.   Food was decent also.  Tasty and quick.
