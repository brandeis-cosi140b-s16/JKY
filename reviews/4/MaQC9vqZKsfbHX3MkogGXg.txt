Has one of the widest varieties of options for varieties for a burrito chain I've even been to. I love that they have tofu as an option but I also can get fish tacos if I'm feeling that. The daily special's are a plus, which made lunch here affordable. They also do free or $1 burrito day which is AWESOME. Good quality food, decent prices, and the management is fantastic. I keep going back when I'm in town. Love it.
