The staff was very helpful and I relied on them for suggestions since I hardly ever make my way here... They set me up with some delicious lunch, too... I ordered the brisket tacos when I saw them on the screen behind the ordering bar... 

The tortillas tasted fresh, the brisket was well seasoned and even though I took the tacos to go (and they had a "superhot" sauce, grilled onions, cilantro and cheese), they were not all wet and icky which was incredibly impressive... I ordered the hottest sauce they have and it barely had a kick to it in my opinion... Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I was expecting a lot more spice...

Candyce B was right, guys... Do not skip the queso... The chips were pretty run of the mill, though... 

Lastly, the price was a bit high...  Over $8 for two tacos, a drink and queso?  Maybe I'm crazy, but that's a little steep for lunch... At least for me, so I definitely wouldn't do this frequently, but it hit the spot today... And it's good to know that tasty food is waiting for you whenever you need it...
