I checked this place out specifically for the breakfast burritos and I must say I was not disappointed.  I went with one sausage and one bacon and I AM FULL!  The price was right, the food was good, the service was quick and efficient.  I will definitely check this place out again when I am craving a quick Mexican breakfast.
