We stopped here for happy hour after some shopping on a Friday, and had a really good experience.  Maria Maria is a large, open place with beautiful decor.  Upon sitting down we received the chips and 3 salsa, which I really liked despite the chips being a little greasy.   When we asked about happy hour specials, we were told they were only available at the (small) bar.....but Tom made an exception for us at our table and even brought us a happy hour menu - definitely a plus and we didn't even have to throw in a wink, wink.  

Our 2 happy hour margaritas were great - strong and not too sweet and soury.  We ended up ordering the Carnitas Quesadillas, minus the carnitas (yes, weirdo vegetarian here) and I didn't even get a strange look.  Instead of refried beans, they use black beans, which makes me sooooo very happy.  They were yummy, with the perfect amount of beans and cheese with sourcream drizzled on top.  The menu seemed to have a lot of items and specific vegetarian choices, so I'll definitely be back!
