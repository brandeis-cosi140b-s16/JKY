I was dubious about going here because the previous inhabitant (Ketzal) was so terrible.  However, I'm pleased to report that it has made a great recovery!  The decor in this place is BRIGHT.  Bring your shades and perhaps wear black and white so you can look at something else occasionally.  

Contrary to other reviews, I thought the salsa was delicious.  It was just spicy enough and the chips were clearly made in house.  Both husband and I were pleased with our meals and we will definitely be back.  It's great to have a Mexican place in the area.  (I know that technically El Encanto Dos in "in the area" and in fact, I live a mile from it but putting gobs of orange cheese on things does not make it ethnic or appetizing in any way.)
