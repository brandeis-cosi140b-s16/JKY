I went here by my lonesome self on a Wednesday night, it was quite busy but there was no line.

The interior is really nice, they have murals of Mexican theme on their walls, and the ceiling is like one of those Vegas hotels. Noise level is not so bad either, it's a good place to take a date.

I had better Mexican food that is much cheaper too, but  we have to remember we're paying for ambiance too. I got the rib eye steak with enchiladas and a margarita, there's nothing special about their steak either, ordinary steak that you also get at Denny's. I love their tortilla chips with 4 kinds salsa, the chips are thin and crispy that goes well with the salsas, you just can't stop eating.

Lastly I give their service five stars, my server who's name is Madison is really friendly and attentive but not intrusive, my drink took a little longer to come (which I don't know why since the bar is not that busy) but I didn't mind at all because of her positive attitude. She even gave me extra salsa and chips to go when I told her I really like the chips.
