Listen. I'm embarrassed to say this, but I need to be upfront.  I am addicted to those spicy carrots you find at most mexican joints like this.  And this place maybe has the best in town!

not that the rest of the food is not tasty!  I usually get the carne asada nachos or a beef burrito.  Always delicious.  

but the carrots.  /stomach growl

oh oh.

I guess i gotta go down there for lunch today!
