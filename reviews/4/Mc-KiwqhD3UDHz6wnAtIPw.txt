After looking at all the comments about how great the carne asada fries were here, I decided to try them out. No bullshit! The carne asada fries at this location are probably the best here in Az, BUT I also tried the rolled tacos with guacamole & they were horrible at this location. I looked inside the rolled taco & there was a little strand of meat. They hide the meat with all the guacamole they put over the rolled tacos. Overall I wasn't pissed cause the carne asada fries were bomb here
