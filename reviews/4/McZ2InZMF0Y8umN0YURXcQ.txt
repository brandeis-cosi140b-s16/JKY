I'll admit I'm a sucker for a cozy environment and friendly staff that seem to actually enjoi their job. Been eating there for years and have yet to ever be disapointed. Always plenty of food and I've never experienced anyone skimping on the fillings like some heave said. Never had a problem with parking either, it's not in some big strip mall, ya didn't catch that pulling up??
