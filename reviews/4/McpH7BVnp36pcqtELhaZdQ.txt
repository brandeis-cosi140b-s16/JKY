Someburros comes from the same family as the longtime South Phoenix staple "Ponchos". However, Someburros has somehow managed to take the family business to a whole another level! I've been to several different Someburros and they all consistently have good food, service and atmosphere. My favorites include the Green Chile Burro enchilada style and the tacos. The beans and rice are always moist and better than that you get free chips and salsa with your meal. I like how the atmosphere is more Mexican-American but the food is definitely authentic!  If you hate a crowd avoid Lunch hours like the plague. If you are in a hurry you can also call your order in ahead of time and pick it up through the drive through take out window.
