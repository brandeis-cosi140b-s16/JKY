Decor seemed less terrible this time for some reason--maybe because we were seated further back in the restaurant?  First time, we were seated in one of the booths right at the entrance.  Also seemed more brightly lit this time, so that probably helped.  I like being able to see my food.

Still a solid 4 stars.  Not the absolute best Mexican food but it's cheap, filling, and quite tasty.  I tried the chiles poblanos rellenos...or something to that effect...with a cheese enchilada and rice and beans (Vegetarian...F I believe).  Yum!  Service was just as fast as last time, and it was considerably busier this time around.

My boyfriend is convinced that their beef is not actually beef.  He thinks it must be cat food or something.  My non-meat food was perfectly tasty, however, sooo...he can think what he wants about the beef.
