This restaurant has more selections to tempt your tastebuds than any southwestern or mexican joint in Phoenix. Along with the traditional fajitas, rellenos, chimichangas, and hand rolled tamales, this unique venue offers up gumbos, gourmet chili, chilean sea bass, an oyster bar, and build your own margaritas.

Not only is the menu exciting, but the moment you walk into the place you are enchanted. High ceilings, graced with a colonnade of bronze, life size horses galloping across the ceiling, fountains, gothic lamps and oversized candles, a second story looking like a scene from Three Amigos...you feel transported to another world.

On the weekends I highly recommend venturing there after 8pm to see the performing band of mariachis. The group of girls are geared up with instruments, costumes, and beautiful singing voices, and they serenade all of the patrons.
