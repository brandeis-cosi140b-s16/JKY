I try Mexican cafes' or grills all the time, most of the time I'm disappointed. Not this time, this is a new establishment, only opened one week. I noticed a steady flow of customers while I enjoyed my Tortas, The beans and dip were a plus and appeared to be homemade. If you want a treat, treat yourself to La Tortilla.
