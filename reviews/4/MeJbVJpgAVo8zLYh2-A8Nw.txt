The owner of this place is really friendly and he makes an effort to get to know his customers. The employees are definitely juggling a lot of tasks at once, which makes them not be able to provide the best customer service. This business had grown a lot in the past three years but because of that, they resort to skimping out on food in tacos. The food is really good and based off of the taste of food I would recommend coming here but don't expect the three tables to be clean. I would also recommend coming here during the weekends because their specialty food is good. If you want a authentic food this is definitely the place to try.
