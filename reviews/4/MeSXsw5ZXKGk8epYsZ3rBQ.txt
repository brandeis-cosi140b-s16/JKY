We've been here twice so far - just my husband and I the first time and then with a group the second time. Everything we've had has been great and everyone in our group seems to have enjoyed their meal as well. So far we've tried the tomatillo enchiladas, the shrimp fajitas, and the asada quesadilla. The shrimp fajitas are my favorite so far, and you get a ton of shrimp - I just needed a few more tortillas and it would have been perfect. The tomatillo enchiladas were great but a tad spicy for me, and my husband loved his asada quesadilla. 

The staff is very friendly and welcoming as well, which is always a plus! They gave us a complimentary flan which was sweet and kind of creamy (I was expecting something like the jello-y stuff you make from the box). We'll definitely be back.
