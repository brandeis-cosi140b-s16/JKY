This place never disappoints! I love bringing friends here that have never been :) 

My favorites: the beer selection. The fresh made tortillas are to die for!!! They're like little sponges of awesomeness heaven that carry my taco filling perfectly and melt in your mouth. I could probably eat the tortillas by themselves lol. The tomatillo salsa is perfect. Service was prompt and friendly 

My real only complaint is no complimentary chips and salsa, cmon! :( and they skimp big time on the chips and salsa when you do order it. No mi gusta. Fix this and it'd be a 5 star for sure.
