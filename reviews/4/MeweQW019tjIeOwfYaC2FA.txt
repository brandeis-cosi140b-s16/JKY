they have decent chicken taco here but I normally get the chicken quesadilla since it is so damn tasty! The tacos are a bit salty so if you like salt you should get them. The drinks are free refills which is nice so you can have plenty to drink. We really enjoy their tostada as well since they pile it high with lots of lettuce.
