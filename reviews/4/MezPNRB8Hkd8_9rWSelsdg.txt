I have to hold my review at 4 stars just because the facility is kind of a dive...BUT...the food is awesome.  This is a great spot for lunch.  The chicken quesadilla is out of this world!  Tacos and burritos are awesome too.  I would say Fausto's is just a shade better than Roberto's.  Prices are about average and the service is quick.
