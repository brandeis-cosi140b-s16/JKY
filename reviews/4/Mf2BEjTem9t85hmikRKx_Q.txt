Delicious. Ordered 1 pound of asada and 1 pound of barbacoa with all the fixins. Great choice. Everything was delicious. Made a great meal for a lot of people for a great price. Highly recommend it. Great customer service. Kinda loud and crowded but soccer was going on. Decided to take it to go! Still highly satisfied with my visit.
