I'm kicking myself. I've driven past this little joint with the bright red and yellow exterior for years...like 7 years.  I've read the reviews, but it still took me a couple of months to get brave enough to go in. I've eaten several times a the Thai place just down the block. I finally did it based on my search for some good chili fries. I ordered chili fries and a double cheese burger. These are real hamburger patties. They come standard with ketchup, mayo, mustard, pickles, tomato, lettuce. It was a moist grilled patty. The chili cheese fries were covered in a rich chili, didn't taste as if it was from a can, the chili was covered with cheese and chopped white onions. The ambiance, well, it's a hole on the wall, but good chili fries aren't usually in fancy restaurants. I'm looking forward to going again soon!
