Here for the 3rd time. It is really good. I had the ham torta and it was gooood! The tostitos preparados are really good too! I've gone around the valley trying them and these are the closest to the legit Mexican ones. I would keep coming back to this place. However, the only downfall to this is that they take a long time to make something. The place isn't packed and it's only a couple items and it feel they take forever.
