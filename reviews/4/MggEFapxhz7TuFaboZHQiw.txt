I wish I could give 3.5 stars.  I do love the flavor of the food, but the portions-- particularly on the tacos-- are pretty small for the price.  However, they make the guacamole for you right there at the table, and it's $9, but it's totally worth it.  I am a guacamole fiend, and I would say it's the best I've had so far in Scottsdale.

That being said, I have to say the bad:  1.  Parking not great.  2.  When we showed up, they gave our table to another couple right in front of us, even though we had reservations.  3.  They had run out of menus, so we had to wait for them... for over 20 minutes.  4.  I was most looking forward to trying the Texas grits, and when they didn't show up, I asked our server about them, and he told me he was sorry, but they were out of them.  That's fine, but I wish he had told me sooner.

However, again, the personality of the server was nice and accomodating, and the flavor of the food at The Mission is delicious.
