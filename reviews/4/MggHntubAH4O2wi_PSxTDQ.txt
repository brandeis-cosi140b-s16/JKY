If you're like me, you go to Chuy's for:

-cold Dos Equis on tap.
-tortilla soup when you're feeling under the weather.
-free salsa and tortilla chips.

Overall, I enjoy this place quite a bit, especially since it's only a mile or so from my house. If there's one thing on the menu to avoid, it's the burgers...they're often overcooked, and I find it odd that the cheese for cheeseburgers is served shredded and on the side.
