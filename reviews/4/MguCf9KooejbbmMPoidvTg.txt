We tried this restaurant for the first time tonight. We went for "Taco Tuesday" ($2). We were very pleasantly surprised. They have recently changed management in the past two months. The staff was very courteous and friendly. Our server, Austin, was fantastic. 

I ordered four different flavors. My top two favorites were the roasted green chili and the flash-fried chicken with sweet chili sauce. I would definitely get them next time I go. 
The chips were fresh and so was the salsa. That is a must for me when going to a Mexican restaurant. 

The place itself is cozy and I like the decor. I would recommend you try it out. It was a great experience overall!
