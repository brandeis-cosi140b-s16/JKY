Plenty of good, spicy New Mexican grub. The standard menu has the standards - tacos, tostados, enchiladas, which are fine for lunch, and would be even better for late night noshing if they were open later than the posted closing hour of 9PM. 

I went there for dinner with my brother from Apache Junction and my son from California. They get there more frequently than I do, coming in from New York, and I can see why it's one of their favorite Phoenix area  eating places.

We arrived about 7:30 on a weekday night and were lucky to get the last table for 3 or 4. We started off with the 'Kick-Ass' pitcher of Margaritas, at $29 ,eight bucks more than the House Pitcher, but at least assured that it actually had some alcoholic content. We were right.

In addition to the House Specialties on the regular menu, there was another sheet of Daily Specials. Every item on it, except one, had the traditional hot pepper beside it, indicating Spicy (New Mexico Chili). I knew this was my kind of place. Just to make sure, we requested and used (sparingly) a bottle of Hot Sauce for the table.  I got the roast pork dish from the Daily Special menu. Tender, juicy, flavorful, and highly recommended.

Plenty to eat and drink; no need to waste your time on appetizers or desserts. Well, maybe some guacamole and chips while you're waiting. Attentive service makes it a pleasure to eat here. I understand that they also have an outpost in the Flatiron District in NYC, near Union Square, and about a block from a branch of Rosa Mexicana. Comparative review coming up.
