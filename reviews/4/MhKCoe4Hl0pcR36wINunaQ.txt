Fan of Chipotle and this location because it's downtown-City Scape and it's also convenient because work is just down the street but they always seem to get my order wrong or forget to add an item. 

Monday-Friday around noon (lunchtime) this place is always hopping. It's best to order online and go to pick-up window but sometimes that too is busy.
