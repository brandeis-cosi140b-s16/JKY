My mom was in town visiting and she loves mexican food so I wanted to bring her to something traditional and good near our house in Surprise. After checking the review on Yelp, I decided to give this place a try and was pleasantly rewarded for doing so. The decore was very welcoming and the food was delicious. They give such large portions you can easily have two meals! I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a low key but fantastic mexican restaurant on the west side!
