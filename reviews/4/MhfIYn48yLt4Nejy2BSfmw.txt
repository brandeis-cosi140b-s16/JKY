This place is a hidden gem in the downtown Phoenix area. From the outside it looks a little sketchy and reminded me of eating on a border town restaurant, but that is what makes this place more appealing. I've tried Tacos De Juarez a few times with friends and family. Each time it delivers on its promise. Good Mexican food at a great price.  They have a good selection of beers and food that reminds you of eating at your tia's house. 

They usually have two people working the front. However, the orders come out quick once entered. The salas are flavorful and can surprise you. They have a good selection of traditional dishes. Their specialities are tacos and gorditas. They also have lengua and other traditional surprises. Oh yeah... and they have free wifi. So you can have a working lunch if you need it. 

Give them a try. You won't be disappointed.
