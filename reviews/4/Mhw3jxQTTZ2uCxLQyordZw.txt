I am writing this review for the killer deal I got with a GroupOn for brunch for four with unlimited mimosas! 

We got seated quickly, all food was available and good! The beans were a little flavorless, and so was the fajitas, but that was solved easily by melting some cheese into the beans and mixing in some of that amazing salsa. They brought our table of five a lovely plate of sliced fruit, as well as a few baskets of tortilla chips with salsa accompaniment. The salsa verde was fantastic. I mixed it in with everything I threw into the flour tortillas, which were piping hot, soft and wrapped in foil to keep them that way. they also had corn tortillas available. 

They also had bananas, pancakes, bacon, pan fried potatoes (with or without chirizo), yogourt with strawberries, and moreeee!  

Orange juice mimosas could get a little boring but they had Jamaican, Regular, and Tamarind. The waitress was very on point and would not let them go empty. She kept filling our glasses long after the buffet ended and kept us very happy and drunk! 

My conclusion is that the GroupOn customers who attended this restaurant came when the restaurant was totally unprepared for the volume of customers. We had a great experience.
