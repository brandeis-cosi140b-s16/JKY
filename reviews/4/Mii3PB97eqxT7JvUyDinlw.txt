Stopped by to cure my hangover hunger :) on a Sunday afternoon. I live in the area  but never been to this hole-in-the-wall yet so I was kind of intrigued after seeing review about this place in LV Weekly.

Ordered few tacos and sope and quesadilla. All was good but I'd like to come back and try more stuff to see what's the hype. 
It should be all good because place was packed (although it is very small  inside).
