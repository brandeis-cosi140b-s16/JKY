This place had quality tacos and a fun and easygoing atmosphere. We have had a couple large group gatherings here and the staff was very accommodating.

However, seating was limited and we were not informed that there would be an issue. Additionally, the environment was a bit excessively loud and it was not due to our group...

Overall; customer service was great, food was delicious, environment was loud.
