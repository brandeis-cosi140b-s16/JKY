Contrary to other reviews, our experience was pretty darn good. The place is more like a Vig than a Chuys, and was mostly empty except for a few bar flies watching some inane Australian sport on the tv. We were seated promptly by a friendly hostess and visited immediately by our waitress who brought back good margaritas, a draft XX lager,and some fine seltzer water for moi. Chips and salsa were ok to poor, the salsa did not have any distinction and the chips were a bit confusing --I'll say poor because they were $3. For $3, you should get Z Tejas or Sam's Cafe quality chips and salsa. Our entrees were superb. I had the fish tacos with halibut which was moist and tender on the inside, and crunchy on the outside, and had the ubiquitous cabbage and pico with some kind of avocado(?) dressing. The pico had a nice zing to it with roasted jalapenos. Everyone at the table loved the beans. Re-fried but not destroyed and with a peppery bite that we all liked. The rice was a bit ketchuppy. Mrs. G had a burro with some tasty pork, another in our party had enchiladas which were good and we also had a chimi which was very good. The kids chewed on a cheese crisp, and since both families had coupons, our bill was very reasonable. We will be back.
