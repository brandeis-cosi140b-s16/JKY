Went here last Friday with a coworker to grab some lunch. When I worked for PBS I came all the time, but it has been a while since my last visit.

They have many new options like Nachos and breakfast since the last time I went. I usually get the Zaba Bowl but I decided what the heck I will get Nachos as the girl working the assembly line assured me the queso wasn't overly spicy, I am a wuss and can not handle spicy..its sad really..

I got the Nachos and a small drink to go and I think it was 9.08. Not overally cheap, more than Chipotle but about the same as Cafe Rio. It was good and they were friendly, so i would likely return..
