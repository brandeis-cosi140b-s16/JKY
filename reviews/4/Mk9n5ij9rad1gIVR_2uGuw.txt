If you like this style restaurant and burrito then you will love this location.

Pros: Clean, high end area
         Great outdoor patio with nice view of Eastern to look at people
         Next door to Golden Spoon for dessert afterwards

Cons: Busy like every Chipotle
          Not healthy for you no matter how they spin it
          They need more than one size burrito
