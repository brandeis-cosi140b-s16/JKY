I know. It's Del Taco. But it was so good. I'm tired, hungover and not in the mood to sit in a restaurant and be around people today. Our drive-through order was perfect and error free. They gave us lots of napkins and a mountain of Del Scorcho sauce. Food was hot, fresh and just what we expected. Now I can nap with a full and happy tummy.
