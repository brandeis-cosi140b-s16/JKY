I love Roberto's and have for a long time.  I have my favorites from here and those are what I usually order.  They are the chicken tacos (2 or 3 at $0.99 each on Wednesdays) and an order of three rolled beef tacos with guacamole.  I also occasionally get the chicken burrito meal ($3.99 on Mondays).  I used to order the carne asada burrito (my dads favorite) but I don't care for the amount of onion in it and I always forget to aske them to leave it off.  Other highlights at Roberto's include the asada fries.  Think of them as nachos with fries instead of chips.  They are loaded with cheese, beans and carne asada.  I only ordered them once and that was enough for awhile.  They are insanely good but also monsterously big.  It was too much even for a big eater like me.  The same can be said about the chimichunga which I do at times order in a combo with rice and beans.  The beans are good but I can do without them.  The rice, on the other hand, is great and sometimes I just order a side of it because it is so good.  

While the food quality at various Roberto's shops is pretty standard and equal to one another each location varies in its appearance and cleanliness.  This Roberto's which I go to most frequently is one of the cleanest I've seen.  I love coming in.  The only questionable area is the cold bar with the salsas, cucumber, radishes, green onions, limes and pickled jalapenos and carrots.  Despite the splatters of salsa soiling the stainless steel I still like to get some of the carrots, cucumber and radishes.  A nice refreshing crunch on the side with my tacos is sometimes just what the stomach ordered.
