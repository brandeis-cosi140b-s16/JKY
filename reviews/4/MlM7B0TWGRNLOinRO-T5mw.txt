I like to come here with friends to catch up. The staff is always friendly, and will accommodate if we have a group of 10 or more. The last time I was here I got a chimichanga and ordered a nice golden margarita. Tasty. The bean dip and salsa always taste fresh too. I haven't been to any other Serrano's locations, but this one is my usual stomping ground for dinner, snacks, and conversation with friends.
