Great place to take a break on a different take on new Mexican cuisine instead of the constant sonoran style Mexican food were used to here in the valley. 

The restaurant itself has an odd decor that will have you thinking more of LOST, or Gilligan's Island instead of the famous caverns. I believe it used to be a Polynesian restaurant back in the day, many moons ago. 

The food is great here and the portions huge. They do have some Mexican beers on draft which is also great. My wife loves and swears by the Lobster enchiladas and my buddy and I spilt the Habenero burger. Thank god we split it as its by far the hottest burger this side of the Rio Grande. 

Carlsbad does a really great chili both red and green and I haven't veered to far off the menu for other entrees. 

I recommend it if your looking for great casual evening out with Friends or if your just driving by and in the mood for a great lunch.
