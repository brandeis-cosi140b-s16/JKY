Good prices, good food. We ordered to go fish taco, mini carnitas taco and carne asada torta.  They were all good and flavorful, but the two complaints was that they forgot the sauce on fish taco and the ratio of meat to bread on the torta was off.  Good bread, but too much bread for the quantity of delicious carne asada. I still will definitely go back again and try some other things on menu. Another thing, Manny is a cool dude. He has customer service skills.
