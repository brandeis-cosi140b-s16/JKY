I've been a frequent customer of Filly B's for a while. This location is close to my work and home and I've easily consumed over 30 breakfast burritos from them. Great quality food, reasonably fast. 

Should be noted they charge $0.60 additional for credit card fees. Their drive-thru customer interaction isn't excellent, but they are to the point.
