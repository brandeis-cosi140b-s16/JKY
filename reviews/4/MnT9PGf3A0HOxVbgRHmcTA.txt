Tried Horchata for the first time here, really good stuff, made in house! I hadn't had a torta either (didn't know there were Mexican sandwiches, is that like a British Burrito?) and it was pretty good. We grabbed some food late night to go and it was good, affordable, and the guy at the counter was nice and helpful with suggestions of what to order.
