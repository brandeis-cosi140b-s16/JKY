Was very pleased with this Chipotle on Lake Mead.  The employee's were servicing the customers  in an efficient manner and not standing around like a previous Chipotle I had commented on.   At this location the food was very good, tables were spotless and had an outside eating area  also.  Have been back twice now.   Good job!
