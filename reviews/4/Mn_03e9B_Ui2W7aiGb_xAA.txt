I will start with the service. A+ on service. We were greeted as soon as we walked through the door and it hasn't ever been any wait for us so that's a plus. The servers here are on their feet when it comes to refills on drinks and the chips and salsa. I'm really satisfied with the friendly service here.

The cleanliness of the place is well kept. I don't think I found any major issues so I'm happy.

Food wise. It's pretty good to me but that's based on someone who haven't had real Mexican food. Based on that I usually go for the fajitas or the chimichangas and it tastes delicious! Even when I Togo the food it still taste good the next day.

I like this place but the four stars is because it doesn't pop up to my mind as a first choice when I'm hungry.
