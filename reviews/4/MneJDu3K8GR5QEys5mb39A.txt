Just moved into my new house in Tempe and am lucky that this little gem is in my backyard. I've been here twice now and so far I've really enjoyed everything I've had. My favorite so far? The spinach enchiladas are YUM YUM YUMMY!!! I ordered the 3 Amigos Sampler feeling least excited about the spinach enchiladas but they were by far my favorite. Next time I might just order those. Also, they have a skinny margarita! Yay for that!
