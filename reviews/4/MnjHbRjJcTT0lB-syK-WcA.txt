we go to this place often only because it's right around the corner from where we live and the price is okay and you get a helluv a lot food.

we have never tried the drive thru.  we always dine in.  we have ordered different taco, burrito combos and some bean & fries dish.  not the best food but above average for mexican fast food.

the service is okay and at times they mess up your order.  we never had any complications with fixing our orders.  just sitting and waiting to get our new orders.  if you are not in shape and love fried food this is the place.
