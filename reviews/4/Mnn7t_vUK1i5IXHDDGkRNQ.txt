First Impressions for me were: I'm here for an early middle of the week lunch and they have people in both rooms, it is not crowded at 11:30am yet there are several people already here.  They let me sit where ever I want instead of just taking me to a table, nice though it does not effect my rating.  

I'm seated and I notice the "Garage Doors" Urban Architecture and simple Decor so I like this!  It's got Potential!  Plenty of Outdoor seating too, Great designs, this place is cool!

Chips and Salsa:  I LOVE great Salsa!  This one is better than A-OK and I guess I can say I'm a fan, though barely! Even so, this Salsa is better than many I have tasted in the Charlotte area.  Hot Chips (no not the strippers, I mean dancers and not the Potato Chips) these are Excellent Corn Flour (I guess) Tortilla Chips 5 yelp stars.

The REAL Food.  I'm telling my waitress what I'm thinking and she makes suggestions:  I could get Two Tacos instead of three (on the menu they are listed as three) I could get one of each instead of choosing just one flavor and I could get a different wrapper instead of Corn Flour!  So I'm IMPRESSED!  I order two of one and one of the other!  I'm glad I ordered two of the Steak with White Onions it was very good!  I want to forget the other one!  If I had only ordered it I would probably not be writing this review.  So the Steak with White Onions (see my photo I don't know what it is called) was very good 4.10 yelp stars.  The different Salsa or Sauce they served on the side (thankfully) was awful and I ate more of it than I should, just to be sure it was terrible (I hope they get rid of it and invent a new one)!  Not to worry, my server consistently made sure I had plenty of the other Salsa they serve with the chips.

Here is a place I had not heard anything good about yet wanted to see for myself (it has been a while and they could have improved if there ever was a problem).  My taste is different from some others, some of the time.
