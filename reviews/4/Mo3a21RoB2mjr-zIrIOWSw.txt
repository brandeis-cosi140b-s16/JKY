Food was yummy! Authentic Mexican food. The BF rarely ever says Mexican restaraunt are good because they can't beat his moms cooking. He actually liked this place and said it was good! 

The only reason they get a 4 is because it is a little bit unorganized. It's obviously family owned and operated. Everyone is very friendly. We just couldn't tell who worked there and who was a patron. Uniforms and someone greeting as people walked in would make it a 5!
