Ordered the Enchiladas Susias came with two sides..refried beans & Mexican rice..you get a cup of conchita soup & basket of tostada chips with two salsas..all for under $10 add a Corona & iced tea (free refills on the iced tea) for another $5..food looked appetizing, tasted good & service was decent. Music was what's expected for a Mexican restaurant however a bit too loud at times so trying to carry on a conversation was a bit difficult. Overall I'd recommend giving this little family owned restaurant a go.
