Always liked this place. Outdoor pool tables, need I say more?

Service is always spot on. Pours on bourbon always generous. Owners seem to be around a lot, lots of cool stories from Chicago.

Food, meh... Not terrible, not great, but also not why I've frequented this place over the years.

A welcome change from chain restaurants and faux neighborhood bars.
