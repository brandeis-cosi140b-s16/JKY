Wow, Phrank's is the real deal!  I found this place about a month ago. Thank you yelpers.  Man I'm so glad I found this hidden gem.  I've tried the fish tacos, chile verde nachos, chile relleno, carne asada and chile verde burrito.  This morning I tried the bacon egg and potato breakfast burrito.  Wow, it was so good that I had to write this review.  The owner Frank is really friendly, he makes it a point to talk to everyone and get to know them and make em' feel at home.  Only thng I miss when I come here is avocado, or guacamole. But do yourself a favor and find this place. You won't be sorry.
