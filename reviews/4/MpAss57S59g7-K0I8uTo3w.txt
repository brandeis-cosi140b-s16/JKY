Pedro's is my favorite Mexican resturant in Madison. I miss the one located on the West Side of town, but food is good at any Pedro's location. 
My favoirte thing is their pressed and warmed tortillas (they are a sweet treat if you butter them and put some sugar on them). They have good complimentary chips and salsa in the dinning area. And anything I have had on their menu is great. My go to order is the shredded chicken burrito. I have even gotten the three pount burrito and split it with my Fiancee. 
Favorite margarita flavor is peach!
