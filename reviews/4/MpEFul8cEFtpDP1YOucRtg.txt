Chipotle Who? (kidding)

I stopped by Bea's today for lunch. I wanted something different and after walking by Bea's sometime last week, I've been waiting to try it out today

I ordered the "Enchilada Suizas" It came with 3 enchiladas (choice of chicken or beef) and was topped with lettuce, sour cream and my choice of red sauce. The dish was also served with rice and beans.

 I enjoyed my lunch but i do admit it wasnt completely filling and i was hungry two hours later :\

4 stars for another authentic mexican joint downtown, wooh!
