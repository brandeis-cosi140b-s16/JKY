Chipotle is a great place to get a fast, reasonably priced vegan meal. I always order the vegetarian bowl with rice, black beans (pinto beans are not vegan), grilled peppers and onions, pico de gallo and hot salsa, corn, guacamole, and lettuce. Yum. My husband gets the same in a burrito, and sometimes adds cheese. Good, fast, and filling. One reviewer here could do with fewer onions. I could do with less cilantro and perhaps brown rice instead of white, but other than that, no complaints.
