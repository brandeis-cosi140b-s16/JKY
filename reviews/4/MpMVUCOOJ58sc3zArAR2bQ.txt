"listo, Matt listo!!" Ahh, just those three little words bring my tastebuds to tingling as I can completely visualize the Guedo Chicken burro (has a very unique sauce that you won't find anywhere) closely nestled up against a steak taco with cheese as if they are old acquaintances just getting back to each others' company.

Yes, it is pricey for the size of the portions, but I'm at the stage of my culinary travels that I no longer pine for the La Tolteca 3lb burrito for $4.99 (or whatever it goes for these days), but rather a nice quality meal with a cold cerveza.

The expansions that they've done since I first started going here back in 1995 are a nice touch and its nice to see that they survived the city of Chandler's construction problems.

They're also one of the few places in town that I can get a veggie burro/taco with whole beans, instead of ones that have been watered down with like a ton of lard and no taste.

If you want quality, add this to your list. If you want quantity, go to Chipotle.
