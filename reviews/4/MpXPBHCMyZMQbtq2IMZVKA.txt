Since moving to the Summerlin side of town, KoMex take out has been on rotation in our house almost weekly. They specialize in Korean/Mexican fusion and you really can't go wrong with anything "fusion" on the menu.  I am a huge fan of their tacos, especially the pork belly. They are pretty small, but they are loaded with delicious meat and cheap. I am also seriously addicted to their chips, salsa, and guacamole. The salsa has a little kick and great tomato flavor and the chips are homemade! YUM! My husband is partial to the fusion burrito, which is both delicious and filling. We have also tried the fusion cheesesteak with fries and it is out of this world delicious! It is super cheesy and of course the bulgogi is so flavorful. The fries are disappointing but that may be because they are usually cold by the time we get them home. We recently tried the fusion wings and my husband loved the flavor, but they definitely have a bit of a kick. The only thing that I have had that I was not into was the Chow Fettuccine. It was actually much better reheated the next day, but I just wasn't a fan of the flavors and it was a tiny bit greasy. Other than that one dish everything we have tried has been outstanding! If you are looking for something different and delicious you should definitely give it a try!
