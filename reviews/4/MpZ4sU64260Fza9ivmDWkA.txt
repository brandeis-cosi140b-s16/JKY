Of the five local area Mexian resturants I frequent, Garcia's would be my favorite.  I usually have the MAGNIFICO SAMPLER, and always enjoy it.  The beans always taste fresh.  In some other plpaces, they often taste canned, but not here.  The food was just spicy enough.  I admit it, I am a whimp whenit comes to spicy food.  I do not like HOT stuff.  I prefer just a little tang with my meal.  And Garcia's always gets it right.
