Ok, so La Bamba is a chain and it may not be a 100% representation of what you'd find in the Barrio or from a food cart vendor in Mexico City - fine.  We get it; none of us are as worthy as the handful of ethnic (particularly Mexican and Thai) food snobs (with big chips on their shoulders) that lurk Yelp....

Now that we've got that out of the way - La Bamba is a great "go to option" for when my burrito demons rear their ugly heads.  Why?  

The stuff is fresh.  There are no freezers anywhere.  I've watched them make their hot sauce from scratch - they take dried peppers, smoked chile peppers, water and a touch of oil, toss it into a huge VitaMix mixer and puree it.  Handful by handful.  Nothing from a can.

My favorite item?  The Super steak burrito, no cheese, no beans, add hot sauce.  Yum.  I could eat 2-3 of them at a time, no lie.  The steak is always flavorful and tender, with nary a sign of gristle, excess fat, or any other nasties.  

Service is always helpful, fast, and friendly to boot.  Tip those guys - they do a great job!

The only thing I've ever been less than impressed with are the nacho chips... they seem to always be a touch on the stale side.  Otherwise, La Bamba is a definite WIN.
