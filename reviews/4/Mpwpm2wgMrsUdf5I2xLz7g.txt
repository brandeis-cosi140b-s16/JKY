Met a friend here for lunch on a weekday; it was my first visit and definitely won't be my last.  We grabbed a table near one of the front windows; a waitress appeared with menus and an order of chips and salsa.

The salsa was extremely fresh tasting - diced chunks of tomato and onion, cilantro, and a hint of lime.  The chips weren't anything spectacular, but the salsa was solid.  We ordered soft drinks and browsed the menu.

Our server recommended the chimichangas, but we were interested in being a little healthy, so we opted for tacos - we ordered one of each (steak, chicken, and pastor).  They were a reasonable $2 each.

Within a few minutes, our baskets arrived - they looked delicious.  Accompanying our chow were two bottles of house-made hot sauces: one green, one red.  The green had some seriously great flavor, along with a good kick of heat.  The red was tasty, with less heat than the green.

I sampled the steak taco first.  Corn tortillas were soft and tasty.  The steak was super high quality, nicely seared, and lean.  The diced onion and chopped cilantro were plentiful and fresh.  Green sauce contributed a nice little flavor boost.

The chicken was shredded and served with shredded cheese.  Unfortunately, it was lacking in any real flavor.  Definitely required the addition of the green and red hot sauces.

The pastor stole the show - it was superb.  Flavorful and just excellent.  Get this.
