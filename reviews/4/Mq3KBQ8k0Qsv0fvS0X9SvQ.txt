I love Joyride! The tacos are amazing, the queso is awesome, the tea is magnificient! I even like the cucumber orange salad and I don't usually eat any types of salads! The service has always been great when I've been there. Even when the person I was with sent something back. They took care of it and the manager came over to check that everything was better when the alternate taco came out.

The lunch special is pretty great too!
