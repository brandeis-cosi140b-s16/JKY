I generally seem to think of all these -berto's type fast food places to be all the same. 

But Amando's is soooo good. I've been a hardcore Filiberto's girl since the womb I'm sure, but the lack of one in my 'hood has forced me to start going elsewhere for my breakfast burrito needs. 

Amando's more than fills the void. I crave their bean & cheese burrito on a nightly basis, I swear--and no extra charge for cheese! (I hate when -bertos does that! oh and no fee for debit card either!) They have great salsa and I think that is what sets their food apart from the others. The salsa verde is awesome, but packs a punch so watch out.

Other than the slightly awkward location (getting around the light rail and turning out of the lot is kind of annoying) Amando's is cheap, easy, and convenient. If you are in this area and have a craving, don't be afraid to give them a try! They have combos and daily specials with free drinks in a lot of them, and most importantly, 24-hour yummy, greasy Mexican food. Mmmm.
