Think Filibertos with about half the sodium content, I had the much raved about carne asada california burrito which was a combo of carne asada, cheese and french fries....pretty damn good. 
My wife had a chicken chimichanga combo and it was so good it inspired me to try a simple chicken taco. Not very good...glad I got that out of the way so my next visit doesn't change what I think of the place. Still looking for that magical taco shop that reminds me of must stop even though traffic is a bitch and $7 parking Olvera St in downtown LA. But this is good enough for dinner if it happens to be on the way home.

Cant wait to try the breakfast burritos.
