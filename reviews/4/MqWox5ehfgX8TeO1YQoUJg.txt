It's a great location. Whilst driving southward and in need of a burrito bol, burrito, gratuitous amounts of guac, or any combination of the aforementioned, this is a great location. Staff? Eh, they're friendly for the most part. Efficient at the very least. 

Only con: Entering the shopping center driving south on providence or towards Southpark on Sharon Amity. Forget about it. You're either going to wreck your freshly polished Range Rover or back up traffic for a quarter mile. Do yourself a favor and choose the opposite of the two. You'll save yourself a headache and also commence burrito consumption much faster.
