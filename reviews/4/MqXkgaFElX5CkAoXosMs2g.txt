This was my first time dining there.  It has a Chipotle style of food creation to it, but with better options and flavors I felt!  CRAZY busy for lunch being right across from UNLV, so walking in to this I could only assume that it was this busy because it was that good!
I went there with a friend, we both got cheese enchiladas, hers with mild sauce, mine with medium.  Both lunches and two sodas came to $20, so right on track with what I was wanting to spend.  
I had the complimentary condiments added (rice & beans, pico, sour cream, guac)...my friend said no...but then decided at the cash register that she wanted the sour cream.  For some reason her enchiladas were $1.10 more than mine plus an add on of $1.00 for a side of sour cream.  I didn't realize this til I looked at the receipt later.  I'm not tryna complain about $2, but that is the ONLY reason why I dropped a star, just the accuracy at the register.
Otherwise, the order-taker/creators were great, smiles all around, and knowledgeable.  Nice atmosphere and had Coca-Cola products with Coke Zero, Diet Dr. Pepper, and Horchata...yum!!
