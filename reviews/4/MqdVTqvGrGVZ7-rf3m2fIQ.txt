4 Stars for Qdoba... 
I eat here often, mainly because i'm one of the cheapest people you will ever meet when comes to getting lunch, and mainly because I use their Qdoba points card which gives me a free burrito after I buy 10 or something... 

I would normally rate them 3 stars because it's usually "just ok", but when you can catch them at their prime lunch time, everything just seems so freakin BOMB!!

Go Qdoba!
