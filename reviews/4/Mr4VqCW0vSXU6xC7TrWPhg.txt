Lindo's is usually a good spot they rarely disappoint. The menu has your classic authentic Mexican food and softer stuff for the kiddos as well. The staff here are super friendly and treat you well so that's always a plus. I'm not sure if I came during rush hour or what but it was super busy. 

They have a bar, televisions, and a really nice decor. You can see them warming fresh tortillas while your waiting to be seated. Also if its your birthday you will probably get the loudest birthday song ever here :) enjoy.
