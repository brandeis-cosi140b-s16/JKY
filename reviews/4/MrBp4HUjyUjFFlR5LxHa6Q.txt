My review is not only based on fantastic customer service but very good food. At the end you will understand the 4 star vs 5 star. We placed a catering order with Chipotle on Friday. I had called the local location and discussed my options and then was referred to the 800 number to place my order. We placed a large order for 20 people. This included everything you needed from service utensils, food to the matches needed to light burners. The order was to be ready Sunday at 2:00. I received a confirmation of my order Saturday via email. Sunday my husband went to pick up food at local store to find order wasn't received and food wasn't ready. Of course my husband was surprised but that is when the local manager jumped in and took over. She apologized profusely and submitted order immediately and got her team working hard to fill our order. In the end my husband went back at 3 to pick up not only what we ordered but many extras. Not only did the manager have everyone jumping through hoops to get our food ready but she did something RARELY done in this day she took care of the bill. The CUSTOMER SERVICE  was above and beyond and greatly appreciated. Everyone at our party loved all the food and we were over the top pleased with the results. Great Job we will definitely be sending referrals just next time I would suggest calling local store to make sure received order from corporate otherwise awesome experience. Thank You!
