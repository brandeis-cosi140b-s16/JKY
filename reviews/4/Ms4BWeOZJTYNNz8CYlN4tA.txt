Good, fast Mexi-American food at a reasonable price.

As other reviewers have pointed out, Zabas is similar in menu to Chipotle, but with more protein options. You pick you meal (burrito, quesadillas, salads...), your protein, your preferred salsa, and your add-ons. I had a pulled steak quesadilla. It was basic, and a bit too greasy for my tastes, but the meat was both good and plentiful. 

Located by the Kohl's and Petsmart in the NW corner of the city, it's not a place I would go to specifically, but it is the best of the food options in the area.
