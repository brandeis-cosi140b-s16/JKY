Walk into Burrito Drive at 2:30am. Go up to the register and be greeted by a nice gentleman. Ask what they are known for. You order. Chips come to the table with hottt Salsa. Yes! The Sheh-meh-neh burrito comes out within less 7 min. It's huge but  you devour it. Sweet potato pur√©e, grilled chicken, pickled red onion, bacon!, quest fresco. You leave at 3am when they close mostly sobered up. I call that a success.
