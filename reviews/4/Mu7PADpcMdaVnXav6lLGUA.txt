I am giving this place 5 stars for service, kindness, and genuineness. Why the 4 stars? Simply to leave room for improvement... The place is cute and the food tastes wonderful. They got us in with their $10 Yelp deal for $20 worth of food! Had a great discussion with the manager who is so sweet and hard working. The place is great but I feel that they could make some slight changes to make it even better. Yes, I'm just being over critical but like I said in my profile, I have to be honest.
