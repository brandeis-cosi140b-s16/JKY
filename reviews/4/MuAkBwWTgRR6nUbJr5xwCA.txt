I ate here today for the first time. It's not really a "sit down" kind of restaurant, but the food was very good.  I had the two tacos meal and iced tea. The taco meat was flavorful, the beans didn't taste like canned refried beans, the rice was really good, and the tea was freshly brewed. It's filibertos-ish by way of the menu  but WAY better in quality of the food.  There was a huge line after we got there but people were in and out pretty quickly.
