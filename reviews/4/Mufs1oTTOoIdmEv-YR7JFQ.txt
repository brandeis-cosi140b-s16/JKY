So, it was a lazy Sunday and my man and I needed to just get out of the house.  We headed on down to Mill Street because I have never been.  I LOVED IT!  I didn't feel old either.  There was a mix of people and it was great.  After a while we were hungry and thirsty so we came across this great place.  As we walked in, the decor, the atmosphere was perfect.  It was modern, hip and sophisticated with an edgy feeling.  There was also side walk seating and that's what we chose so we could people watch. But I"m getting ahead of myself.  The hostess was so sweet, friendly and made us feel welcome....more than welcome, she made us feel like she knew us. Nice!.  We were seated and we ordered cold beers.  They hit the spot.  We also ordered some mushroom tacos and fish tacos.  They looked a bit small but when we were finished we were perfectly satisfied.  We sat there for hours drinking beer, people watching and we even had a great little conversation with the people at the table behind us.  It was a wonderful way to end a good weekend.  The only reason why I didn't give it a five is probably just because I"m pretty damn picky.  Oh well....you might rate it a five...you should try it.
