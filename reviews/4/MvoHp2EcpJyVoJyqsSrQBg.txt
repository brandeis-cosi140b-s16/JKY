I really like Cafe Rumba. The lunch special Rumba Burrito, Drink and Rumba Fries is a good value. I love the the Peach-Mango Salsa and the spicy sour cream. 
They do tend to close early at night so I usually go there for a late lunch. They are too busy at lunch time so I just go later. 
What happened to the discount coupons in the Super Savings Magazine? I miss using those coupons! I do appreciate having the punch card for customer loyalty where your 10th item is free!
