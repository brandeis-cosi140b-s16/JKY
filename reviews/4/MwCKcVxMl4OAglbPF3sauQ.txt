A close contender for my favorite Mexican food.

It's not the most flavorful I've had, but it makes up for that in freshness. Besides, who needs their freshly grilled asada loaded up with salt? Get the California burrito and their cantaloupe agua fresca...you won't regret it.

If you're feeling brave, get one of those awesome looking seafood dishes on the menu. It almost seems to be their specialty. Come here on Friday/Saturday when the lobby is open 24 hours, and if weather permits, enjoy your time on the comfy patio adjacent to busy 59th avenue traffic. Sounds tacky, but you'll like it.

I think I'll be grabbing a midnight snack.
