I've seen these all over So. Cal before, but never tried it til they opened one here in Summerlin. It was pretty cool since it was my first time and their first time actually opening.

It kinda has this Baja thing to it. IDK if it's cus the people actually making our food weren't mexican at all or because they had these skateboards hanging on their walls. And while you're waiting in line, they let you tag up the walls. Gives it this friendly kinda vibe for some reason.

I've tried their carne asada tacos and their carnitas burrito. The carne asada tacos were pretty decent. The carnitas were really sweet and juicy. They have Monday specials 5 dollar burritos and Tuesday tacos! 

The service is quick and friendly. They always greet everyone at first step in the door. And the parking is plenty unless its a Sunday. Sunday is the busiest I've seen it.
