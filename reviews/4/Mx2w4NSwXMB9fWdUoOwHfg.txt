I love the concept of this restaurant and it is very tasty.  A friend of mine suggested it and now I go regularly.  It's great because my husband is a total Chinese food freak and I am a total Mexican food freak.  We can both get stuff we like here.

My favorites are the emerald chicken and the machacha beef.  My husband loves the jerk chicken, jade chicken, and jerk fried rice.

Sometimes I have them make a quesadilla out of my choices, but usually I just like them unadorned with the rice and beans.  I can't decide which I love more, the black or regular refried beans.  One time I ordered the chile relleno and it was heavenly fried goodness.

Another time, I was stuck on what to serve my book club so I ordered a bunch of food from here and everyone raved about it.  I sent home doggie bags.

Oh, and their snickerdoodles are so good, I can't stop eating them.  It's a sickness, I think.  

I actually like the hole-in-the-wall decor, it doesn't bother me at all.  I think this place is charming and everyone there is always helpful and friendly.  I would recommend Chino to anyone who likes non-typical ethnic food.
