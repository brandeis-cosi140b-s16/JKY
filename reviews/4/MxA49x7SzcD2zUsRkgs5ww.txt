Want to try a really good torta(Mexican sandwich?  This is one of the best places in Phoenix.  It's in a rough part of town but don't worry I'm positive you will like it.  Place is always clean and their menu is awesome. You can also try the ribeye tacos as they are also pretty awesome. On the way out don't forget to pick up some Mexican sweet bread or an ice cream cone.   I would have given them 5 stars but I believe their food is expensive. They should have at least a 1 special of the day.  Expect to spend between 9 and 11 dollars for lunch.
