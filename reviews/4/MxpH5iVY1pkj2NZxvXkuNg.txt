For only $13.99 + tax, you can get a large 1 topping pizza and 10 wings! Since they also make Mexican food, they sell the real Mexican coke. I always have to get one if a restaurant sells it. They're so good. 

My husband and I went tonight on the recommendation of a friend. The location is pretty small, so I wouldn't dine in if you're claustrophobic. It's also a bit stuffy inside from the owners deep fat frying the chicken wings. 

We ordered a large pepperoni pizza. It came out piping hot; we had to wait a few minutes for it to cool down. The pepperoni was delicious, and good quality. The cheese was also phenomenal. The dough was light and a titch crispy. I really appreciated it. 

My husband was a bit disappointed with the tomato sauce; he said it was bland. Honestly, I didn't notice bc the pepperoni and mozzarella cheese were fantastic. Since the owner is splurging on the pizza toppings, I can see where he might not want to spend too much on the sauce. 

The buffalo wings were just as hot and fresh as the pizza. I asked for hot sauce, and he delivered. More than likely, he used El Tapatio sauce, and if so then woooooot. Without asking, we automatically received ranch dressing for the wings and the pizza. I told my husband that I'd definitely want to come back. If and when we do, we'll probably call in a take out order.
