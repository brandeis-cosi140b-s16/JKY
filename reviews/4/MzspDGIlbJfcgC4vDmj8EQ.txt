Love this taco shop, this is my second visit here, and we were not dissapointed. The owner is friendly and remebered us from our visit almost a year ago.
I ordered the taco al pastor, a highly flavorful steak that has been marinated and chopped up into a soft taco.
My husband ordered the chicken asdo burrito, it was fresh, tasty and awesome
Free fixings bar, excellent tortillas, clean and nicely decorated for what it is, a taqueria.
