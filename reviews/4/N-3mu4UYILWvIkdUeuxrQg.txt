As many reviewers have stated I have been coming to Jordan's for 40 years, it was a family tradition that I have continued with my own children. I love the hot sauce and chips, and my kids fight over it. If you ask they will gladly bring you some chunky salsa. 
Joe the owner always comes by and says hello to all of the guests.
I've never had any problems with the service they have always been attentive and friendly.
This is the Mexican food I have grown up with and it's what I consider good Mexican food. It's always been consistent and wonderful.  It defiantly is old school Phoenix Mexican food one of the last of a dying breed of a non chain.
I usually get the no.7 red or green and it's always satisfying. I also love the chimichanga and the portions are very generous.
