I must say I was pleasantly surprised by how good this place is.     Starting with the big bowl of chips and salsa, the salsa was flavored with the perfect list of ingredients.   I ordered the Ultimate Chimichanga and my companion, the Baja Fish Tacos.    I am not real big on fried food, but the chimichanga was not greasy at all.    I ordered it with the chicken, and it also contained beans and various cheese and seasoning.    Yummm!!    My companion had the crispy version of the fish tacos.   It came with a sauce, which was completely unnecessary.     The flavors couldn't have been better.    Would I return?   You betcha!!
