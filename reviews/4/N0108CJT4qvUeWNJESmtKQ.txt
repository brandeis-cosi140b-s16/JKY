I'm ashamed to admit every time I walk into Monterry's that ask me if I want a Margarita, they don't even ID me anymore. That either means I drink way too many margaritas or I'm a fan of Monterrey's. 
The location isn't anything special. If you're coming from Harris Blvd. you will mostly likely miss the turn and will have to swing back around. As for Charlotte/ North Carolina chain restaurants, this Mexican joint is a personal fave. 
While the food isn't authentic Mexican it will satisfy your craving. 
Their queso dip and margs are pretty tasty. The menu is quite extensive- usually I just grab a taco or burrito, but they have many other options.  
This location, has the best service. Everyone is always kind, attentive and speedy. I have been to other Monterrey's and this one is my favorite. They have good specials, outdoor seating and tasty Mexican... what's not to love?
