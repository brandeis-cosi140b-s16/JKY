Resurrected from the closed Chuy's.  Almost exactly the same.  Walk in, order at the bar.  Self serve chips bar with salsa and shake.  Local crowd at the bar.  Everything that Chuy's was.  Even down to the roll of paper towels on every table.  The only difference I noticed was that instead of a stuffed animal to give you for your order (as a marker for the server), now it's a numbered small orange cone. 

Love the mesquite salmon dinner with mex rice and beans.  Good place to catch a game on one of the many TV's.  Sort of a Mexican/Mesquite/Sports/Local hang out.

Recently had the large nachos.  Awesome!  Huge.  I could not eat a thing after finishing it!
