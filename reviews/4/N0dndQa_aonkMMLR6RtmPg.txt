Stopped here on our way to the Dells.  Three of us ordered steak tacos (only $2 each!) and the other ordered the chicken Mole.  We rolled out of there raving about the food.  The free chips and salsa (salsa was excellent) was a nice surprise.  So too was the high fructose free Coke.  Service was great, and you can tell the waitress cares about the customers and the quality of food they serve.  If you are hungry and driving by Madison on I39/94, make the detour to El Poblano, you won't be disappointed.
