I grab a breakfast burrito here once a week or so, and they are generally pretty good w decent quality ingredients and an excellent tortilla. 

Add tomatoes, onions and jalape√±os to whatever burrito you order. Totally upgrades them. 

Not sure what other reviewers expect, but this is a solid fast-Mexican joint. Not special, but solid and reasonably priced.
