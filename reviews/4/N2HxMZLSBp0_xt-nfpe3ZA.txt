Don't be FOOLED like me by the exterior! It looked like a normal restaurant from a glance but it isn't! as you can tell by the store name its a fusion of asain/mexican food. My BF brought be here recently to eat their tacos. I must say it was one of the BEST tacos I've had and I LOVE soft tacos from trucks to stores. Their Carnita taco was SO GOOD. The meat was very very soft and moist. It just shreds so easily. The sauce was sweet and a very soft hit of lime which was PERFECT. I also had the chicken taco was to me was just okay. The chicken tasted good but the sauce was a little to strong for me. I also had the Al Pastor. The meat was also again SUPERB. The slice of pineapple, at first i was skeptical, but they complemented the meat so well. YOU MUST try that one. We also had the hot and sour soup. It was again very delish. It wasn't the typical hot and sour soup that has A LOT of pepper it was more sour in a differen't way. The chicken pieces were cooked to perfection. It was so soft and moist. Easy to eat. My favorite was the chips and salsa. The salsa to me was either a hit or miss with people. Its either you like it or you don't because it has a some particular strong flavor. I LOVED it. I kept on eating it and my boyfriend just stared at me. This is a place you def need to try. Although its a bit on the pricey side what isn't in Vegas?  and you ARE IN VEGAS! WHY NOT! just do it! :)
