Francisco's is a great option for getting your fix of Mexican food.  I kind of have a checklist for things I look for in restaurants like these, so i'll go down the list:

Free chips/salsa? - Check, to an extent.  The first basket is free, then the next is $1.50-75, which is reasonable enough.
Margaritas? - Check, and you can get them in gigantic sizes.  I've had better ones, but these ones do the job.
Big Burritos? - Check.
Family run establishment? - Check.
Cheap? - Check.  None of the Burritos run over $8, and there's plenty of options for under $6.
Open late? - Check, but only on Fridays and Saturdays.  Other nights it's until 10.

To top all of that off, it's in a superb location, right off the Capitol square, an area with a lot of restaurants that are either American or more expensive.  So, it stands out on its own there.

I'm giving Francisco's a 4, because there are some things they could be doing better.  Sometimes the service isn't superb, and the menu is just standard fare done well, unlike a couple other places in town like El Dorado or Tex Tubb's.  A place like this at most locations would only be a 3 in my book, but the great Capitol spot bumps it up a star.
