If you're walking through or near the Linq and craving some Mexican food or guacamole, this place is a MUST try!

I'm a local myself and frequently bring guests here all the time as this place is LEGIT!

The inside offers dining amidst a well designed Mexican themed interior.  There is also a mechanical bull that is available to guests late at night.  The outdoor patio is a favorite of mine.  Any of the tables offer an amazing view of the surrounding shops, restaurants, the High Roller, and of course a prime seat to people watch!

The food is great!  I've had everything from the chips and salsa (cuidado, es muy caliente!) to the fish tacos and everything in between. Todo es muy BUENO!

The service is ALWAYS great.  Everyone from the hostess to the bartenders are quick, knowledgeable, and friendly.  I even lost my debit card here one time and they found it and returned it to me asap!

I've came here many times and will continue to do so!

ARRRRRIBAAA!!!
