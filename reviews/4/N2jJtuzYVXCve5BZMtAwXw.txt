Good, standard Mexican food.  Mexican food to me is mostly all the same.  A good Mexican place tastes basically the same as the next good Mexican place, so don't expect anything mind blowing here.  Expect good food and good service for a good price.  They do serve RC Cola which I love... much better than Coke or Pepsi.

Don't come here for "healthy eating", pretty much everything is made with lard....and as expected, tastes good.

They have a full bar and there are always a decent amount of people eating, but not too packed.  This place is family owned/run and has been here for over 22 years.
