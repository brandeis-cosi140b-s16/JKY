This is a pretty pricey place. It was a nice vibe. There was a pool party going on so it was loud with club music. We decided to sit outside where the music and party was going on. The service was great, very attentative. The food was good bt too pricey for me. I got Baja tacos, 3 for 12 bucks. My bf got carne asada for 19. The drinks are pretty pricey too bt it is in the hard rock hotel so it was expected. Overall a very nice place to eat, love the vibe and decor. Good experience.
