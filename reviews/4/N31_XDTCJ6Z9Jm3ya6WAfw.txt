I went with a group of about 10 people for dinner on a Friday night. They had a table saved for us in the bar area which was perfect. It takes groups awhile to get there so the server was checking on us from time to time and getting drinks as people wandered in. They also brought lots of chips and salsa for us which were very tasty.

My dish was wonderful, (I ordered the baja enchiladas) and there was lots of rice and beans that came with it. i also ordered the side salad for $1.99 extra and it was really good. The rest of the table seemed to like everything they ordered.

I will stop there again if i am in the neighborhood.
