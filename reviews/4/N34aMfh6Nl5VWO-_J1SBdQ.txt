If I could, I would give them a 4.5  I would not call this a Mexican Restaurant... it is so much more.  We had short rib street tacos.... fabulous and the quac was fresh and flavorful.... like nothing you have had in this city.... same with the salsa, we tried 2 of them, this is not your find it anywhere salsa varieties.  We also had a mahi mahi torta served with french fries with cohito (sp) cheese sprinkled on them.... yum!  The breaded shrimp in lettuce cups were wonderful.... the lightest batter ever on the shrimp.  We will put this place on our list of faves....   Do not go there looking for Mexican food that you order by color and it tastes the same as all the other Mexican places.... this place is big on presentation and commitment to flavor.  Chef driven!
