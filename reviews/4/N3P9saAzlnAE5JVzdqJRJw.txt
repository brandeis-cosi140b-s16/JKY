I have driven by this place many times and never once thought about stopping in.  That was until the other day someone at work had recommended this place.  Thank goodness for that recommendation.

The Sonoran dog is a must have.  Good ole Mexican street-style comfort food.  I had 2 but could of just as easily had 1.  This dog was piled high with pinto beans, bacon, pico de gallo, ketchup, mayo, mustard and all contained within a soft bun.  I'd be surprised if someone could eat one of these and not spill something.

I also had some chips and different salsas from the salsa bar.  Good chips and tasty salsas.  My only complaint was that the chips were a little too salty for me.  But I'm one who does not care for a lot of salt.

I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed it.  The street-style tacos looked great and also had heard their tortas are wonderful too.  I'll save that for my next trip.
