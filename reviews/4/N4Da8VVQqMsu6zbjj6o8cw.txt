I agree a lot with the other poster on cleanliness, so to go is the way to do it here. They deserve 4 stars for there carne asada chimi changa, I was not even a fan and was lost to order one day so I decided to give it a try. They have mastered it! I am hooked for life and get one every 2-3 weeks. The shreded beef hard tacos are good, the carne asada burros are my wifes favorite around town from there. They have great food, just need to clean up a little more, and perfect there orders, yes sometimes they do make mistakes but I will let it slide because of there awesome chimi's
