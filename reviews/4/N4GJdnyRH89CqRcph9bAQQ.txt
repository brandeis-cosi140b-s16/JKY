Good, Cheap, FRIENDLY, and QUICK!!!
I'm already addicted to their "green chile burros".  Very basic, green chili pork, beans, wrapped in a tortilla... but full of flavor.  I usually don't like beans but I like em here. I had their chilaquilas too... just ok.. a little sloppy.. but it;s a total dive so I'll take it.    

Best as a take out joint.
