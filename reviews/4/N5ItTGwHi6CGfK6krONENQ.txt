When looking for a Mexican spot, you will not go wrong picking Maria's over the rest...

Lunch Specials are truly special. They combine great taste to a price so low that it does not match... On average a lunch special would go for $6 (usually under!). Order some water and you are well under an average price lunch outing.

If you are feeling like eating mexican and your around the area... Visit Maria's and i'm pretty sure you'll leave with a belly full smile.

Buen Aprovecho! (Enjoy!)
