Visited Phoenix for some rest and relaxation.  A friend of ours mentioned the need to try a Sonora Dog.  Visited Yelp and searched and searched for a restaurant in Phoenix which was actually a food truck that didn't set up until evening.  A quick search in Yelp found us Micky's Dogs in Mesa.  We made the quick 30 minute trip and found a little "hole in the wall" restaurant which is not in the best part of Mesa, but my wife and I have conclued some of the best foods are often found in less than desirable locations.  THIS IS THE CASE WITH MICKEY'S DOGS. Be warned, this is not a sit down restaurant with servers. You order at the counter and wait for the deliciousness to be created.  A few tables and chairs are available, but I can see this place getting packed very easily due to the great food being served.The Sonora Dogs are superb.  The bread is soft, the bacon wrapped wiener tasty, and the beans and cheese topping are great.  MICKEY's also serves "Salchipapas" which are basically french fries, fried bits of wiener and cheese sauce. This may sound simple, but my wife and I are still talking about this decadent side. We had the pleasure of meeting the owner and were happy to have met her.  All in all a great experience for the culinary adventurous.
