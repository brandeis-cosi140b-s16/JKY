I had seen the construction going on at Poblano's for the past 9 months or so now. I knew I had to try it, once construction was completed. A couple months ago, I believe, the sign said Poblano's Gourmet Tacos with a pic of a poblano pepper, but I guess they changed their minds. It looks like they did a complete remodel of the place. I had never been in the place that occupied it before Poblano's, but everything looked brand new. They have a giant menu screen when you 1st walk in (think Pei Wei-ish). They also had large windows so you could see into the kitchen, I really dug that. 

I decided on the carne asada tacos & I made it a combo with rice & beans & added a drink. I asked the girl at the counter what came on the tacos & she mentioned avocado slices. I told her to please hold those & that I'd like pico de gallo added. She gave me the #7 & I waited for my number to be called. About 10 minutes later she brought my food out to me & I returned to work. 

When I got to my office I discovered that they gave me an entire bowl of pico, I just wanted a lil added to my tacos! I then noticed that there was guac on my tacos, wish she had mentioned that guac was also on them because I would have told her to hold that too. The tacos were pretty good & a huge portion. I ordered 2 & could have easily been satisfied with 1. I have to say their meat was very tender & well seasoned. The rice & beans were pretty good as well. 

The prices seemed decent when scanning the menu, but somehow my taco combo plate & drink came out to $13.50! Was that huge side of pico $5?! Any way, I do like that this is a local, family owned business & their food was pretty good, so I think they deserve 4 stars. I'm sure I'll be returning for lunch during the week, since they are a 2 minute drive from my work. I also like that they have a drive thru, very convenient.
