i had a hankerin' for some mexican food and spotted these guys on grubhub. after a short wait, an order of chiles relle√±os appeared at my door (well, there was a guy carrying the bag, too).

for some amazing reason, the order came with more than ten corn tortillas. my first bite was stupendous! the perfect (albeit bad for me) amount of cheese and breaded poblano mixed with a little bit of sour cream and tortilla. i don't normally eat the rice and beans that come with your standard mexican fare, so i can't say how theirs stack up, but i thought it was tasty.

i'm only slightly embarrassed to admit that my mouth is watering thinking about this meal.

i plan on trying the dine-in version of this place soon; we'll see if it holds up.
