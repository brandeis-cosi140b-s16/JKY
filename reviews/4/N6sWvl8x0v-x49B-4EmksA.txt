I think o could eat Mexican every day and be happy. When I heard about this new place I had to try it. The restaurant is small with s few bar stools at the front window and a few pulled up to the side of the bar. I posted pics so you could get an idea of the decor. It's colorful and lively. They have a big chalkboard that states the tacos they offer. They all looked good but I went for the Americano and the Pollo. They offer flour or corn taco shells. They have a small vintage fridge filled with sodas. 
They say the Americano is just like your mom makes. That might be true if your mom is Hispanic. It had seasoned ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, shredded cheese and cream (sour cream).  The beef was seasoned well and it was a lot of meat for a taco. The shell was soft and all of the flavors melded together. It was one of the best tacos I've had (and I have had many. LOL. The Pollo (chicken) taco had the crumbling Mexican cheese, some avocado, cream along with a lime wedge. The chicken was juicy and the lime juice was perfect. Yum!!
Tacos are $3 each.  For four tacos and 2 sodas it was $16. That's a cheap lunch date. That's cheap for tacos that good. They have nachos for $4, add meat and it's $5. They do a great business and are open til 3am on weekends.
