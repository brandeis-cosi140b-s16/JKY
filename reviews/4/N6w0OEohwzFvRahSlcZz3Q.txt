I always enjoy their food.  If you love hot salsa ask be sure to ask for it!  The regular salsa is always so fresh and yummy!  They had a new cook that misread several of the entrees.  The waiter brought me the wrong kind of beans on my plate and my friend had a chicken enchilada when she wanted a cheese.  I will definitely be back!  I'm sure the new guy will have it perfected by then.
