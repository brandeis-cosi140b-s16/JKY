This is a pretty standard Mexican fare in Las Vegas... the food was good and the service extremely friendly. I had the carnitas meal and a friend had the carne asada tacos. Both of the meals were served with refried beans, rice, and choice of corn or flour tortilla. The meat was actually not dry and was very flavorful. The chips they serve are fresh and go amazing with the bean dip. The prices are reasonable and the service was attentive and friendly. I would say they are on par with Bonito/Lindos.
