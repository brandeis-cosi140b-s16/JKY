We did a large catering order in November.  Everything went smoothly and all items were included.  The food went over well and was pretty much gone.  
I would definitely order over as opposed to under what you think you'll need.  I think the serving sizes are a little smaller than they claim.  
I also wish they delivered for us.  We had to pick it up which was a little difficult with how much food we ordered.
