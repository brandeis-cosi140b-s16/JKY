Berlin is the best. She was very obviously new to the job, but we told her our names... she remembered them the entire time, and didn't even mind that 4 people came in for just 2 margaritas and a couple of sodas. They are sticklers about their 10pm start time for reverse happy hour, but otherwise... a great place to relax, unwind, and people watch.
