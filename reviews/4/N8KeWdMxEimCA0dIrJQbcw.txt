My top authentic Mexican place. This is a mom and pop, so don't expect perfect consistency every time. If I could give it 4.5 stars I would, though. This place has been great 9 times out of 10, and average 1/10. 
Sometimes you get salsa and chips at your table, sometimes you don't. The salsa is always different, but always really good. Nothing is not spicy so don't bring your wimpy family members.

My favorites are the tacos (try them all!) and the al pastore burrito. Great food at a phenomenal price pretty much sums it up!
