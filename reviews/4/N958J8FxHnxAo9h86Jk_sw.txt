Ermahgerd, it's Taco Tuesday!!.. Monday, and Wednesday.  Genuine soft or hard taco's with corn tortillas for a buck, three days out of the week?  I'm sold!  I tried the shredded beef, the ground beef, as well as the chicken tacos.. they were amazing! And if you are more a fan of street tacos, they got those too.. maybe next review i will talk about their burritos.
