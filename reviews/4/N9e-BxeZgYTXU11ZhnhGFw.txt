When I visit Phoenix, its mexican food or bust. A friend recommended this place to me so off we went. 
I am a fan of alcoholic beverages, so a few margaritas before dinner seemed about right. 
I was not a huge fan of the margaritas... way too sweet for my liking. But i came here for the food: 
The enchilada was fantastic. I also had the tacos which were relatively small but very good flavor. We went toward closing time so we were one of the only tables there. 

The chimichanga for me was the best item on the menu. The guacamole seemed fresh and made in house (didnt confirm that) and the flavors were poppin'.

One of the better mexican restaurants i went to while visiting Phoenix. I would definately return.
