This is one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix.  (pair with an evening at Castles and Coasters with kids (or as a date and it is a great night out))

I love their food and will go out of my way to come here for dinner.

The shrimp with aijllo chiles was a refreshing dish --- so was the octopus with "chunky salsa"  (it is not what you might think --- very pleasant.

My kids and I always share a virgin pina colada --- nice and colorful --- a real treat

Nachos are warm and fresh --- which is quite welcome

Service is also always friendly --- a great place to be
