Food was great.  Had a salad and my friend had the vegetarian quesadilla.  She didn't like it too much, but I thought it looked good.  It had fresh spinach in it.  My salad was like fajitas in a salad..yummmm.  This was our first visit.  I am sure we will be back.  The biggest downfall was the singer who couldn't sing.  He was so loud!!!  It was hard to have a conversation, but we did our best.
