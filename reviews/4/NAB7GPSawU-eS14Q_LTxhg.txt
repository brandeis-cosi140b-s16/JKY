Located near The Cracked Egg and Tea Time; Upon arriving I believe the owner of the place who was very friendly and helpful. He explained how the menu works, he said the tacos were very popular with the Al Pastor meat. The Costras is what caught my eyes, I didn't know what it was but it sounded good. I ordered the Costras with Al Pastor meat which is a bed of tortilla topped with marinated meat and layered with mozzarella cheese, topped with their salsa. The salsa was really good, it was their own recipe which had pineapples in it. Definitely a must try! I also ordered a tres leche cake to go...the cake was delicious and it was only $3.00.
