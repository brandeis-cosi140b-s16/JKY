A solid 4 star Mexican meal.  Considering the location and modern look, I expected it to be "Americanized" and or pricy but it was neither.   GREAT food served fast and surprisingly cheap.  Dinner for two including sodas and a dessert was under $30.   

My wife hade a bean and cheese burrito (you can't mess that up) and I had the beer battered fish tacos - they were amazing!  I've had hundreds of fish tacos and these were some of the best.

Be sure to ask for the full selection of hot salsas if you dare.
