Clean, warm atmosphere. I had the carne asada tacos with rice and beans, very yummy! They also have a salsa bar with a variety of salsas, I loved the salsa de chile de arbol, it has a nice kick. They also had food network playing on a flat screen tv that I watched while waiting for my take out order.
