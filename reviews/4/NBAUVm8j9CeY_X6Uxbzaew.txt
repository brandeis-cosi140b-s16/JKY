According to their menu, this restaurant (not this locale of course) was the inventor of the margarita. If so, they still do it right here. Flavorful and strong without being too overly sweet. Their chips and fresh salsa is very enjoyable and try their steak nachos as well. They are filling and worth a try. 

Service is friendly and I'll be back here for happy hour my next trip.
