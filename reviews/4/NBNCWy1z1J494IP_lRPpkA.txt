When you want a great Mexican food, you gotta look for a  hole-in-the-wall restaurant to get it and this place is it. I love to order a  variety of their tacos because they are all so good. This place reminds me of little Mexican taco restaurants back home in LA. Yes the interior is lacking but it makes up for it in authenticity and tastiness.
