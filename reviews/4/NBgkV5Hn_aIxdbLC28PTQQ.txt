This place is cool, great drive/ride, the road can use a little repair, but it is what it is.
My only complaint would be that the burgers only come one temp, "well done".. I like
a med-rare.. so i asked them to just simply cook it how they normally cook it, just 1 min less 
on each side.. they can't seem to get it.. but the burger is great regardless and the service is spot on.
