Usual Chipotle served FAST at usual Chipotle prices in the middle of the strip. After stuffing your piehole with buffet food it's not a bad idea to get a burrito bowl or salad here. They can get crowded of course but they move fast. There aren't a ton of seats and they share their space with pizza and Chinese places so you might have to get it to go.
