Consistently good Tex Mex food and good service. My only complaint and I always say this when I go to one of the Pasquals restaurants,  Is they sprinkle a red powder on the chips( that you have to buy extra which is annoying) and it tastes terrible and this time was very salty. You can ask for them to be un seasoned but its a special order that takes time. When Pasquals first opened the chips were part of the order and it was the blue corn ones that are round not triangle shaped ones like these. You can buy a bag of them in the restaurant and I sometimes do and use them at the table and take the rest home. I still love the place, especially this Monroe street location.
