UPS: Great food, generous portions, well-priced, creative menu, great location, a few free parking spots, hipster hotspot.
DOWNS: Slightly odd that no Mexican people serve the customers, service is inconsistent (ie food can arrive quickly, but both times it took FOREVER to get the check).
If they can iron out the service issues it will be a GEM :)
