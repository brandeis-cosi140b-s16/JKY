Love this place! I love the ambiance, atmosphere, the people and the menu!  

Designed as a "nicer" restaurant, but with all of the amenities of "home away from home". We went on a Thursday afternoon along with a couple of business-attired folks sitting at the bar working at their lap tops, several booths with 4-5 people and a couple of families.

The server brought chips & salsa to the table and then we enjoyed the taco salad and tortilla soup (very, very good!) and the three combo plate.  

Both meals were very good, worth the price (total bill was $20 + tip), but what made this adventure enjoyable was our server.  She was very personable, professional and really delightful.  We asked if she was the owner and she replied "no", but just really loved her job!

WOW - don't hear that every day.  The Owner did visit our table and chat with us a bit ... which was very nice.

I'm all about good customer service and this place definitely did not disappoint.

Looks like they even have a (big) room in the back for meetings or networking events.   Definitely worth checking out.
