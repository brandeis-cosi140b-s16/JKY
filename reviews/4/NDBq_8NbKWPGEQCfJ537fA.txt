Stopped in for lunch with M.  I got the Mahi Mahi Quesa (Oaxaca cheese, mahi mahi fish, poblano pepper, mushrooms, onion, fresh garlic and Mexican herbs) and a large rasberry lemonade.  I asked if I can have the quesa without pepper (not a big fan), they said ok.  But it still came with it.  The quesa was HUGE!  It was really good.  The total came to $10.27, a little more $$ than I thought it should be.
