i have loved this place since i was in california.  i moved to georgia and finally found one and i was very please.  i probably visit this place 1-2 times a week as i love their tacos.  the price is always reasonable and service is always friendly and fast.  they only drawback is when i go through the drive-thru i never get enough of the mild sauce when they give it to me.  i ask for extra but it's never enough for me as i use 3 for every taco i eat.  none the less i am please with the food and will continue to be a customer.
