This place starts, middles, and ends with the San Marcos chicken burro. If you go to Pedro's, order it and don't agree, I will take a 50-cent piece out of my personal fortune and mail it to you*  It's got jalapeno cream cheese for Pete's sake..the burro not the 50-cent piece.  JFK didn't care for spicy dishes unless it was Rita Moreno!!!!  I'm drunk right now...drunk on how awesome the San Marcos burro is.
