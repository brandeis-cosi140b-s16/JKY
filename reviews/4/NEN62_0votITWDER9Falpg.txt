We decided to head to Fili B's because tonight we wanted good, inexpensive, and fast food. 

Berto's restaurants are quintessential to Phoenix, and have proven themselves time and time again. 

But to night there was no way I wanted to deal with an idiot waiter, crying kids or being too early for happy hour. ... Oh wait is Saturday, there are almost no happy hours. 

"Three carne asada burros please," I ordered happily while I handed over my 10% off coupon I had received from the Fry's market earlier that week.  While we waited for our food, we helped ourselves to the clean "fresh salsa bar".  There was, and always is, an assortment of salsas, pickled carrots, pickled onions, pickled jalapenos, fresh onion, fresh cilantro, lemons and yes of course plenty of warm chips all waiting for you to help yourself to. 

Tonight whoever was building the burritos had a heavy hand with everything, these were huge burritos... and to think we were going to split the third burrito. 

With our bellies full and wallets fat we left with a smile, thanks FiliB's for coming thru again.
