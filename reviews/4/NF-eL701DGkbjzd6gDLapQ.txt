Bienvenidos a Tacos Sahuaro - enjoy authentic Mexican street tacos without leaving Phoenix!

The restaurant is nothing fancy, but it has plenty of seating inside and most importantly serves up delicious tacos for only $2 each. The tacos are made with with two freshly cooked tortillas, your choice of meat, chopped onions and cilantro. The tacos are also served with a selection of fresh veggies to cleanse the palate - sliced cucumber, picked carrots, onions, and jalape√±os if you want to kick it up a notch. The green chile and red salsa were good, but not the best I've ever had. 

At the suggestion of other Yelpers, I tried the Al Pastor, Carne Asada, and the Carnitas Tacos. The three tacos were quite filling because they come double wrapped in two tortillas. The Carne Asada Taco didn't have a lot of flavor on its own - probably would've been good with some fresh guacamole - but the Al Pastor Taco was delicious! 

Also, if you order a Coca Cola be prepared for "un medio litro - that's half a liter! They didn't have Horchata when we visited, but they have a wide selection of Jarritos drinks (mango, tamarindo, lime).
