First off, I love how open and hipster - looking this restaurant is. The staff is nice. You can spot the manager keep going around checking on customers. Their tacos are great with beautiful presentation. Tortilla soup has a fresh taste with a subtle kick so be careful if you're not good with spicy food. 
I came during happy hour so I decided to order a fresh pineapple  juice with rum. However, I'm pretty sure they forgot to put rum in there. The manager happened to check on us right then so I told him I didn't really taste the alcohol. Immediately, I watched him making me a new drink at the bar. This time, he made sure he filled the glass with what tasted like 50% rum ;) Great service recovery. Will definitely come back again to try another dish on the menu.
