This has been a semi-regular stop for my friend and myself...   We enjoy the muzzled atmosphere and the proximity.  The food is bland, but they make up for it with mediocre drink choices.  The prices are alright, as long as you do not have anywhere else to go.  Sometimes, there is a karaoke disc jockey who has a rather inadequate selection of songs, but makes the best effort to play what is requested... even if it is the wrong song.  If you are in the square block, give this place a shot.
