I have been coming here for 8 yrs. and have always enjoyed my dining experience. This is Mexican/Americanized but still some of the best in the area.

Service is prompt and friendly with a welcome and appreciative feeling. . The nice warm chips and salsa start the evening. The menu covers most dishes you recognize and the atmosphere is bustling and alive. Outdoor dining is also available.

I am not afraid to bring my Midwest tourists here as this is what they are familiar with as "Mexican" food. They are not dissappointed. Quality has never been compromised over price here.

I am always served promptly and have never had a bad experience with service here. The ingredients are fresh and well prepared, I  recommend any of the chicken entrees.  Portions are big enough for take home snacking. If you are in the neighborhood and looking for local Mexican I recommend Ajo Al's.
