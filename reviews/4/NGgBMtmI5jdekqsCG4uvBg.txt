We had dinner here tonight & had a really good time! Everyone was friendly and went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. They even moved us to another table when they saw we were too warm at ours - we didn't even have to ask. Food and prices were good and there was no 25min wait time like across the street. We'll definitely be back!
