Came in for lunch & drinks while on vacation and instantly fell in love with the decor and ambiance, what a great place.

Our second love was the guac - seriously...the BEST I have ever had. If there was guac in heaven, this would be it. So freaking good.

Both the hus and I opted for different tacos, all of which were delish & the service was great. Definitely a great spot for lunch and I imagine and even better place for dinner & bar atmosphere.
