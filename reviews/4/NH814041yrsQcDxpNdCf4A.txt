I have a love hate relationship with this place.  I think their prices are fair for their burritos and for the guacamole and chips and they give you a good size portion of guacamole which I really like.  I like that they have brown rice now and I really enjoy their salsas.  But my BIG HUGE COMPLAINT with them is VERY simple. 

GET A WHOLE WHEAT TORTILLA!!!!!!!!!!!!!

How can a place that a prides themselves on healthy, organic, fresh made blah blah blah not have a wheat tortilla??? They only have white flour.

Yet right across the street from them at Rubios (which I LOVE) has had wheat tortillas for years now.  

Sorry but if you want a 5th star from me, get whole wheat as an option.
