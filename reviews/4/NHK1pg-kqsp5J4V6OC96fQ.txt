Wow! Who knew airport Pozole could be so delicious!

We had half an hour to grab a bite before our next plane but didn't want to do fast food. The hostess said they were quick so we sat ourselves down and ordered margaritas and pozole. 

It took about 15 minutes to get our food and drinks - which is pretty quick for a sit-down type of place (but a little long for just soup!). The pozole was great! I really wasn't expecting much since we were at the airport, but I was really impressed! The margaritas were strong and definitely gave us a nice buzz for our flight home. 

Would definitely come here again if I find myself in the Phoenix Airport!
