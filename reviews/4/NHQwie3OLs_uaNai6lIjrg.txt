we went here on 4th of July morning looking for menudo to help a friends hangover, it looks alittle sketchy but oh well, figured we'd try it.  First...I don't speak Spanish and they speak very little English, thank goodness for for the one other person in there who ordered for us.  My friend got the menudo and I decided on this chicharone dish with some kind of green sauce.  I would've just drank that green sauce...it was sooo yummy.  My friend said the menudo was on point, def. helped his ails.  I managed to talk to one of the workers and she told me how the green sauce was made...I told her I would love to purchase just some of the sauce and she just GAVE me a nice sized portion of the sauce to take home, which I have put on just about everything..lol.
Very nice place and lovely employees, we will be back for sure to try other menu items.
