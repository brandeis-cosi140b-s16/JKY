My Favorite Martins was a Mom & pop place that we liked to frequent. 
The couple had a hard time with the financial downturn and had to sell. 
The restaurant was taken over by Zens. They had a great menu but tried to make it into a sports bar. Didn't fly as this is open to the public but in a 55+ gated community. They ran into problems and left. 
Our little eatery has been updated and is now The LINKS Neighborhood Grill. They have a good Happy Hour and a nice menu. Food is good, not fancy. The fish on Friday is still the best. The people are friendly, service is reasonable for how busy or not they are. Summer is slow but winter gets busy. Come over and enjoy!
