I don't frequent Chipotle because they pretty much have the same thing all the time.. not that that's a bad thing, just that I can get bored quickly.  When I do go, I do like to get their 2 soft corn tacos with beef or pork, which is marinated perfectly.  They are a bit stingy with the meat servings, but I guess I understand that if they are using "hormone free" (as they claim, but you never really are sure) meat.  I usually make it up with added fajitas, lettuce, salsa, etc.. then my tacos get really fat and filling.

The staff is nice and quick and gets my order done correctly.  This location can get really busy and have a long line at lunch (figures, a lot of people love Chipotle), but if you do the phone or online order, you can run in and pay and be out in a jiff.
