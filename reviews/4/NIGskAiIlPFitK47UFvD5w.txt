Oh Elmer's. How I love thee! I have been coming here for years and I will always be a fan. Their food is exceptional! Pricing isn't too bad either. I can't help but indulge while I'm there so my tab always seems a little high. The strips are phenomenal and the salsa completes the meal. It is the best place for Grade A, hole in the wall delicious Mexican Food!!!
