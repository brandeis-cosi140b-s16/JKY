First went to Tia Rosa 6 years ago when came to AZ for the first time.  The food is still incredible there and the courtyard is quaint and cozy if you are able to get seated there.  The servers over the past couple years have changed and aren't as friendly as in the past - more so seem to be rushed with little interaction or interest.  Still great food and Margs
