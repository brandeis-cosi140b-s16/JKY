The place really is a gem.. Outside patio, great chips good salsa and they have a deal that if you join their club and sample all their tequilas you get a cartoon caricature with your name painted on a wall inside the bar. Food is usually good (but inconsistent), service during the summer was awesome. Service during the winter is obviously not as good. Always clean, nice fresh atmosphere and reasonable prices. Separate restaurant area from the bar for family dinning and the patio always works on mild days. I hope they can regroup in the kitchen and get the servers trained so they can get the consistency back on track. I rated them for their past not present conditions in the hope they will get it together. Oh and Elise was awesome as a waitress.
