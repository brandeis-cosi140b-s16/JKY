Comfort food to me is a bean and cheese burrito and a little carne asada on the side. El Taco Feliz does not disappoint with either. The area, is a little sketchy. I recommend locking car doors as a safety measure, especially at night as their drive through is pretty dark. During the day it's probably not too bad but at night, be aware. 

That being said, my son (and I) prefer the cheese they use here, to that of Filly B's. Their bean and cheese burritos seem a little cheesier and tastier. They have a location that is off Dobbins as well. It has eat in dining and a pretty descent salsa bar. One of my favorite fast food joints in town.
