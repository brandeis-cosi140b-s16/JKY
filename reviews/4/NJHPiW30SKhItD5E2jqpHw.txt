Looks aren't everything.......

This little divito looks a little scary looking, but like I've said before "you can't judge a book by it's cover". 

Not necessarily the kind of place you will take your date (unless she's blind and hungry), but man oh man is the food ever good! 

We have ordered breakfast, lunch, & dinner, and it is all fantastico. They make home-made corn tortillas and several salsas. The breakfast burritos are out of this world and cost about the same as a McDonald's meal. 

We are a family that eats out frequently and we are frankly tired of pretty places with below average food. This place is sure to cure your hankerin for a tasty Mexican meal.
