I don't usually frequent Julio G's. Maybe because I'm so picky about Mexican food and I prefer to cook it myself. But recently while at a friends wedding I was amused to find Julio G's was doing the catering. She was a bit obsessed with them, and she has been living in Oklahoma for school. 

Everything tasted really good and I had seconds of the Pollo Magnifico which was excellent! The chicken was very tender and it was nice and cheesy just the way I like it! It definitely made me consider going there soon!
