I went to The Tee Pee last night for dinner and it was a great experience. I ordered the Original Tee Pee Special (one ground beef taco, one cheese enchilada, and one bean torta) and let me tell you, it was delicious!! I had a hard time finishing just half of my plate, but for 9 bucks it was worth it. The chips were good, and the salsa had the perfect amount of spice. And even though we went out to eat a little bit late, around 8 pm, the place was still packed. The waitress was really nice and everything came out quick and hot. Next time, I'll have to try the margaritas.

Overall, if you want some good, cheap Mexican, give The Tee Pee a shot.
