The food was pretty good... Not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but seeing as it is an airport restaurant I can't complain. 

This review is mainly for our sever, Carol. She was the BEST! Super nice and attentive. My favorite thing though, was when I asked if their key lime pie was good (my favorite dessert) she gave me an honest answer and told me no. Servers survive on tips. Ideally, the bigger the meal, the higher the tip. By telling me the truth about the key lime pie she risked a lesser tip for honest service. LOVE that! If you go here.. Make sure you ask for her. 

(And to clarify, she definitely got a higher tip than she probably would have gotten if I had ordered the pie :))
