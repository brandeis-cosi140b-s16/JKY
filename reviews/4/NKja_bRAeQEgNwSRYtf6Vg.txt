TACOS! There are only two things that make me stop when I'm driving. Christmassy lights flashing on my rear view mirror and taco places. Tacos de Mexico is open 24 hours and close to home, this is like the emergency place for me to go when I'm starving and in need of grease and carbs fast! The food is sooooo good but a little greasy, this is like the Mexican version of heart attack grill on freemont  and that's why I only eat here once in a while. The restaurant doesn't look good from the outside and the inside looks just as good as the outside, but what you see is not what you get, you're here for the tacos and this place is all about your taste buds and nothing more. The taqueros here are very friendly and will answer any question you have about the food, but I wouldn't ask what lengua, cabeza or tripas are, I would just say I'll have three or four of those and point. You'll be glad you tried it whatever it is that you try since everything is good here.
                                                                                ......See you at the taco line.
