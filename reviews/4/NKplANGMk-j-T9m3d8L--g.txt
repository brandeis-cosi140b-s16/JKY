Lightning fast service early in the morning. The place also looked clean and neat. Got the nachos and a bean 'n cheese burrito with rice. The burrito was definitely enough food for a filling breakfast. I swear it  was at least 12 inches long. The nachos I feel were overpriced, the guac. isn't fresh, but the cheese was decent so it made up for it. I'd love to see them throw the nachos under a broiler or something to help melt and cook the cheese. Overall a good place that will cure the late night Mexican food munches.
