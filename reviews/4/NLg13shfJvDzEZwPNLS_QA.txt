Nice restaurant.  The decor is fairly nice, but I didn't feel terribly out of place in shorts and a t-shirt.  Service was good.

I was expecting this place to have more vegetarian options on the menu.  There are a few, and the server suggested I replace the meat in a burrito with veggies (which I did), its just that I expected more options.  None of the Family-style meals are vegetarian (though I suppose you could ask, as they seemed fine with going off the menu).  But what I had was pretty good.  First up was the guacamole.  As several other reviewers have noted, Cantina makes their guacamole tableside.  It was very, very good, the right consistency/flavor/etc.  The only thing is that its $9, which seems really, really pricey to me (everything else seemed reasonably priced though).  My burrito was good too.  It wasn't anything fancy, just a burrito with sauteed veggies, rice, beans and queso.  

So overall I liked this place.  Probably closer to 3.5 stars, but I have no problem bumping it up to a 4.
