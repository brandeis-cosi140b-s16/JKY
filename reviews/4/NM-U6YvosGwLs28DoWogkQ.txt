Impromptu visit to Milagros yesterday as it has finally opened. In between lunch and dinner, but wanted to check it out anyway. Great vibe and rich look, they have really transformed this space.

Fixed my eyes on the Mahi tacos, price aside, some of the best fish tacos I've had in a long time. Fresh Mahi, hand made tortilla's, pickled red onions, thinly sliced chili peppers, three little gems on a plate. Sumptuous! I asked for " something " spicy and my server brought a very unusual side of a thick spicy blended sauce that fulfilled the craving for heat. 

I can't believe the size of the patio they added and can't wait for cooler weather to enjoy it at happy hour. Great addition to the Arcadia restaurant scene. Congrats to all the Johnsons on this endeavor.
