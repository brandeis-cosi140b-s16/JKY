The service at this place was AweSOME and we loved our waiter.

The chips and salsa was very good, a mix of tortilla and plantain chips.  I usually don't like the verde they serve at restaurants but both of the salsas were tasty with a slight kick of spicy.  Never ending!  We got refills..  ~.~

The steak tacos were phenomenal.  I'd prefer these over boring steaks any day - they're tacos but deliver great steak flavor.  They had tiny slivers of I think radish or beets that were a great compliment.  The pork carnita enchiladas were great too.

Not sure about the agua frescas - the watermelon one tastes like watermelon juice (its really good), the lemon one was very tart.  I liked the watermelon one but you can tell both has a ton of sugar in them.  I chose to drink Coke because it was the healthier option!  

Not sure about the dessert options.  We got the bread pudding and it was full of nuts and raisins, carmelized pineapples and a scoop of gelato.  I wasn't a fan...  Maybe next time I'll try one of the other 2 choices..

All in all, the prices are high for the portions although the endless chips and salsa and willingness to refill these by staff helps.  (They refill both salsas and chips every time which I thought was excellent).  Taberna Mexicana is definitely my top Mexican restaurant - but will wait to get Groupons, or other deals to dine there again.
