I love this place it's just down the road from our house and it's a great place to hang out.  The food is ok but I love kicking back and enjoying the tropical setting.  they have been great to the little league kids and the adults have fun.  It's a great neighborhood bar that you alwyas feel safe in with or without the kids.
