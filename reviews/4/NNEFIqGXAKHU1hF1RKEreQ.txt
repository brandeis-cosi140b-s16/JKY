Yum!  Cute little restaurant with yummy food.  Waitress doesn't really speak English but that was so unimportant.  The service was good and the food was really good.

Great free chips and salsa.  My kids liked the cheese enchilada so much that I didn't even get a bite!  Great bean and cheese burrito.  The best chili relleno I have had in a long time.

The price was a tiny bit more than I was expecting but I will be back!
