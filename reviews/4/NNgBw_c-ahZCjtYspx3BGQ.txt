I am one of those ethnic food party poopers who does not want heat in my food seasoning wise-hot spice deadens the taste buds while feeling the burn and i like to taste the nuances in food.  The lobster enchiladas were good but could not be ordered without the heat as they are delivered premade each day. Lobster is not a strong flavor so the heat really masked the seafood's flavor.  The rice and beans accompaniment were also great. Friend in our group raved about the marguerita. will return next time I am in the Phoenix area.
almost forgot-great outdoor seating beside a pondlike water structure.
