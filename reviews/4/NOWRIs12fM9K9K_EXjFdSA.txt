My family goes out for family dinner every Sunday. Always looking for someplace new. So I thought we'd try FOGON. I had the raspberry ginger margarita. It was delicious. My husband got one after he tasted mine. I ordered the chile relleno. It was sooo good. My son and husband ordered the steak fajitas and shrimp fajitas. Very flavorful. The table side (made in the kitchen) was spicy and creamy.  My son ordered a chicken quesadilla as an appetizer and since it didn't come out till our entrees did our waitress took it off the bill. That was very kind. I only gave 4 stars because the service was pretty slow.  We will go back again and hopefully it will be better.   We enjoyed sitting on the patio...now that our weather is nice!
