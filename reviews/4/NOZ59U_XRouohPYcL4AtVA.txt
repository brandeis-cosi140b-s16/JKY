a valley staple for hardcore mexican food lovers.  everything is HOT.  even the rice is spicy.  you will need chapstick, deodorant, a hankie to wipe the sweat from your brow, and a full box of pepcid a-c or zantac.  be prepared to wait a long time during peak hours....but God it is worth it.  everything is incredibly flavorful and super spicy hot.  service is spotty...but who cares!   this is a supreme mexican food destination.
