I am so glad I discovered this place last night. They have very good traditional-style tacos with great late-night specials, and there is a toppings bar so you can dress up your tacos any way you want. The employees are super friendly and even with a line, the wait for your food doesn't take long. The venue is very simple but the food so I wouldn't come here on a special occasion, but if you are just looking for some good, cheap tacos, this is your spot.
