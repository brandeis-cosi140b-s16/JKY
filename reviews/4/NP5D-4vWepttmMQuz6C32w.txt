Good food! Had the fish tacos and they were pretty awesome. Salad on the side was fresh. Drinks, awesome except for the fact that for a Mexican place I'd say they should have more than one random Mexican beer on tap. Waitress... Umm... In general the staff was below standard and quite interesting but service was at standard at least. I'll be back next time I'm here!
