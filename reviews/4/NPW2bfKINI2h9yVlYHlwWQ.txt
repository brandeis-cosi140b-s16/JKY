We have enjoyed this restaurant for many  years. Tonight we had great service, our waitress Maria recommended the enchilada sampler and it was great. However, one of our favorite things is the chips and salsa. I noticed that the spicier sauce seemed watered down, and it had no consistency to it. I advised the bus person of this, and he agreed with me. He stated that other customers have complained as well, and that all of the salsa in the restaurant was the same way.
