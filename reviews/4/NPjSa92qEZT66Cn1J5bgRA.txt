Stopped in for a quick dinner with the family tonight.  Made fresh right in front of you with meat and toppings that you chose.  You can get tacos, burritos, salads or burrito bowls.  Much bigger portion sizes that many of the other similar places.  They had a special with $2 tacos and $2 beers.  We will definitely return.  Nice, new facility.
