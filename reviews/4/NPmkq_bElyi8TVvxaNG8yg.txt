So I was a little skeptical about the place when we decide to go in. I'm so glad I went in! I had the Carne Asada Torta and it was great. I prefer the authentic Mexican places and this one hit the spot. They have a good salsa bar so you can pick from several salsas. The price is very reasonable. I can't wait to go back.
