My favorite tacos are "intestine and tongue." I love organ meat and this is the place that satisfies my craving anytime of the day/night. They offer any type of meat, from pork to beef. Don't ask for chicken because it does not exist on the menu. Prepare to stand in line and bring someone to save you a table, or you will end up eating in your car. It's worth the wait, for authentic Mexican tacos, though.
