My mother took me here a while back and I finally wanted to write a review. Rio mirage, both locations, has really good Mexican food. My favorite thing on (or maybe off) the menu is the flaming Toritos. That's what you want to come for. On another note, I think it's really tired and old to age bash residents of sun city and sun city west. Show some respect.  What are you people?  15 years old?
