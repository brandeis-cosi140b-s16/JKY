Love Gadzooks!! This is one of my favorite neighborhood joints :) I love their white wine sangria...I'm not sure if it's always available, but if you see it then you must try it! You will not be disappointed! Lines can get a little long, since everything is made to order. However, it is definitely worth the wait!
