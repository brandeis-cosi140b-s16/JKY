Mmmmmmm...yummy!

I found this place when I went out on a blah date with someone I met online. Fortunately, this food is far from blah! I now have a new love, sorry guy!

This is as authentic as I believe I've tasted in awhile. The pico de gallo, the bean dip, the different spiciness each different dip has (I believe there were 3). So delicious! I like my chips very light, not so dense, but when you need to dip that bean dip these are the only things that will do it. 

I ordered a combo plate of bean tostada and cheese enchilada with a side of rice and beans along with a side of guac. 

The guac hit my mouth with just the right amount of cold, spicy, fresh and chunky! I loved it and I wish I'd gotten a bigger one. Delicious!

The enchilada was without a doubt the best I've ever eaten anywhere. It wasn't overly cheesy, or saucy, it was mild enough, yet flavorful enough and when you cut into it with a fork it just had the right amount of cheesy filling. It was the best thing ever. 

The tostada had a very crunchy, thick shell. Again, l happen to like my tostadas a little lighter, but you can't beat the beans, the very crisp lettuce and the just perfectly ripened tomatoes. It was heaven!

The service is a little slow, but the people are super friendly and the prices can be a little high (I don't like to pay $11 for that much food, but hey...), but the atmosphere is nice, the restaurant is super clean and the food, of course, is DELICIOUS!

New favorite, hands down!
