Go here.  Best Mexican for miles around.

I'm a strange breed and, as a Native, love Mexican food of all shapes and sizes.  From greasy, gut rot Bertos, to central Mexico and New Mexican authentic, to high class more fancy Mex in Scottsdale. I love all types of regional Mexican fare.

This place sits nicely in the middle of grease and Scottsdale.  No drive through but you do order from a counter.  The nice part is that if you eat in, your food comes on a actual plate and the guy behind the counter will actually bring it to you with real silverware.

Been here a few time and each time was very good, and cheap to boot.  I recommend the Caminero burro.  Solid beans and salsa too.

Just a nice little family owned spot with a menu similar to most Mexican places with the assortment of burros, enchiladas and tacos.  They just do it a little better here than most places and certainly WAY BETTER than the ripoff, joke of a Mexican restaurant across the street, Top Shelf.

Laugh as you leave and look across the street at Top Shelf.  You'll $20 richer and a good bit happier than if you went there
