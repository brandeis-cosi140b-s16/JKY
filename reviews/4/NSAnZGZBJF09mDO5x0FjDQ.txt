fast & friendly, english-speaking. food ordered was food delivered to the table. free refills. what you demand at a fast food place. average service. just make it fresh & get it right!!! they did good
the carne asada was very good. tender & spiced just right. everything was hot & fresh. could've used a little more cilantro & onions but they are 2-bite tacos. excellent value for the $$
