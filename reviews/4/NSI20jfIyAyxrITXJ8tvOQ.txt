First time at Rubio's and we were so impressed! Love the fish tacos concept. We ordered every single fish taco on the menu along with their shrimp taco and burritos. I like my fish seasoned with their blackened seasoning. My boyfriend thought the burritos were good but a bit too heavy.

If you want something light and refreshing, go their their fish tacos! We even recommended this place to a few friends already!
