I like this location. The staff is always warm and inviting and get to know regulars. I think the food quality and selection are better than Chipotle and at a greater value. Would give 5 stars, but they are not a full service restaurant with table side service, so would be unfair to the hardworking wait staff of those types of establishments. Try it! I am sure you will like it too!
