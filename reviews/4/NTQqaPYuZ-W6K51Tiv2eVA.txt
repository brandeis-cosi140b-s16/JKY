What a great place for lunch. Service is fast and efficient. We loved the hot salsa, so spicy. Would definitely bring a group here. Food was delicious. Dirty Martini made pretty good for being a Margarita type restaurant. 
The beans taste homemade and not from a can. Homemade tamales are delicious. Going to take a dozen home with me! Will be back.
