We used these guys to cater street tacos for our daughter's 1yo birthday party.
If you have an upcoming event and need awesome food and great service at a great price, use Taqueria Guadalajara.  These are legit street tacos.
   Hector was my contact person, and he was very accomodating and professional. We ended up increasing the guest list significantly near the party, and it was no problem. 4 types of meat are included - went with carne asada, chicken, chorizo, and al pastor (pork). All four were good, but the consensus was that the al pastor was the best. 
   David came out to our house and set up about an hour before food was to be served. He started grilling, and set out the vegetable bar, which was huge. There were pickled onions, carrots/jalapeno, some sort of slaw, lettuce, pico de gallo, onions, and green and red salsas. David was extremely courteous, and stayed to serve until the last person was done eating - in 100 degree heat outside. Cleanup was great, you wouldn't even know they were there. 
  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because David did leave a "Tips" box out on the table. My feeling is that at a catered party, it is the host's responsibility to tip for good service. Expecting the guests to tip is a little awkward. Just my opinion, but not a huge deal. 
Would use them again in a heartbeat, as will many of my guests.
