My husband and I came in for some good Mexican food and we were not disappointed. He ordered the red chile beef enchiladas and I their red chile burrito. The portions were huge. Their prices are reasonable but depending on what you order can add up quickly. I also recommend their Nachos which are enough to feed three people easily.
