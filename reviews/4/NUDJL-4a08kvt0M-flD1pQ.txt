I was a little hesitant to try this place, as it hasn't really been reviewed well. However, I'm glad I trusted my gut (not the hungry part, the sensible part)!

When I walked in, the dining room was absolutely packed! Obviously, it's a popular destination. So, I took a minute to see what looked best to me. After a few minutes perusing their menu, I opted for the Shrimp Burrito. The young lady behind the counter informed me that it would take about five minutes for my order to be ready. So, I took my drink to the dining room and waited.

As I was waiting, I passed by their full bar. I wasn't really in the market for an alcoholic beverage during lunch, so I didn't really price anything. The fact that this bar exists, though...that's the important thing! The self-serve chips and salsa bar was really cool! It's similar to ones that you would find at Baja Fresh, except for the endless chips. That's a pretty nice touch, in my opinion.

After about five minutes (a touch longer, but I wasn't in a hurry), my burrito was ready. Size wise, my burrito was comparable to ones that you find at Chipotle or Qdoba. However, the difference maker for me was the actual content. I made sure to pay extra close attention to the amount of shrimp contained in my burrito. I've been burned at places before when they skimped on contents. Not here. EVERY single bite I took was accompanied by a full shrimp...and I don't take small bites. For $8.85, I was definitely impressed. 

If you're in the market for a sort of change of pace with regards to your Mexican food, you should check out Blue Burrito Grille. If you need more incentive, they do have a couple of televisions, free Wi-Fi, and a nice patio. The patio is covered by umbrellas, but it doesn't have misters or anything like that. So, if you want to sit outside, make sure you get in on the action before it gets hot!
