First Yelp review....hopefully this inspires the whole city to try this new taco spot!

Garnachas just opened, and that is apparent in how clean and organized this place is.  They have a bar and a restaurant which is cool, a cold Dos Equis and tacos is always close to perfect.  Along with a perfect location on Valley View in between Sahara and Desert Inn, this place is destined for success. 

So I walk in the bar entrance and was immediately greeted by the owner.  Dude was cool without putting on his "welcome new customer" spiel.  He shows me the menu board and explains my options. I decide to get 4 different tacos (pastor, carnitas, chicken and braised beef") along with rice and beans.  Bottled Coke is an automatic! Garnachas does the line different than El Gordo or Taco Y Taco.... Its more assembly line which allows you to "build your own" on top of your taco. Service was fast and friendly.  All of the tacos were hot and moist and had a ton of flavor.  Topped with Jalape√±o salsa, i could've eaten more than the 4 but I showed restraint.  The only thing I would change would be the rice, it was kinda of plain and just hasn't as good as it should be.  The owner thanked me for the comment and said was going to have 2 different kinds of upgraded rice very soon.  

4 tacos, rice and beans and a bottled Coke was $12 bucks.  Leaving full and satisfied.  Free chips and salsa bar is also a nice touch.  Keep up the good work, I will be a regular for sure!!!
