Again I always rate a Mexican Restaurant on these few things.

1.)  Are their Refried Beans homemade and do they taste good?
2.)  Salsa taste?  Are their tortilla chips homemade and are they light, airy, and fluffy?
3.)  Chimichanga taste and how large is their food portions?
4.)  Large Portion size of amount of food given especially in comparable to their prices?
5.)  Chili Rellenos any good?

I have gown up around Matta's my whole life.  It first started down by the Mesa Temple before these fast food chains from their kids began.  So here it goes!

Their refried beans are passable.  They do taste homemade but flavor could use a punch!  Not the best I have tasted but surely not the worst.

Their Salsa tastes great!  Chunky type of salsa and good!  Chips are pretty fluffy.

Their Chimichanga with shredded beef or chicken is AMAZING!!  One thing you have to try is their special recipe of sour cream!  Get it as a side for the Chimi and you won't be disappointed!  

They definitely have large portion sizes!  Great for the Chimichanga!

Their Chili Rellenos used to be better.  At the family owned Mesa location they used to have, their Chili Rellenos were incredible.  Now flavor has suffered.  Somewhat bland and not as large in portion size. 

As far as their enchiladas, nothing special in taste or portion size.  Also their cheese crisp.  There is nothing crispy about it.  Doused in melted cheese may sound nice but it's not when all your eating a big glob of GOOP!  Disgusting!  Check the picture out!  Lots of cheese is nice but you still need that buttery taste and a little crunch.

So best things here are the Salsa, Chimichanga any way you want it, and their special sour cream (I could take this home in the bucket fulls)!
