This is a good road trip. Actually, one of the primary reasons people visit Tortilla Flat is that the winding Apache Trail can potentially be a really fun road to take your sports car or motorcycle for a ride, and it's the last place to stop before the pavement ends. You can also find yourself stuck behind a slow truck with a boat trailer for 20 miles, so don't get your hopes up.

The food in the saloon is your basic pub grub (burgers, sandwiches, tacos). It was pretty good, and priced better than one would expect for a tourist trap. The general store is famous for it's prickly pear ice cream, which I'll leave to some other reviewer to describe (the mint chocolate chip was good). There's also an interesting little museum next door, about the size of a garden shed, with a little history of Tortilla Flat as a stagecoach stop.

It's worth checking out.
