I visited this place for dinner with family and upon checking in I was told we would be seated soon. There were plenty of free tables and didn't quiet understand why there was more than a 20 min delay to be seated...when I went back to desk to see what happened I was told we were next in line?? We were seated right after and then it took about 5 min to finally receive a menu. I ordered the combo fajitas and was blown away!!! Delish! The chicken and shrimp was my fave...my steak had took much fat so I was not a huge fan of steak but overall it was delish. I also tried the 3 different spicy sauces they have..and they are all spicy and yummy. Will definitely come back...but they need to work on better customer service.
