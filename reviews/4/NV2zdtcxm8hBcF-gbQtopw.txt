Fellow hikers and I stopped at Elvira's Mexican Food on a recent Saturday after a hike up Gold Canyon to see the petroglyphs. Mexican is one of my favorite food groups, so I won't say "no" to trying a new place! (And certainly not after just having torched 1,019 calories hiking before lunch...)

We arrived right around lunch time and were quickly accommodated with tables and chairs pulled together for our group. The interior decor is very bright and colorful; we found ourselves looking around at all the different art. 

I ordered the green chile beef chimichanga with double rice (no beans). The green chile gave it a different taste than I'm used to, but it was really good. The added guacamole and sour cream made for a perfect combination. The chips and salsa were excellent too. 

The restrooms are one-holers, so if you have a group who, say, just came from hiking Gold Canyon and say, all have to go the bathroom, well...make sure you get in the door first. 

We had great service, and it wasn't too crowded on a Saturday for lunch. I recommend this place!
