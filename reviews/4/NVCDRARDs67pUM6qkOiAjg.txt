Great service and atmosphere. Spicy margarita pitcher did not disappoint.

Amazing queso topped with pickled jalepeno, my first time trying pickled jalepeno and it's now a favorite. 

Could be satisfied with the chips and guac/queso alone, but couldn't leave without trying some tacos. Tacos were good but chips and fresh dips/salsas were the highlight.
