As far as I know this is one of the nearest Chipotles to downtown phoenix, so it tends to get extremely busy during the lunch rush. Some days it can be hard to find parking because of all the The God Delusion thumping rationalists who like to show up and scream at the top of their lungs that Chipotle is destroying the world because they choose to not use GMO ingredients.

I kid.

It can be hard to find parking nearly every day because the parking lot is very small and services multiple eateries. All those rationalists I mentioned are nowhere to be found because they would rather place an online order than be near non-Internet people for more than a minute.

Which leads me to why this isn't a five star review.

During that lunch rush I mentioned they WILL fulfill online/phone orders at the most inconvenient times. Worst of all, they WON'T tell those scared junior associates who come stumbling in right at noon, lanyards swaying to and fro, with a page full of convoluted office orders, to scram. Chipotle has a very efficient system in place but when the line is out the door yet there is only one customer at the glass it only takes a moment of focus to figure out which hand they're holding that small wrinkly sheet of paper that was obviously passed around the office. If your vision is good enough you can even read details like "be sure to ask three times if the chicken is fresh" "if the burrito isn't wrapped perfectly make them do it again" and "call me at this number I never answer if the company card is declined"
