Great food! Had a huge burrito here with everything in it! We came here last weekend, enjoyed our time and food.
The only thing that threw me off a bit was the DJ. He was so loud it was hard for me to order my food. Entertaining of course, but loud.
Other than that, I recommend this place to anyone whose looking to eat fresh food and good drinks on a budget. :)
