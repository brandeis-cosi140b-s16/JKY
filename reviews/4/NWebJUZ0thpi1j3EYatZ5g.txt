The amount of random taco shops in Vegas is quite daunting. Usually the shredded beef is a safe bet on an initial visit because it might not always be the best, but there is less of a chance of fatty meat appearing than say the Carne Asada. Anyway, i ordered three $1.25 tacos of that beef and this was actually really flavorful stuff loaded onto double corn tortillas and grilled with a few peppers and tomatoes (unusual). There was no sauce on top, but cilantro and chopped onions topped off the tacos. They really put alot of beef on them and three will last you awhile especially if you load up on the cold radishes (not green either) and the kinda spicy carrots. Red and green salsa were traditional. Almost five stars, but the walls were kinda dirty next to my booth. Still a great lunch for 4 bucks.
