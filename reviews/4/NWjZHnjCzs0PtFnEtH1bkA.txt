Pleasantly surprised here compared to yelp expectations.  Very good prices/value, very good happy hour hours (till 8), and good service (Thursday night).  Place felt like a bar overall but plenty of families in the seating area.  Food quality was good, especially queso & chips (with free queso refill).  $3.50 margarita was exceptional for that price.
