The bf and I wanted Dick's Hideaway for breakfast, and were not particular about which location we ate off the menu from. For some reason. we just didn't feel like being cramped in the location next to Luci's today.
Very glad we tried the Rokerij! It was not busy for breakfast, so we got a giant comfy booth to ourselves. It was nice and dark inside which we like! 

The service was fine. We had Ryno today, and he was outgoing, spoke about a few menu items, and generally came back in a reasonable amount of time. 

I decided to try something different, and got the dungeness crab omelet featured on the blackboard. It was a generous amount of crab, peppers and onions, paired with the standard tortilla, potatoes and beans.  Not something I'd order on a regular basis, but this whole place is a bit of an adventure and the crab omelet really hit the spot.
He got the meatloaf and eggs, mmm spicy!! You have to ask for ketchup for your potatoes, and we were only brought one ramekin, but that's okay. It sufficed.

We don't really care for free valet as we are fully capable of parking our own car, but at least when we walked out, they brought our car immediately.

Overall, not enough for the 5th star, but it's worth the drive for something different. We are dying to come back for lunch sometime and try that Pasta Heidi or Chimayo Chicken! 
I could find the back door and restrooms here, too. The ladies' room was clean with interesting artwork on the wall. This is silly, but I loved that they had the nice soft paper towels. Maybe that's why the menu prices are so high lol.
