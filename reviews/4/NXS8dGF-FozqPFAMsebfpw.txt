Came here for lunch. Friendly service. Tried the CC Sizzle sopaipilla. Yum! The fry bread is good, I even liked the beans - I usually don't eat them. The cabbage on top adds a bit of sweetness. 
Friend liked the green chile sauce on hers. 
Good deal, wish the soda machine worked!

Its a cool family run place - try it!
