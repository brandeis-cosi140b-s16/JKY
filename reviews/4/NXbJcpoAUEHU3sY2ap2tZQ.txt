Poor blind pig, ended up in a butcher case! Now I didn't get the chance to order up some of that pig, but I did have a great order of Carne Asada Tacos! Now there isn't much to a carne asada taco, but mess up one or two of these ingredients and I'm out. Number 1 and my most important ingredient is the meat. The Blind Pig seasoned the meat perfectly and grilled to perfection. Meat wasn't dry and trimmed of all fat. Number 2 is the tortilla, has to be homemade or from a local tortillaria. The tortilla was from one of those. Soft corn tortillas that didn't break and had some flavor to them. The rest of the ingredients just need to be fresh. Make sure you get the chips and salsa. Once again made there or somewhere in town. Looking forward to going back to The Blind Pig and trying some of the other refrigerated animals in the butcher case!!
