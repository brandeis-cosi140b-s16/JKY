When I'm an out-of-towner, I certainly go with what the locals have to recommend and if you want cheap quick Mexican food they said to go to Casa Grande.  So we did.  10 of us were quickly and easily seated.  Not all of us arrived at the same time and the staff had no problem with that.  

There were two kinds of salsa: one more fresca and the other your typical saucy kind.  I sipped up the smooth salsa and chomped away on chips and cheese dip.  Our orders were taken quickly and drinks came out promptly.  The sodas were flat and that was fixed immediately, but my beer came out with a nice chilled glass so I was content.  My lunch Speedy Gonzalez (taco, enchilada and rice or beans) was only $3.75!  In no time our food came out and there was not a single error on the food orders, which is impressive to me when you've got 10 orders and everything is so fast.  Everyone was full and most plates were cleaned although I couldn't finish the taco or the beans.  Flavor was somewhat lacking, but it was sufficient.  

I'd go back again because of the service and ease with which we were taken care of in addition to those great prices.  Great lunch!
