This is a new location for Cafe Rio. I have been a die hard fan since it opened up years ago in Gilbert off Baseline and Gilbert Rd. It is really busy so best not be starving as it will put you in a funk real quick. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the food and my fav are their salads and house dressings. Both the dressings are delish!
Now with this new location.. the parking sucks due to having way too many businesses jammed in one area. And their service line has not been fine tuned yet. They will eventually get it. My only complaint really is they are typically slammed (because the food is freaking delish!) and it takes some time to get through the line. But worth it at the end. No problems with the workers there either. They seem to be friendly.
