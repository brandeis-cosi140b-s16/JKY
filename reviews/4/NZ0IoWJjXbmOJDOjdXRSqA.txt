My moms obsessed w this place and eats it all the time. today I tried their steak fajitas. It came w red and yellow sliced bell pepper, white onion, Spanish rice and pinto beans(melted white cheese on top) on the side. It was very good along w their guacamole. Only thing I didn't really like was their dark green salsa. It was a darker hotter salsa I've never tasted before. Idk if it spilled but it seems like that's what they put on the steak and it was just a little much. Next time I'll ask for it w/o.
