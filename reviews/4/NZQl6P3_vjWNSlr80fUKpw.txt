An awesome independent family own taco place! 
I went there on my way to Hoover dam and ate like a hungry bear.
I had chicken, fish and beef tacos, not much of fish cos it was fried instead of sauteed, chicken and beef are very flavorful! I love the green tomato and roasted veg sauces by the condiment counter.
It's got family style atmosphere, large enough to accomodate groups, the lady work behind the counter was very friendly and the place was really clean!
