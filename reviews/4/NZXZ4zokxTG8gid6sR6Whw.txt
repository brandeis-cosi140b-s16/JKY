I have been to this Taco Del Mar once before and went again this weekend, so I felt it was time for a review.

First of all, TDM is a great middle ground between Taco Bell and Chipotle. Its quick and easy, and they have a wide variety of options.

This particular location is pretty cool. The decor inside is fun and it has been very clean both times I have been.

They have veggie options and use lard free beans. I always get the veggie mondo burro and have not been disappointed at all. They are a great size with great flavor.

Another cool thing they have is an iced tea machine. You can select four different tea flavors from the machine, including green tea. They also have a little salsa bar with a few different salsa options and jalapenos.
