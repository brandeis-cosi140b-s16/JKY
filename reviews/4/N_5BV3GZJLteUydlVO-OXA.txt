I really dig this little (literally) spot. Don't let the surroundings wig you out. Three Amigos is on point. Check out their awesome *giant* margarita specials on Friday. Are you a hot head? Ask them for their extra spicy green salsa. So good! Expect a wait during busy times but it is well worth it!
