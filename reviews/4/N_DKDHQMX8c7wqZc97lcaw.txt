This place is good.  It's a little joint that you get in line to order, walk around the corner to pick up, and pay after you eat.  
I ordered the 3 tacos so I could sample their selections.  I got one fish, one carnitas, and one carne asada.  The fish was good, the carnitas was better, and the carne asada was just ok.  
You can pick the toppings, the sides, the meat and the tortilla. They have a soda fountain, bottle and canned drinks.... and I even some some beer selections. 
This is very casual quick grab some lunch kind of place, but the food was good and the staff friendly. If I'm hungry on this side of town again, I will come try some of the other meats. Who am I kidding....I'm always hungry!
