On our final day we decided to grab lunch here before heading to the airport. We were staying at the Monte Carlo so it was convenient and they had a nice open air view off of the bar where we could take in the last bit of time we had in Vegas.

If your table is going to have 3 margarita's then opt for the pitcher for the same price of what those 3 margarita's will cost...the pitcher produces about 5 full margarita's. Great value compared to the high prices we had been paying all over the strip during our trip. 

We started with chips and salsa which was ok. The salsa had a good flavor, the chips weren't homemade but not terrible.

I ordered the Mexicali combo and my husband the stuffed quesadilla. They were both very good, served fresh and hot. 

Will definitely come back and if you're staying at the Monte Carlo and want a place to sit and have a drink while people watching with a view of the strip this is a MUCH better choice than their other strip view restaurant called Double Barrel.
