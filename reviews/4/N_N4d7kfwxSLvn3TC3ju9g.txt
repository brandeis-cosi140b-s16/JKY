I thought this restaurant was good.  It is ran by an older couple who have owned the place for years.  The inside is small (only 3 tables) and you order your food at the counter and you pick up the food at the counter.  The food was tasty and I was surprised how it wasn't that greasy at all.

This place is better than most places in the area as long as you aren't looking to have a waiter or waitress.
