I'm here to talk dessert ...The Mini Chimi...was good! They have these little rolls stuffed with chocolate sauce. The rolls are a little harder than crepes. They sit on top of whipped cream and vanilla ice cream. It is served in like a tostada shell..I tried to dip the shell in ice cream but it tasted kind of awkward. They should maybe serve it in a waffle bowl instead. Overall it was a nice treat and it's big enough to share!
