always wanted to review this place but I usually stay away from chains..  I do have to comment that their marinated grilled chicken is some of the finest I have had.  I recently had their new BBQ chicken and well that was great too.

I dont really see the point in reviewing too many fast food joints but El Pollo Loco is special.  

Sometimes I have seen people get pissed with the service because they think it is a fast food joint and it takes a while sometimes for the food to cook.  People need to just stand back and relax.  It is worth the wait, although sometimes the place is understaffed.

I love the crazy chicken.
