Great fast clean taco shop!

I have been coming here for years when I just want greasy carbs! They are always fast, to the the point and very delicious!

Sometimes it does get crowded but the wait is never too long. Everyone in the neighborhood is a fan I swear! 

Much much better than any Filiberto's!! Or any bertos' !!
