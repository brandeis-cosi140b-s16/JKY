This is my favorite place for late night munchies. Ok, so it's probably not the highest quality food out there, but it sure beats McDonald's and definitely hits the spot! My favorite meals here are the Carne Asada Chimichanga and the Carne Asada burrito. A lot of people like the Arizona versions, but I'm not a big fan of fries in my burritos.
