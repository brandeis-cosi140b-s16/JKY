I've never once been disappointed with the food here. Yo Rita is a place you don't expect to find in Pittsburgh, it seems like more of a Chicago type of joint. 

Reading some old reviews it seems people were upset with portion size and pricing, if you haven't been here in a while you need to give it another try. I've never left without being uncomfortably full of delicious food at a fair price. (And I also saw people complaining about parking...this isn't Manhattan it's not that hard to find parking. You just might have to (gasp!) walk a block or two. I guarantee you'll survive. 

Now for the FOOD - you start off with free chips and salsa. One is a milder salsa and the other is just a touch spicy. The chips are warm and delicious, beware that you could easily ruin your appetite as you get free refills on the chips. 

DRINKS - I've had a margarita here a few times and they were good if you're into that. I'm more of a beer drinker and they have some beers on tap as well as Modelo, Tecate, Corona etc. 

TACOS - I've never had a taco I didn't like here. They change up their menu now and again but always have a few that stay. The Santa Cruz is great and so is the BBQ Chicken for people not willing to venture out to their more exotic choices. I've always found that two tacos is more than enough for me and usually females are completely full after one taco. The prices run from $6-$9 usually, but as I mentioned two is more than enough. 

The space is a bit small so blast of cold air from the door can be a bit uncomfortable depending on which table you sit at, but they usually keep the heat up pretty high to combat that so it's not such a big deal.
