Some of the best fast food baja available in the Phoenix area.  For the price, it's hard to beat this place.

This location has received awards for outstanding service and more.  The owner and regular employees tend to learn people's names over time, and it's a great little atmosphere for enjoying affordable, tasty food.

Great location right off the 101.
