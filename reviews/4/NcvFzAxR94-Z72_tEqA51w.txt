Great atmosphere and good patio.  Open late which is a plus in North Scottsdale.  The tortilla soup was perfect,  broth base and full of flavor. If you do not like raw onions I suggest you ask for them on the side or a lighter amount added. Carne Asada tacos were good too. Only reason I gave 4 stars is because I lived in Texas for a while so nothing lives up to TexMex! #biased
