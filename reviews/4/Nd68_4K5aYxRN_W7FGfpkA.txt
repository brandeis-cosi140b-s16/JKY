Shockingly good, better than it has to be. 

Chicken fajitas was seasoned well, fresh veggies, etc. Tortillas fresh, flaky. My dad had a burrito, fresh, not oily.

This doesn't seem like "authentic" Mexican food to me... in LA, it's all over the place but "authentic" Mexican food sometimes is a sloppy/greasy mess where all the flavors run into each other.  Not here.  Everything is distinct.

Also, the service was great... totally attentive, a waiter and a 'helper' refilling drinks.  Sometimes, a third person would jump in.  My cup literally was never less than half full.

What a pleasant surprise.
