Seriously ono!  It's like a Hawaiian Chipotle.  Bowls, tacos, burritos and salads pack a serious aloha punch to your tasty buds.  The meat/vegetarian choices include huli huli chicken, kalua pig, pulehu steak, grilled fish, or veggies.  My personal favorite is the grilled fish, which is packed full of flavor despite the nondescript name.  Now here is where it gets interesting, you get to choose one of their yummy salsas to top your creation.  Their current salsa list includes charred pineapple verde (mild), mango/roasted corn (med), or tomato/grilled maui onions (spicy).  My favorite is the tomato/onions salsa, however I wouldn't call it spicy by a long shot.  All of the other standard toppings are available, such as cheese, sour cream, lettuce, beans, etc.  They also offer jalapenos, which is a nice surprise!

My only complaint is their rice, it's quite dense and heavy.  I wish they offered a choice of something fluffier.

If you're not too full, you must grab some of the coconut bark dessert.  Screw it, even if you are full just grab some for later.  Be warned my friends, this stuff is more addictive than crack!

Braddah's often runs Groupon and/or yelp deals, so check both before you go to save a few bucks.
