Tamales sounded like a perfect late-morning breakfast as we wandered through the Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market. The list of frozen tamales for purchase at the Tamale Store stand was impressively long, with meat and vegetarian options. The hot, ready-to-eat choices included chipotle chicken and mushroom with cream cheese. 

The chicken tamal(e) was my favorite, with large pieces of meat and a smoky sauce tucked inside the moist masa. The mushroom one was also good, but not as flavorful. Considering how time-consuming it is to make tamales (my sister-in-law spends hours on them), if there were a Tamale Store in my town, I'd definitely be a regular.
