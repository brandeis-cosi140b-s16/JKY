This restaurant is my 2nd fav Mexican restaurant in the valley, mostly due to Tacos al Pastor and other authentic dishes, which cannot be found at many places these days...

Service is usually decent, salsa is usually good, although it's different every time I've gone as it's probably made fresh.  Huge drink menu for mixed drinks (not a fan of margaritas)

Lately they have advertised Sat night dancing but have not attended this.  However, I have been there for live music, and the one-man performer is great.  He usually plays a mix of oldies, pop, and latin on keyboard almost like a Vegas lounge act.  Creates a nice date atmosphere.  

Decent casual atmosphere.  Would go there more if it were closer, and was very disappointed when the W. Bell Rd location closed several months ago.
