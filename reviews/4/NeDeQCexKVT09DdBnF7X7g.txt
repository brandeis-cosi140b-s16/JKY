First time checking the place out since the remodel and name change. It's still the same food (although the chips are different -- but still good). I usually go for the carne asada burrito which is great but today I tried the mahi mahi rice bowl which was great! It came with tortillas on the side but the bowl itself was plenty of food. My colleague went for her usual bean, cheese, and rice burrito (she's a veg) and said it was just as good as it had been. She also enjoyed their strawberry lemonade. The atmosphere is much better than the old space and there's much more room for dining in. It used to be all counter service -- the takeout counter is still there but it's now evolved into full service dining. Bar in the middle of the restaurant and I thought the lighting fixtures were cool! I want to go back for happy hour.
