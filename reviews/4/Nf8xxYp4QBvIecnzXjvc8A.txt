Beer battered fish tacos for the win! These are amazing but sometimes overly fried, though the fish itself is always tender and moist. Add some salsa for more flavor. it is a bit on the expensive side for simple fried fish tacos. I would also consider trying the burritos that can be fish burritos, shrimp burritos, or LOBSTER BURRITOS which are all amazing. 

Regardless of what you get, 2 tacos, or burrito that comes w/ chips, I guarantee you will be full!
