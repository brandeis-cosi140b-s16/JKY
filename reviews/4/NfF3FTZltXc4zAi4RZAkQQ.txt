Ok, so don't go here if you plan on being "dainty" or if you don't want your skirt to get dirty.  BUT, if you just want gooooood food and don't mind the blaring tex-mex polka music on the juke box....Taco's Mexico is the place.  Its AUTHENTIC Mexican food.  Say it with me people, AWWTHENTIC.  No, you won't get del taco or taco bell crap here.  
There is a wide variety of meats to choose from.  Stick with the carnitas, carne asada, or al pastor.  But if you're adventurous, try the sesos, cabeza or lengua. To me, its YUCK (and I'm hispanic). 
The tacos are made on little round corn tortillas, with just meat, onions, cilantro and hot sauce.  Make sure you order plenty (4 at least) cuz they are small.  
The burritos, however, are GINORMUS.  They pile on the meat, cheese, beans, rice, and salsa - or you can customize them any way you want..  HOLY CRAP.  Their menu has more on it than just tacos and burritos.  I recommend you try the sopes or the tortas (sandwiches).

BONUS: this place is CHEAP.  And take a Spanish speaking buddy.  They will treat you better if you speak the language. - see TIP below.

TIP: however, don't try to speak Spanish if you don't know how.  Believe me, they will respect you more if you're just a gringo with good taste in food.
