This place should be far busier at dinner than it is. The flour tortillas for the tacos are simply awesome, and the filling is good too. The rice left my husband totally satisfied. And the churros. Get the churros. Seriously. All for a really reasonable price of $10-15 a plate. The drink was weak and the atmosphere was lacking, but overall a really pleasant experience. The food isn't unique and creative-- but they master the basics.
