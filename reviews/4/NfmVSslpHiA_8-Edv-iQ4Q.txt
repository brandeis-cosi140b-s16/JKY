Plaza Bonita definitely surprised me, I had read the reviews here on yelp but even then I had my doubts. Its a very intimate setting, it reminds me of being in Mexico. The staff are very friendly, they call you Amigo which I thought was funny. The staff could be a bit more organized we couldn't find our waiter for a good 15 minutes. Besides all that the food is phenomenal!!! I ordered the Pollo Fundido and Jack got the Steak Fajitas, the food came out steaming hot! We had to wait a few minutes to eat it, it was so hot lol. The Pollo Fundido was creamy, and the chicken perfectly cooked not dry at all, the Steak Fajitas were bomb, the steak wasn't chewy or over spiced, and the tortillas were perfect. Oh and their guacamole is made in house and its beyond tastey. I definitely will be coming back to Plaza Bonita in the near future, be sure to order a side of ranch with the tortilla chips. I know it sounds weird but its super good to dip the chips in. As for their margaritas WOW! Felt like I was back in Rocky Point on the beach! Strong but good and very decent priced. :) Got a nice buzz off of one!
