"If you buy a cha cha mug, you know it is refillable for cheap?" SCORE! I have my mug in my car just in case I happen to go to another Macayo's just so that I if I happen to go to one, I know my drink will be around $3.99 tops lol. The chips and salsa are always hot and fresh. The service was great and the food has never disappointed. Our bartender was great and made sure to check on us often and kept our drinks refilled.. alot. I will definitely visit this location when I come back to the West side to visit friends!
