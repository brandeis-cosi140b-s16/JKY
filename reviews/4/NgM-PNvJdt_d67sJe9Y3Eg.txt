Wow I'm ecstatic this Hawaiian style Chipotle is near my gym....eeeeeeek hope my coach isn't reading this. :)

Burritos, bowls, tacos, etc.  They are on the corner of Rainbow/Sahara next to McDonalds.  When we walked in they greeted us with Aloha, asked if we have been here and started to serve us up some samples to help us decide which meat we wanted.  So nice to taste before we order.  I like that their ingredients are not salty compared to Chipotle, very simply flavored, BBQ style, not drenched in oil.  

I chose the Pulehu Steak Burrito pretty much the whole shabang.  Let me tell you, the buggah was mEEEEaaaaan.  After my hard work at the gym, then feeding my empty belly, you had one satisfied girl. 

PS Coconut Bark is on point, don't you dare walk out of this place not tasting it.  The delicious chocolate topped with coconut in between a layor of some kind of breading and bottomed off what tastes like salted caramal...Mmmm hmmmm, it was that good.
