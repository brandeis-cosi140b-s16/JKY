This has got to be my favorite Chipotle in town. The employees are super friendly. They say hi and bye to customers (except when they are slammed). They actually look happy to be there, which is nice because I don't want grumpy people prepping my food. They aren't skimpy on the ingredients either. This is the only Chipotle that gives me more rice (I hate beans) without me having to ask. The place is clean and in a nice area. Only thing that sucks about this location is that it's in a small plaza with Buffalo Wild Wings and Jamba Juice, so parking is a pain in the a$$ sometimes. Otherwise I'm a fan:)
