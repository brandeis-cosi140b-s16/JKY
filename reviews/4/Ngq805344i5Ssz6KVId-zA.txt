I do like a good torta. Currently, in my book the king of tortas in Phoenix is Gallo Blanco. However, sometimes I don't want such a fine dining experience. There are days when I want quick and cheap; and when I want a quick, cheap, and good torta, there's one place that has not let me down: Tortas Paquimé.

As a biographical aside, I actually visited Paquimé, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua back in the spring of 1995. My first torta was prepared by a Tarahumaran Indian over a wood fire at Copper Canyon nearby there.  But I digress...

A buddy of mine who is originally from Ciudad Chihuahua turned me on to Tortas Paquimé when I asked him what he thought was a good, authentic torta place in the Valley. He noted, and I must agree, that the fact that they bake their own bread on-site makes all the difference.  I've had a few of their numerous tortas, and have not had a bad one.  Nor have I heard any of my co-workers who have accompanied me there complain.

The place is spotlessly clean. In fact, the cleanliness and order there is a little jarring at first visit. The staff is very nice, and completely bilingual. And the tortas are not only good, but they are also pretty cheap. All in all, this is delicious food at a great value in a clean, friendly place.
