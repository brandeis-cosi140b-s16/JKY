Good stuff. I've eaten at Rosa's on University for a couple of decades and the "old" Tia Rosa's as well. I'm quite happy with this change to new ownership - same great food (fish tacos! hooray!) and the best beans I've ever had. Seriously. Perfect. Beans. OMG.

We went there mid-week and did have to wait about 15 minutes to be seated - but the hostess was super polite (BIG change from the previous ownership - so rude we stopped going to this location) and explained that it was because they didn't want to slam the wait staff so that they wouldn't provide good service. Fair enough. The hostess also offered us beverages as we waited. 

Once we were seated the service was fine. Food took a little bit long - seems the kitchen was a bit overwhelmed - but we were more than happy to kill the time with chips & salsa & the best bean dip ever. No biggie.

So, are they working out the kinks? Sure. Hopefully they'll get totally up to speed by the time snowbird season rolls around.
Is the food delicious? Absolutely. Tastes just like the deliciousness of Rosa's on University and it's closer to me.
Are drinks yummy? Yes they are. They have Margarita and sangria by the pitcher too.
Does the food cost a bit more than I'd like to pay? Well, yeah - but so is every other restaurant too - inflation sucks. 
Is the dining room loud? Yep. Especially when so many of the tables have 5 little kids making noise and *not staying seated* (pet peeve.) Because East Mesa demographics. Not the fault of the owners. 

They could use better seating in the waiting area though. Hopefully they'll add that on by the time snowbird season rolls around.
