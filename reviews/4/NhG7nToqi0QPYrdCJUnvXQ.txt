This was the second time I have been to Ajo Al's.  The first time was about 10 years ago when I first visited Phoenix.  I remembered it well.  I like the atmosphere.  Warm and welcoming, lots of cool are and things to look at.  I did not know this was a chain until I read the other reviews.  This is no Chevy's though.  This is far better, in my opinion.  The chips and salsa are fresh and flavorful and plentiful.  The basket they bring you is huge!  I had chicken flautas and they were delicious.  They topped them with guac and pico de gallo.  The rice was fluffly and moist and the beans were good too.  I only had ice tea but that was some of the best ice tea I have ever had.  I don't know what made it so good.......I mean it's ice tea, but I downed two glasses of it in no time flat.  

I know there are tons of other non-chain mexican places in Phoenix and I will try them all!!  I love mexican food!!  But I will come back to Ajo Al's too.  I'd like to try a margarita next time.  :)
