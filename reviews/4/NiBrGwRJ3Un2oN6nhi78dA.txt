I'm from NY so I love finding little hole in the walls..ya this place looks sketchy but I wish there was more like this! I'm all for hot stuff I got the spicy machaca burro..and mann! It was spicy! Will def be back to try some more..I couldn't finish this nice sized burro due to the hotness but can't wait to try something else! Good size good price good food!
