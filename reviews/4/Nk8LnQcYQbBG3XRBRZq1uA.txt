Ambiance: This place is great coming into when it's triple digit heat outside. It was nice and cool, low lighting, and love the booths.

Food: We came here for lunch and I had one of the specials: one chicken enchilada with red sauce, rice, and beans. The plates come volcano hot, which I love, as they are very generous with the cheese and my favorite part is the crispy bits on the edges. For around $8, this is quite a bit of food, especially after the chips and salsa. I like how their chips are thin and light and their salsa is nice and chunky, not too hot.

Service: very friendly and accurate service, she was a pro for sure.
