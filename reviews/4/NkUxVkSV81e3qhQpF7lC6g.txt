I don't have the words for how awesome this place is.  I mean how has this not blown up before.  Mexican & Asian food all on the same menu and combined?  It is everything I love and it is so wrong that it is so right.

I look at the menu in awe and just grin about the damage I am getting ready to do.   It would be wise for me to list out all of the concoctions and requests but I can't remember.  I know that they were on DDD but a friend of mine took me here and don't go very often but when I do....it is on.  

Just do it....do it....do it....
