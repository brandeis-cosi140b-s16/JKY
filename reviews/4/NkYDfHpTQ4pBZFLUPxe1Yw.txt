Nice and clean inside. Fast and friendly service. I love the sonoran hot dogs. I've never had them anywhere else before so I'm not sure how they measure up to other places but there pretty darn grub at Moreno's. I've had the burritos, tacos (fish, chicken and carne asada) and vampiros and love them every time. Salsa is delicious too. I recommend this place for sure.
