Located on Rainbow and Smoke Ranch, this place turned out to be good!As I walked in, it kind of reminded me of Roberto's because it has the Salsa bar. Of course only women work there because it is called Las Gorditas, I don't speak Spanish but I know anything ending in AS is lady or girl (I think). 
When I looked at the menu and looked at the prices my eyes got wider, everything on the menu is less then $6 bucks. So if your on a budget you can get a gordita for only $2.45 which is kind of like a small taco with a pocket. 
So far I have tried the carne asada burrito which is pretty good which has rice, beans, and meat. The meat was cooked perfect, not too salty and not too greasy. I also tried their Gorditas which is pretty good, you can make it a combo if you want which you can either pick 2 or 3 Gorditas that comes with a side of rice and beans. They also serve different flavors of shaved ice, smoothies, and fresh squeezed juice!
