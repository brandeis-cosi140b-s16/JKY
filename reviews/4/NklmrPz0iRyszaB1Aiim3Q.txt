Saw the ad for this place on Hulu commercials actually lol came in and reminded me of Chipotle but the food was actually pretty good! I will come back most likely. We tried basically one of each of the tacos. They're all great to be honest. Food tastes fresh and had a crunch with the veggies and steak was awesome. Perfect tacos.
