Went to grab a quick lunch today and this place was recommended.  There is ample parking and is located in a shopping plaza.  We got there early and there was plenty of parking, when we left, the place was getting their lunch time rush. The inside was nice and open and decorated nicely which made for a pleasant visit.

We were seated immediately and our waiter started out with the drinks.  We let the waiter know that we were in a rush because we had to catch a plane, this is typically a good test of the urgency the waiter can relay back to the kitchen, which they nailed, great teamwork guys..  They serve some corn bread with butter which was warm and fresh and had a little bit of sweetness.  

I ordered the steak burrito which was covered in sauce.  The steak was nice and juicy and they were ample size cuts.  The burrito had a nice little spice to it and came with some rice on the plate. 

The only thing I think needs a little change is the salsa and chips.  None of the three salsa's were particularly spicy and didn't really stand out from one another even though they were different styles.
