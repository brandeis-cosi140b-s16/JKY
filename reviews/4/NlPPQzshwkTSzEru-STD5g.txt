Its downtown, expect to see some creepy creepies and the usual degenerates. The food is freaking awesome!!!!! Service is ok. If you want a classy joint, of 5 star service go somewhere else. Everyone that expects more from this place other than delicious food is an idiot. I go here all the time, and recommend it to everyone. Shrimp fajitas are out of control!
