Unexpectedly pretty building along a dusty dirt road, like a jewel dropped amid some dirty river rocks.  We drove past it twice before we found it.  I'm glad we did... The food was good. Chips and salsa were good... Nachos were good... Everyone enjoyed their food... This is one of those places that will "grow" into itself over the years.  To have good quality Mexican food that's not from a blah-bland Generican chain... Excellent.
