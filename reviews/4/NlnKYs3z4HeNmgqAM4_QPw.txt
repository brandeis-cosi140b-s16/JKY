This place was highly recommend by several people so I had to check it out. 

My first impression was that the restaurant was way too dark inside. I had to use my phone flashlight to actually read the menu. I suggest sitting on the porch if at all possible. You'll be able to see better. 

I ordered the New Mexico enchiladas and they were fantastic. I got a beef, pork, and chicken. I have to say out of the 3 the chicken was the best. Accompanied with the prickly pear margarita this meal was phenomenal. 

If you enjoy spicy food ask for their spicy salsa. Great addition to the meal.
