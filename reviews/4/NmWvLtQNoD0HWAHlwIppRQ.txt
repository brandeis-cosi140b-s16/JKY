I had a great time at Cabo. My girlfriend brought me here for one of her Yelp events. 

We had unlimited margaritas- which was amazing. They were so good! Who doesn't love free margaritas on a Wednesday afternoon! 

They had amazing salsa, and their chips were not too salty. I loved their guacamole, which I am pretty particular about (it definitely was not like Roberto's goop of what they call guacamole out of a bag). 

We had a great time! We sat outside by the fire, and met great people. The staff was really friendly and funny, which was a surprise since most restaurants have okay service. Overall it was a great success, and I will definitely be back to try more of their menu items.
