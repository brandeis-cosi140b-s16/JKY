Great pupusas! The bean and cheese (with lots of curtido) are my favorite. I also love their chicken sopes/gorditas. I usually get take-out because the restaurant itself isn't great. They should replace their dusty, fake plants with real ones and turn down the music. Until then, I'll just call in my order. :)
