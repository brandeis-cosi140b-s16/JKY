Baja and anything ending in "Berto's" are about the same, except Baja is more expensive, with a much smaller menu and probably a bit healthier and definitely fresher.

Fish tacos rock it, so does the carne asada and the Baja salsa looks like coffee grounds or lava but it tastes amazing with a totopo de maiz.
