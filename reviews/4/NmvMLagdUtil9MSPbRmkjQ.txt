I love Pasqual's house margarita with orange juice-- strong, with good flavor!

Their chips are phenomenal. So fresh and well-seasoned! Salsa tastes fresh too, though the "hot" isn't particularly hot. Also, I don't get why they offer you mild, hot, or extra hot... Isn't it really just mild, medium, or hot then? Details...

I'll be honest, I usually get the same things here, but they don't disappoint. Their black bean soup and white chicken chili are fabulous. Served with blue corn bread and cheese-filled corn quesadillas, respectively. They are very flavorful and always served piping hot.

I've had tamales here, which were also good. Friends have reported that their massive burritos and veggie enchiladas were delicious.  

Servers are always attentive and friendly, and willing to split checks. They can even split a chip basket up as many ways as you want!
