I've passed Santa Rosa many times in the past and have wondered if it was good. When Jessie B told me how much her husband and herself loved it I knew I had to give it a try. 

If you aren't looking for Santa Rosa you just might miss it. It's a tiny building in between a 7-11 and a boat shop. They even have a drive thru. Inside is your standard Mexican taco shop. I immediately saw they had a pastor Chimichanga that came with rice and beans. I also ordered a cheese enchilada and chicken taco combo for my mom. The pastor Chimichanga was crispy and covered in guacamole and sour cream. The pastor was tender and full of that chili lime flavor that I love. The beans and rice were perfect too. My mom's order was cheesy which she enjoyed. Her chicken taco also had great flavor.

If you aren't feeling like getting out of your car Santa Rosa even has a drive thru. I can't wait to go back for another chimichanga. I've also heard they have a killer breakfast burrito! Yay for Santa Rosa! Yummy food and at prices that won't break the bank! Plus, it's right in my Hendertucky hood.
