This location in the Fashion Show mall is opening to the public on 10/12/11. Yesterday they had their soft opening for mall employees, offering a free meal with a distributed voucher. The line snaked around the central eating area (under the escalators in the great hall), but it moved fairly quickly.

The restaurant itself is small, occupying the space that formerly housed Fresh Produce. It sits between Johnny Rockets on the right and Aveda on the left. Here's hoping this location keeps the mall employees fed well, While providing quick eats. It's great to have a fast food place that ISN'T in the food court, for those shops that are in this area of the mall!
