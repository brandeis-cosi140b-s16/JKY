This Two Hippies location has been under a new owner for about 5 weeks now.  This management has changed the ingredients in the menu and now use fresh ingredients to make their items.  Give them a try if you haven't been there recently.  Had the stoner hoagie & bacon cheese burger.  Preferred the burger to the hoagie.
