GOOD QUALITY, HEALTHY MEXICAN FOOD!  Well, the experience here was mostly good. All the food was very tasty.  I was not very impressed with the brisket taco. It was VERY dry. I am very spoiled when it comes to brisket.  Little miss BBQ is the best bbq in AZ and has the most incredible brisket you will ever taste!

Now the service. It was good, and our server Patrick was a very nice guy who was attentive and definitely cares about customer service. My only suggestion to him is to tone down his energy, be more relaxed, and talk much slower.  There was this older lady(some kind of supervisor/manager) that was going around yelling at some of the servers/ other managers.  She stood right in front of our table, about 2 feet from us, and was scolding a staff member.  Your the one who should be scolded lady.  Customer service 101- don't argue or scold your staff right in front of customers.  I don't think LENNY would be happy with you!
