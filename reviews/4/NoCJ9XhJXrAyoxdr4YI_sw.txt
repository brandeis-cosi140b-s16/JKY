Once upon a time, there were Q'doba restaurants all over the place.  Now, you have to look for them....it's like an Easter Egg Hunt trying to find one.  Luckily, the Yelp app on my iPhone found one relatively nearby.  I made the trek to seek out their Queso Steak Burrito, which is one of my favorites.  I think they put crack in their Queso Sauce.....that's the only explanation I have for wanting to drive a ways to grab something from this joint.

It didn't take long for me to finish the Queso Steak Burrito and a Side of Chips.  The Chips were *bleh*, but the Burrito was awesome.  I'll definitely be back.
