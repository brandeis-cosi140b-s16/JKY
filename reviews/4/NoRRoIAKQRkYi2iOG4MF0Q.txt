When I heard that Tacos Atoyac had closed, I was super disappointed since I had only been once and because it was so good. So when I heard they had reopened, you can imagine my excitement! I went back a couple days ago and it is very much the same as it was before. I had 2 fish tacos and a molote (which I have never tried or heard of). The molote was SO good! it is fried masa with potato and a little bit of chorizo inside with black beans on top.... super tasty stuff. The fish tacos were good, but I feel like they weren't as good as when I had gone before. This could be a fluke, but the fish just wasn't as light and crispy as it had been. Regardless, it still tasted good and the fish still tasted fresh. I will be back! Hooray!
