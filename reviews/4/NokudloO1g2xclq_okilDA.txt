I would give this place 5 stars, except it took us forever to find the location, when we arrived, we had to approach the chatty group of hostess girls, and they still took time to sit us after we said we had reservations.

So the rating is for the food and our specific server.

Started off with signature margaritas, and mussels.
Both were great, my boyfriend doesn't eat mussels but was exceptionally wowed by the broth that they sit in (weird, I know).

I had the platter of tacos, which was excellent.
My boyfriend has enchiladas which he said were seasoned great.

The setting is right off the end of the Venetian canal.

The location is central to that of Ceasers palace and the Wynn
