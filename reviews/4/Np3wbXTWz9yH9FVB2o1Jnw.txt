Dunno what people are beefing about.Best SW Mex food in town, tasty,delicious guacamole, wonderful extra-hot salsa, and a variety of meat and veggie dishes--and a more than ample dinner for two for twenty bucks--a great food buy. Service was pleasant and efficient, nice atmosphere. Definitely recommend if you're around the Monroe St. area.
