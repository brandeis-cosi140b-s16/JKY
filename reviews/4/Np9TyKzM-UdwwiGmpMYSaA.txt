Why would you go to a strip mall for Mexican food when there are 2 large chain restaurants right across the parking lot? Because the food is GREAT, that's why! Is it a simple place? Sure. Maybe 40 dishes on the menu. But the food is fresh, it is tasty (my wife is practically drinking the green chile sauce from my plate), and the people who run it are nice. What more could you want from a lunch place? :)
