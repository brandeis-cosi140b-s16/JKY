I thought the food was pretty good, better than I expected for a casino like this way off the strip.

I was simply a tourist, and live in L.A. (land of mexican food) and was pleasantly surprised. Their shredded chicken was real moist and flavorful. 

Drinks were great, service was cool, salsa bar was nice...etc.

I can understand ppl not digging the atmosphere, but remember where you are at.
