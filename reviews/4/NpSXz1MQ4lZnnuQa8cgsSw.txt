This is a wonderful family restaurant with very personal service and attention to quality ingredients. 

Mark makes excellent margaritas, not the sickly sweet things that are so common here. He's on the quiet side, but I enjoy his wry sense of humor.

Maria is the outgoing one of the pair. She clearly takes pride in everything she makes. After a few visits, it's become my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. My favorite is the mole enchiladas. Not available every day, I think she makes mole on Tuesdays and the weekends. It is to die for and I think one of the best moles I've ever had, and that includes many trips to Mexico.
