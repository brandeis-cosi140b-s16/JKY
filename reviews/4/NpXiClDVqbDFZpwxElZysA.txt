This tiny building has fantastic red chili at a great price. It was 6.95 for a plate that included tasty rice and creamy beans. I felt like I was ripping them off so I ordered a green tamale. The red chili was hotter than a lot of them out there. But it also had this fantastic creamy texture that made the red chili just melt with the meat in your mouth or rolled in a tortilla.
As you read all the reviews it is cash only. There is a tiny little building adjacent with eight booths to sit in. If you were looking for a fancy dining area or even a standard indoor dining area get your food to go because this place cannot accommodate your needs. I ate in the booths and it was a little warm in the dead of summer.
