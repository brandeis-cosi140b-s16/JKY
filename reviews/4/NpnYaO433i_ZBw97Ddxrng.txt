More like 3.5 star for me, but I'll round up this time!
Bf and I were craving some Mexican food and found this spot only a mile away from my apartment. Thanks Yelp AZ for the recommendation!

Service: quick, it's a pick-up-serve-yourself kinda place. The guy at the cashier was sorta rude though, it was our first time there so we took a while deciding what to order, he was seemingly impatient, jeez.

Decor: not much, fairly clean, some tables were not cleaned right after patrons left though.

Food: this is when things started to look up for Tosinos

Carne Asada Tacos combo: OMGAH so delicious, the portion was generous and the meat was just sooooo tasty, full of flavors.
Fish Tacos combo: my bf says he's had better, I think we'll just stick with the carne asada next time

SAUCE BAR: I'm obsessed with places that has sauce bar, it even comes with the little picked carrots and sliced turnips

Anyhow, not the best I've had, but I'll be back because of its proximity to where I live.
