Dinner with friends was tasty and made for an enjoyable evening. We all ordered off the "over 60" menu (are we really that old?) and it was a good deal & good food. Margaritas were excellent. Ate here a couple of months ago with a larger group and enjoyed that evening. All staff have always been friendly and efficient.
