This is a 3.5 star mexican restaurant. Great for the family as it is loud and a bit messy. Love places that give you bean dip and salsa with the chips. The cheese crisp was good and the guac was great. Similar to oreganos guac. Chimi wasn't bad and the sopapillas were tasty. Server did a great job and was on top of drinks all night. Don't feel so good leaving though. Haha.
