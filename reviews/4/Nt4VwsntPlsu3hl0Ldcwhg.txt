Came here tonight to watch the USA vs MX soccer game :-) The camarones de patron was delicious and the homemade corn tortillas too! The dish was made with white cheese and grilled bell peppers which was a nice combination. I really liked the white rice with vegetables too. My only complaint would be that the  shrimp was a little over cooked but other than that the food was very good. I also enjoyed the crispy chips and hot salsa..muy picoso!
