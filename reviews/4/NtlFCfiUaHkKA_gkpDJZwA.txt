My cousin was in town last week and we picked somewhere we both hadn't been, we had a lovely evening! The white Sangria hit the spot, the food was delicious, the atmosphere was great, the live music was nice background noise and our server Alex was fantastic (Seriously. Super attentive, gave great advise and had a big, beautiful smile!)!!! I loved the New Mexico decor and vibe, would definitley dine here again!
