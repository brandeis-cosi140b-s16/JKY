Prefect price, attentive service, delicious food.

We are visiting from out of town and wanted Mexican.  Found this restaurant on yelp and thought it was worth a look.

So glad we came! Our waitress talked us into a salvadorean pupusa revuelta, and we loved it with the tomato sauce and the curtido (cabbage similar to vinegar slaw).

Enchilada and burritos were very good.  No chips or salsa are served here.
