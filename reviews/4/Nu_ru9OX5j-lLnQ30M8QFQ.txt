This place has been here for a long time. So i have visted more than once. We came here last night for dinner,and it was really good. You can get your food to go,or eat here at the restaurant.   I did not give it 5 stars,just because it is a little dirty looking and you totally use a spruse up.   Other than that ,we were sat right away to a comfortable booth. My girlfriend got coffee which was nice and fresh,and i got Ice tea which they refilled for us several times..........Our food was really good ,We both got fish tacos that came with a lot of rice and beans. Chips and salsa were good as well. There was so much food we had to take some to go.  The price is very good as well. No complaints here.
