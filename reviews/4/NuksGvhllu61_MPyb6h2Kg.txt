I have an addiction to Jalapeno Cream Cheese.  There, I admitted it!  I am not sure what it is about this sinful substance, but it keeps drawing me back in again and again.  I have to say that Ajo Al's version is one of the best out there.  I usually get the Beef Flautas with the cream cheese and a side of beans.  It is even tastier to mix some of the cream cheese with the beans!  The pollo fundido is also excellent, of course, it too has the cream cheese!  They do a good job on the classics as well, enchiladas, tacos and I love their salsa too!  Overall, a quality place serving Sonoran style favorites.
