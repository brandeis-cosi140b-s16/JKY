I often eat at many of the filbertos in the valley but we all know that some are good and some are bad. This one is good along with the one on 19th ave and Thunderbird and 19th ave and Bell Rd. But i was  at a bar  in this area of town over the weekend and this place made up one of the best breakfast burritos I have ever had.  God dam, ill be back when Im in the area. Thanks Bertos!
