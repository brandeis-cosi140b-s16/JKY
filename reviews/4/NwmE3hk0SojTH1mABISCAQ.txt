I really love this place. I use to live really close by. The enchiladas the tacos the quesadillas and the nanas bowl are all really delicious. The service is also really great. The chips and salsa bar are great. The two different chips are the best. The only thing i think that they can change and why i knocked off 1 star is because half of the dining area is always closed off. Some time i am forced to eat next to dirty dishes or a dirty table that they haven't had a chance to clean. Giving us that extra space and using it for what it is intended for would be nice.
