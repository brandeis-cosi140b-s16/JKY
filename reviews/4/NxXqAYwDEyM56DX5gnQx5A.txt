I was staying at the Embassy Suites and I was getting hungry.  I decided to do a search and destroy and find me some pizza place to eat at.  I came across this place and looked at it and decided not to eat there.  It just looked gross and there were a few homeless people at the door.  I walked away and pulled up yelp and saw that it got good reviews....hmmmm.  I decided to give it a try.  I ordered the Carne Asada Combo.  It came with beans, rice and tortillas and it was damn good!  The portion was amazing and the guy that made it for me was very nice.

Like others have said it is in a bad area, I was ok with it, been in worse, but if you are the yuppie type or scared of these types of places, might be best to stay away.

I wouldn't though, I will be back the next time I am in Vegas!
