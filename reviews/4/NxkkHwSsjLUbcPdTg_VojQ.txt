Went at 2pm so no problem at all with service or seating.  Our waitress, Jen, was exactly what you want when visiting a new place, very knowledable about the dishes and extremely friendly.  Plaintain chips were delicious and my friends seemed to like the cerviche.  My steak tacos were delicious.  The only problem was I could have eaten about 9 of those extremely  little devils which would have come to $36. Prices are high here but, the place is impeccably appointed, very comfortable and food seems great.
