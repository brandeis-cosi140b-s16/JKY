First time at this location last night. I used to visit the one near 16th and Camelback in Phoenix years ago. I'm glad to know there is one right down the road (it's not very noticeable - small signs).

Nice atmosphere, good service, and solid tex-mex style food (this is far from an authentic south-of-the-border experience). The soft tacos were well prepared with fresh ingredients. The rice and beans were excellent (the mark of a good Mexican joint). The salsa is above average, but go ahead and request the hot stuff.
