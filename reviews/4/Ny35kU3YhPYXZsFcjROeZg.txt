I'm giving it 4 stars because the outdoor eating area smelled bad (reeked of beer) so I ate in my car.
ANYWAYS I got a fish burrito (pictured) and the special for Friday; a cheese enchilada for 99Â¢! My bill was $6 and something cents! 
Fast service, and I got one of the BIGGEST burritos I have ever had! Delicious fish too! The enchilada was very good. I will go back! 
Cheap cost, good food. :)
