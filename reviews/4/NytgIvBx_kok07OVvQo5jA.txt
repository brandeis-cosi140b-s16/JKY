We came here after bowling last night, around 12:30 am or so.  Some of us were a little drunka nd annoying lol, the employees here were really cool about it.  Took our orders and our food was out promptly.  I ordered the carne asada fries, minus the carne asada (I am a vegetarian) and some how when i got home I had my friends, meat filled fries lol (not the fault of the restaurant) I tried to pick as much as i could, and what i could eat was amamzing. I will be going back soon so I can have my vegitarian yummies.
