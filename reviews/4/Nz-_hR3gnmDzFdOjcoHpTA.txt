We were staying at The Luxor, and after driving for nearly 5 hours to get to Vegas, we just wanted to keep it low key, and stay in that night. It was my Birthday, but we're not the "go clubbing" type of people. So, we chose T&T. It's up on the mezzanine in the lobby of the Hotel. 

The two women hostess' seemed like they were in their own world as far as paying attention to who wanted to eat there. We waited under 10 minutes for a seat. We were sat in the back, but it was quiet, and lit perfectly, so it really wasn't that bad. There was an amazing piece of Art on the wall of a woman and a bull, which I seriously NEED to find out who painted it. I want it!

Our waitress was over quickly, she was very talkative which did annoy me at first, but that's my preference, nothing personal towards her. She was friendly, and very open discussing almost anything.  Another man brought out chips and salsa while she was conversing with us. The salsa was good! A red and a green, the red was smoky, like you'd expect, and the green was flavorful. Very impressive. 

I decided to have the Watermelon cocktail, was good. I've found out that I'm not really into the mixed drinks as I used to be. It was good though. We weren't really hungry, so decided to share the Nachos, chicken added. 

Oh my goodness. Heaven! They make their own Chipotle cheese for the nachos, and the black beans are sort of thinned out so it's not so thick. The chicken was tender, well seasoned. We seriously considered stopping by before we left just for an order of Nachos to go. 

I was given a free shot of Tequila for my Birthday, which was brought out with the dessert we ordered. We ordered the Sunday for dessert, and the cinnamon ice cream was out of this world. 

I would go back in a heart beat :)
