One of those hole in the wall places, or like hole near unlv. it's very nice environment i ll give it that. Funny stickers and Art and weirdness ora going on in this place. food is tasty, affordable, and not so common. cool spot to just kick it, meet friends, and grab a bite. I know they have some kind of happy hour but i m not really much of a drinker so i m quite unsure how good of the deals are, but i m sure you wont be disappointed
