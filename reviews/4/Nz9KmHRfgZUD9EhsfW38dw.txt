Stopped in for a quick drink once I learned that happy Hour exists over here at Arizona Mills (none at Rainforest). A few folks were at the bar around 5pm, but tons of specials available including 1/2 price appetizers, which I never tried. I was planning on sampling, but then they gave me this giant dish of weird circular chips and a hot bean dip and fresh salsa also for free. The bean dip was actually quite good, not spicy and the salsa was bursting with green onions and had a nice regular salsa taste. Also had a giant beer (23 oz) for 1/2 price, which came out to only $2.71. Three TV's at the bar were kinda small, but did the trick. They probably should hire another server to work the bar tables because bartender had to cover it and that left the bar empty for long stretches.
