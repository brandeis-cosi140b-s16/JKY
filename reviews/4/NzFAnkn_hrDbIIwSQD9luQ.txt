It shouldn't be possible to get 4 stars for a budget Mexican fast food place. However, they do such a good job of it. They are fast when I dine in. They are friendly and the place is clean. They even take Isis payments. The seafood taco's are far better than expected. Some other dishes are pretty good.
I know. I know. It looks like I'm getting soft in my reviews. It's not true. If I'm going to grade on how well a place does compared to what they say they do, this is four star.
