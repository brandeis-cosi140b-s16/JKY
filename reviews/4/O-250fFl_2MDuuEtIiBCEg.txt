Fantastic!  Went there with my boyfriend and some friends for drinks and a bite.  I got a veggie burrito (definitely a thumbs up) and an assortment of drinks, all delicious.  You can tell the bartender cares about what he puts together, and it was fun chatting with him before we ate.  The atmosphere is almost trying too hard, but that really only adds to it's charm, as you notice more and more interesting details as you look around (parachute frogs on the vent, etc).  I'm hoping to stop in again very soon to try their veggie nachos or tacos.
