It's clear that the majority of Las Vegans have still not discovered the joy of Mexican food from Los Tacos.  If they had, if they had tasted the joy of a Los Tacos carne asada burrito, they would have chased Taco Bell and Roberto's out of town--out into the desert wastelands where people might not mind the dregs of Mexican food.

Los Tacos is playing at a whole other level than Roberto's, Taco Bell and the other Mexican food chains around Vegas.  Quite simply, there isn't a better cheap burrito in town.  It's probably because Los Tacos operates under the "radical" notion that fresh ingredients make better food.  Fresh salsa, fresh guacamole, fresh cilantro.  And the steak for the carne asada dishes?  It's tender, seasoned, wonderful.  Simple, quick and delicious.
