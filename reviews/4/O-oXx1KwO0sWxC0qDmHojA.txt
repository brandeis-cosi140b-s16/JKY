My husband & I took our kids here last Sunday, with another couple. We had a Groupon Now, which was why we decided to try it. 

Sundays, they have a delicious brunch buffet that includes champagne or Horchata. They have a lady making fresh tortillas (that are just okay) and an omelet station. The buffet had two varieties of soup, waffles, churros, mexican pudding, fresh fruit, beans, rice, flavorful meat, several desserts and all the juice and Horchata one could want. Kids 3 and under eat at the buffet for free, which is a big plus in our book!

We must have had the same waiter as Lucky T., because we had to ask the manager for menus, what the price of the buffet was, etc, as the waiter would just nod and walk away. He'd come back empty handed and with a puzzled look on his face.

The mariachi band was great to listen to and very friendly. They played a couple of songs at our table, and played a special chicken song for the kids. 

We will probably go again on a Sunday.
