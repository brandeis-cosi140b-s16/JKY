Three and a half stars but Yelp doesn't allow halfs. We used to come here when it was El Rico's and were bummed when it closed. We've been jonesing for a new local place. 

The service was good and attentive.

My margarita was pretty strong and tasty. 

The salsa they put on the table is extremely mild but if you ask for hot they bring out a salsa verde that doesn't mess around! I'm not a wimp when it comes to spice but I mixed it with the red. 

I got the carne asade and enjoyed it. The meat was a little on the salty side on its own but good with all the accompaniments. My dining partner ordered the chicken chimi and said it was good but nowhere near as good as Jim's Burros on Ocatillo. 

Atmosphere is good except we didn't like the Mexican elevator music. All tables have tablecloths, which I associate with more formal establishments. That's not a complaint, just an observation.

We'll definitely go back and try other things. Outdoor dining will be nice once it cools down.
