Better chipotles around. This one really does skimp on portions; like it is coming out of the employees pocket! Weird. I agree that the online orders do hold up the line and have always told my wife that chipotle needs to rethink how they deal with this for inline customers (possibly an entirely different area) but I didn't dock stars as this is an upper management problem. I do however have an issue with some of the employees at the moment, mainly attitudes but the management is very competent and has on two occasions made good which is the only reason we have this location a 4 star. Something else they need to do is TURN THE RADIO DOWN! I HATE having to yell my order 3 times over because nobody can hear anything. I'm not at a bar trying to order a rum and coke here. I tend to eat here often and will report back if anything major changes but we have actually found a nicer location a little further away which we have started going to. *i also want to send out a PSA to everyone in line ahead of me: chipotle made the glass higher for a reason, stop trying to lean over it to see the food- it's glass- keep your nastys off my food!
