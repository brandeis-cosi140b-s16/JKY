This place is super trendy/hip, without the arrogance or standoff attitude of most hip places.  Be aware though: This place is super super small, you are basically sitting with your neighbor, very loud music and dark like a club. I think its awesome, but it is certainly something you need to be in the mood for. Don't go there if you are just looking to relax, it def has an upbeat vibe. 
The service was great! Although it was tiny the manager was able to accommodate our request to sit outside away from the crowd (reservations aren't taken for outside) due to my bf's medical problems. They were super nice and the wait wasn't too long. Service was great through the entire meal. I especially like that everyone was "hip" but very nice and down to earth.
The drinks were AMAZING. Seriously two of the best cocktails I have every had..high alcohol content (I watched bartender make it), yet it tasted great and not like alcohol too strong. Two margaritas and I had a great buzz going. I recommend the passion fruit margarita, so yummy, and pretty! The spicy cucumber margarita was great too, could actually taste the heat. 
The food....this place is definitely all about the drinks/vibe, which is fine. The food was really good though, but not the best tacos I have had or anything...they are not "Mexican" style in case that is what you are looking for...rather they are very "clean" and simple tacos, lots of good options, the pork and pineapple was great!! Lots of fun apps to share, the street corn was really nice.

I def want to go back to try some more margaritas! Loved the place! They really have something good going on....MUST have a reservation though or you are not getting in.
