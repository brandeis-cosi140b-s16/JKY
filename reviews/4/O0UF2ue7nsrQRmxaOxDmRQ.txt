This place was bomb. I got the burger brûlée it was so many good flavored combined together. My favorite part was the burnt sugar on the bun omg it was so good! Also I got the sweet potato tater tots with jalapeño ranch. And my husband got the baklava (not sure if I spelt that right) shake and that was really good! You could taste the honey in there and it wasn't to sweet so you can actually drink the whole thing and enjoy it. Basically this place is a must go. Glad we went.
