This is a great choice if you are in the DC Ranch area.

I came in with a large group for Happy Hour.
1/2 off appetizers is a great deal, and the Margaritas were delicious. Plus, unlimited tasty chips and salsa.

Service was good and most all the food our group had was great.

I truly hope they add blinds or something. The light coming in from outside was pretty annoying. Based on my first experience, that's my only complaint.

Enjoy!
