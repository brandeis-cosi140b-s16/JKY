Not in the greatest part of LV but for lunch why not. There was only 1 other party dinning  when I arrived.

Started off with ice tea which is was huge. I ordered the 2 combo tostada with octopus and crab - it was large and decent but the octopus was chopped to fine. I followed with a shrimp taco and a side of rice. The taco was ginormous and stuffed with deep fried shrimp, cabbage and a light white sauce - it was very good. The rice was also tasty and lightly flavored.

The service was OK, the waitress put white sauce on my taco when I requested it on the side thankfully it was light otherwise I would have sent it back. 

I suggest the shrimp tacos, you can go wrong and if you eat two you'll be set.
