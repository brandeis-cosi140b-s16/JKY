It's been several years since I ate at Restaurant Mexico and decided to try it again and very glad I did. This place serves up some very tasty tostadas and tacos and not drowned in cheddar grease cheese like those so called chain restaurants. The decor is very inviting and the service was excellent. Cody the Norwegian Latino is an awesome server with the right attitude!
