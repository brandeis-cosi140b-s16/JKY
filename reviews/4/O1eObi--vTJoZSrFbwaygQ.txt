First of all, I love Taco Bell anyhow.  But I went to pick up take out for my hubby and wow...the drive thru attendant was SO friendly!

Just wanted to say thanks for the excellent customer service.  We frequently grab food from this particular Taco Bell and I appreciate the hearty "thanks for your business!"

I wish I could remember his name, but next time.  Thanks!
