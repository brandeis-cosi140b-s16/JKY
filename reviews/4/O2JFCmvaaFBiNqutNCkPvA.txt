The reviews online and from people I trust have been all over the board with this place.  So here's my run at it:
The ambiance is awesome. It always looks closed when I go by but it was really full when we went inside. The door was opened by a guy with huge sideburns and he was happy and helpful. We were taken to a booth really quick and it was seamless. Perfect.
Our server was a nice kid. Quick and full of smiles. Brought me a Rita and beans for the kiddo on the fly. 
Have I mentioned he ambience is awesome? It's a really cool churchy old town Mexico feel. 
The salsa and chips were good. The kiddo loved them. The guac and queso came mixed together which was alright I guess, flavor was odd but enjoyable. 
Had a pork taco on corn and a duck taco. Both were pretty good. I'd eat them again for sure. 
All in all a good experience. As with most taco places it can be hit or miss with each build.
The lady will want to check it out too, so I know I'll be back.
