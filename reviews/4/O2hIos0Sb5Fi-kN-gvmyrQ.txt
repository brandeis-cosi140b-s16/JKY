Really good New Mexican cuisine!

The d√©cor was very typical Southwest with pastel colored walls and accents of Mexican and Native American art.  The service was decent and they had a pretty good wine list.

I had the Carne Adovada plate, which was very good.  The stew itself was savory and arrived as a very good portion...the pork was tender and full of flavor.  The plate also came with rice and pinto beans - the beans were a nice side dish since they were a bit bland compared to the adovada and helped to balance the meal.  Everything was served on a large flour tortilla and came with a tortilla on the side.

This is a great location to go to for a unique dining experience.  Overall, most items on the menu aren't very expensive so (the adovada was $15) so you can have a great meal without spending a lot.
