Great old school presentation.  Had the lengua, barbacoa, cabeza, and tripas tacos.  The salsa bar is also great for spoonfuls of pico de galleo and the smooth silky guac to elevate the tacos to another level.  If your in the area and wondering if you should try it I'd definitely say stop in.  Next time I go I'm ordering the family style meal.  Something about cooking sizzling meat at your table with fresh tortillas and different salsa hits a soft spot with me!
