Good Mexican food in Anthem.  I love that you get a huge bowl of Salsa, hard to say if hot is better than the original.  A little pricey and the Happy Hour leaves a little to be desired... I have not tried the chicken fingers or kids menu, but.... I think adult Mexican food is great.  I will be back regularly.
