I stepped into a colourful atmosphere with yellow walls, Mexican painted mural on the walls, colourful banners hanging from the ceiling and pleasant Mexican music playing.  The table and chairs are beautiful with a Mexican painting on each and finished with high gloss sealant.  It is very clean. The staff friendly. 

I had not ordered a Mexican Pizza in a very long time so I decided I would get the Beef Mexican Pizza. To my surprise it was huge. The size of a cheese crisp. Ones I ordered at other places were personal pizza size on a thicker crust. 
 The crust was thin on this one which is a problem BC all those toppings made it soggy. This item should be served on a thicker crust or Indian Fry Bread. Aside from the soggyness, the flavor was very good. 

The rice was different from what I'm used too. It was green in color with corn and green chilies. Tasted fine but I really like the regular rice better.

Daughter order 3 chicken tacos, rice and beans which was a shocker BC 99.8% of the time she gets a cheese crisp. . The chicken was fresh and flavorful.  Honestly everything had good flavor.  If you like Serrano's, I think you'll like this place a little better.
