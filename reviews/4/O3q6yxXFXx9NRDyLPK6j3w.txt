When this place first opened we came and did not enjoy any aspect...this time the food was great.. First they bring you chips and salsa AND an awesome bean dip! I got the chicken flautas which were heaven ... Only issue was getting our check at the end.. Had to flag someone down finally!! But I will def be back!
