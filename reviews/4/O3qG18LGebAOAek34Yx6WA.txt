I have always preferred Qdoba over Chipotle anyday. I love their queso & chips. I always get their chicken nachos. This time I decided to get their chicken burrito bowl. I will say I was very pleased. I prefer this over Chipotle simply because they have queso that can be added to anything on the menu. The only reason I am giving them a 4 out of 5 stars is because they only had one server making the meals. This made the service slower. Otherwise, great establishment & reasonable prices.
