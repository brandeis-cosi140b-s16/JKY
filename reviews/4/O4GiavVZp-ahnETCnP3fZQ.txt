The wife and I decided to take a chance last night since ASU was out for the summer and things aren't normally as hectic. And we're glad we did. 

Entering to the blaring trumpets of Mexican music piped overhead, we were immediately greeted and shown to a table. Within a minute or so we were treated to freshly made salsa and a bowl of warm chips. The salsa was one of the best I've tasted with fresh tomatoes, onions, light seasoning and just the right amount of cilantro. 

Our friendly waitress was personable, focused on us and our needs and helpful with the menu.  I ordered the chicken burrito enchilada style and the wife ordered a fish taco; we were both very happy and have plans to return again.

While the neighborhood is funky, this is old school Mex-American grub made the way it's supposed to me made.
