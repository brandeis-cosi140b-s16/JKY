Great local Mexican restaurant. Delicious good. This Encanto is a little smaller than the main one in Cave Creek, but they did a great job providing a unique atmosphere with their beautiful patio/courtyard. 

GET THE POLLO FUNDIDO. My wife gets craving for that dish! That with some roasted vegetables was enough for us to share. 

Highly recommend this locally owned gem of a Mexican food experience!
