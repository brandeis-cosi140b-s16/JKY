Vegas vacation wouldn't be complete without 2 for 1 Margaritas, pulled chicken tacos and Fajitas! The service was so quick and amazing at this place. Walked right in got a table and had drinks in my hand in less than 5 minutes. Try the chips and salsa. Fresh salsa is really good. The fajitas come out sizzling, hot and fast.  The pulled chicken tacos are good and you can even get substitute one chicken and get a steak. They come 3 to a plate. The rice that comes with them is really good. The best part about this place... Couldn't finish my second Margarita  and they gave me a cup to go... Hello! Now that's what I call service. Try this place out. You will enjoy it. Nice vibe if your looking for somewhere that's not quiet and just a turned up atmosphere.
