We leave near here and decided to give it a try finally last night. But you need to be able to speak Spanish are at least some it seemed like. Our order was wrong but the one burrito we got instead of the one we ordered was the best thing we got so it was nice. My wife who use to travel to Mexico alot when living in SOCAL and she said it was pretty authentic to her. We will try again for sure. The place also seemed very clean.
