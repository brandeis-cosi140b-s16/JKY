So I would love to give then 3.5 but there is no half option. 

Setting: typical mexican restaurant theme. 

Service: My server was friendly, quick with refills, and helpful with menu questions. 5 out of 5
Also the lady that brought me chips was super cheerful

Tea: I known it is weird that I rate ice tea but I like unsweetened tea and I can't stand old and bitter.
 There's was perfect

Food: 3.5 out of 5 nothing was bad but nothing knocked my socks off. It did scratch the itch or tex mex for me. 
Prices: I think they are very fairly priced at lunch. 

Overall I would go back and enjoy it I am sure.
