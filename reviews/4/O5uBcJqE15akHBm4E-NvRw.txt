i can't really vouch for any of the other mad mex's but i like this one a lot. the staff are all friendly and always willing to mix you up a margarita of whatever flavor. the food is really good too, but i'll admit, unless there's a special going on, the prices can be a little steep. i am a big fan of the dips trio and mango margaritas though! and if you've never been to a mad mex, the atmosphere is so fun, i would tell anyone to check it out!
