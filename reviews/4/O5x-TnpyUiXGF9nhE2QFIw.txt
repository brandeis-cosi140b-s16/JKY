Before I relocated to Charlotte, Chipotle and Baja Fresh had my heart since there were no Qdoba locations in Detroit.  Chipotle still has my heart, just a smaller piece of it... as I am now a die-hard loyalist to the Q!!!  Loves this location because the staff is friendly and the guys are always heavy-handed with the chicken for my quesadillas and queso burrito!  Loves that you can dine out back on the patio porch in the summer and enjoy the breathtaking view of the apartment complex fountain... LOL!   Food is delish, staff is cool, and a (back deck) room with a view... what more could you ask for???
