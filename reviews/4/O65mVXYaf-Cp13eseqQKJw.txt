Extremely bizarre to roll up on this place and see exactly one vehicle in the parking lot, front or back. It's right off I-10, so you'd think more people would roll off for a bite. Whatever... I'm willing to take a few things on faith at my age.

The host/waiter/etc guy (I think there -had- to be a separate cook in the back, but I'm not sure) was efficient and professional. Everything was quick including ordering, serving, drink refills, and so on. I wouldn't go so far as to say he was friendly, but he wasn't unfriendly either. He just... was. Really, though, isn't that enough? Do we need intrusive or annoyingly perky servers?

The food was very good. My wife had the Pork Birria and I had flautas. The pork was cooked well and the sauce was delicious. The flautas were very good with nice fresh toppings. They have a good recipe for mexican rice as well. Portions were reasonable, as you can see from some of the photos.

Check this place out. It's worthwhile to support a local place that's doing good by its customers.
