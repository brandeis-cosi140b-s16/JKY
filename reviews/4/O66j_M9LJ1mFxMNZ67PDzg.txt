I was pleasantly surprised to find a decent restaurant at the Luxor!  My last dining experience there was sub-par, but the T&T is actually quite nice.  Their margaritas are made with fresh fruit juice and taste pretty good.  I didn't care for their tortilla chips; I think they were a mixture of flour and corn.  But the salsa and guacamole were above average.  The fajitas I had were tasty, and Gerald's burrito was very good.  I finished dinner with a cafe au lait, which they made extremely well.

I would probably go back if I were in the Luxor, but I still prefer Diego at the MGM Grand, even though it's gone a bit downhill lately.
