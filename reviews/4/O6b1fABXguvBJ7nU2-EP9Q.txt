The food was very good, It was a month or so back so I forgot what I ordered but it was on the customers favorites section ( It's no longer there.) It was some kind of enchilada with goat cheese and chicken and spinach and mushrooms, etc... Really great! My boyfriend ordered what was stated on the menu as a 13 inch burrito but we thought maybe they brought him the wrong food item. Although it was super tasty (no complaints about the taste), It was only about a 7 inch burrito, so way smaller then stated on the menu or expected. Good service, a nice menu, obviously they change the menu up, which is also a plus. When we went, they were speaking of opening a great wine bar we'd like to try. The chips and salsa were very good! We will go back after we try out a few more Mexican restaurants. The one nice plus about Scottsdale is the selection of places to eat is so HUGE we have the great pleasure of finding a trying out so many great places such as this!
