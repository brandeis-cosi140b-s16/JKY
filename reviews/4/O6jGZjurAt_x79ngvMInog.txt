I love mexican food. I love mexican food that's not in Canada.

We are big fans of  trying different types of tacos wherever we go and this place had a fair selection. They were great. I tried the nacho's and they were tasty as well. 

I know it's a chain, but it's pretty good regardless. The food is priced reasonably well and their horchata is awesome as per the boyfriend.

The only complaint I have were the characters that came in to eat.. I was getting scared there for a while. I shall say no more.
