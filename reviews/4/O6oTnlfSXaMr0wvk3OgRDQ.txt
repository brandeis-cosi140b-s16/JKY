Not the most spectacular looking place.
But the food is pretty good, the portions are HUGE.
It is clean and well kept on the inside.

Chimichanga is HUGE, rolled tacos are good, fish tacos are good.
Chile Relleno is very good.

I like that they also have chips and salsa bar.
Sometimes they are out of chips though, so you need to tell the cashier.
