This da place right hurr you go to when you're partied out but still want to grub. :))

It can be easy to miss but just keep your eyes peeled for a blinking cone...or just look for a big white truck! Parking is fairly easy as the place never gets crowded. The place is pretty chill lots of people finishing up their night from clubbing or bar hopping trying to sober up. 

I usually just get one of each of their tacos and carne asada fries to share with my friends. If I were to narrow it to the best flavors though it'd be the tongue and marinated pork :) . As for the carne asada fries they're pretty much average but its a good filler food. 

Other from that it's pretty much self serving, they have the drinks on the side. DON'T FORGET THE SAUCES, it's usually covered but feel free to open up that metal cart. They usually are pretty stocked with everything and if not you can ask them directly for any sauce you want. Prices are $1.50 a taco which isn't too bad. If anything I'm always too smashed too care.

TIP: They add a $1 charge for card so bring cash ^^
