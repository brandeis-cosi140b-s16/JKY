Stopped by for lunch with my sisters after a hike up South Mountain.  

We tried the carne asada tacos, which had a good grill flavor.  We ate in, not sure if it's different if it's to go, but we got two little trays of salsa-red and green which were both very good.  We both had horchata which I liked but my sis didn't.  I thought it was real because it was grainy like just made, but she thought it was a powdered mix and milky..anyhoo....

I had a side of beans which I thought were really good but my sister was pretty sure they were canned.  I don't believe her and I don't think she believed herself because she also ended up getting a bean and cheese burrito after she was done with her tacos and loved it!

Along with my tacos, I tried their green chile empanada, which was cheesy and really good but also really big!  I tried to eat it all.....The prices were decent for the food.

We were satisfied with our experience and would like to try some of their other items on a future occassion.

Staff was really friendly, and it's covered outside seating
