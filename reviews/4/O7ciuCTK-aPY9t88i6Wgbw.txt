Our waitress Tracy was very patient and kind. Despite the overpriced food and loud music she was so sweet. I didn't like my margarita she suggested the sinful vixen much better.  She helped us find a nightclub to go to after dinner and it turned out to be super fun. I'd recommend sitting in her section. Also try the nachos they are amazing
