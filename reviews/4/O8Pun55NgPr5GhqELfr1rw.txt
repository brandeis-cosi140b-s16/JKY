I would have rated Los Dos Molinos a strong 5 stars if it weren't for the service.  In the three times I have been to this restaurant, the service has been so-so.  There is usually no one in the front to greet you and it does take a few minutes for the server to come to the table.  However, the food does not disappoint!  It is certainly spicy, but the spice does not mask the flavors.  I have had the adovada tamale, the machaca burro and the relleno dinner.  Every dish has been exceptional and the people I have been there with have also thoroughly enjoyed their food.  I would certainly recommend this restaurant to others, just beware that, a) you'll need patience and b) your sinuses will be cleared.
