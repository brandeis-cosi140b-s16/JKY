Amazing food, and cheap too.  Located anywhere else, this place would be asking triple for what they are charging...which is why I think this place is even more of a find and why its consistently busy.  You know it's good mexican food...when this is where the mexican's go to eat.  (And I don't mean that in any derogatory sense at all)   When you find authentic food in anywhere I can appreciate that.  

Missing the 5th star because the parking is atrocious and surrounding businesses do not accommodate whatsoever. 

Also no bar....which is not a bad thing I guess and maybe I sound like a lush, but I would have liked to have a drink or two with my meal.  Smoothies were ridiculously good though so no harm, no foul.
