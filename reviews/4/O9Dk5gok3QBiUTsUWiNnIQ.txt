Caramba is the authentic Mexican version of a Baja Fresh or a Rubio's type of restaurant. It's a clean restaurant in a strip mall with a fairly extensive menu and a friendly staff. While I wouldn't qualify it as super healthy, it's definitely healthier than most Mexican food places (they don't douse everything in cheese and nothing seemed super-greasy). 

I got the machaca burrito - the meat was tender, not fatty, and had good flavor. It was wrapped in an authentic tortilla (no Mission/Taco Bell style tortillas for this girl). I loaded up on salsas at their salsa bar (pico, roasted tomato, medium, extra hot, chile verde, and more). I had the horchata to offset the spicier of the salsas (none were overly-intense). My burrito didn't come with any sides so I ordered some black beans... nothing special about them. I'd probably order something else next time. Overall, I really liked my meal!
