Slightly above Filiberto's. No drive thru but parking is easy and the wait is never long. The menu is also similar to Filiberto's, but for me that is not a bad thing. Their green sauce is better also. This is family owned and staffed. In fact, I've heard the family lives in the neighborhood behind the restaurant. I have never been disappointed.
