If you ignore the lack of welcoming decor, you'll find yourself with a unique
menu of delicious choices, especially the jade chicken or machaca. The cookies are perfectly baked, every time, the red sauce is one of my favorites, and I have no complaints.  They also have reasonably fast service for the amount of customers they serve.
