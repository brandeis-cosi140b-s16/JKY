Delicious burger stand in central Phoenix!  We stopped in Friday night for takeout and thoroughly enjoyed the cheeseburger.  It was so delicious and left me wanting another one the next day.  The fries were subpar, but that is ok since the burger is so good.  Cute burger stand with super friendly staff!
