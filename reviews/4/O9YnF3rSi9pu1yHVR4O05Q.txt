This neveria is a pretty good place - not my favorite dessert establishment, but certainly passable. 

On the downsides, the location sort of sucks, and the ordering process is confusing and weird.  I had to get some clarification of what was what, and what options I had.  

On the upside, this is not your average neveria and odds are if you can dream it up, it is on the menu. 

All in all, a good place, but not great.
