I first tried Fuzzys in Austin, Texas and believed it was a local resturant to that area. I loved their food and was stoked to learn that it was a chain that had a location in Madison (lived in Texas last summer, moved to Madison I'm the fall).

The tacos are small which allows you to mix it up and try a could of flavors. Very good margaritas and queso.
