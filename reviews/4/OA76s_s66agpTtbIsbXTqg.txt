I give them a 4 star rating because I get what I expect. I always order the burritos with no rice. To me that's just filler and carbs I don't need. I really like the blackened Mahi Mahi. Service is okay sometimes they can be slow, however every time I'm here they are extremely polite. I'd recommend this choice over Johnny Rockets and the other choices inside the casino....

And by some extra chips and sit and people watch! It can be quite entertaining....
