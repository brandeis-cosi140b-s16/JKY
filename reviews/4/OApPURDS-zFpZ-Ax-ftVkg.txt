I don't hand out 5 star ratings all too often - this place is really close though! The price point for this quality of food is extremely competitive. Why spend 5-7 bucks on Taco Bell when you can get authentic Mexican food at Anita's?!

Honestly, their daily special includes a burrito, a quesadilla, AND rice for only $5.90! The fresh queso used for both items was delectable. I could eat that queso all day. Furthermore, this place uses fresh jalapenos, as opposed to those pickled salty ones you get at the chain restaurants. 

I am amazed at their value, and think that this place is definitely going to stay around for a while. Good luck!
