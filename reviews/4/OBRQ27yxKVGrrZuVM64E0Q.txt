Very nice Mexican/Spanish food. I will drive 45 minutes into University to eat here. Service is always attentive. Patio and inside seating are nice. Very family friendly, although I don't have small children anymore. I am struck by the numbers of Latino patrons, and I think that attests to the quality of the food here. If you know the real deal, you don't patronize a crappy representation!
I especially love the rice and beans, the cheeses (and the generous amount of cheeses!!!) and the beer. Did I mention the chicken dishes are all quite good. Have not tried the beef and fish entrees- yet.
