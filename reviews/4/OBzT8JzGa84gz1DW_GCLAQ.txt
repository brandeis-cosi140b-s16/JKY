I read a review somewhere that said this place had the best fish tacos in town...actually, all I knew was that I read a review giving the title of 'best fish tacos' to a place on Nellis Blvd with Mariscos in the name. I was working on this side of town for a couple months and drove past Mariscos Las Islitas daily. It's in a pretty random and trashy strip mall, but I finally decided to give it a try. I was on my lunch hour, so I didn't sample the famous micheladas or ceviche, but I did get the fish and shrimp tacos. They were excellent, maybe even the best in town. The shrimp and fish were both lightly fried in a delicious crispy batter, the chunks were meaty, and the tacos were accompanied by the usual cabbage 'slaw' mix and a little bit of sauce. Overall, the tacos were excellent, and I think average-priced, at ~$10 for 3.
It's not a takeout place, which probably explains all the seafood and the love for the micheladas, but I got mine to go, so I can't comment on the service.
Overall, the food was delicious, and I will be back when I have some adventurous souls in tow (just because it's a long drive) or when I'm working in the area again.
