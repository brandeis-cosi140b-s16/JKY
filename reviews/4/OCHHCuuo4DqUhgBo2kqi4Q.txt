Best street tacos that I've had in a real long time. It must have been a really long time because I can not remember the last time street tacos that taste that good! Tried the Pork and Carne tacos, Quesadilla was also delicious. The walnuts in the horchata were different but didn't change the taste much at all. Red and Green sauce was tasty and had a nice warmth to it. If you want some heat eat the side pepper and you'll get a kick. Service was polite willing to answer questions and interested in our experience. Definitely coming back with others to share another experience at Taco Atoyac.
