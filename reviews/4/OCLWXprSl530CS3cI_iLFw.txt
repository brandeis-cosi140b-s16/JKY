Not sure why I haven't reviewed this place yet.  My friends and I have spent every birthday here for several years.  They are great with our group...order comes out at the same time, orders are always right.  In a group of 10 with maybe 6 birthdays here a year I've never seen a friend send anything back.

Portions are big and it's a good value.  I like how they have the standard tortilla, meat, bean, rice combos, but then have Latin American specials here as well.  I usually pick one of the options from there. 

The chips are thicker than I'd like, but still great.

If it's your birthday they give you a flaming shot!  Great place for adult birthday parties.
