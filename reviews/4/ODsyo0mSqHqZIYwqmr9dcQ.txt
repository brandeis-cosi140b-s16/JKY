I've been to the Cabo Mexican Restaurant at Sunset Station several times in the past couple of years and just went there tonight.  It was and still is a great sit-down Mexican Restaurant!

All of the food I've tried there has been excellent and in very large portions.  My favorite is the shredded beef enchilada. So big and so tasty! I also like their selection of Mexican beers.

The star of the show, however, is their amazing salsa bar! They have more kinds of salsa there than any other Mexican restaurant that I've been to in Las Vegas and I've been to a lot of them.  My favorite is the Alcopulco salsa. It is chunks of fresh melons with a very light and slightly spicy picante sauce.  I like to eat it by the bowl-ful with just my fork. My idea of a nice light appetizer and it comes with the meal.  The other salsas are all very good too with something for everyone from very mild to very hot and even some with a smokey roasted taste.  

The staff are very friendly and very quick. They take the time to chat with you a bit while they are refreshing your drink too. 

The only thing keeping me from giving them five stars is the price of their mixed drinks. I know lots of places in Vegas have high priced mixed drinks, but it still bugs me that sometimes the drink costs more than the food, even if the drink is really good.  That's why I stick to the beers. My wife sometimes gets a margarita. They are delicious but pricey.
