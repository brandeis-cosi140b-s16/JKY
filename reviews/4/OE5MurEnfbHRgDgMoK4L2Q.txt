I used to hate this place, and quite honestly, I'm just a HUGE fan of their Happy Hour.  It's awesome.   I haven't really found anything on their regular menu that's all that exciting, but I'm picky about my mexican food. I did have the steak fajitas and they were pretty good. One thing you MUST try is the Mexicali Relish, it's outstanding.  Their refried beans are pretty well done too.  They have happy hour Mon - Fri til 7, can't remember when it starts, but it's about how long they go anyway.  They have it on Saturday from 12-6 too, seriously sweet.  Their tall drafts are gigantic, it makes me do a double take anytime I get one somewhere else.  The employees seem to have a great bond too, at least in the Cantina, I never really get the feeling that any of them hate their job.  

Things to be aware of:
Salsa Hot or Chunky seems to be made daily, so it's not always the same.  I can't say that it's ever been bad though, just home made!

Same with the MexiCali relish - it's the hottest thing on their menu (it's like $1.75 extra), made up of roasted veggies, and comes in a little miniture taco salad bowl.  Looks like shredded beef, it's yummy.  Recommended with the Happy Hour Chicken tenders.

Tuesday is Senior night - if you are not a senior and you have plans to eat there, get there early, it's PACKED.
