Not all of the Roberto locations are the same, each location though they have the same menu, the food can be drastically different.

I have been to this location many times and is by far my favorite! There are two locations closer to me, I drive past them to go to this one.

My favs... Carne Asada Nacho!!! Loaded with everything wonderful! Carne Asada Burrito. Want to make it better? Get the burrito enchilada style!! Delicious!!! The breakfast burrito is excellent as well.

I prefer to get it to go... the location is a little icky... booths aren't cleaned as often as they should be. Thats why I am giving them 4 stars and not 5. 
But the food is really good.
