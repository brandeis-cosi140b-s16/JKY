I only had a chance to try the cocktail bar and I bought the two for the price of one yard margarita drinks
I took the strawberry daiquiri and my spouse took the Miami vice
They were strong and delicious! The Waiter was fast and greeted us at the bar

That was all I experienced

Good drinks decent price
