YUM! I had a certificate for $10 if I spent $20, so I ordered the bao (one vegetarian, one fish) and the shrimp curry noodles. So much exquisite flavor. My order took a while (~15-20 minutes) but it was cooked fresh and I was happy they processed my deal quickly with no questions. I loved the vegetarian bao, a bun filled with a mushroom and pepper mix. It reminded me of how a hot and sour soup tastes. The fish one had salmon in it, and it was okay. The shrimp curry noodle bowl was delicious! Loved the mix of flavors (soy sauce and hot sauce included), definitely Asian-inspired. The salad is great and I like that they included limes for extra flavor. 

I still have another certificate so I'll be back! Next time, I'll order online for pickup so I can get my food in a timely manner during a lunch break.
