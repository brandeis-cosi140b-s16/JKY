Everything's about perspective.  If I still lived in Madison I'd probably have given them an A-OK and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  They are better than most options in my current area.  My friend and I enjoyed the pork and shrimp tacos with a couple IPA's before heading to the Overture for a show.  It was Friday night and busy.  I'd stop in anytime.
