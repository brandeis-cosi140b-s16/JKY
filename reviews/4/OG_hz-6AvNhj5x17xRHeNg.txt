Robertos Closest location to my house! Nothing much to say but here's what i've got.

Since this location is literally a block and a half away from home i can literally walk to have a late night snack. Price is very good for the portion of food you get. I usually get the carne asada breakfast burrito. Packed with meat and very thick. I'm full and content once im done with it.

Service here is always friendly and fast. Nothing much to say other than that when it comes to service. Most of the time the tables are clean and the floor is clean, every once in awhile i walk in and there's a small mess on a table from customers not cleaning up after themselves or on the counter top of the soda machine there's a mess, but what fast food restaurant doesnt?

I come here for my mexican food fix, great deal for the money you spend.
