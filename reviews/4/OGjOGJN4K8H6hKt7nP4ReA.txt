Wedge is a welcome sight for my belly... yes my belly can see tacos. I like the idea of well done Mexican Cuisine in downtown Champaign. I"m a big fan of the way they do their tacos. I have had a pretty tasty Margarita here as well, that said, I like Pacifico with my tacos.
The staff is on point.
 What?!?!
