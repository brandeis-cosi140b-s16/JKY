Family owned homestyle mexican food for the masses. Good flavor inexpensive. quesadillas for the kids and cheese crisps to start while you wait . Guac is good. My fave are the tacos chicken or beef. I have friends who are fans of the green chile really havent had anything on the menu I didnt like. They do serve beer as well. During dinner area is full and they usually have two servers. Always friendly (maybe just not peppy) and even if food isnt fast its not because the workers are sitting around twiddling thumbs.
