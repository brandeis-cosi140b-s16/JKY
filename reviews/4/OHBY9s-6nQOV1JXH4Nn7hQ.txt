I don't go to Taco Bell often, mainly because I prefer more authentic tacos. This Taco Bell is very close to my house though, so I will rarely go through the drive-through for a quick snack. 

The last time I did so, Taco Bell must have been shorthanded. When it was my turn to order, the employee asked me to wait a moment. And then a few minutes later, she apologized for the wait but asked me to wait again, as she was taking orders for both the drive-through and customers that were inside. 

When it was my turn, MAYBE 5 minutes had passed... It was certainly not a long enough period of time for me to get impatient or upset. Regardless, the employee was very apologetic, and offered me a free beverage to make up for the wait. I wasn't even bothered by the wait, but I was impressed with the customer service. 

I wish more fast food employees offered such service.
