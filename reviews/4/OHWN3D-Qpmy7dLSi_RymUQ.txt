California carne asada burro! Nom nom nom nom. I eat here at least once/wk and the people are nice, the prices are fantastic and if they delivered to local businesses they'd get 5/5. They seem to have a staff that operates on a higher level than most fast food places & I haven't gone wrong w/ tacos and other burritos here either.
