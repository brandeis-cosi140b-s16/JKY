I went to this place on a Wednesday evening at about 7:30pm. There were only a few customers there, and we were seating immediately. The waitress brought our complementary chips and three different dips - a bean dip, a green salsa, and a red salsa that had a smoky taste to it. All very yummy! I actually got fairly full off of eating chips and dips. Our waitress was very friendly. When my friend asked her to sing about the different sauces they had available, she opted to just tell us while she did a little shimmy dance. I ordered the regular bean and cheese burrito, which was massive. Even though I ate a lot of chips, the burrito was so good, that I ate over half of it. My friend got the three taco meal. He said he really enjoyed. Then we got dessert. I ordered the sopapillas...delicious. I couldn't eat them all though. He got the churros with ice cream. The churros, alone, were good, but the churro - ice cream combo wasn't that great. I'm not a fan of vanilla ice cream though. When I went, the food was good; the service was good; and I will be going back.
