My husband and I have been coming to this place for about 13 years.  We strangely love this little hole in the wall chinese buffet.  The food comes out fresh and its cheap 2, about $5 pp.  We r strangely addicted to this place even though we think its dingy and it could use some cleaning, we just keep coming back.  We have surprisingly never gotten sick from eating here.  We have gotten most of our family and friends addicted also.  We have even become friends with the owners son, which BTW works here.  we love it and as long as they r open we'll keep coming back.
