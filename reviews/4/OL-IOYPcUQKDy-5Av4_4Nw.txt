Took me a while to finally make my way to Bakersfield on East, that opened a few months ago, but happy I made it.  The location is challenged, in part due to his checkered past of poor restaurants, but namely because of an abysmal parking situation.  With valet parking available at the evening, I opted for nearby parking across the street at Harris Teeter for the quick walk over.  

Firstly, they did a phenoninal job on the remodel.  The restaurants-past are barely visible when looking at the new layout.  Kudos.  Secondly, the food.  By all measures, a very simple menu, but extremely well executed with fresh ingredients.  The service matches the approachable and easy-going feel for the restaurant.  Dare I say, this one might actually make it in this location?

I give Bakersfield 4 starts for a good vibe, good food and great guac.  Repeat visit on the horizon.
