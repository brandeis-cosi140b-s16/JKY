If you have driven by Loco Patron you know its busy,  Not sure why people are giving such low starts. The fan club here is loyal to the drinks and food.  I don't ever think I have been to this place when it does not have a good group of people hanging out.  

The Scottsdale location puts Local Patron between the bar side of Old Town Scottsdale and the Club side.  Here you find a great mixture of the dressed up Scottsdale folks as well as a t-shirt wearing crowed.

I hope to see more positive reviews on this place, see for your self why this bar has a large following.
