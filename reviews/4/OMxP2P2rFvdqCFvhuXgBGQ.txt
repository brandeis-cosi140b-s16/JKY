I was really excited to go to this restaurant due to all the hubbub about the other locations.  So many people seemed so happy about this new location opening here in Chandler.  I work in the area so I thought, "what the hell, why not!" 

I called ahead and put my name down for a reservation.  Haha, probably didn't need to do so.  It was empty when we arrived at 5:30.  Though early, still disheartening to see an empty restaurant.  We showed up 15 minutes early and got seated right away, sweet.

Our waiter was right there when we got seated and had water in tow.  Already a plus.  First thing I asked was his recommendation.  He had 4 or 5 recommendations for 2 or 3 different scenarios (light meals, heavy meals, chicken/beef etc."  

Salsa and chips were "eh had better"  The green salsa was yummy and different because it was sweet, but the red salsa was your average run of the mill tomato salsa.

I ordered the "Nuevo Chile Relleno," and it was phenomenal.  Prepared beautifully, extremely tasty, and an average sized portion which was plenty large enough.  ($14)

My girlfriend had the beef "Flying Saucer." ($8) It was served on top of a crispy, muy delicioso fried tortilla thing and was stacked as tall as it was wide with yummy goodness.  The beef was shredded and seasoned to perfection.  

Ok the most depressing part of this meal... you knew it was coming... the Spanish rice.  It was surprising when it came out to my table because I had no clue it came with my food.  Totally failed reading comprehension apparently.  It was bland and tasteless.  Much much colder than the rest of our meal and honestly if they left it out, my meal would probably have been better.  whoops.

All together a great experience.  And I will return to try more on the menu.
