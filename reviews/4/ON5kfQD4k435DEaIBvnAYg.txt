This is a great authentic Mexican restaurant. I lived in Mexico for a couple of years and this place brought many good memories. I lived in Puebla and they serve great mole poblano. The servers' primary language is Spanish. So it can be a little difficult to communicate with them at times if you don't speak the language. Great food!
