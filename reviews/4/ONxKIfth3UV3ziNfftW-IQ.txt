I love this place. I really do. My family & I started coming here when it barely opened. The owners during that time were very nice & Humble which why I was shocked to see so many negative reviews. When I went back recently after not going for a while, I noticed the more distant and "rude" manner people were talking about. I don't think the way they act towards customers is based on rudeness or bad customer service, I think it is intimidation since they do not speak the English language as well as they would like. Nonetheless, the Raspados are still just as good as ever (better than the ones in Mexico), but they are so expensive!
