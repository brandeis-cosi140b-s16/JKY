Before we moved back to CA (the story of my life!)  we were here SO much they actually knew who we were, what we ate, how we ate it, and then we moved. :0(   Now that we are back, we have been a few times, they haven't remembered us yet. Boohoo...  But we are suckers for the chips!!  This location is easy to get it, parking is a lot better than it used to be and it is just worth the extra swearing waiting for a parking spot to open!  Be patient to those who havent eaten there before.  Remember the first time we were all confused!!  I hate seeing jerks in here being rude to newbies!  Just help them figure it out and we will all get through the lines!
