Went with my family.  At first we were not impressed and slightly nervous about eating here. While walking to the bathrooms upon first getting here I slipped on a wet spot on the floor.  I quickly notified a waitress and they cleaned it up.  Then entering the bathroom discovered floors covered in over spilling trash.  Again I notified management and they thank us and quickly took care of the problem.  We asked for a table but were walked to a booth.  We ordered raspberry tea and asked what other drinks they had.  Our server stated to us they were out of the raspberry tea and offered strawberry. Declining that flavor I went with just water.  I order the White Sand Chimi, My son ordered the Steak Tampico.  Attempted to get Menudo, but strangely enough for a mexican rest. they do not have any.
The salsa and bean dip was great.  the salsa had a bite to it but the flavor was good.  getting our order served took a good 20-30 minutes.  The waitress was great and took good care of our needs as we waited.Once we got our meal, the food itself was delicious!  I thought I would burst from the large amount I consumed, but I couldn't help myself.  My tongue burning from the spiciness but my mouth kept saying "more, more".  Upon walking out I noticed yet another large wet spot on the floor.  Usually I wouldn't mention it but as I discovered when that floor was wet it was very slick.
I give them 4 stars because the product the have is wonderful they just need to work on some of the esthetics.  Maybe it truly does represent a little hole in the wall rest. in Mexico.  If you like a kick to your food and really great tastes i truly suggest trying Arriba's.
