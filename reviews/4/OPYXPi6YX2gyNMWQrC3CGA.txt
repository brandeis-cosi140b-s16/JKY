Where oh where would I be without the amazing world of YelpI  After seeing all of the great reviews we decided to check this place out with the kiddos in tow.  Loved everything about it - the menu, the decor and especially the happy hour deals.   Starting with the drinks, we enjoyed the sangria, the negro modelo on draft and fresh watermelon juice for the kids.  Many (possibly all) of their ingredients are from local vendors and therefore very fresh.  We had the shrimp ceviche appetizer and various tacos - halibut, shrimp, pork and beef.  The kids had something called a chicharron which is like a huge letter-paper size chip made of cheese.  They had a good time eating it as well as cheese quesadillas off of the sides menu.  It was a little far for us, but this is a great place to meet folks and do happy hour.
