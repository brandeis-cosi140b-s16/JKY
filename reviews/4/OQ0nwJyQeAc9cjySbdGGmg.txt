Clean, friendly staff, huge portions. Not the best Mexican food i've had but it hits the spot when i've got the craving. I always tell myself that I'm only going to eat half of what I get and save the rest for another meal. It never works. I always stuff my face till it's all gone. That stuff is addictive.
