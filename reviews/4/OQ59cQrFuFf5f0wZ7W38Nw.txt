I went to the Carlsbad tavern during a business trip and was not disappointed.  I want to go back for more.

Atmosphere / Service:   I sat at the bar.  The bartender was very attentive and friendly.  I placed an order for their chips w/ two salsas.  Something happened and my order never came out.  The bartender apologized and comp'd me for the mistake.  Atmosphere was comfortable and fun

Food:  I ordered the enchantment platter.  It came with a adovada burrito, a chicken enchillada, and the chile relleno.  It was fantastic.  the adovada burrito was the best part. will get those again next time.
