This place was a shock given it is located in a mall food court right next to the tourist mecca of Carowinds.  This is Mexican food more authentic than can be found in the burbs of San Diego.  The menu has limited English so you need to be careful less you order unwanted animal parts (tripe, tongue etc).  This is the real deal, a truly great cheap taco shop on the NC/SC border.
