I go between 3 and 4 stars for Qdoba.  Sometimes service is great; sometimes it stinks.  Sometimes the food is great; sometimes it stinks.  Sensing a theme here?  

If I leave this place alone for a while and come back I enjoy it immensely.  The food is good and fresh, albeit not authentic.  And sometimes you just crave this sort of thing.  I admit that when I'm in the mood for something like this I like Qdoba more than Chipotle.  On my last visit the service was quick and on point and the chicken tacos and three cheese queso hit the spot.  I think I'll give it some time before my next visit so I'll like it just as much!
