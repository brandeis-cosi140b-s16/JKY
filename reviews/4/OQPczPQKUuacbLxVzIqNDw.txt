Went there tonight for dinner. Diner ambiance, interesting.. Mirrors everywhere which was kinda neat. Wait staff nothing special, but not terrible. Large portions. We ordered a pitcher of margarita... Standard but not strong at all. With that said, some of the best Mexican food in the area. Although... I ordered the borracho shrimp and was a little disappointed (shrimp ratio to price: 7 : $15.) but the mucho chimis and more was awesome!!! Worth the price and more than we could finish! Best corn tamale I've had!  Recommend it if you want good Mexican and a casual atmosphere
