Thank God!  I finally found a taco stand here in Vegas that is on par with the taco stands, and trucks in Southern California.  I had tacos El Pastor.  They put a generous portion of meat on the tacos and they were $1.25 each.  I have had better, but not in Vegas and not for this price.  I highly recommend this place.  And they are open late.
