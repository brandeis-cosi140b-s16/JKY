The first time I came in here I was craving chips & salsa so bad, I remember walking around the corner and the place seemed to be glowing...or maybe it was the huge pinkish purple sign...anyways, I certainly got my fill of chips and salsa and then some. The portions are huge! I had to take the bf here the next time we went down. He mistakenly ordered something on his own and couldn't finish it (I told you so). But the BEST thing about this place is the breakfast! What a deal and it's just the right amount. Every time I head to Vegas this is a place we always stop at. The servers are very friendly and on top of things and the atmosphere is always pleasant.
