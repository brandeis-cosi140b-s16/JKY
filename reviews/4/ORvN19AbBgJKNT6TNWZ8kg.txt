Having been to the Monterrey in the University area several times for lunch, we decided to give this Monterrey on Independence a try for dinner this past weekend, and we weren't disappointed. 

The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, as it's in a strip mall near Outback Steakhouse.  Once you get inside, though, you can see that they took the extra effort to actually do something with their square footage.  It's not just one big room; they divided it up into sections and included high-backed booths for additional privacy during your dinner.  The Mexican decor is very fitting and creates the ambiance.  

The dinner menu is a lot more extensive than lunch, but they still have combos from which you can choose.  Although instead of about 6 or 7 combos, there's about 30.  And those are just the numbered ones.  There are many, many more with names.  Ay, chihuahua!  The thing to do is, if you know what you'd like Mexican-wise, keep that in your head and look for a meal that has those combinations.  That's the quickest way to get through the menu!  

I had "La Mejor" (translated = "the best").  It came with a beef soft taco, chalupa (different from Taco Bell's), and chile relleno (which isn't really a stuffed chile, it's more of a pile of mush of cheese and meat (?) on top of a tiny chile pepper, but oh-so-good).  And while the meal was good, I wouldn't call it the best.  We'll go back, but I'll try something different next time.  

The chips and salsa they bring to your table are nothing out of the ordinary, but they always taste so good to whet your appetite.  The salsa comes in a little decanter which you can then pour into your salsa bowl(s).  It's unnecessary, but the presentation of it is very nice.  

It's also a good place for kids and groups.  There is plenty of seating and they have a good number of choices for kids' meals.
