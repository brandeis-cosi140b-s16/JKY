High quality service is the first thing I noticed, a place that the staff remember the drinks you order. 

Chips and salsa come standard with your meal, which almost serve as an appetizer.

Carne asada tacos were OK, doesn't come close to more authentic restaurants in terms of flavor. Baja sauce definitely makes it enjoyable, but it's par for the course compared to the competition.
