The best seafood enchiladas I've ever had!  This is a cut little hidden gem and the decor and ambience are lovely.  What isn't lovely is the service.  Wait for water..wait for drink refills,  wait for food. It's a waiting game here.   I could understand if they were super busy but it was a Thursday night and not at all crowded. While I usually don't mind a leisurely dinner the waiting was verging toward annoying.  I was never offered a refill on water..had to ask...no silverware. .. it just went on. .. but the food was superb.  Go and enjoy the food but be prepared to spend a while. 
The only thing we didn't wait for was the bill...of course!
