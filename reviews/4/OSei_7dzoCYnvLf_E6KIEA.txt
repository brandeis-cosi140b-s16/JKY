good pupusas!!!!!! 1st time trying pupusas and i am a fan! its nice to kno there are still types of food out there i havnt discovered yet!!!!!!!!

if you are reading this review and havnt tried pupusas go get it!!!

its like a round thick corn tortilla (the ones they use for south american food) stuffed with cheese and shredded pork. you eat it with an orange sauce and hot sauce if you like...

you are supposed to eat it with pickled cabbage, but i preffer not to. i like to taste the full effect of cheese and shredded pork and hot sauce!

good shit! LOL
