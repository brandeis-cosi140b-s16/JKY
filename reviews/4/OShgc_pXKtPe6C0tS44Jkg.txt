No-nonsense cheap Mexican (Tex-Mex) food.  It's a tiny neighborhood joint but the food is pretty reliable for what it is.  The tacos and burritos are better than the tortas, which are undistinguished.  

Definitely the best $5 Mexican food in this part of town, which is probably why it's almost always busy.
