I am a fan of Chipotle.  The food quality is high and you don't feel like you are going on a fast food burger & fries binge even though it still fills you up.  This particular location is a little slow; the one by Scottsdale Fashion Square is much faster.  The other nitpicky thing I don't like is the tables that are basically next to each other with a small gap between them.  Neither of these things change the fact that this is a great lunch option.
