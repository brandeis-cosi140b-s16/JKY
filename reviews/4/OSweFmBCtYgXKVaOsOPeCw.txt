I literally live 1/4 of a mile from this eatery.  I would never have tried it except for reading a Yelp review that called out what I will echo: you would never guess something this authentically good exists in a nondescript setback shopping strip.  I was starving and needed cheap eats.  I showed up at 5p on a Saturday.  I was welcomed by the "OPEN - ABIERTO" sign, made me start feeling the authentic ethic vibe.  When I entered I immediately noticed the strong cleaning smell.  A smell that I have smelled other times in mexican joints actually in Mexico so I took that as a good authentic smell vs. a bad one.  Not sure if you can order Mexican "TVs" but they have two of them with poor reception playing futbol; making this place authentic.  Add a large floor fan going, plus a tall gray waste basket near the serving counter, plus a host of beers and wine, plus them trying to make it look like the typical half-ass built mexican cantinas by spray painting faux cracks in the wall, plus the friendly spanish speaking food staff, plus the que bueno carne asada burro with caliente salsa, and El Molino Mexican Cafe sums to a very decent place to grab some inexpensive Mexican food.  Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars just yet - - - would have been nice to see some other sit-down patrons to make it a fiesta and I had to wait a little too long for my burro.  But heck, that's authentic mexican!
