This place is POPPIN' even more than the day clubs and night clubs in Vegas. If you're a foodie and you've been to Vegas more than once but have not yet stopped into this spot for some super duper authentic Mexican tacos, SHAME ON YOU.

I love that the tacos are still priced pretty decently even in this craycray economy we're in ($2 a taco).

They also have quesadillas, burritos, tostadas, etc. 

I've had the Carne Asada, Chicken and of course the Lengua tacos here. BOMB.
The salsas they use and offer are also BOMB.

Like I said, this place is always POPPIN'. So don't be alarmed if you're walking into a mosh pit full of hungry or hungover Vegas visitors and/or locals.
