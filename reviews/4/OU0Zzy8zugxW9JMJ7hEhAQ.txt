I am rarely happy with myself after eating Mexican food in this town. I have had good Mexican food, in Mexico and California, and normally eating Mexican food in this town feels unhealthy and gross.
Mas Amigos is different. The flavors are fresh and you can detect all of the yummy components. None of that monotonous mush we have all grown accustom to.
There tortilla chips are flaky and hearty, they seem homemade although I have never asked. The salsa is good, however I recommend requesting their homemade hot sauces, there is a green and red, they are quite spicy and sooo fresh and tasty.
It is no doubt obvious that I am not an expert on this place.
I have had two dishes here, cheese enchiladas and heuvos a la mexicana, and have enjoyed every bit of them. I am excited to go back and try more. 
Unfortunately, their Margaritas are not great, they come from a slushy machine and that just makes me sad.
