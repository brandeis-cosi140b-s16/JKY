If we're in the mood for Mexican food, Cabo is a great place!

Located in Sunset Station Casino, they are only open for dinner.  I still wish they would open earlier for lunches so I'll keep my fingers crossed.  Included with every meal is the complimentary salsa bar.  There are about 12 different choices of salsa.  There is a good variety of milds, mediums and hot salsas.  On the salsa bar is also bean dip which I always enjoy too much of before my meal.  

The entrees are good and always filling.  We've tried the fajitas, enchiladas, salads and chimichangas.  All have been throughly enjoyable and tasty! Like every Mexican restaurant, they are accompanied by rice and beans.  

Service here has been good.  Waiters have remembered us even if it's been a while since our last visit.  Our drinks stay filled while being treated with polite and personable service.  Since our first visit, we've been back many times to enjoy their great food.  Ol√©!
