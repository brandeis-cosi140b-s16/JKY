For the most part, this restaurant serves very tasty food. While some of the food tastes a bit underseasoned, I can definitely say that the food that has been adequately seasoned is rather good. The breakfast burritos, especially the Chorizo Burritos, are to die for, especially if you had a long night and need a good pick-me-up in the morning. Additionally, the Carne Asada Fries are a guilty pleasure of mine and are great for a day of indulgence. When asked if you want extra hot sauce, always say yes and ask for the green salsa. It will add a wonderful flavor to your food.
