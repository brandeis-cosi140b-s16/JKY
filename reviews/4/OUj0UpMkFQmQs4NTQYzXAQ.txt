I know people are going to disagree with me, and that's fine. The food isn't great, the service is iffy, the decor is awful, the place reeks of smoke from the lounge even though indoor smoking was banned years ago, but I really love me some El Charro. So much so that I drive from the far west side to Mesa for the experience. 

Their hot sauce alone is worth the drive. The food is gringo-Sonoran, and is as good as any gringo-Sonoran out there. Tacos, enchiladas, tamales, chimichangas, you know the drill. There are also dishes that aren't found everywhere, like the Spanish Tongue Platter. This is something special. 

If you like Sonoran-style food and 50s-style dives, El Charro is the place for you.
