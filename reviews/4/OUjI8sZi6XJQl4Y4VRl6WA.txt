The first time I ate at Gil's, I was in a hurry so I didn't really take time to read the menu.  I picked up a lunch special with tacos. They were not great seemed like store bought shells and greasy hamburger meat.... I will not hold them to this because of my rushing. 

I stopped in again to get dinner recently and took the time to ask questions and read the menu. I settled on the dinner special of a sopapilla stuffed with green chili pork. It was amazing! The side of beans was also very tasty, the rice was so-so. Either way it completely made up for the tacos. I would give the food a 5.

The 4-star rating, in stead of the five was because the order took an extremely long time to be prepared and the restaurant was quite hot, I opted to wait outside because even though it was also hot outdoors, I think it was cooler than the building.
