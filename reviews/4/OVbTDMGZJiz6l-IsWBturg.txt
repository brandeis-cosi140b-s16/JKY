I went here for lunch one day and it was delicious! The margaritas are a great size so you definitely get bang for your buck. I had the street tacos with veggies and it was so delicious. The Jalapeño cole-slaw was really good. The salsa had the rite amount of spice to it and the service was really good. Also try the pineapple-jalapeño margarita it is delicious!
