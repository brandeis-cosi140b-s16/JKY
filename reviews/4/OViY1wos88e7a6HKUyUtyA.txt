This place has the best ceviche in town, been there twice already, I recommend the Tostadas Mixtas for $3.50, hearty, lots of meat, and very filling.  I have had ceviche in Peruvian restaurants down in Orange County, in Costa Rica, as well as homemade, but the ones at Tacos El Rey are amazing.  The order will come with ceviche, chopped up soft octopus, and cooked shrimp.  They serve it on a tostada shell and will give you an extra one if the shell gets too soggy, plus extra limes and hot sauce for condiments.

I have to say, the service really isn't as nice as it was before in terms of going the extra mile.  I still go there for fish tacos, platters, and horchata, which are decent.  But their burritos are just totally inferior in quality compared with Taquerias.
