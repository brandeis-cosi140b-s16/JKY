I have been here a few times. I think this place is definitely better than the other common Mexican family chain taco places. I had the shrimp burrito. At first I was kinda iffy ordering shrimp. In the end it was worth the risk. It was the perfect amount of spiciness where it makes you sweat a little but you cant stop eating it. My friends dad got the mole chicken and he swears it was just as good as his ex wife's. I know of several other people that live in the area that also rave about this place. They have dinning tables but its more of a order your food to go place. They cook the food fresh so it will still be piping hot when you get home.
