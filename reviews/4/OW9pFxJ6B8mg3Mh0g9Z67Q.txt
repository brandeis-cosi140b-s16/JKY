I really like the food here.  My standard is the Tacos con Carne Asada.  It;s very similar to Tacos al Carbon which is grilled meat, with rice & beans.  

I also like the bean dip and salsa they provide for free. Refills are no problem and the service when I've there (3 times) has been quick and friendly.  

The last two times there was a guy on an electric keyboard playing which was (ahem) interesting.  Depends on your musical taste, but played a lot of cheesy 70's toons.  Overall solid choice for Mexican, I'll be back.
