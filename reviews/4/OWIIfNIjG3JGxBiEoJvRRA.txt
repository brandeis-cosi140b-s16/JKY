I really enjoyed this place. I had the combo number 3. It came with a burrito, taco, enchilada, rice, beans, and a soup before the meal for $13.50. It was an awesome portion and I took about half of it home. Definitely a good deal. The ambiance of this was also nice. Lights were dim, candle on the table, earthy colors, lots of decorations, live solo guitar player playing music. Huge menu, lots of choices. Overall authentic Mexican restaurant that provided a good deal and pleasant dining experience.
