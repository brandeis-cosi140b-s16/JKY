The 3lb pound mucho matadore burrito is a legit contender for anyone with an abnormal appetite or just really loves their burritos like me. I got this thing on a Thursday night which is also half price Margarita night and yet around 545 the place was not really all that busy. I ordered and was served within 10 minutes. For 11 bucks this thing is a steal as it could feed 2 full grown men easy. I however have an inferno like metabolism with nothing normal about it so lets move on. This thing has everything inside it. Choice of pork, steak, beef or chicken (I got chicken) corn, black beans, lettuce, cheese, rice, bit of sour creme and then topped with mole sauce and sprinkled with cheese. The smell and the taste were genuine and delicious! Scary part is that despite "pacing myself" I still finished solo in under 12 minutes and felt pretty content afterwords.
