Pretty damn good fish tacos! My husband is a taco snob. He thinks that having been born in Mexicali, he was granted with an innate ability to accurately judge any taco on authenticity, taste, and grandeur.  He loves, loves this place! My only wish is that they served the tacos with that yummy chipotle sauce.
