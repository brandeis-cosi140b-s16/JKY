Heaven in a box! This tiny little dump is amazing.

I got a little nervous when I pulled up and I saw that the restaurant was more of a four walled building with an oven inside than an actual sit down place, but I was not disappointed. Big portions, great taste, and good value.

Only drawback is that the sitting area isn't air conditioned so in the summer it gets pretty toasty and there are a number of flies buzzing at your plate. Nevertheless, the food is awesome and I'll definitely be going back.
