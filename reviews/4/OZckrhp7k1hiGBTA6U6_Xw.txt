1900 Mexican Grill is a cool, little tucked-away Mexican restaurant off Park Rd (near Fairview).  The inside is themed and decorated very well in bright colors.  I recommend the booths!  They provide a private, intimate experience.  They also have outdoor seating on their patio in the courtyard, which is nice to enjoy during the warmer months (but not too warm -- unless you're sitting in a pitcher of margarita!).  

The chips and salsa they serve are average, but a little on the hotter side than some places.  My favorite dish is the Chicken Mole.  Yum.  I love a good mole sauce and 1900 Mexican Grill does a great job.  

We've always been able to get seated right away, too, no matter what night we've gone on.  Give 'em a try!
