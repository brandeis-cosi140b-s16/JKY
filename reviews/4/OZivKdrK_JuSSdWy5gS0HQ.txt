My husband and I LOVE Lindo.  Service at the bar by Liz is phenomenal.  She always remembers what we drink, which makes Lindo feel like our second home.  The food is spot-on every time.  I usually order one of the fish dishes, which my friends all tell me is strange at a Mexican restaurant.  However, it is cooked to perfection without fail.  We frequent Lindo a minimum of once and month and have never been disappointed.

Listen up Lindo:  Four stars instead of five only because you took away the live mariachi band, apparently due to the oldster customers complaining about the noise.  I truly hope you bring it back very soon, especially since I can about guarantee the "youngster" crowd is spending lots more money than the old-timers.
