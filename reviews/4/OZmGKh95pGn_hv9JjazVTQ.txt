I love this places food. I am a New Mexico boy myself and no one seems to be able to do it outside of New Mexico but this place is really really good I wish I could tell you more about there's I buy ever since I got stuffed sopapillas with meat and cheese I have been legit hooked the only other thing I have had is the dollar tacos on taco Tuesday which is real meat and real cheese and green chile in my case and the green chile and meat at serious serious business!!!!

My only gripe  about here is the line for taking orders is kind of clunky and awkwardly close to people sitting at there tables and squeeze between a soda machine and tables so people are squeezing by and around you which is a bubble issue I guess besides that the cashier is never entirely helpful for those who come for the first time and don't normally have New Mexican food.... But I already know what I want so I'm good lmao

The food really does make up for those awkward though... Long live Carlito's!!!!
