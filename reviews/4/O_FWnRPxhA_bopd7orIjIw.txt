I went there for the first time on Saturday afternoon just by chance. It wasn't busy (yet - but started to fill up for the UFC fights later that night) and I sat at the bar. The waitress and bartender were both friendly and attentive. I tried the beef cheek taco, the pork taco and the duck taco with flour tortillas and enjoyed all three immensely. With a Dr. Pepper, my total bill was $12, and I was perfectly full and content. I didn't realize this place has a reputation as a "party" bar but I can see, with all the TVs around the bar, it probably gets nuts on sports nights. But if you just want to go and have some really tasty and affordable gourmet tacos, I recommend going for lunch or an early dinner and avoiding the crowds.
