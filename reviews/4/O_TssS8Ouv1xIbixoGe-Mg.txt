Love visiting this place when going to classes at CPCC on central campus.  The food is great and always quick service.  They have a nice outdoor sitting area.  I enjoy the steak burrito while the wife always gets a bowl, and the spices have always been just right for me.  Not too spicy but enough flavor to give a little kick..  The best part of this location is walking over to the Cherry Berry in the Metropolitan Shopping center for desert.
