Had the tilapia burrito. They were really good!!! The waitress was really nice. Get ready for it if you ask for the big beer, it's huge. Even the chips they gave us before were tasty. The place isn't fancy or doesn't look very appealing but the food is totally worth it especially if u are in the neighborhood. I put 4 out of 5 just because I've had better Mexican food and if it hadn't been recommended I probably wouldn't have gone, but definitely had a good experience
