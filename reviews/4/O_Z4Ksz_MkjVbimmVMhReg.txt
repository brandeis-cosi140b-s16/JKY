Apparently my recent visit was better than several other recent reviewers experienced, as I had a lovely meal. The restaurant is right next to both the Titanic & Bodies exhibits at the Luxor.The strawberry margarita & shrimp quesadilla were both excellent.  I hate shrimp that is chewy, but these were perfectly cooked. The chips & salsa were also very good. One salsa was made with tomatillos and was very fresh tasting; the other was made with smoked peppers & had a very unique taste, both very different from the usual tomato salsa I get at home. I would definitely come back here if I was staying at the Luxor.
