Came here for brunch this afternoon and it was excellent.  We were seated right away once we found the place, and while the service was a little slow, it was totally worth the wait.  I had the relleno's, which came smothered in cheese, red and green chili, with hash browns, beans and eggs on top.  The combination was absurdly flavorful - so so so good.  My mom loved her huevos rancheros as well.  I had a huge appetite but was unable to finish the beans or tortilla that came on the side; in fact, I haven't been hungry all day since eating this delicious meal.  I highly recommend this hidden gem!
