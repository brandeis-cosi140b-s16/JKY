If you need some delicious authentic Mexican food Pepe's is the place for you.

The Carnitas de Puerco, slow roasted pork in their delicious green sauce is out of this world. The Enchiladas de Pollo con Mole is fantastic too! It seems that if you close your eyes and point you will be rewarded with something incredibly yummy.

If you are tired of the same old chimichangas and the like head over to Pepe's for a taste of Mexico.
