Don't know how I missed this place before.  Spotted it here on Yelp.  Had the chance to stop in for lunch.

The owner is VERY gregarious.  And loud.  Which is fine.  I like seeing an enthusiastic owner.  They usually want to do a good job.

This place seems to be pretty authentic.  The proprietor apparently is from Puerto Vallarta.  Fresh ingredients. Home made. Authentic and flavorful.  I had the burro (enchilada style) because I almost always get a burro or chimi when trying a new place so I have a basis to compare to other places.  When I said "rice and black beans" I had thought they would be on the side, but like many burro places he put them inside.  Which is fine.  Though ti did allow a bit of skimping on the meat.  It was very good, though.

My wife had the "tacos".  These are more like miniature tostadas except the tortilla is soft.  I think actually this is more authentic than either a tostada or a "typical" taco one finds in most places.  But again, lots of rice and tortilla, not as much meat.  Tasty, but just too many carbs.  A little more meat, maybe some added veggies (tomato, peppers, onions, etc) and a bit less on the starchy stuff would have helped.  Just three tiny tacos and a mound of rice (my wife opted for no beans).

I would probably rate this 3.5 stars, but I can't do that.  And the owner's enthusiasm and cheerfulness makes me round it up.

I think I will come back and try them again sometime.  Try something different.  The flavors were very good, but we just wanted a bit more meat and less starch.
