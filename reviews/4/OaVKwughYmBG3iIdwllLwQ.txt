The carne asada burrito was delicious. The tortilla itself I could have eaten plain. The meat has a great smoky flavor. 

The verde salsa is spicy but has great layers of flavors. Their tortilla chips were very yummy. Guacamole was overly processed and lacked depth of flavor. Definitely would not get it again. 

Super fast take out.
