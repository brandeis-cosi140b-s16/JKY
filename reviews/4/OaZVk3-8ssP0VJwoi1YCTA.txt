Yummy! Authentic Mexican food! Everything is made fresh. The sauce for the enchilada was spot on. It hit the spot. We don't like beans, but the beans here almost taste like mashed potatoes. We even loved whatever cheese they used in their carne asana nachos lol. But the winner has to be the salsa. All homemade and you get to choose between 4 salsas. 
 
The little old lady behind the register was so nice too. She kept stopping by to see how we were doing and even stood around and chat with us a bit. She even took a chair for a little as she has back pain. 

Lovely small authentic mexican restaurant.
