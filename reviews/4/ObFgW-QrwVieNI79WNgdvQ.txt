I love this Serranos!  Every time that we have went here the employees are great, the food is awsome, and the price is right.  We started going here when we first moved to the QC a few years ago, and even though their are more choices out there, we still love our old reliable Serrano's.  I have never had a bad experience here and would reccomend this restaurant to anyone who likes inexpensive authentic mexican food.
