Thank you Three Amigos!!!  In fact, goodbye Loco Lime and hello to my new favorite Mexican spot.  Excellent, fresh margaritas, great tequila selections, and the food is wonderful as well. Guacamole - fresh, chunky, flavorful and I could stop in just to eat a serving of this alone.  But there's so much more.  And it's so close to home.  

Welcome to the neighborhood Three Amigos.  Stay awhile!
