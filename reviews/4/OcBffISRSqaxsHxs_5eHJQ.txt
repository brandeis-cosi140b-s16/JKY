I've been here a few times now and I think I must have had better experiences than others.. I usually sit at the bar so the service is fast. I love how open and bright it is inside of the restaurant. The d√©cor is cool and the lighting at night is very soft so it sets a casual tone. 

 I read all the reviews with people complaining about small portions, but I have to state the opposite. I love going to a restaurant and actually finishing most of my meal. Americans are used to eating substantially bigger portions than the rest of the world. I don't think the portions are small,  they are just not gordo portions you see in most Mexican establishments.  Did I mention they do two types of Sangria and they are not overly sweet! I think the food an atmosphere at this place are great and I will definitely be back.
