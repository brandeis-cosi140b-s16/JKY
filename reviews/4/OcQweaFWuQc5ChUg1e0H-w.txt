So after two times here with poor service at this location, Manuel's redeemed itself. The food was top quality, and the service was impeccable. It was attentive, prompt, and preemptive. The water and salsa never ran dry. The waiter (I think his name is Bob) was friendly and personable. I'm glad to see Manuel's is back to how I loved it. I always get the #4 combo unless I come on a Monday and get the special with the same things: shredded beef taco, cheese enchilada, and beans. We also get a cheese crisp.
