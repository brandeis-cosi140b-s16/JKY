I really like the food here. the restaurant itself is really cute from the outside looks like something that belongs in Mexico! I love it

they sang me happy birthday with a full mariachi it sounded like. the staff is really nice and attentive. 

good place to come if your in Vegas and in the mood for some Mexican food.
