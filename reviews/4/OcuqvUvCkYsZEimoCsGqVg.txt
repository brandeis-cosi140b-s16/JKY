I'm gonna keep it simple.

$7.99 for unlimited tacos and rice and chips and salsa, I'm already sold!

Chicken Taco - 4/5 very good, a little dry...not as good as my moms home cookin
Beef Taco - 2.5/5 it's okay, was very soggy and wasn't memorable
Shredded beef taco - 4.9/5, sooooo good I'm a fan, I would just come here and order those forever if I could.
Pink Taco - 1/5, taste life fish, very disappointed 

Get a sense of humor :)
