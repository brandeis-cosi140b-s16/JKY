When I'm looking for something fast but not crazy unhealthy, I love to grab something from Rubio's. It satisfies my Mexican food craving, without being too greasy (a.k.a the guilt).  My favorites are the California Bowl (all the deliciousness from inside the burrito but without the tortilla) and the Gourmet Tacos (all meat options have bacon in them....need I say more?).  Plus, the salsa bar is always stocked and the place is always clean.

Rubio's is definitely fast food done right!
