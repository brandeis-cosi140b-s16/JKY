We go to Tradiciones on a somewhat regular basis and love to take the out of towner's there to enjoy the atmosphere and the good food.  The only real thing I am not as thrilled with Tradiciones is that if you want to have a conversation it can be tough at times with the regular mariachi's playing (don't get me wrong they are good and entertaining).  The patio is really nice once it cools down a little outside!

Their Mole' is a sweet / spicy which is a little different and good!
