What a charm San Carlos.
Unpretentious - as though sitting in a restaurant somewhere deep in Mexico - this place has all the charm of, well, a shitty little restaurant deep in Mexico.
But that's not why I love San Carlos.
I eat here because of their inexpensive yet delicious food offerings.

Let me put it another way,
I recently dined at Ocean Club, ordering their seafood tower as an appetizer. It was in the three-hundred dollar range...for an appetizer. YIKES.
At San Carlos you can get the same seafood platter, featuring every denizen of the deep for under thirty dollars!

Clams, mussels, crab; both king and stone claws, snapper, cod, octopus, tilapia, and a host of other fish whose names escape me all served on an oval platter stacked four inches high.
Two of us couldn't finish it.

As I said, if you're looking for charm, forget it. 
Also, make sure you have a good car alarm as it's in a dodgy part of Phoenix. 
But it is Arizona, so no-one will be surprised if you dine with a heater on your hip.

It also helps if you know a bit more Spanish other than; My name is Diego, would you let me sleep with me for twenty dollars?
