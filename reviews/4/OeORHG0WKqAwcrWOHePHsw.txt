My boyfriend and I were big fans of the outdoor seating and the friendly staff. The food was good - not the best I've ever had, but definitely above average. The bottomless chips with various salsas were an affordable starter, and the chile relleno was cooked to perfection. The margaritas were average, but did the job. I thought the presentation and overall vibe were enough to make me come back, and it offered a lovely view of the Vegas Strip and Fashion Drive. Very cool little place!
