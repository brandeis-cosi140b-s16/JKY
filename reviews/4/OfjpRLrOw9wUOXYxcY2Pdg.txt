Amazing food in a cool, casual setting! 4.5 stars.

Went for a hangover-cure lunch and BG definitely delivered.  We were seated right away, and had a nice, attentive server.  Started out with the sparkling blood orange lemonade, which was super tasty!  Would make a fabulous cocktail if vodka or rum was added. ;)

The chips and salsa were deeeeeee-lish.  And we're from San Diego, home of some of the best.  Loved that they gave us 3 salsas to try!  And loved the fresh-cut, hot chips!

I ordered the crispy potato rajas tacos and my hubby got the Yucatan pork.  Both were pretty amazing.  I loved that his came on little soft-fried tortillas and had picked onions on them.  But mine were the show stealer.  I'm definitely not a vegetarian, but they sounded interesting, so I took a chance.  Glad I did - the filling was amazing.  The contrast between the crunchy outside and the creamy inside was on point!  Sooooo good.

The only reason I had to take a 1/2 star off was for the beans and rice on our plates.  At first I was excited to have both red and green rice, but upon trying them I was very disappointed.  They were both undercooked and virtually flavorless.  The beans were also bland, and were almost cold.  Totally not a deal breaker, because our meals came with 3 tacos, and we had plenty of chips to fill us up.  But, being a Susan Feniger restaurant, I would expect a half decent side dish on my plate.

All in all, we will totally be back.  I think next time for dinner, so we can try all the cocktails!  :)
