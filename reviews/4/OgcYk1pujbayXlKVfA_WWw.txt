Came to this place specifically for the scorpion shots. And of course. They were OUT OF SCORPIONS. I was so disappointed that we traveled all the way downtown just to be told we couldn't get what I wanted. Oh well, we ordered food anyway.

The food itself was pretty good. My cheesy nachos had delicious queso, though it was lacking the amount of jalapenos we would have liked. We asked for a side of them extra. But, our server/bartender forgot and we had to ask again 15 minutes later.

My boyfriend also ordered one of the burritos. He really liked it, and it was a generous size. He gobbled it all down. I didn't try it myself, but I trust his judgement.

We also had to ask for refills for our water, which was challenging because she spent most of her time talking to a couple and group on opposite sides of the bar.

I'm pretty set on trying these scorpion shots. But next time I will call first.

EDIT:

Just added another star to this review because I was immediately contacted by the restaurant owner to apologize for my experience. I was offered a comp and to be contacted when scorpions come in. I'm very impressed. And I am hoping very much that I can give them another try when I come back to Vegas next year! :)

EDIT AGAIN: Bartender just contacted me to apologize to me too. Seriously, this place is wowing me with their customer service. I just have to give another star. I'm going to be back next year and will definitely come here.
