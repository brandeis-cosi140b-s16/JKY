So we found this little treasure off of South Blvd, based solely on the awesome Yelp reviews. 

We walked in and were greeted and seated right away. Chips and salsa were presented immediately and then we got our menus. I loved the menu...there were tons of pages and options...anything you could possibly want chicken, seafood, beef, steak and great  pictures under most all the dishes so you can see exactly what you will be getting which made me as a hungry and confused first timer very happy! 

After some questions and review of the menu we finally ordered I opted for the lunch special, burritos and cream sauce. 

Okay, first things first,I agree with the previous review portion size here is here is out of control!!! There were so many plates always coming out the kitchen loaded with tons of great food! I couldn't wait to get mine and I was not disappointed!

When my burritos arrived all I could get out was OMG! They were huge! Packed with delicious shredded chicken and rice... My favorite part of the dish was the sauce. It was so flavorful and had a very nice kick, but if you want to kick it up make sure to ask for some of the hot sauce from the kitchen, it's so freaking good! 

Needless to say we both left stuffed and happy! This is a great place for some Mexican grub and I look forward to going back!
