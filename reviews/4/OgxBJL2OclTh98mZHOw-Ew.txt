Just grabbed two breakfast burritos one machaca for my wife and the other steak and eggs for myself. Both burritos are a little smaller then other places but when you bite into them they are hot off the grill. The steak and eggs could use a little flavor, i used both green and red salsa and i lile the red over the green but not by much. I felt the green didnt have any flavor at all and the red had a bit of spice to it but thats it. I gave thos place four stars one for how clean it was. One for friendliness of staff. One for quickness and one for not finding any pieces of fat in my steak like i have found in other places....gross. Other then that i will be back to try other items.
