I went there today for the first time...yes, I HAVE been living under a rock.  I tried the California Bowl, and it was very good.  I also tried the classic taco and I loved it!  They were quick and very polite, and overall I had a great experience.  It was a little pricey (I think I paid about $13 including tax), but the flavor was good and I think it is a healthier choice than a burger and fries (I still love 'em though).  I will definitely go back, and I recommend giving them a try.
