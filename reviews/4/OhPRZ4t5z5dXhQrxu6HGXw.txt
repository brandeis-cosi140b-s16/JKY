Fresh Mexican seafood, which my husband loved and a delicious side of rice and beans for a vegan like me. 


The atmosphere is also authentically Mexican.  The place is happy with loud Spanish music and colorful decorations. 

Recommended to seafood lovers who seek to travel to Mexico without leaving Las Vegas!
