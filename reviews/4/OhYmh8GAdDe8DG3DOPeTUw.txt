I've been to many Mexican restaurants, some have been forgettable, some are consistently good, the majority are average. I've only been to Mi Pueblos twice, but I've had good results both times. Service is quick; drinks and chips were on the table within a couple of minutes. I had no problem getting in and out for lunch under thirty minutes. The chips were decent, neither stale or fresh out of the fryer, and the salsa was good. You can always tell how the quality of a restaurant's salsa is just by the way it looks and smells, Mi Pueblo's is properly chunky and has that distinct smell of fresh cilantro. They pass the test. I hate when Mexican restaurants have bland rice, it's almost as if you're chewing nothing at all. Luckily theirs has enough spice and salt to complement the entree. The burrito is large, tasty, and the meat quality is good. The building looks clean and it's easy to tell that the management upkeep the building well. Just about everything was great. What I didn't like was their guacamole dip, too me it had an off-putting taste, and their queso was a little bland. I'd also appreciate a little more variety on their menu. They have the staples covered, but once you've been to an authentic Mexican restaurant it's just hard to settle for anything less. Overall, it's easy to recommend Mi Pueblo's, the service is great and the food is good.
