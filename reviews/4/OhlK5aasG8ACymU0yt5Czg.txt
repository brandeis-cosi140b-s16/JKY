Best mushroom enchilada's in town! I am always so baffled by the crappy chain restaurants getting good reviews, and the small local restaurants getting bad reviews.

This is one of those places the service kinda sucks, emphasize kinda, but the food it so good it doesn't matter. The salsa is yummy, and they have great chips.  Stop your chain addiction  and try out one of these great local favorites!

Oh for those of you who are looking for a healthy Mexican option, stick with Rubio's. This is good ol' authentic, greasy yummy Mexican food.
