Great little Mexican place, I got a Green Shredded Beef Chimi for dinner and it was delish.  Small joint and the table we got was kinda cramped.  Service was good.  I liked the old style decor because this is not like all the boring chain restaurants you see today in the valley.  They kept our table full of chips and salsa, which the salsa was ok.  Overall, a real good experience.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 is we were cramped, most tables/booths didn't look this way, but some booths did.  I will go back and try their fry bread which was nice to see on the menu.

03/27/2009-  I did get to go back and try their fry bread, It was really good, and both times I got really good service, what I forgot to say in the earlier review is that they use real Guacamole, yum!
