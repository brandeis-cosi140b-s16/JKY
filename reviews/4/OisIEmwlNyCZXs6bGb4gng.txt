"Best horchata in Mesa !"

That's the claim of the hospitable hostess slash waitress slash cashier.

"It's made from scratch, not a mix", she says to bolster her point.

Me, I'm no expert on horchatas (or much of anything for that matter), but it's one of the best I've ever had anywhere. For curiosity sake I did try another horchata in Mesa and while it was good you could taste some graininess. 

Go for the large size, trust me.

In addition to excellent horchatas the food is delicious and affordable.
A good size entree with rice, beans and salad for $5.75 ?
A pretty sweet deal.
I had the fish tacos (very good), the beef enchilada (excellent). A generous portion given the price. I had light dinners after eating this for lunch.

It seems that two people do everything here and are quite hospitable and sincere. While making claims of how great the horchata was it came across as less of a brag and more of a statement of pride.  

A great, casual Mexican restaurant with amazing lunch specials..
