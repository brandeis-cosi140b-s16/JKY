Oh I was craving tacos! The thought of biting into a delicous taco with all the fixings had me drooling around yelp trying to find a place near me with grand tacos.  I found NOTHING through the search of "tacos" (which I indeed laughed at because as we all know its the first e.g of what to search for..) All I found was Robertos, and Lindo whatever. I was looking for something that would ease my craving for tacos, not just disappoint me with sorry excuses for tacos...

LUCKY I came across Misti's thread "Taco Time" http://www.yelp.com/topic/las-vegas-taco-time

Shes trying to find taco shops for a taco crawl....the first place I saw someone suggest was Tacos El Compita....so I threw it in the search bar and thought, "Oooohh yes."

This place has some killer tacos. Every bite got me excited for the next. I'm a little sorry when it comes to spiciness so I stuck with the salsa it had on top, which was perfect for me. They, of course, have different salsas and all the other goodies at a bar.
I ordered the 5 tacos for $5.25. Two lenguas, two carnitas, and 1 pollo. Friggin BOMB. 

When that damn Mexican demon craving comes back, I'll know how to put it in its place.  Their tacos are delish. Can't wait to try more!
