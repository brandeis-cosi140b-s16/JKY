On my way to a meeting, I stopped in grab a quick bite. I stopped in at just the right time as a few people were leaving the counter.

As it was my first time at the taqueria, I asked what the recommended. The others at the bar suggested I try both a corn and flour tortilla so that I get the best of both worlds. I chose the vegetarian (black bean) and chicken tacos.

The tacos were ready in a flash and came topped with cheese and a lime on the side. The tacos were both delicious and I think that the black bean was my favorite. Both weren't as flavorful as I would have imagined, I was expecting more of a punch, but you could tell that the quality was there.

This place is pretty small and only seats up to maybe 8 or so at time, so if you're looking for a late night snack, definitely grab and go!
