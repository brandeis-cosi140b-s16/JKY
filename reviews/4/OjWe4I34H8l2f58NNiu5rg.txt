Size does matter! 

That is what they serve here, the burritos must weigh about a pound and a half no matter which one you order. 

I prefer the Carna Asada, Chorizo with Potatoes or Breakfast Burrito with Eggs, Potatoes and Sausage. 

The Carna Asada Tacos are huge served I'm a soft taco and you can barely bend the tortilla because there is so much meat and salsa.

I also like the cheese quesidilla which also is served on an awesome tortilla. 

Everything is very inexpensive and pretty fresh tasting. 

So to sum it up huge portions, cheap prices count me in on coming back for more!
