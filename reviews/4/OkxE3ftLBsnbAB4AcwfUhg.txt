Great food!  Excellent service!  The place is small and busy during the lunch hour, but the service is quick.  I had the chicken chimichanga, which was great.  Love the sour cream too!  The two salsas were both spicy, but good.  I had the sopapillas for dessert with honey and powdered sugar, which were also good.
