Love this place for local, easy Mexican. We always ask for Jorge, whose fun and attentive. I'm a lover of chile relleno and their enchiladas. Being a zonie my whole life, I eat Mexican - well, a lot. Each place has it's specialty and for Serranos it's the relleno. It's a little hot, so prepare with a Patron margarita. Or three. Ah, the good life!
