This place deserves more than the 3 stars it currently has at the time of this writing. I had both the Salt Air Margarita and the Singapore Sling. I don't normally like salted rims on my margaritas because I don't like the texture, but this salted foam was a nice, innovative way to infuse that flavor without the crunchiness. Perfect balance of sweet and citrus with enough punch. The Singapore Sling was also really well done, I could drink those all day. The lengua taco was small, but very soft and juicy.
