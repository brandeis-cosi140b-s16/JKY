went here  for bfast one day and IT WAS AWESOME. nothing to say but AWESOME. went two days later for dinner and was not as impressed but the food was good. too $$$ for my blue collar budget, steak was ok, duck was great. we all had different soups and they were all GREAT. we will try them again next trip.
