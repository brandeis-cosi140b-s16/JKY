Considering chipotle is one of my favorite places to eat, I've been able to frequent many locations in the Las Vegas area. The location on Ft. Apache is by far one of the best not only for freshness but also for service. 

Chips are essential to any "bowl" and they have never disappointed unlike other locations who tend to run out of chips later on in the evening. Not only are they well stocked among other things but they have the friendliest of employees. Everyone from the beginning of the line to the cashier were extremely friendly! Particularly Riqo! 

Keep up the great work Ft. Apache Chipotle! :)
