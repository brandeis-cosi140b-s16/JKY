((Nom nom)) this place is soooo good!! I recommend getting the hand-made guacamole! They make it right at your table! Also their salsa is to die for! I got the sizzling enchiladas (mostly because a yelp review at a picture of it and it looked Devine :) ) yummy! I was full from the guac and salsa it was so hard to eat haha yum! Highly recommend! It's location is hidden and it's sort of a hole-in-the-wall kinda place, but in my experience those are usually the best kind of places!
