Once we figured how to enter threw the enclosed patio we made it to the hostess stand and got seated. The menu is all over the place meaning all kinds of styles of food are offered and they have multiple menus even at lunch time. 

Overall I thought the Spa Menu Salmon Taco Plate was surprisingly good. Instead of a taco shell they thinly sliced fresh juicy jicama ! That's a great idea and it made the tacos very light and refreshing. I was so happy that the salmon tasted fresh and not fishy and was seasoned OK. The plate also came with grilled pineapple and grilled vegetables. The only thing I didn't like at all was the guacamole because it was dark and mushy with a weird thin texture and not such a good flavor. But it was only in a small amount of the taco so I could tolerate it. Overall it was a very nice plate anyway and I'd love to have it again when I'm up here on a hot sunny day.

My husband had the Enchiladas sampler plate with what they called green chile fideo. He liked his plate and said the enchiladas were tastier than he was expecting but the green chili fideo was OK but just seemed like spaghetti with a south west sauce on it instead of toasted pasta like it should be. But he was still overall happy with his meal.

Bigger hits than misses.

Worth a try!
