This place is new in the dreaded location at the south main entrance to Chandler Fashion Square.  I say "dreaded" because every restaurant here has gone out of business for some reason even though the location is ideal for a restaurant.  I think Sir Veza's might be number 4 or 5 since 2001?  I'm not sure why the others failed.  But I digress!!!

The remodel looks great.  Very open with good TV viewing everywhere, and a nice indoor/outdoor seating arrangement.  The staff was Fantastic!  They truly acted like they wanted to be there.  Our server "Fire" was on fire with his service and attitude.  Really nice guy that cared about the place and the customers.

I ordered the 2 taco combo.  They were fantastic and nicely done.  They have an interesting approach to "glueing" two corn tortillas together with cheese to make a bigger taco.   Loved the chips and sides too (charro beans and rice).  Also you could get a "protein style" taco wrapped in lettuce for you low carb types.  I wish they put cheese in those though. (they didn't with my S.O.'s lettuce-wrap taco)

Fire mentioned that they also cater to gluten free people so that's great and unusual for a Mexican joint.

The margaritas were great too, btw!

The only down sides:  

1.  I'd like to see a way to order tacos a la carte though so I could get more taco and no sides.  
2.  The prices are high for the amount of food you get.  $12 for two tacos and beans and rice, and $15 for three tacos and beans and rice.  Ouch!   This could seriously stop many folks from coming back even though they love the food, IMO.

Suggestions:
1.  Add taco take-out at the food-court window.  You can only get hotdogs or something like that now.
