You can't beat online ordering and I used the app to customize the very picky orders of my wife and kids. You can select many ingredients and put in notes. All seemed to be followed to a T. Plus you skip the line when you come to pickup. Don't get greedy on a parking spot. Anywhere in the 28226 on a Friday or Saturday night is a close spot. Wear sneakers. 

It's chipotle. Food quality is good and guac is extra.
