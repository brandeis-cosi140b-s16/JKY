I read a few of the reviews of Mad Mex and quite a few reviewers called their food Tex Mex and I don't see it that way. I see Mad Mex as more Cali Mex with the accent being on fresh ingredients, healthy cooking, and excellent service. The black bean soup is almost fat free and the best I've ever had. (try it Joe D style with a dollop of guac on it instead of sour cream) The lime cilantro salad dressing Is amazing, I've had it on the grilled portobello mushroom salad for a meat free meal. The grilled fish tacos are every bit as good as the famous fish tacos in San Diego. The fish is grilled perfectly, plenty of home made guac, pico, and sour cream accompany this dish. The beer list is a who's who of some of the finest micro brews across the states, including many IPAs which are rotated monthly. You can watch the bartenders squeezing fresh fruits and melons for their huge line ups of margaritas flavors. This little Pittsburgh gem of a restaurant is now opening locations in other cities like Columbus and Philly. There are many locations in the Burgh.
