Mark this.  Yelp saves you time, money and time.  I said time twice cuz it saves you a lot of time...

Pink Taco is like this review (and reviewer): Bi-Polar.  Its both 4 stars and 1star.

Before venturing over to  the congestion of Scottsdale and Camelback, I got on the Yelp machine and read the reviews.  

**  Yelp knowledge summed up: **
1) don't go unless its 10pm on an effen Tues, 
2) don't eat and 
3) expect tourists

Goodness!  It was spot on!

**  Other things bigDucky.Yelp.com is adding:  **
a-) secret parking is down below
b-) location has horrible feng shui (feng shui is translated to mean wind water and it has to do with furniture orientation)
c-) the term berger-douche is high-larry-ass
d-) there are a dozen things going on that gives it a TGIF feel mixed in with a little hooters waitress action.  
e-) I love how the mayor of Scottsdale is ok with PT.  Just don't let it integrate into a Paradise Valley resort unless it is buried behind a curtain like burger joint http://www.yelp.com/biz/XxLGYdB0s8IkZ9QZtGKBZA
f-) Businesses that are confusing tend to go under.  Then Pink Taco peeps would get pink slips :-I
g-) Its right next to a borders books so study breaks at PinkTaco!
h-) It needs a g-spot where drinks are FREE if you sit there
i-) It needs a place for all the tourists to take photos in a cut-out PinkTaco

ohhh!:  I have your new slogan: "Pink Taco-Eating out has never been so hit or miss"

Yelpers nice job analyzing PT a half a dozen ways!

p.s. If you wanna secret parking spot, park under the 7150 Bldng across the street
p.p.s. @James S: So, is that something that youre proud of or embarassed for... It's not like you invented "Waffle-House-of-Pancake-F-Changs"
