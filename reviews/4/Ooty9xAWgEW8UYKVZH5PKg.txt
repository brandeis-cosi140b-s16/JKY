Reviews on W&Js are all over the place.   We stayed at Sams for 5 nights and ate here twice.  Happy both times.   The food was maybe just above average .   We had marguaritas over the rocks (the only way) and were good.   Probably just depends on who is bartending.    1st time, they were perfect.  Not overly sweet with plenty of taquila.   2nd time, they were pretty ordinary but still good.   We sat inside the 1st time and then sat out on the patio which is nice.   The waterfall show is fine but just not while we're trying to enjoy our dinner.   If you have room for dessert, their flan is exceptional.
