The first time I ever had a Molcajete (translation is Mortar and Pestle) was in Puerto Vallarta and it was one of the most delicious meals that I have ever had.  It has been about 6 years since I have had one and yesterday was my lucky day....I found a review on Yelp about a restaurant that served Molcajetes.  As soon as I read the other reviews, I literally could feel my mouth start to salivate.  I had no idea that this existed in Las Vegas....but I knew that I had dinner plans that night.   Three of us met for dinner (2 of us ordered the Molcajetes and the other ordered the fried fish).  The order came out and looked exactly as I remembered in Puerto Vallarta.  It comes in a steaming hot mortar (like a volcanic rock) and is enough for two.  I ordered the chicken and asked if they would also add shrimp (they were very accommodating), the BF ordered the combination (chicken, beef and shrimp) and our friend ordered the Fried Fish (which was a Whole Fish which he thought was delicious).   The Molcajetes were very authentic and very good.  The sauce had a deep, rich flavor that I am sure I will craving for weeks to come (thank God that I have leftovers today).  They also add Roasted Peppers, Limes, Avocados, Radishes, a couple Cactus Leaves, Grilled Green Onions, a small square of fresh cheese and FRESH tortillas for dipping (which is a must).  AND...to top it off....The price is extremely reasonable for the portion size!!  ENJOY
