The food here is good... Really good honestly! Not priced to bad . Can feed a family of 4 for $25 due to there family meal deals! ONLY PROBLEM HERE IS THE place! It's to damn small!!! To many people often times not enough room to sit & it's hot in there! I would go back but never on a weekend. & never to dine in! Service is good. Meat is cooked on grill right before your eyes!
