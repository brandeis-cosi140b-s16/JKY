I still love this place and I got dinner to take home for us here last night.
It was hot and fresh, and oh so good!
Their portions seem a bit smaller than they used to be. But, I am noticing that every where now. 
They still sell everything at a really good prices. They make the tortillas fresh here and everything is nice and hot when you get it.
Their salsa is divine. So good.
I of course got my favorite, Chicken Delight with Verde Sauce. Loved it!
 There staff is really nice always, very happy and friendly. You have to love that. When most people in the Airport are a bit on the Grumpy side.
