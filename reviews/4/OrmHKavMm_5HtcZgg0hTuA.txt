We have ordered take out from here several times and finally stopped in the other day for lunch. They have amazing salsa, lots of cilantro which I happen to love. They don't have many vegetarian options on the menu but they do a have a few. The vegetable burrito was delicious and the portion is huge. The waiters were nice and quick with everything. All in all I would def. go here again and we will continue to get take out from here all the time!
