Overall a great experience. It took a little bit yo get seated, they overlooked us ( each thought the other already took care of us). Once seated it was about 5 min til they took our drink order. After that, our service was great. Food was very good, nice to see bean dip with the chips. I had carnitas enchiladas, would highly recommend.
