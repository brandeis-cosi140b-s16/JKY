Needed some quick, cheap, good food after a long tiring day.  I was wary of Vegas Mexican food, since living in SD/near East LA has raised my expectations for hole-in-the-wall, best-after-11pm Mexican food.  Tiny little place with just a few booths, Francisco the "waiter" (& possibly cook) was hospitable & even brought a gallon jug of water to our table for our group of 6.  The food was exactly what we were looking for.  I had a full-plate of nachos supreme (chips w/ shredded chicken, carne asada AND shredded beef, topped w/ beans, cheese, sour cream, guac & pico de gallo).  Others ordered fish taco, carnitas burrito, chorizo combo plate, beef fajitas combo plate, and chile verde burrito.  Everything was good, but my sister especially liked the carnitas.  Combo plates were ~6.99 and came w/ rice, beans, lettuce, tortillas.  Horchata came from the soda fountain though.
