Having been a fan of the Rice Cafe that was here previously, I was excited. A friend's recommendation was on the mark.

I enjoyed the vegetarian special of the night. The service was nice. The food did take a bit of time but it was freshly prepared. The menu was filled with delicious sounding dishes and the traditional favorites: mojitos, enchiladas, chips, and salsa.
