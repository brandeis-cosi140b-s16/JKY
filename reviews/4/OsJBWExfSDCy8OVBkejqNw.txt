Pretty good! My boyfriend works down the street from here and when he has time to grab some lunch or asks me to pick up lunch for him, Qdoba is always something we agree on. I absolutely LOVE the fact that nothing costs extra. You pay one flat fee for whatever you choose (tacos, burrito, salad) and all the ingredients are all on the table, literally. We have only tried their taco salad with tostada shell bowl. It comes out to just a little less than $10 but that could feed both of us fine. I'm not sure what took us so long to try Qdoba, we have just started going here this year. But we are glad we did.
