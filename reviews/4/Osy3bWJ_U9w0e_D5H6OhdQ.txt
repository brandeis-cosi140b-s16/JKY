The food was most excellent, my first time here with some friends on a birthday. We got sat in a corner, five of us, waitress took our orders and we got served our drinks and didn't come back until we got served our food. I actually had to get up and go find an employee to get us more water. 

I think we got full on ice, chips and salsa by the time we got our food, but it's all good, we got full all over again. 

We didn't see our server again until we got our checks, next time I'm gonna ask we sit in the middle of the restaurant.

Again food was excellent, the service could use some improving. Pay attention, it's not a very big place.
