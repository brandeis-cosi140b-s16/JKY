I stopped by the Huauchinango Mexican Grill about two weeks ago on a Saturday morning around 10am, as I was hoping to be able to score a breakfast burrito of some sort but I would not find one on the menu.  What I did find was a bustling restaurant of smiling faces cheerfully speaking a language that I wish I knew better, chomping away on large plates of food, some dishes recognizable, some not.

Since I was already in the mood for this aforementioned burrito, I decided to order a little lunch sampler for later in the day which included one of each of their three tamales, in addition two tacos, pescado and carnitas - all of which were absolutely fantastic!  There is a sauce bar with three very different and very tasty salsas, too - all available for takeout.

I will note that the entire menu is in Spanish with very few things in English, but if you have any experience with Mexican food at all, you will have no problem navigating this extraordinary menu.

I can't wait to go back!
