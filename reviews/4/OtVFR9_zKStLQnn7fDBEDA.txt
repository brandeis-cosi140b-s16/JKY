I thought the Pink Taco was pretty good. I am not sure about the who gastro intestinal issues other reviewers have had, and I am not sure anyone on Yelp really wants to hear about that. 

Here is the long and the short of the matter. This place is solid. they make all of their own tortillas and chips. I really liked the shrimp tacos. They did a nice job of cooking the shrimp without over cooking them. In addition they had fresh avocado and a spicy mayo sauce thati was just fantastic. 

They always have cold beer and rock on the radio. The atmosphere is pretty electric and the wait staff is very friendly. Make this spot a place to go on your Vegas trip!
