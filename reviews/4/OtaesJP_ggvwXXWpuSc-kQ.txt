Now that's a good tamale! 

It was only one of the three items in my combo - the others were a beef taco and a cheese enchilada. All were tasty, but the tamale (beef-machaca?) took the prize on that plate. Beans and rice were both decent and then I sprinkled on some of the magic dust that was in a shaker on the table. BAM! Awesome spice that seemed to be a mixture of red pepper flakes, chili powder and perhaps a touch of cayenne. Nice. Another sprinkle jar on the table was some nice, fresh Mexican Oregano. All of that was washed down with a full half liter of Mexican Coke. I'm not sure why so many places are now importing Mexi-coke, but I like it. This si the only place I know of that is using the 1/2 liter botles that are returnable. 

Once again, this place features Mexi-coke, but offers Pepsi on the fountain for Coca-cola haters. As much as I like Pepsi, I still gotta have the glass-bottled Cokes. I wish more places would also import the Mexi-Pepsi!

Athena had the Chile Relleno, which she said was very good but perhaps could have used a bit more flavoring in the batter.

The salsas were fresh, but as with almost every salsa these days, it has been gringo-ized and could definitely use more kick. The hot isn't that hot, and it's of the chipotle variety. Is it too hard to make some pico de gallo and toss in a bunch of serranos? Heck - just mince up some serranos and offer them on the salsa bar.

One more note: if you are dining in, there are fresh, tasty tortilla chips available under the heat lamp at the salsa bar.
