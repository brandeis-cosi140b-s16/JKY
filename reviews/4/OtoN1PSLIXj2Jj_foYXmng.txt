Here is AZ we find it difficult to find authentic Mexican food, those types of place that look like they are going out of business but the line to place your order is at least  a 10 minute wait.  But you know the food is worth it.  This is one of those places, the food is authentic not fast food or Chipotle style food, real Mexican food.  The portions are generous and the menu is massive, they also serve breakfast all day.

So if you are tired of Taco Bell, Chipotle, and the other places that try to make Mexican food, give this place a try.
