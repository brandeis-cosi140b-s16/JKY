Fantastic food, great service, cool ambience.
The server made a mistake on my order and gave me a red burrito instead of a green. He removed it from my check without me asking. I thought this was pretty cool. I had a red chili burro & my wife had a tostada.
Both were fantastic and the price was right. We ordered off the lunch menu.

They could probably pick up their game on their chips and salsa. That withstanding, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit.
