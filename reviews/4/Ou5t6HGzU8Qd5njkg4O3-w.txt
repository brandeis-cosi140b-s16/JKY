This place is just down the street which is awesome.. it has great salsa.. and a decent selection of entrees.. The prices are also in the right range. I had the Del Mar which is a seafood enchilada dish and it was quite good!

The best thing was their service.. Chris H. was our waiter and he was on his game! My son downs his soda in minutes and he never waited for a refill.. (that's impressive..)

I would give 5 stars if the margarita had been better.. lime on the rocks and it tasted like a premixed drink without a drop of tequila in it.. 

All in all it was a nice dinner and I would definitely go back..
