I rate all chipotle locations on the following factors 1) meat portions  2) how clean the lobby is ....


With that said this chipotle is usually pretty good about adhering to Chipotle's meat policy (a full scoop ) every once in a while you'll have an employee who finesses the meat portions but that doesn't happen to often. The lobby is usually clean. Lastly , the line moves pretty swiftly. 

Overall , chipotle is good , affordable and cheap. You usually know what you're getting.
