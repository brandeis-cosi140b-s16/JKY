Good ol' Chipotle. You can always count on Chipotle for a great bite and this location was no different. The staff was friendly and service was swift as expected. 

The food tasted on point to the greatness that is Chipotle and one of the staff members came and cleared our tray and asked us about our food. 

Chipotle. Yas, Queen.
