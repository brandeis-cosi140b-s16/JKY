We went to the Salted Lime last night for a New Year's Eve dinner. We had a great experience from being seated by the hostess to great service from our waitress Lyndsey. Definitely order the bacon wrapped shrimp  appetizer which was excellent,  a lttle pricey but very good. For dinner we had the beef chimichanga and shrimp & chicken fajitas both were great especially the chimichanga, the beef was very tender. Looking forward to our next visit.
