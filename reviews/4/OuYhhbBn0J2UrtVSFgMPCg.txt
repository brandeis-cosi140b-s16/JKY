I am always looking for local breweries.  Hit the place up on my own since I was by  myself in town on recommendation from some people.

I had an IPA which was nice.  The atmosphere was awesome. Waitress was friendly and the BBQ chicken pizza was very good. Over all happy with the place and would love to come back with a group of people.
