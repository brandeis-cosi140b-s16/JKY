Probably would have given it five stars for the food except that the tortilla chips were really spicy to me, I am a wimp about spicy food.  They put some kind of hot seasoning on them.  I think the salsa was spicy too but couldn't tell because the chips already spiced me out.  So I didn't eat them.  Good for the diet but disappointed because I love tortilla chips!  I had the Chimichanga Mediterranea which was EXCELLENT.  Plump yummy shrimp on top, the chimichanga itself was very good, rich and flavorful.  Probably a zillion calories. Came with white rice which was cooked well, and grilled vegetable which were great except the zuchini was bitter as it often can be.   Service was okay except it took a while for them to take my payment.  I was a single diner and it wasn't very busy when I went for dinner on a Tuesday night.  I'd go again and have the same thing, or maybe try the shredded beef chimichanga.
