Very good. I love their tacos al pastor. Very good portions so go hungry. Their margaritas are delicious I think they have a promotion right now on Tuesdays (margaritas 2x1) haven't go on a Tuesday but definitely a will go soon. My husband ordered their enchiladas with chile the Ã¡rbol sauce and he love it (this sauce is HOT so be careful). Overall, very good mexican restaurant. We'll be back.
