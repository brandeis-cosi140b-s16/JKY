I really like this El Pollo Location. There's always some on going promotion or coupons in circulation. The service is fast and friendly even throughout lunch rush. The last time I went here it was going to take a long time for them to cook my taquito so the manager gave me a free taco so I could start eating while I waited. I love the side selection variety and the salsa bar. This place makes it easy to eat relatively healthy for cheap. Although this is a chain I would gladly welcome them into my neighborhood over a Del Taco any day.
