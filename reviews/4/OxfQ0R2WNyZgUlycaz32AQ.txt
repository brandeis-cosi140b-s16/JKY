Hungry and in a odd area visiting a friend late at night, we stopped in for some noms. We've been in the same situation before and remembered it being good the last few times we got food here. 

This time the BF got a California burrito and I got a carnitas burrito. It was pretty good flavor and there wasn't odd chewy or dry spots, only nice and juicy meat. Only "bad" thing about it was it needed a tad more seasoning on the meat as adding tad of salt brought the meat out. The guacamole and salsa was fresh tasting which can be a bit shaky with some of these late night Mexican food places. Their burritos are also on the heavy side- more generous with the filling than most. 

It's definitely fresher tasting and seems a bit more consistent in quality and flavor than Robertos and other late night Mexican.
