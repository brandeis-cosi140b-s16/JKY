Amazing New Mexico cuisine!  I highly recommend the Carne Adovada with eggs for brunch or dinner... It has so much flavor with just the right amount of heat to make it enjoyable to the pallet.  My next favorite is the chili relleno stuffed with pork.  Can't get enough of this place.  Our server Susanna was amazing and is a definite must to sit in her area.  Great food and great service, what a winning combination!
