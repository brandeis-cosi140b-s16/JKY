I am thankful for the other reviews that pointed me to this place. I love the breakfast burritos, just pay the small charge for the cheese, its worth it. I have also tried the tacos, ok, and the chimichanga, very good! The owner comes out to the tables most times we are there, seems like a very nice person.
