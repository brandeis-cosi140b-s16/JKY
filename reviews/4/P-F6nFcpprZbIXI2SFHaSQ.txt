This is a restaurant which offers a variety of Mexican  street foods and snacks. This is a really clean restaurant and the staff is very friendly. They sell sandwiches, flautas, tortas, salads, and even have ice cream. The food is tasty however if you get a Torta make sure to ask for it on fresh instead of it being fried(makes it soggy) check out this place
