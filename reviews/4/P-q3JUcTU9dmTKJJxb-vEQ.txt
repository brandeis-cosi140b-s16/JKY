I went to a seminar here and as that didn't thrill me so much I made a move to the bar area to see what that was about. 

Crafty drinks, nice conversational atmosphere, and the food was killer.

Highly recommend the guac! Nice and chunky so you could see it was just made in house.  I couldn't make my mind up on what burrito so I went with the tacos.  The plate comes with 3 so I went with the barbacoa and al pastor.. They load each one up with meat and the toppings are prime.  Ill definitely be back
