Not a bad restaurant. Atmosphere and Deco was a little cheesy! Service was very good. The guy checked on us many times and was very friendly. He brought us a new bowl of chips and salsa after 5 minutes. I really liked their roasted pepper salsa. We ordered the appetizer platter and a combo meal, which included a burrito and a taco, plus rice and beans. They were both very good and the portions were big. We ended up only eating half of the appetizer sampler and not even touching the other one. I probably wouldn't make an extra trip to go there but it was a good alternative to the restaurants in that area.
