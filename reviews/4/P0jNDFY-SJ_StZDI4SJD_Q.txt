I am a HUGE fan of Rubio's Fish Tacos with flour tortilla of course. I don't think I have had fish tacos anywhere else that was so yummy! The fish is always crispy and tender in the middle and the cabbage isn't overbearing and overstuffed. I also love the fact that Rubio's has a salsa bar that you can pick different salsas out. When I'm feeling for something a  lil healthier this is the place that I go to....although I'm not sure how deep fried anything is healthier.
