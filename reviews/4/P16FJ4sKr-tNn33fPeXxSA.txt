Okay, the Betos isn't going to win any international awards for culinary subtlety but dammit if it isn't an institution.  And, yes, you'll hear the haters talking the mess about the 'Tos being just for late-night drunken gorging.  False.  Slander!  Their chimichanga, paragon of authentic Northern Mexican cuisine, I know -- is otherworldly in its cheesy, meaty assault.  The carne asada burrito -- aka "the donkey dick" -- is abusively delicious, as are the breakfast burritos.  AND, as a bonus, I've never gotten ill from eating there in ten or so years of loyal patronage.

And to address to accusations of cats being used to supplement the meats, as my buddy once pointed out, "If this is what cat tastes like, it's all good."

And don't be fooled -- they're not open on Xmas Day.  That's why they get four instead of five stars.  Bullshit.
