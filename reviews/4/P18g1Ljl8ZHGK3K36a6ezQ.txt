Any good sandwich starts with the bread. The torta roll was soft, sweet, and lightly toasted.  They used a sweet mayo which I normally don't like, but it worked so nicely with the meat.  I got pork...Mmmmmmmm!  It was tender and tasty!  The thing that made this torta so delicious, was the avocado.  They generously covered the roll with soft perfectly ripe avocado...and it was warm. They also put a little pickled jalape√±o which added a nice tang.  I could have used a little more heat.  If I lived out here, this place would be a regular spot!
