I had to stop by and find out what Guy Fierre was talking about. I was not disappointed. The food was very good. The atmosphere, not so much. Its inside of a gas station. The people who were working were very knowledgeable and friendly. I will definitely stop by again when I am out that way and and craving a little Mexican food.
