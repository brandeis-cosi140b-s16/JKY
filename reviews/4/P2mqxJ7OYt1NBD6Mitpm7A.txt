Quite honestly, I've never been as enamored by the Fox restaurants as other seem to be. I mean, I like them, and I've never had a bad experience at one, but I just don't go as crazy for them as others seem to. 

The first time I went to Blanco Tacos (the Scottsdale location) I didn't like it at all. All I remember was having a bland over-priced quesadilla that left me with no real desire to come back,

Well, a friend from out of town was staying in this area for work so I met them for HH here. Honestly, that might be the reason I had a pretty positive experience. If you knock a few bucks off drinks and apps during the early evening hours I'm generally pretty happy. 

I had a couple margs and they were good. Nothing necessarily stood out about them, but they were a little more on the strong side & not real sweet so I was happy. 

We split some apps as well. Again, everything was good, but nothing really stood out. We had guacamole & the queso blanco dip. I have to say, I REALLY like the standard salsa they the give you, It has a bit of kick, but is still tasty. 

At the end of the day Blanco has a solid HH that I'd come back to. I should note that they are strict about the cut-off time. We ordered a round of margs, like, right after 6 (honestly, I'm pretty sure we got them right at 6) and were charged full price on them. We didn't say anything, and it wasn't a big deal, but I just thought it should be noted.
