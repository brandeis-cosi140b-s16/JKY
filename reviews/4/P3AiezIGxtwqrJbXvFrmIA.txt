For my first fish taco experience, I have to say I'm impressed. I had the pleasure of devouring the bbq mahi taco with the creamy cilantro sauce. My husband had the chicken quesadillas(which was also awesome) Music was great. The setting was nice. Music was Parking not so nice. We were lucky to snag a spot nearby but if it was any busier, we would have been SOL. But we enjoyed the experience and we will be back :)
