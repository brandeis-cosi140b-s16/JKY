After my last review I received a sincere note from John the owner inviting me back to see the changes he had made the menu since my last visit. I have had a chance to visit twice since then and John and his staff have out done themselves. The food is wonderful (I recommend the grilled steak burrito enchilada style). With the new menu changes it qualifies as a traditional Mexican food restaurant. For those of you that frequent Jalapeno's in north Scottsdale this is a great alternative. Check it out!
