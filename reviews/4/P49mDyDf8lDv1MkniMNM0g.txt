I'd give the food a 5 and the service a 2.5-3. Went for Father's Day dinner tonight. The fish ceviche and green sauce appetizer they bring to all tables is wonderful! Only wish it hadn't taken 15 min for our drink order to be taken because it has some kick. We also had the guacamole which was fresh and super reasonable. So delicious. Great selection of bottled Mexican beers too. We had fish tacos, prawns, grilled mussels, shrimp empanadas, pork tacos, crab tostada, steak tacos and fried shrimp between the five of us. It was all wonderful. 

I will definitely be back and hopefully the service is faster so I can change my rating to a five. It is super authentic Mexican seafood so don't expect anything texmex. The majority of the clientele were Hispanic as well which can vouch for the authenticity in my opinion too.

Glad we took the chance to come and try something different.
