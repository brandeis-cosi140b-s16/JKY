One Liner: Some of the best Tacos

Food: (scale of 0-4) 3.2
This hole in the wall is apparently famous for the green tamales. Personally, I loved the tacos. (pork mexican tacos especially). The salsa was awesome as well. I could never have enough of it. It's good that we had to pay a small amount for it. I wouldn't feel bad ordering seconds after seconds.
