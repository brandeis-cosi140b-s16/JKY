The food here is great! I learned about them after they won "Best Taco" at a taco festival in Tucson. The first time I went, I ordered their BBQ tacos and they were delicious. I really enjoyed it and had to come back for more! They have a special called 100 days of summer where you can order a la carte tacos, rather than ordering off of the menu and getting 3 of the same kind. It was an awesome deal and I got 4 different kinds.
