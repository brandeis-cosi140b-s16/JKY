Okay-tacos are delicious and the staff are super friendly...I didn't care for the ambience since it was a bit loud to carry on any conversation and one ladies bathroom for a packed place is ridiculous.....

Frankly, the tacos are the BEST so it doesn't matter if there are no available bathroom, loud music, long wait.. It is worth it :-)
