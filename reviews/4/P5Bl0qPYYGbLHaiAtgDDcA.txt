I stopped by here one day because I was craving some traditional tacos. I just moved to this side of town, and I notice it's lacking flavor, (the area not Tony's.) 

I ordered 4 carne asada soft tacos, 1 carne asada sope.

The tacos were EXACTLY what I was looking for. The meat was so tasty and juicy with some crunchy bits in it. They were topped with cilantro and onion. They came with some limes and hot sauce. The tacos were waaaay better than Roberto's, which seems to be the only Mexican restaurant in this general area aside from Baja Fresh.

The sope was good too, it had a whole tomato slice on top which was kind of weird but still good. 

I also got an horchata. I have been craving some homemade horchata so it was only natural I try it out. It was just okay, I think it may have tasted better a few hours prior to my arrival because it was a little watery but you can still taste the milk base and sweetness. 

All in all it was 10 dollars for my feast, and it was well worth the price. I got take out so I didn't get to try the chips and salsa, or the service. From what I saw, this place is pretty empty most of the time, the cashier was really friendly and the food comes out fast. Me likey.
