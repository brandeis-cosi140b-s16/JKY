We had our local "Lunch Club here on Wednesday and everyone had the Taco Buffet. I was surprized when I saw all the other items in the buffet. I tried a little of everything and loved it all. They have a nice side room if you want to hold a meeting or event like we did. The service was prompt and they handled our group of 35+ without a hitch. Thanks, We'll be back often!!
