Does anyone remember when this place was Safari nightclub?  Because of my fond memories of drunken nights of debauchery at Safari in the 90's, I WANTED to boycott this place and hate it...

but damn if they haven't won me over.

As others have said, the food isn't over the top spectacular...but solid, reasonably priced, and there are a few noteworthy treats on the menu:  nopales (quite authentically prepared), queso con chorizo, and some delicioso-flaming-platanos-drizzled-in-something-or-other-vaguely-alcoholic.   mmmmmm....

The convenience factor is what keeps bringing me back to El Patron.  In and out with no headaches.  Right on Maryland Pkway, easy parking right there, never a wait, instant seats and service...and waiters who remember my orders.  Its also, nice, dark and subdued inside...and you know me...obsessed with all non-neon-slots-stucco-vegas-y places hidden in Vegas.
