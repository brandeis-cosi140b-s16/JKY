The prices are little higher (still way cheaper than in Hawaii) than Zef's but the portions are HUGE! I had a fish burrito $4.75, rolled tacos $5.50 (YUM) and my MIL had the carnitas plate (enough for two) and my husband the al pastor burrito. Their menu is a lot more expansive as they are a full restaurant. They even have senior discounts too! 

I love the guacamole here, it's nice and chunky and they gave a lot on their rolled taco order. 

The location is kind of out of the way from my In-law's place but not far. Its kind of in a dusty shopping center. The restaurant itself was clean, but not the newest in decor. However, it seems they have a steady following of patrons as their staff is attentive and friendly. I'll come back here and sit down to eat and try something else, as I only did take out and did just quick food (burritos). My recap:

Pros:
-Huge portions for pretty inexpensive prices
-Happy Hour and Senior discounts
-Good food

Cons:
-Their take out is SLOW. Call in a head of time to avoid waiting 20 minutes or so. We should of done that, we just walked in and ordered and tho there wasn't a full house of people, I wondered why it took so long. Other folks just walked in and picked up...smart.
