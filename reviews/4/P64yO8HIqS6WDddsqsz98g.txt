We were looking for a taco truck and found this funny little place. The food was good and the service was friendly. As previously stated the speaker doesn't work so you order, pay and get your good from one window. We ordered rolled tacos, beef and chicken tacos. The rolled ones were smothered in guacamole and cheese. Add some of the red or verde sauce for a little extra pizazz. The beef taco was shredded, the chicken was phenomenal. We'd highly recommend it. From the outside the place looks a little sketch, but sometimes those are the best places.
