I like Taco Bell. The variety they offer is exceptional and it allows me to orders something new every time. So, on the visit to this particular Taco Bell last week, I ordered some 10 items and the time they took to get it ready was not even 10 minutes. 

The Lacos-Tacos are a good twist to the traditional taco.

I was super impressed with the staff. Somehow, I forgot to pick one of the items that I ordered. The girl at the register, ran to me, all the way to the parking to hand it over.
