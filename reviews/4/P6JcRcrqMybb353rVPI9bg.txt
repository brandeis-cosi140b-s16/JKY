We were just out and about, stopped in. My expectations were drop kicked to the curb. This place was awesome. I really enjoyed the food. The beans seemed home made like my momma's.  The service was awesome. It was very clean and really enjoyable. I will be back to combat my hangovers with some good ceviche.
