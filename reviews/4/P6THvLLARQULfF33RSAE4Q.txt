Eaten here a few times, and while it's not much to look at, the food is pretty darn tasty, flavorful and a little spicy. If you're looking to burn your mouth (and ass) this probably isn't your place. The beans and rice are consistently yummy, I've tried the red and green chile meat, tacos, tamales with red and beef, and the pollo fundido, and never been disappointed. They also have coke in the bottle, yay! 
They cool the outdoor seating area, which is shaded, and it helps, but if you're  a wuss, get it to go. 
I'd up it to 5 stars if they didn't take only cash. Who carries cash anymore?
