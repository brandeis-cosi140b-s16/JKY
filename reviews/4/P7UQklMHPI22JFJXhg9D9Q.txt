Just had brunch with the family, restaurant was comfortably busy.  We were seated in the patio garden, very nice setting.  Four different menu items were selected, everyone was pleased with their meals.  There was one error made by the kitchen in misreading the ticket but this was quickly corrected.  Our waitress was a little frosty but highly efficient nevertheless.  The pace was great, desserts were particularly good.  Amazed by the impressive wine list; looking forward to returning perhaps in the evening next time.
