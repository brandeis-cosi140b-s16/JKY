My group of 4 visited the place just over a wk ago. The food was good. I only had wine so I can't tell u how their cocktails are. 
I had the cheese stuffed bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer for my dinner, I wasn't very hungry to begin with. It was FANTASTIC!!!! I shoulda ordered two!! Lol. My hubby had a chimichanga thing he said it was good but wasn't hot enough-he loves the spicy! The other two with us had salads and tacos which they were very pleased. 
Now seriously, I can do without the singing ppl, I think it's a nice gesture, but I didn't want nor asked for it. The woman looked over at my table-right at me as they were finishing with the other table. I politely shook my head and mouthed "no". I continue to have conversation with my husband and whaddya know.. This heffer is standing right next to me singing in my ear. So I said "no no no.. I'm sorry, thank u but no" I felt a little bad but I was not into that at the moment. 
That should really be optional.!
