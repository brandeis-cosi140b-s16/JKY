I can't believe all the poor reviews.  This is, after all, a fast food restaurant.  I have been there 10  or 12 times and the employees have always been friendly.  They have a decent selection of sides and the chicken is far better, and healthier,  than any of the KFCs or Churches I have tried in the area.  Always like picking up a to go order there when the grand kids are in town.
