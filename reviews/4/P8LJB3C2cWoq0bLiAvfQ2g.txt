I don't know what all the other bad reviews are about but I had Tres Pesos last night and was very satisfied. The chips and salsa brought out on the house were quite good. The chips were warm and the salsa was flavorful and spicy. I ordered the chimichanga but had them make it vegetarian style. Inside it was stuffed with re-fried beans, onions, bell peppers and mushrooms. on top it was layered with a nice cheese sauce. On the side my dish came with beans and rice with guacamole and sour cream with lettuce and tomatoes. I left happy and will definitely return!!!! On top of all of that my server was awesome!
