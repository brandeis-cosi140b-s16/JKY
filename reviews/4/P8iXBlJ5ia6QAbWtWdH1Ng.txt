My first time Chipotle was sometime last year. It was one of the best things, and I fell in love with Chipotle. The service is fast and the food is great. I love their chicken tacos and burrito bowls and they have tons of other great choices. If you love Mexican food, I would definitely suggest trying  it out!!
