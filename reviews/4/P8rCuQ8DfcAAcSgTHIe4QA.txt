My biggest complaint in restaurant food these days is that its over seasoned and in particular too salty.

El Picante is not guilty of that.  The flavors are fresh and clean and delicate.   Traditional mexican meats and beans and rice,  good tortillas, and you can put it together how you like it.

Very inexpensive, good take out as not much atmosphere in seating area.

the portions are a bit small on the tacos and the servings are a bit inconsistant depending on who's making your plate,  but the good flavor is worth it. 

if you want easy quick food, thats flavorful and not greasy...go to el picante.
