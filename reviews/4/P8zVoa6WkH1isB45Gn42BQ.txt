Consistently good food, decent prices, friendly service.

Been here twice so far...
got fish tacos the first time ($13.99 for 3)
enchilada + chile relleno most recently 

food has always been good, nothing to write home about and nothing amazing but definitely above average

the free salsa + bean dip they provide with chips is delicious

+points for clean bathrooms
