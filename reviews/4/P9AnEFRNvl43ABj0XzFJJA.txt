Macayo's isn't a bad place for a sit down Mexican restaurant. They certainly do have their marguerita specials!

Since they don't have any actual vegetarian options, I went with a salmon and vegetable dish with refried beans (because whole beans are bs in my opinion). It was pretty good, and everyone I was with was happy with what they got.

As I say just about everywhere, I would like to see some actual vegetarian options that aren't: cheese items, fish items, egg items, or all onions and peppers/rice and beans. Real vegetables, no fillers or condiments piled onto nothing. Its pretty easy to find vegetarian dishes in Mexico, I don't know who it is so hard to find them at Mexican restaurants. Just sayin...
