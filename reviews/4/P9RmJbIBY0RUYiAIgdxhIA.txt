LOVE THIS PLACE! The owner is always behind the counter cooking my food fresh ready to order. And they deliver for free no delivery charge! Even though I tip anyways. And once again the owner delivers my food somtimes in a hair net haha.The food is the best most authenic quick mexican food I've had in this area and I haven't found anything that compares. I'm from Chicago and i personally feel the Mexican food is awful out here.. maybe its the desert or cheap products. Anyways the fresh gauc and salsa mmmmyum but some reason they don't make their chips or even have good corn chips. That is the only reason I took it down to 4 star. They look like fritos! I hate those, I just use different chips from the mexican market I buy at home to eat the delicious salsa. Ill recommend they should at least have better chips. Also the interior has little atmosphere,  but with a little work they could decorate. The walls are white , some pictures up of family, you can see through the kitchen and hear everything. Not the best place to eat at but I enjoy there company and good food so atmosphere is not a priority when I visit. I've eatn the tacos all the meats offered are great..the carne asada is the best, but my go to is the chicken grilled burrito...so good. My boyfriend LOVES the chili relleno burrito, gets it almost everytime.all in all one of my favorites and I'm having it for lunch now ;)
