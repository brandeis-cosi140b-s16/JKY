There are not many places where you can get good food at very reasonable prices.  This is comfort Mexican done well, clearly the same way forever here.  What seems to have stayed the same over the years are the prices.  $3 for a bean burrito, $5 for a chimi.  Re-opening look the same with a new a clean kitchen.  Also, free refills on drinks and chips!  That's a good change.  Now that Don Jose is back, so will I.
