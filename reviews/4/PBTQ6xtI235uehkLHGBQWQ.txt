As an avid Chipotle-goer (and ex-employee) for 15 years, I'm pretty critical when I visit a new location.  My first visit to this location felt right.  It was fast, the people were energetic, the store was clean, the procedures were right on.  It's been consistent since that day, and helps to keep my Chipotle love alive!
