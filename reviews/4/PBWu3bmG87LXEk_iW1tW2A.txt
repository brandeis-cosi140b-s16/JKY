Mexican restaurant chains...what can I say.  Some are better than others and if you compare OTB to "family" owned Mexican restaurants then you aren't being fair.   OTB is really good for what it is.  Their salsa and chips are unique and tasty. Their Guacamole Live is my favorite.  The serve Dos Equis on tap and Negro Modelo in a bottle which they used to have on tap but no more (shame).
Taco Tuesday is the day we go.  Cheap and good.  An after work dinner that won't break the bank.  We almost always sit in the cantina and Kelly is the best.  Great friendly service with a smile.  Thanks Kelly!  
It can get busy and longer than usual wait times are expected but that gives me more time to drink beer and scarf down chips.
Overall OTB is our go to restaurant especially for the specials.  By some of the other reviews it seems you can't please everyone but they must be doing something right because they seem to always be busy.
