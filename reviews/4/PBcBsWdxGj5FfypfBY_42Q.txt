This is my pick for the best Mexican food in the valley. I've been coming here since I first came to PHX, in '98. The only caveat is that you must either be OK with sitting in a cramped booth or visit during off-peak hours. The chips and salsa are my "Best of the Valley". Plus, the faded steer leaning against a cactus logo is a fave. I actually rocked the shirt during college.
