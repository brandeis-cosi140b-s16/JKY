I was greeted as soon as I walked in, everyone was so nice and made me feel welcome! That's a big plus! 

Not to mention the tacos are to die for. I've been to Tacos el Gordo and Taco y Taco, but I like Taco Tijuana so much better! I had the adobada or al pastor tacos with everything. The avocado creama and pineapple slice on them makes the marinade on the al pastor really come to life! I ordered a burrito to go and can't wait to crack into it for lunch!!

If you're looking for great authentic tacos. Taco Tijuana is the place! I'll be a returning customer from now on!
