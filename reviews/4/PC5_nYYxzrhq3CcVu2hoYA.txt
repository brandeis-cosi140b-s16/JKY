So it comes to this! I am writing a review on a fast food joint. Why would I do that? Imma tell you! DORITO SHELLS!!!!! That's why!

Once up on a time, I was a pretty big fan of the Bell. Pretty good grub for a pittance. But as the years went by the beef filling got thinner and thinner and the lettuce started taking up it's place. I was there for a beef taco, not a lettuce taco with beef flavoring.  

But NOW they've gone and done it. Take the traditional shell and turn it into a Dorito chip. STFU!!!!!!! I would like to kiss, square on the lips, whoever came up with this idea (yep, even a guy, don't mind smooching a man for an idea this good!).  Seriously, I would cover the medical bills if this person broke their arm patting themselves on the back.

As a bonus for this visit, there was a fellow named George who was doing pretty much the entire front side of the business. At one time he was ringing my order up on one register while finishing payment for another customer on another! It was like watching a yo-yo-er yo-yo-ing with both hands. Kudos' to George, you deserve a raise.

"Why then, Vic, are you only giving 4 out of 5 star's, when you obviously enjoyed your visit", you may ask.(and you may)

Three words: Not Enough Beef!
