Happened to be in the area at Hair Plus. I was so hungry in between running errands I thought it would be a good time to check it out. I just grabbed a steak burrito and it was very good. It reminded me of my Santa Barbara days. The steak was seasoned and not skimpy. The rice was also good, not too bland or salty. The burrito came with beans, steak, guac, sour cream and lettuce. The lettuce was unusual but it added a layer of freshness. I only gave four stars because I did not sample the chicken which seems to be the moniker of the establishment.
