This is an above average Taco Bell. I don't think I could ever give a Taco Bell 5 stars, but this one was really great. It's one of the newer updated ones, so the inside area was really nice. 

We ordered for a family of four, and although it was a little bit of a wait, everything tasted really fresh and good. If I'm craving Taco Bell anytime I'm near this one, I won't hesitate to visit again for the good food, nice atmosphere and friendly employees!
