I have been a customer at this restaurant for the last 20 years. I love Mexican food and seek out new mexican food restaurants wherever I go. The shrimp cocktails and green chili burritos at Susie's are excellent. There is a quick turnaround on food to go which I have made use of on many occasions for lunch or as food gifts. I recommend this restaurant, the service is good, and the staff is dedicated.
