I've eaten at this Garduno's as well as a couple in Albuquerque. The food is consistently good, if not a tad overpriced for the quantity you receive. Service is usually decent, although a few times I had to ask for refills on my beverage, which is a no-no with me if you want a really good tip. The decor at all of them is very nice with a very comfortable atmosphere. The Chandler location used to have a roaming female mariachi band who were superb, but I haven't seen them for awhile.
I'd recommend this restuarant, but beware the carne adobada. That was the hottest stuff I've ever tasted.
