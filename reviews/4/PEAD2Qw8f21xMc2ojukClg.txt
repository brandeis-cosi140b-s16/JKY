Excellent food and service! Came here for breakfast, sat outside in the sun looking over the park and mall - really nice! Tried the smoked brisket skillet, the Juevos Rancheros, the Tequila raisin walnut pancakes and the tres letches French toast - I know what you think and yes I'm that kind of a breakfast pig. Coffee was good and plentiful. Can't wait to come back for lunch.
