I've been going to this place for years.  I love the fact that they serve grilled veggies and a wide variety of them.  I also enjoy their inexpensive margaritas, enjoy their chips and salsa, and the laid back atmosphere.  This is a true hole in the wall, but this establishment's food and margaritas are the treasure in that hole!
