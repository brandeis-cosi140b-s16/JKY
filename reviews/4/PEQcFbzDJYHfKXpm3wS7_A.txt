This place is pretty straight forward. It's very much where the local Madison resident population hangs out/gets their food. I could see the food being less consistently good at times just because the place seems very informal. 

The price is right though and it hasn't bit me yet. Portions aren't too shabby and they have everything you might need.  Take a ride on the wild side, head done Park St. and give this simple but more authentic joint a chance.
