We've been here many times since it opened. I am glad they finally removed what was by far the  most ridiculous and ugly wall graffiti  infesting the walls of the entire place (and it was done by some famous artist...I guess that explains it). Well, at least now it's warmer and you don't have to wander if the stuff on the wall is a finger or a penis.
Service is warm and comfortable without being pretentious.
The menu is quite accommodative and the dishes are very tasty. Not being as pricy as most strip restaurants is an added bonus. They charge $0.50 per person for water....not the greatest thing, but in the Vegas frame of mine, I will not let it bother me.
Ask questions to make sure you know what it is on your plate. Find what sounds good, and chances are very good that you will find it delicious.
Always looking forward to coming back here.
