This place has delish pupusas! Can't speak for the other dishes, but I can't wait to come back and try more. There is a bit of a language barrier but the wait staff are friendly. They close at 8 which I think is due to the neighborhood. Decor is weird since the ceiling looks like it should belong in an Italian joint (fake vineyard look complete with grapes). 

Minus 1 star for 20 minute wait for two pupusas to go.
