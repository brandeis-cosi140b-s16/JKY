Very good service, friendly people, and hot, fresh food are what it's about for me and I got all of these both times I've gone to this location. I really like Del Taco and for the money, they are a good value. 

The only downfall I see to this location is it looks a bit trashy outside due to lightrail construction and scattered shopping carts here and there. You see the occasional strange character outside the restaurant but otherwise not bad. Easy to get in and out of as well, despite the lightrail construction.
