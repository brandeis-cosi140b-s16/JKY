On the hunt for good cheap Mexican, I decided to drop in having passed by for years without stopping into any of the numerous taquerias along Trop. Their potato taco is awesome! It is huge and fried, with rich and savory potato filling. I also tried a beef sope which was ok, the shell was a little soggy and a little chewy. If that weren't enough, I also had the barbacoa plate which came with a TON of meat, very nicely spiced. Great value, good taste, not a bad place to stop into.
