Delicious food and great service! We were however disappointed when we ordered the "tableside  guacamole" and were told the "cart" was backed up and asked if it would be ok if they made it in back and brought it out to us, we were looking forward to watching it be freshly prepared at out table. Again the food was superb! And the chef even came out to greet each table and introduce himself. Try this place you won't regret it!
