I will be very brief.......the food is fantastic,!!!!!

The service is hard to figure out though. Lots of staff but we were constantly looking for our waiter, the water guy, the plate remover guy. All seemed to be on break simultaneously. I strongly recommend eating at the bar until they get the staff better trained.
