I come to Phoenix for work a lot and this is always a place my co-workers and I come to when we're in town.  There's really nice outdoor seating with some misters to cool you down on a hot summer day. 

They always provide you with chips and salsa which are AH-MAY-ZING.  It's not your typical tortilla chips and salsa there's something extra special about these chips.  

It's your standard tex-mex cuisine.  I really like their shrimp taco's.  The carnitas platter was pretty good but the pork was a bit too salty for me.  Their fajitas are always good.  The salmon is also pretty good.  Those are the typical dishes I get when I go.  

When you end the meal they always give you white chocolate tamales to clean/cool your palate.  Always delish. ...

The place hasn't really disappointed me except for this past week when we purchased two pitchers of the Grand Canyon margaritas and there was more juice than there was tequila.  :-\  but other than that it's pretty good.
