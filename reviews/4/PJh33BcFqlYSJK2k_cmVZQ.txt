Love this place, it's my go to place for spicy cheap eats! Always, great food with service that's fast and friendly! I've been coming here for so long that she knows my order, and chuckles because she knows I am going to order my usual quesadilla with jalapenos and a carne asada mini taco. (which comes with two corn tortillas so I always make two tacos out of it as not to wear it) The quesadilla is made from a huge soft tortilla, the jalapenos are fresh and spicy and it it smothered and melted into cheese perfection. The carne asada taco is filled with flavor and covered in pico de gallo & guacamole. They have great tasting red and green sauce if you want to add more heat, of course I always do.  It's the perfect place to go if your craving something quick and spicy!
