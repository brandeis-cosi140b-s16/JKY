El Burro has some of the best burritos in Pittsburgh. Also, their chips & salsa is awesome. Their chips taste homemade & their salsa is homemade & has just the right amount of spice (not too spicy). I love their breakfast burrito which comes with egg, cheese, fries & pico. I tried their potato taco & fish taco one time & I wasn't really impressed. The tacos were kind of dry & not a lot of flavor. I'll stick with their burritos. Highly recommend El Burro.
