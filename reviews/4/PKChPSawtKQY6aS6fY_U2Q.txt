OK, so I can barely drive by this place without stopping, I go today and meet one of my friends, I am excited that I am with someone so I can order more food and share and maybe, just maybe, try something different than the Al Pastor tacos.  So I order, 2 Pastor tacos and chicken enchiladas.  My spanish is muy malo, but I knew when she said ensalada that it wasn't a good sign.  We got a good chuckle out of it and ate our stupid shredded lettuce salad.  You know, I didn't even say anything.  Donde esta mi bicycleta?  SÃ© que es mi ensalada.
