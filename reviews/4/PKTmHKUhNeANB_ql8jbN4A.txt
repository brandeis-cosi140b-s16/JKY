I had the honey grilled chicken burrito.  I thought it was good.  You can choose white rice, spanish rice, pinto beans, black beans to add to it.  You also have the choice of tomato, onion, lettuce, hot sauce or mild, sour cream.   The people working there were very helpful and let me try samples of the chicken before ordering.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't think it's there yet.  Also, the fish tacos are really awesome.
