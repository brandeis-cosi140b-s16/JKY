I've never had a bad time at Qdoba, and I really like this location. This whole shopping center somehow gets to be cool even though it's a crappy strip mall. I like that it has an upstairs and downstairs, and being on a hillside just makes it a little more exciting. This Qdoba has always been clean, and the staff is friendly and helpful.

There's lots of fun stuff for vegetarians, which always helps me out. Everything is always fresh, and it's a nice, bright room to sit and hang out. I had a memorably good lunch here with my mom once, so I have positive associations.
