The Filiberto's of the West Valley!!! Really like this place! I have been here about three times, get the same old steak and egg burrito, w/beans and potato's! And of course add a little bit of pico! Never been disappointed, a very large serving, and has had very good service. Place looks like its closed down! But it's not, they just blacked the windows to keep the sun out! Family keeps on asking me when I will take them? Soon!
