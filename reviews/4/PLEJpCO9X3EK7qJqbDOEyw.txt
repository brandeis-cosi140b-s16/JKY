Ramiros used to be open 24 hours, so you know this was my spot when it was 2:45AM and me and my friends are hammered and we all decided that we are hungry, and everyone knows mexican food is the best drunk munchies. Sadly, they changed their hours... maybe because my friends and I weren't getting drunk enough, so they figured to close shop a couple hours earlier. Sad day. I still go there time to time for their carne asada fries, or menudo for my hangover.
