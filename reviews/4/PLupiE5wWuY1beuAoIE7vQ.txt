Great regional chain spot for a quick lunch. This place has some good fish tacos, the normal fried fish tacos and the mango habanero grilled mahi mahi tacos!  Both are tasty, if you go on a Tuesday the original fish tacos are $1.50 after 2:30pm.

The chicken burrito especial isn't a bad pick either.  The nice thing they also have here is a churro, nice ending for a quick lunch.  Most meals come with the pinto beans and chips which are pretty decent, nothing special but good.

This location is pretty clean and lots of space to eat inside or outside.
