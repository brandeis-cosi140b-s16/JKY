A few months ago I would've given Baja Fresh five stars. No joke. I don't know if it's me getting older and more frail, but for some reason my body can't handle it as well as it used to be able to and I go into a food coma for a good 45 minutes to an hour after eating it nowadays. 

If that doesn't slow you down, it actually has some of the more authentic tasting mexican food around. Cilantro dominates the smell of the entire restaurant, and they even have a wide selection of salsas of different varieties for all to sample. I am a fan of the burritos, but, then again, that's almost unfair. I'm a fan of just about every burrito I've ever had. 

The chicken quesadillas are good but are heavy on the grease. Unless you have a stomach of steel (like I used to) go with the tacos or a burrito.
