This place would have 5 stars from me if it weren't for the tacky interior design.  I can't do half stars so this place will get my 4...  

I was visiting my father-in-law over the weekend for his birthday.  We stopped by Don Jose's before starting our day.  I was recommended the chorizo and the chile relleno burritos.  The chile relleno sounded really good, and was going to go with that until I saw the lengua burritos.  I LOVE lengua.  Could not pass up the opportunity so I went with the lengua burrito (which defaultly *is this a word?*) comes with onions and cilantro.

I ordered the lengua burrito with sour cream and guacmole in it.  It was SOOOO DELICIOUS.  I'm salivating right now thinking about how good this burrito was.  The burrito was a pretty nice size.  Bigger than a 1/2 lb burrito from Taco Bell, but smaller than ones at Chipotle.  The flavor.  The texture.  The combination....  It was heavenly, and filling.  The lengua was cooked perfectly.

The service here at Don Jose's was very attentive.  I believe the owners is the man himself and his wife.  They have about 4 sauce selections to choose from.  There was a dark red, a regular tomato/pico de gallo salsa, green salsa, and I forgot what else.  I loved all of them but I'm a huge fan of the green.  The burrito could go without the sauce, but I'm a well known sauce bandit so it was pretty saucey.

With the order, we ordered a California Burrito, Chorizo Burrito, 2 Ham and Egg Breakfast Burrito, and a Sausage and Egg Breakfast Burrito.  I took a bite out of the Chorizo Burrito, it was pretty good.  Greasy like how a chorizo really is, but the burrito packs a (heavy) flavor punch.

When I come back to Arizona to visit again, I will definitely have to make a stop to Don Jose's.  Not sure if I will go with a new burrito though.... Lengua has been on my mind since then.
