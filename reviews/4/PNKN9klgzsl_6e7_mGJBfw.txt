Same great taste with a sweet location. Right next to my place in the Willo District. Can't beat the price, quality and consistency of chipotle. Located at a busy intersection this chipotle will be here to stay. I always go with the burrito bowl with the tortilla on the side. Chicken or steak you can't go wrong! I will be back.
