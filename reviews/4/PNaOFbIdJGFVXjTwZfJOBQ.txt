I am sure there are better Mexican spots in Vegas but if you are staying on Fremont the convenience (in downtown Fremont and open late) is unbeatable and the food was honestly delicious.  I had 2 burritos a night during my trip.

I got the steak burrito and pastor burrito with Spanish rice and all the fixins(onion cilantro, hot salsa, cheese sour cream, pinto beans).  the meat was tender and flavorful and all of the fixins were tasty complemented the burrito.   I also tried the chicken but wasn't as big of a fan.  Will be back next time I am in Vegas!
