This is the BEST Chipotle location in the Madison area. Seriously, they are SO fast. The portions are huge and the place is always clean.

I know Chipotle is a chain but I can honestly say that this location elevates that status. It has a gorgeous, well-kept patio. The staff is friendly and they are always ready for any special requests I make.
