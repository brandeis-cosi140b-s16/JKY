This is one of the first places I ever drank in Pittsburgh so I guess I'm kinda biased towards it. The food does a bit more than it should, but it's really good. The sangria is awesome and some of the cocktails are really nice, but it's pretty expensive and I hate to say it but some of the servers have a pretty bad attitude.

Even though it gets crazy busy at times, it's still a really nice place to go for a quick bite and a few drinks.
