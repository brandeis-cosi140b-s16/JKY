I really love this place!  The food is fantastic and fresh, and the service has been superior every time I've been there - which is about half a dozen times since moving to Charlotte in October 2014.  I was tempted to give it 5 stars - and refrained ONLY because the back room could use a little sprucing up, and the AC is down too low and the dining area can feel VERY cold. So....bring a sweater (or sit outside!) and enjoy!
