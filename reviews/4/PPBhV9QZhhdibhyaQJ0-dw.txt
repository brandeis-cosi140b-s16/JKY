I'd give it 5 stars but I honestly thing 5 stars and perfect scores should be reserved for a place that has achieved serious perfection. Although I do not believe Abuelos needs any improving. 
I've eaten here numerous times and love the atmosphere. I usually eat in the bar and watch a game that's on. I eat here every couple weeks, every staff member is friendly and attentive, even if they are not waitstaff they always smile back at me and say hello. 
The food has been absolutely delicious every time. 
I have read a lot of reviews about Abuelos and even though some people are claiming they have had Mexican food and understand the flavor I really do not think they do. I grew up eating Mexican food home-cooked by friends of the family that I spent summers with. Hand making corn tortillas and tamales.  Eating at Abuelos is like eating the food Mrs. Artiaga made for me growing up. It makes me feel home again. There's nothing better than that. 

I've also never been anywhere in Wisconsin that cooks shrimp as perfectly as Abuelos. Wisconsin doesn't know seafood like my old homes of Maine and Seattle, Washington.  The steak I had in my fajitas was cooked and seasoned perfectly too. 
Pork tacos are delicious.  
My favorite drink is the hand shaken margarita. Seriously the best I've ever had, and I got a lot more that I expected. 
This is in my top 3 favorite restaurants in Wisconsin... And I'm astounded it's a chain. 
Haters gunna hate. That's just what they do. 
But I love Abuelos.
