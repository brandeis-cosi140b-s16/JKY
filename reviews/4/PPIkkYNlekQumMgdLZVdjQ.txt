El Taco Tote is good ol fashioned grilled mexican food.  The chicken and beef fajitas for a party of 2 or 4 are thier signature dishes served on a hot sizzling skillet(cuidado no te quema's) with handmade corn or flour tortillas and sides of whole beans and rice, and ofcorse the endless salsa bar. The flavor is excellent and worth every penny. The setting is ofcorse of mexican a taco shop persona but the equivalent to something like a dennys or ihop, nothing fancy, not run down, just very casual. AND thats exactly what this restaraunt sets out to deliver. 
Restaraunts have to be rated for the food quality and persona they advertise, not by the colors on the wall or the type of people sitting in the booth next to you...Im just sayin.
