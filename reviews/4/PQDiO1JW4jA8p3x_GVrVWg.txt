Went with family from out of town (there hotel was very close by) and I was pleasantly surprised considering some of the really negative comments.  The atmosphere is very relaxing, the service was great and the food was really, really good!   We all got something different and everyone enjoyed what they had.  I had the two item combo with carne adobada which was delicious a shredded beef taco.  The Hornitos margaritas (for only $5.95) were great...not too sweet like most places.  

My only two suggestions I could offer for them is to: 1). replace the tabletops on the tables with the cracked plastic coating, that doesn't look very good and 2). change the crunchy taco shells...the shredded beef was delicious, but the shell just fell apart and I had to eat it with a fork.

This was my first time going there and I would definitely go again. Maybe they have good days or bad days which could explain the negative remarks... or maybe the people writing them work for a nearby competitor...?  All I can say is we had a great meal and a really nice dining experience there!
