Good place with healthy, fairly flavorful mexican fastfood and good prices. Similar to chipotle- but a tad lower end. Hub likes their beans and rice but still prefers the pork at chipotle a bit more.   I prefer this place to Chipotle so not sure why everyone says different?? The veggies have more flavor plus they have way better options than chipotle. Plus their chips are better too.   

. I usually hate queso but qdoba's has peppers and great spices: its addicting! also love their salty chips. The 2 kinds of extra grilled veggies are great add in but get annoyed that they charge extra even if i skip the rice, cheese.. And then they are even skimpy with their veggie portion.  Hot red salsa is really good but dont care for the others. Service is friendly but not consistent when it comes to charging items or knowing whats a "naked burrito, salad...".  

 Love their frequent buyer program but the customer service from corporate is awful.  Reached out to them twice to get credit for meal when I have forgotten my card (why they cant look up my account with my email or phone number is crazy) but never get replies from their corporate office.
