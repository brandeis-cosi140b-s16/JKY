I walked in here the other afternoon looking for a good happy hour and boy did I find it. I sat at the bar and the ambiance was outstanding a large open restaurant with a huge bar so you don't feel that cluttered or crowded while you enjoy your food. They had $2 drafts during happy hour which set my mood to Happy. I ordered a few small bites off there bar menu. Chicharones Tacos were very simple yet packed with flavor. I ordered a Chile Relleno and at first sight was disappointed that it wasn't deep fried until i took a bite. I have never been so overwhelmed by the flavors mingling in my mouth until now. A dried Chile stuffed with veggies and spices and boy it had some nice heat as well made me order a refreshing margarita only $5. For once I was intoxicated from the food and not the drinks, only cuz i had 2. I was in heaven and can't wait to go for either happy hour or to explore their  menu. After talking with the bartender he informed me that all the food being prepared was made fresh daily. All in all my bill was around $30 with a tip and a few small bites and 2 drinks.
