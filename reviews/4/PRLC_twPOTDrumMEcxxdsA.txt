Looking for a quick, easy meal off our flight, we found this place minutes from the airport. Each had 3 tacos. The pastor and BBQ were fantastic and the chicken was tasty if a little dry. 

Guacamole and chips are recommended. 

Simple, honest, and delicious. Go for it if you're looking for what the southwest does so well!
