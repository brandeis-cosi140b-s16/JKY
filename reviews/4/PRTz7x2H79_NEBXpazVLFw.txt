My husband, daughter and I had dinner, dessert and drinks all for $45.00.  Dinner was delicious and the service was outstanding.  Marcos was very attentive as was our busser.  

The food was very good as was my margarita.  Our server guided us through the menu and assisted us in making the right choices.

We will definitely be going back again soon.
