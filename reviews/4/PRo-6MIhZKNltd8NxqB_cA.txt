Nice Mexican restaurant, fresh and new.  Dinners run on the upper end of the price scale, $16 to $20 something per plate, chips and salsa not included or if they are, we were not offered any.  Wait staff were friendly and everything looked clean.  I tried the shrimp enchiladas ($16) they came with rice and you choice of pinto or black beans; they were full of large shrimp and seasoned perfectly.  Mejico is a nice addition to the neighborhood.
