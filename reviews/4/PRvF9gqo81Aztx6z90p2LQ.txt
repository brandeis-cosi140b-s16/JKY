Moe's is my favorite type of the build your own burrito places to go. It's also my husbands. This location in Ballantyne is right on the corner when you want to make a left, but you can't so you have to go to the light, and make a u-turn. 

Aside from the difficulty that is getting in, they rest is fantastic. The people working there are generally happy, and I've never had a complaint about the food. The salsa is always fresh, and the soda machine is never out of anything. The place is also really clean, something I know must be difficult, when children and chips are involved.
