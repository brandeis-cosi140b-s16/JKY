If I could eat 14 tacos in a row, I would go here. Carne Asada, Pastor, Lomo, Lengua (Beef tongue), Tripa, Buche (pork stomach), oh my!! Seriously - 14 different kinds of tacos! 

Sadly, I only had four:
1) Pollo - delicious! 
2) Pull pork - even more delicious than the chicken. I could eat this all day long.
3) Pastor - decent
4) Carne Asada, I wish I hadn't saved this for last. It tasted like they didn't even add any spices.

As for the decor - the benches are brightly colored wooden scenes and kind of neat to see on their own.

Margaritas were a little pricier than I was expecting. When you're done eating, pay at the counter near the door.

Overall - a solid taco recommendation.
