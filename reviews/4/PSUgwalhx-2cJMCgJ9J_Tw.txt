I dig this place. It's the closest thing to a sure thing in the area for me as far as Mexican food is concerned. The shrimp fajitas rock, as do the fish tacos, which are made with grilled pacific Hawaiian Ono - I think they come with corn tortillas, but they'll gladly trade those out for flour if you ask nice. They also come with a super tasty chipotle cream dipping sauce, but not enough in my opinion. Ask for more, they'll bring it. For vegetarians I recommend the mushroom enchiladas blancas or the spinach enchiladas, both of which are equally delicious - and rich. Bring the Lactaid if you're lactose intolerant. Oh, and apparently they've got a killer lunch menu - not sure how I've been going there for years and didn't know that. Oh, well, maybe it's because I usually go for dinner. Margarita ordering tip: go for broke. The base margarita blows. Yeah, it's way cheaper, but it tastes like you're drinking pure sweet & sour mix. Order their top shelf, whatever it is, I don't remember, think I had one too many last time I was there.
