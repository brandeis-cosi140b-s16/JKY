I brought a friend from Austin here and he absolutely flipped over how much it reminded him of home. Having only been to Austin once myself, I can't say whether or not they're serving authentic Tex-Mex, but Tex Tubb's certainly seemed to be trying. This is the only place in Madison I've seen that has Lone Star and Shiner available, and the fried avocado taco was certainly a welcome departure from the usual Mexican food.

Also an excellent idea on their part - the frito pie. A bag of frito chips topped with chili, salsa, cheese, sour cream, and various other goodies. I tend to hate fritos, but this was really delicious. And I attribute that to the quality of the ingredients they were using.
