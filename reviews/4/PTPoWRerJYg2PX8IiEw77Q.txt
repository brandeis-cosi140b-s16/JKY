One of the best breakfast burrito selections in town.

My personal favorite is the breakfast supreme w/ red sauce ( and root beer the size of my head).

The decor may be meh, but the quality of the food more than makes up for it. 

They deliver, are always nice, and never busy (which is unfortunate). Definitely a diamond in the rough.
