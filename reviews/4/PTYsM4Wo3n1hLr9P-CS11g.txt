Great food as always, but even better service! I'll be honest, we have not always had the best service here, but keep coming back for the yummy tex-mex. Last night, Oct. 17, 2014, we went out for dinner & had the best service I have ever had. Ashley C. Never let my glass get empty & was just the right amount of attentive without being over bearing.  Awesome service! Good food.
