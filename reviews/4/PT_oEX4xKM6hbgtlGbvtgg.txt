The chips make you really full so you won't finish your food, unless your like gorilla hungry.  I went with my bosses because they LOVE it here. I got a combination plate with a chicken taco and a baja enchillada and it was soooo freakin good. I was muchin! From what I heard how good the food taste depends on what resturant you go to and they say this is the best and I can't argue!
