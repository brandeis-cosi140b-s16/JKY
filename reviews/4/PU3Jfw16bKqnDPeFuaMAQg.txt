Fresh ingredients cooked and served warm.

I liked their soft shell shrimp tacos,
and the new bbq Carnita(sp?) tacos.
I liked the texture, seasoning, temperature, harmony of the flavors.

I tried the chopped chicken ranch salad before,
it wasn't too exciting and way over-dressed.

The chips and salsa weren't too great.

I like the interior decoration here.
