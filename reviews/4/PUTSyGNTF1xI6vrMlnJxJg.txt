-(Steak) Mexican Taco on Corn Tortillas..................................................................................................................$1.29
Choice of Meat with Onions & Cilantro ***
Honestly, what carne asada taco isn't good? I won't say it was special but still tasty.

He had:
-Fusion Taco

We shared:
-Fusion Quesadilla...(Beef or Chicken with Mozzarella Cheese on Flour Tortilla)...........................$5.99
SO MUCH CHEESE!!!! :D :D :D

We were stuffed after that and the chips and salsa they bring to you on the table (which we fought for). Order extra chips and salsa!! Extra salsa extra guac!! 

YOU WILL WAIT FOR YOUR FOOD BECAUSE IT IS MADE FRESH. **There is actually a sign hanging up in the restaurant that says this.** 

If you want fast food go to McDonalds you idiot. Also, what are you doing on Yelp?

Be prepared. Service isn't the best but the food is worth the wait.

Can't comment on price because I didn't pay but my boyfriend was happy when we left and I'm pretty sure it was because the food was great and it was cheap too.
