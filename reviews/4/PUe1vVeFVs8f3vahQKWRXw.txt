Authentic Mexican cuisine with a vast menu, friendly owner and staff, tacky in a good way decor, and delicious food and drinks at a decent price! Free chips and salsa and big portions, too! I cannot wait to come back. My chicken fajitas were so good that I kept eating beyond capacity. They have a good tequila selection for a neighborhood Mexican place, as well.
