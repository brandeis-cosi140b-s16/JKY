This was our first visit and although it was busy we were seating quickly since we chose to eat outside.  The misters and fans made it comfortable.  The server was attentive and quick to return to check on us and take our order.  We enjoyed the sweet tamale appetizer, chicken fundido, steak and lobster tacos.  I can't say the lobster taco were the best thing I've ever eaten, but it was ok. The rice was a little too dry.  We loved our cookie sundaie and fried ice cream dessert.  We'll be back!
