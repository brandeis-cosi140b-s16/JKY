Our lunch group tried Phat Phranks (Fat Franks) today. It was awesome Mexican food and very close to what I have been used to eating in California. There were 10 of us and everyone except one person loved their lunch. The service was fast and continuous with drink refills. The owner came out and talked to everyone at least once during our stay. He also spoke to each person as they ordered. Very personable. Many said they would go again. I had the Chili Verde Burrito and it was huge (enough for two) with a small side of salad and iced tea for $10.26 with tax. Reasonable prices.  The chili verde was spicy but not overly done. Next time I will order the Chili Verde plate which is smaller. We will go again.
