Pretty similar to Chipotle/Qdoba in terms of price and selection (maybe a little cheaper).  Went there on a lunch break and the place was packed.  As far as the food goes, let me say this:  Chipotle, you have been pwned.  Seriously.  The food here is way better.  The burritos aren't quite as big, but they taste awesome. Go for the Rumba Burrito and you can't go wrong.  

Staff always seems super friendly, they tend to remember regulars.
