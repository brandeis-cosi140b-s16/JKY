I have been to this restaurant a few times, but it had been a while, so I decided to go back with my family during Arizona Restaurant Week.  We actually ended up ordering off of the regular menu instead of the fixed menu.  

We started with the guacamole - if you like guac, this is a must! It is not tableside like my other favorite upscale Mexican restaurant, but it is still great.  The chips it is served with are good - not too salty - but the salsa they serve is marginal.  They offer two kinds, which were both very watery and bland, but maybe I am just really picky having been raised on homemade spicy salsa? 

For my entree, I ordered the smoked chicken enchiladas.  These were absolutely amazing.  It was heaven in my mouth.  When I took that first bite, I literally just sat there and savored all the flavors exploding in my mouth.  The chicken was so tender and smoky, and the green sauce was a little tangy yet spicy.  The enchiladas came with black beans and rice, which nicely complemented the entree.  The rest of my family ordered the mole poblano, which was white meat chicken (you have to request this) drenched in mole sauce.  I love mole sauce, and this was definitely one of the better ones I've had. 

I would recommend heading here when the weather cools down because they have a great patio and live music out there.  The ambiance inside is pretty unmemorable, and the service inside was not that great either.  Hopefully, it is better outside - that along with some better salsa would make my Los Sombreros experience complete!
