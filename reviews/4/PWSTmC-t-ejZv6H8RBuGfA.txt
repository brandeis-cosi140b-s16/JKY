I agree, the Molcajete was awesome (even for $12). Unlike anything I've had. Great seasoning & flavor. The bottom of the bowel has loose chorizo & steak was tender. My wife loved it too. Margaritas were ok. Chile Rellano was not that good. Super cold Tacate served with lime & salt. Salsa was mild & needed salt/heat added but agree good smokey flavor. Will definitely go back for the Molcajete & Tacate. Solid 4 stars
