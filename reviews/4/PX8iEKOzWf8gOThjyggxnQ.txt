i was walking the strip with a couple of friends of mine and as california natives we were all craving mexican food. we stumbled across a huge tex-mex themed restaurant where the meals averaged about $16. that was a no go for me. I don't pay that kind of money for mexican food because generally the food is not tasty. I turned to yelp to see what was nearby and dj's had a yelp deal. off i went. my burrito was super-good and the tortilla tasted homemade. I got mine to go bc i planned to eat half then and half later but ended up inhaling it all in one setting. Delicious food!
