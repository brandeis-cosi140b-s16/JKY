all in all not too bad...  for being in the heart of old town i think the prices are pretty good and the place is really clean... there is limited seating, but it looks more like a carry out place... to me this place is a nice version of a place you would find on the south side...   I loved the shredded beef tacos and they have hot salsa... and they serve beer at a good price...
