I met my cousin here for lunch, and we were really happy with the meal.  The place is a less than impressive on the interior, dingy booths, long and narrow.  It's terribly crowded up by the counter, not a lot of room to order and pick up your food.

I do question how a place can call itself "Los Taquitos" and then not have taquitos on the menu, but I went for the flautas instead.  They were good, but what set the meal apart were the beans.  The most flavorful beans I have ever had.  If you told me these were magical beans, I would have believed it, but I wouldn't have stopped eating them to plant one and see.

Service was quick and friendly and there was plenty of seating, even during the lunch rush.  Looked like a lot of people get orders to go.  I'd like to go back and try a few other items on their menu, if they come with beans of course.
