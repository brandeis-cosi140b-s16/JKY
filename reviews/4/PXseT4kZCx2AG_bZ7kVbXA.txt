YES! Love em'
2 for 1 Military Mondays is awesome.. because their food is great. 
I have had a few burritos, chimi, and chili rellenos... all amazing.
Also, the staff at this location is great. Always polite, helpful, patient, and will rearrange your order to save you money and get you the same food, SERIOUSLY! You cannot beat it.
