Wow great find for my wife, son and myself while in town for a big 21st b-day party. The atmosphere is very upscale and the staff super friendly. The food really shines here - I like to cook Mexican food so I am very critical of how dishes are prepared. Every dish we ordered was wonderful - lot's interesting ingredients on every dish that played well on the palette. The corn bread they bring to the table is fantastic - best I ever have had.
