I've been coming here for the past 8 years. I originally went to their Craig location an I fell in love with Thor food. I was glad to hear they had opened a location down the street from my house. For breakfast, I always order the Chilaquiles. For lunch, I always order the Chile Verde.

I would have given them a 5 star review, however, they started charging extra for refills.
