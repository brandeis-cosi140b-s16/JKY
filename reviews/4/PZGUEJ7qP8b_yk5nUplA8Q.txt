If you like your food spicy, you will like Arriba!  I know it is a chain, but it is a local chain, and they are very consistent!  They have the best spinach enchiladas around....they are amazing!  I also love that they give you bean dip and two different kinds of salsas with your chips.

The menu has pictures of everything, which makes it very hard to choose, but I usually stick to a few of my favorites.  They also have really good lunch deals like Taco Tuesday (99 cent tacos) and Chicken Chimichanga Thursdays (just $1.99).  The food is always hot and fresh, and they have good beans...which is always a benchmark for me!
