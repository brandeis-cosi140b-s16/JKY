I eat at Zaba's about once a month after working out at LVAC.  It's in the same parking lot as the gym, but I also appreciate the healthier options that they provide...such as:
Wheat tortillas 
Brown rice
SWEET POTATOES
Grilled chicken/shrimp/fajita veggies 

They are not my favorite Mexican grill flavor wise, but the food is all good, the service is fast & friendly, and I love the extra options.
