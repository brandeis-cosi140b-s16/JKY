decided to come here because my friend and i received a coupon for a free margarita with the purchase of an entree. we were roaming around to kill some time before watching the lion king and needed a place to eat dinner anyway. we were seated right away. our server was really nice. the food is a bit pricey compared to other mexican places but it was good. i ordered the combo tacos which came with one chicken, carne, and carnitas taco. all of which were very tasty. my friend got the chicken burrito...also good. the margaritas were good and strong considering that they were free. i'd come back if i ever venture back to the luxor.
