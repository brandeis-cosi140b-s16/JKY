I was in the mood for a "local" vs a "chain" restaurant breakfast while visiting my kids in the area. While driving through town this place caught my eye. I was very pleased with my meal, as well as the service. I had an omelette, bacon, hash browns, and toast. It came out quickly, warm, and as ordered. Very tasty. The coffee and juice were very good too. I'm looking forward to coming back again for the Mexican scramble.
