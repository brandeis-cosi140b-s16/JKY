I used to go to Cafe Carumba a few times a month when I worked in Old Town and I loved it! The food has a unique flavor and the decor is pretty cool. I always get the sundried tomato basil quesadilla. Yumm! It's stuffed with cheese and peppers and it is sooo good. I've had a few other things there as well and have never been disappointed.

The service is always really good and quick (I have only been there for breakfast/lunch so I don't know about the dinner rush) One waiter always ends the meal by bringing your check and asking if you'd like to hear a joke or a riddle. Take the joke....it's pretty funny  =)

Only downside is that this place is very "scottsdale" if you know what I mean. But I guess that is part of the fun of it. Definitely stop in and check this place out if you get the chance.
