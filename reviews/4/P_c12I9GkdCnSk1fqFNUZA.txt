Came here with my family this past weekend.  We were looking for authentic Mexican food... didn't get it here but the food was really good.  They start you off with 6 different salsas (all were good but not spicy enough).  My fave was the cilantro salsa which I asked for more of and the waitress kinda laughed at me.  I didn't get that.... but anyway the food was really good.  The margaritas were awesome!  You definitely don't get the portions that you would get at an authentic Mexican restaurant but we all left full.  

I'll probably go back again and give the service another shot.
