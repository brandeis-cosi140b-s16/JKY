Good prices, delicious tacos, and a salsa bar, what more could you want?

Keep in mind this is a quick service Mexican restaurant (order at the counter and seat yourself), but that doesn't degrade the food quality. Great for lunch or a quick, casual dinner.  Classic tacos with any of the meat options are a win!
