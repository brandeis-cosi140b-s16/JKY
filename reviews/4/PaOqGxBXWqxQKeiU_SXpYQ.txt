It is difficult for me to believe that I had not tried Zabas before yesterday given how much I like burritos. I was with my family hanging out on Mother's Day and we were getting hungry. There was Zabas nearby and it was calling our names. I was amazed at how much it is like Chipotle. The food on the menu is very similar. You have your standards like grilled chicken, grilled steak, carnitas and shredded beef. There is brown rice, white rice, pinto beans or black beans, fajita style veggies, a variety of salsas, sour cream, cheese and guacamole. They have lettuce to choose from if you so desire. They even have cabbage. I got a steak burrito with brown rice, black beans, corn salsa, cheese and sour cream. It was a big filling burrito very much like Chipotle gives me. I think Chipotle has a little more flavor than Zabas. At least when it comes to the steak. I think it was a salty component I was missing. Perhaps the shredded beef is more strongly flavored. It looked good for sure. I was really quite happy with Zabas and look forward to trying it again. The food is good and I have no complaints of the service.
