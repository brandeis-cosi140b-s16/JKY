Went here this past Thursday evening for a quick dinner on my way to UNCC.  I usually don't take the time to review fast food restaurant unless the experience was really memorable - either for being really good or really bad.  In this case, my experience at the Davis Lake Taco Bell was memorable for all the right reasons.

Parking:  There is plenty of parking in the immediate area surrounding the building.  it is well lit and I felt comfortable being there by myself late on a Thursday evening.

Food:  I ordered the chicken grilled-stuff burritos and a pintos and cheese with a small drink.  My order arrived within 3 minutes and was made to my specifications.  The burrito was big and was filled to the brim with the standard cast of characters - refried beans, cheese, guac, sour cream, chicken, rice, etc.  The grilled stuffed burrito tasted awesome and the pintos and cheese were a perfect compliment.

Building/Facilities:  The interior of this Taco Bell was as nice of a TAco Bell as I am ever seen - really.  All the tables were clean.  The napkin and drink areas were both immaculate.  Event the chicken area in the back looked to be clean and well-kept. 

If you are looking for a clean, modern-looking, Taco Bell, were they get your order right and there isn't long lines day and night; then then the Taco Bell @ Davis Lake is the Border you should run to.
