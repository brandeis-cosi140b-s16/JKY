Never been to a Del Taco in my life... and boy... was I missing out.

It's one of the chains that I feel like the food is actually better than "South of the Border" (reference to the old Taco Bell slogan if you're too young to remember).

Great food, and it's super fast.   I noticed that through the drive-thru, they actually have a timer set on the drive-thru window.   I actually dislike this method of management for food since sometimes you get some really crappy wrapped up food or what not.   It is fast food, but no reason to completely screw up someone's order due to a timer.

However, this is a nice segue to Tex Mex when you want it but don't feel like running down to a Mexican restaurant.
