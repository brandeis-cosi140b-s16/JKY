This place is the perfect neighborhood walk to place on a weekend. The food is amazing, they even added chicken to their menu! My one and only criticism is that the beer is warm. I would suggest on their busy nights (Fri, Sat, Sun) they get an ice chest and put their beer in that. They are serving it too fast for the fridge to keep up. Other than that, awesome!!
