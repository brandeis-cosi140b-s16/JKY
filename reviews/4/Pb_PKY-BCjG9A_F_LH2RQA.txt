I heart the heck out of Roberto's!  This new location is clean and modern with the same nummy food.  :)  I am Hispanic so let's get that out of the way for the Roberto's haters.  If you aren't afraid of calories and carbs - order the carne asada chimichanga. YUMMMOOOOO.  If you want a smaller heart attack meal - order the breakfast burrito with eggs, cheese, potatoes, bacon and pico de gallo - super yum!  And  if you want a slightly healthier option hit up the Camarones Rancheros - a nice shrimp, rice and bean combo with just the right amount of pico de gallo - tasty and it's not spicy.  Love this place. :)
