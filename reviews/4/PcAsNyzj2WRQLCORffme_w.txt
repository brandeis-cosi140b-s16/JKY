Ran into this place by accident and we stopped for lunch. The best part for me was the chips and salsa. Amazing flavor. I had the fajitas and wow what a plate full. I think I could get 3 meals out of it! My only disappointment was the tortilla shells. Although they came to the table very warm, they were very dry. The food's flavor was good and our server was attentive and pleasant. I will for sure come back when it is cooler and we can sit outside on the beautiful patio or upstairs open air dining.
