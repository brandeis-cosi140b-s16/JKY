Ritos, you make damn good burritos!

I FINALLY made it down to Ritos on a day off several months back.  I had been hearing about this place from a friend who works downtown and frequently stops in for lunch.  Unfortunately for me I work in North Scottsdale and this place is only open M-F during lunch hours. 

Ritos is pretty much a hole in the wall.  The screen door entrance in a neighborhood setting makes you wonder if you have the right place or will be walking in on a family sitting in their living room watching television.  There is no seating inside and only a few options on the menu.  I ordered the green chili burrito with rice and beans which was one of the best I've ever had.  The meal had probably about 2,000 calories and was worth every bite!  There is picnic table seating outside which would be perfect this time of year...summer, not so much.

One day, I will return again!  

Suggestion - at least be open even for just a little bit on Saturday or Sunday...pretty please?!
