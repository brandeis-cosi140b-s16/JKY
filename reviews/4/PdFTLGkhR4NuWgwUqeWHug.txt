OMG...reviews won't do this place justice...you just have to try and experience this place.

The location on Sahara was formerly a Taco Bell (very obvious architectural structure) but inside was gutted and very open and friendly....AND BUSY! This was the lunch crowd and many business/office folk have also discovered this place. 

The staff works feverishly to get the order out in a timely matter, and the wait is minimal.  

The menu is typical Mexican cuisine, but the portions are huge.  The Carne Asada Taco has an incredible flavor...one that I have never tasted before and the shrimp cocktail in a beer mug was sweet, spicy and flavorful.

Their fruit waters (strawberry, cantaloupe, mango and pineapple), are also the perfect touch to this menu (although I could have enjoyed a good sangrais or mojito!).

If you are looking for a quick grab and go that will leave you full, this is a place you need to check out!
