First found this place through a Living Social deal. To be honest I didn't have expectations, however this restaurant was AMAZING! I purchased that first deal and was back twice throughout the month. 

I had the shrimp tacos, very tasty and filling. I also had a strawberry margarita, not so much a fan. But hey you are there for the tacos and other food right!?

Definitely a must try if you are in the Gilbert area!
