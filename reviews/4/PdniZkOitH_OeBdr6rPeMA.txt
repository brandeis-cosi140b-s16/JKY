I like Serranos and am a HUGE FAN - I think they have very good Mexican food, but I have always thought the Queen Creek one could have better customer service, and do a little more to make their facilities more clean.

Nothing wrong that I would never eat there again, but I just feel they got to relaxed being the only Mexican Food choice out in QC for so long.  They have competition now, and they need to step it up to keep customers from going elsewhere.

I am a huge fan of their Machaca, but they are not consistent.  Sometimes very hot (almost to hot for this white boy to enjoy) and sometimes not hot enough (in case you were actually looking for a food review - ha)  Everything I have had their has been good - especially if you love tacos.  very yummy - just want them to step it up a little.
