Ate here for the first time for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Good food at reasonable prices in a fun atmosphere. Not your typical tex mex, more baja style as the other review mentioned. I know others said the owner is a pest but I appreciated him checking in. Showed that he took pride in his joint. Will come back one evening to check out the live music and extensive beer and tequila menu.
