Fast food and fast service. We ordered a chicken burrito and an assortment of chicken and beef rolled tacos. Both were tasty and the prices very reasonable.

The burrito was brimming with chicken and peppers. Spicey but not over powering.

The rolled tacos came covered in guacamole, sour cream, shredded lettuce and shredded cheese.

Filled us up and didn't break our wallets like most places in this town.
