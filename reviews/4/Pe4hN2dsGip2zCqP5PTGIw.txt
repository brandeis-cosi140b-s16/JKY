Nice weekly specials.  I wish it would be alittle more authentic but the steak tacos and the chicken enchilada nachos have a great flavor I like the enchilada sauce and the tequila list is great Casa noble and 1942 don Julio.  Great fresh margaritas and I usually dine in bar with great service and ambiance.  Fun place to take a date.
