El Patron is truly a hidden gem in a somewhat seedy strip mall. From the outside it looks like a typical Americanized Mexican joint circa 1979, however, upon entry we were transported to a Mexican oasis. 

We had a couple of hours to kill before boarding our plane to come home, so we plopped ourselves at a table and decided to give the menu a try. At first glance I was impressed by all of the offerings that spanned way beyond the typical (and boring) burritos and enchiladas. 

We noshed on prepared tableside guacamole, ceviche, appetizer platter, nopales, homemade flour tortillas that arrived at our table warm and a cup of complimentary soup. 

And to top it off, we enjoyed our meal to the sounds of a pretty decent live musician playing everything from Beatles ballads in Spanish to REM tunes in English. 

El Patron is a lesson in not judging a book by its cover.
