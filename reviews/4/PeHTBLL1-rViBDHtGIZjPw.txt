This particular location has changed owners about 4 times in the past year. They recently opened Tacos La mexicana and I really liked it. The portions and prices are pretty good. I tried the burrito with the flan and it was delicious. to give you a better idea of this place is like going to Robertos, but a bit more scale (not too much, just a bit)
Tip: do not miss their lunch special, 2 tacos, rice & bean + soda for 6 bucks!!

Apparently they are well know for the huaraches! Gotta try them next time!
