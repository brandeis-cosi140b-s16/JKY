If sitting in the sun enjoying a couple of beers and good relaxing fun with your friends is your thing, then look no further.  Maybe it's me getting older, but I enjoy this place much better during the day than at night.  The daytime crowd is my kind of people:  drinking, talking, and enjoying the day.  Plus if you've got a dog, feel free to bring them in.  They allow them out on the patio.

Beer is beer, and they've got plenty of it.  My friend swears by the margaritas here, saying they are cheaper than other places but stronger than most.  The food here is quite good.  You'd think for how cheap the tacos are you'd get nothing, but they are very tasty and come with a good amount of meat on them.  I get them gringo style and they can't be beat.  Other food favorites:  rocky point nachos, the baja shrimp sandwich, and for those hangover days, the aptly named hangover breakfast burrito.

Service is hit and miss here.  Weekend nights it's full of the college kids and those that think they are still in college, hence why I stay away once the sun goes down.  Although seeing all the bras lining the ceiling inside, the mind wanders as to how they all might have gotten there...
