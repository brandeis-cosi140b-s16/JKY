I've been to Roberto ' s twice . beef chimichangas are pretty good. packed with peppers and onions for In  your face flavor. only complaint is that the platters do not come with enough rice & beans. Also, the chimichangas are kinda soggy . but that's probably because they cover them with sour cream & guacamole.  I'll have to remember to request them putting it on the side.
