TEQUILA TUESDAY. All pitchers are half price and if you aren't sharing drinks a margarita is $3 or $4. I split the house margarita pitcher for only $14! I loved the table salsa it had a slight kick and was very fresh. I do have the agree the spinach in the spinach Queso was less than fresh- but not so off putting that we didn't finish the dish or maybe i was just hungry. I ordered the Carnitas. The meat was juicy, grilled perfection. The sides are typical- just a tiny scoop of guacamole was offered. Overall- everything is pretty solid here- medium priced- nothing ridiculous like Vida in the EpiCentre but not Central Ave cheap either. However, $14 margarita pitcher earns this place an extra star- but I guess just on Tuesdays!
