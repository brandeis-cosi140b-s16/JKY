Food with flair and flavor, good atmosphere, easy parking, overall a good experience.

First of all, it's a very comfortable place.  Lots of natural lighting, an open design, large booths, and plenty of space.  I brought my tablet with me and ended up staying for quite a while.  The staff were friendly and attentive.  

I ordered the half serving of the guac and chips.  Really nice flavor overall and the chips are the harder, fresh kind that I usually get at a local Mexican grocery.  The ice tea (can't remember the name, but similar to passion fruit) had a subtle taste to it which I like.  Sometimes people go overboard with flavoring tea....

I got the carne asada taco and the carnitas taco.  The carnitas came with pineapple which had a nice balance to it.  The carne asada was good as well and the fresh, hot tortilla made everything kind of melt in your mouth.  One note:  The meats weren't particularly hot so I'm guessing it was scooped from a bin.  It probably could have used 30 seconds on the flat top. 

I went during Happy Hour and each item was reduced by $1 so the total damage was $12.06, or $15 with tip.  Plenty of food (and refills) for a very lazy lunch day.
