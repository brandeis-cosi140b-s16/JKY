a hole-in-the-wall joint with a great staff and simple but delicious food. the salsa bar has a fantastic avocado salsa!

great ceviche, and the other items are served in a standard, quick-service mexican style. order at the counter, then take your seat. they have a large selection of bottled mexican beers and mexican-style coca-cola. 

this is one of my standbys in maricopa. it definitely beats the other greasy spoon chains.
