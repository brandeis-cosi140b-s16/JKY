The food here was delicious. Very big servings, so it is cost-efficient . You can split the carne asada fries with 3 good appetites. (Guacamole!!) My bf got the tortas and they were amazing as well. For 15 bucks we got a huge lunch,  a decent dinner, and a soda. Not bad at all.

The dinning tables could have been kept a little cleaner, but bf said I was just being picky. Haha. I probably am. Regardless, when we stop over to Glendale Ave we will be making the trip to this little Mexican gem again.
