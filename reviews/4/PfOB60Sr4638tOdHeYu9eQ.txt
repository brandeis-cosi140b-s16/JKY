I had to sit at a "community table" which wasn't my first choice, but the place was packed.  The server was very attentive, even though she was super busy.

I enjoyed the guacamole and chips.  You could tell the guac was freshly made.  The carnitas tacos were delicious and served with black beans and rice.  The rice was a little dried out, but everything else was yummy.
