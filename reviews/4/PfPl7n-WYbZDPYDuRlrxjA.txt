This is such a chill & laid back taco shop for the casual Mexican food diner.  This spot has everything I like in a restaurant:  simple menu, great value, and speedy service.  The ambiance is much align with the name, you get the feel like you are at someone's home which is always conducive to a good time.  I've been here for lunch and dinner and I always leave satisfied.  I recently stopped eating meat and find that the cheese quesadilla with the cabbage mix, or the vegetarian loco potato suffice as great meals.
