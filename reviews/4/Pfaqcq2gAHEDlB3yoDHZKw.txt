Let me say first & foremost that the food at Chino's is fantastic & that you will be hard-pressed to find more bang for your buck considering the amount of yummy stuff you get for $9 (2 main dishes, sides of rice & beans, & a snickerdoodle cookie). The catch is that you have to keep reminding yourself of how good the food will be while you are waiting in line behind so many people that act like they have never been there before. You would think a bus full of Disneyland tourists just unloaded based how people act when they're trying to figure out what to order. Last night there was a group in front of me with two women, each with a spouse with big ideas on how to change the orders around, and one with a grandmother with a coupon who also wanted to split the tab in two. THIS WAS ALL IN THE SAME GROUP. Another patron in front of me asked the grandmother if they had been there before, and she happily replied, "yes, but it's been a long time." Maybe CB has added a few items recently, but I have coming been here for 5 years & have ordered the same favorites & the menu looks identical to me. I had ordered over the phone (highly recommend doing this), and I could see my order on the shelf with my name on it when I showed up 5 minutes later...that's how fast things can go if the tourists weren't holding everything up! I expected the place to be packed just before closing on a Saturday night, but it was only the troublesome group and one other patron and me in the line. At least when I got home and took a bite I remembered why CB was a good choice despite how confused the other customers get trying to place an order. :)
