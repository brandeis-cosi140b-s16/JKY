Yeah, finally some decent fast Mexican food in the Black Mountain, Henderson area. Same menu as the other Robertos and the place is new, nice and clean. Prices are very very reasonable.
There are a few things they can improve on. The first being the red sauce that you fill the little containers with, it's thin and watery. Hopefully it will thicken with time? Is it me or would a couple flat screen TVs be a good idea? Also it would be cool if they had the tiny soft shell tacos like you get on those taco trucks, charge like 75 cents each and they would have a line out the door! Overall it's good to know they are down the street and open all the time! Your wish is their command. They even have tasty breakfast burritos!  Lets support this place Henderson/Las Vegas we need places like this to stay open! The food is pretty good anyways!
