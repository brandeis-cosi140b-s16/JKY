I went with a few family members and we had the #1 combination plate, chicken enchiladas and pulled pork enchiladas. The food was good, worthy of the 4stars. However, it took us an hour to get our food(mind you only two other people were in the restaurant).  Don't let the areas its in fool you, it is a good place to eat.
