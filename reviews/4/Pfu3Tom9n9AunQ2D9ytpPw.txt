My journey for delicious Mexican food has finally ended here at Chevy's.  The  food definitely remind me of the great authentic food back in Houston, Texas.
Even though it is quite a distance from where I am currently live, I will definitely make the drive to satisfy my cravings for Mexican food.  Our last visit at this place, there were 4 couples ahead of us, just waiting and waiting.  Seems like two of the couples waited for quite a while so they gave up and left.  After 5 minutes though, we got a table.  Looked like they were shortage of staff.  But o well, one man's loss is another man's gain.  I got to eat the DELICIOUS Mexican food that I have been craving for!!!

Dinner for 2
1.) Chicken Corn Chowder-a very well balanced soup where one can taste both chicken and corn.  Those two flavors work so well together...OMG!!!

2.) Mixed Grill Plate-Beef Fajitas, Shrimp, and Chicken, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, refried beans, rice, and tortillas.  Oh wait, the best thing is the...TAMALITO :) 
     -TAMALITO-The most delicious thing ever.  Go to Chevy's you must try this awesome corn flour treat.  I ordered another one of this sweet corn tamalito for desser.  It is savory and kinda sweet. Quite honestly, i could have a bowl of these babies and call it dinner!!!!

This was more than enough for 2.  We pretty much stuffed ourselves so none will go to waste!

3.) mango lemonade-yummy yummy yum yum yummy.  I always order this drink.

Food and Service: 4 Stars.
