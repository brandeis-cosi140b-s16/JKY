I LOVE Filiberto's!  Being that I'm a fan, I've eaten at this location before, just not for a while. I like that this one's a sit down location, as normally I go to the one's that are the walk up/drive through ones.

I ate with my friend here for dinner tonight and we both enjoyed ourselves.  I went with my usual of the two shredded tacos, dirty rice and refried beans.  Friend went with the Carne Asada fries.  Both were delicious!  Mine was a bit greasier then normal, but still was exactly what I needed.

The place was kind of dead when we were there, but it was still good none the less.  They also have a salsa bar here, which is kind of cool.  Service was okay, and the food came out hot and quick.

The only down side to this place is that the floor was super sticky in spots and could have used a good moping. I also noticed one of the booths had a tear in the vinyl seating, and hopefully it gets repaired soon. I know this place is "just a Filly B's" but who wants to see it go into slum status?

Anyways, even though the food was extra greasy last night, it's still my favorite food to secretly eat even though it's horrible for me!
