As usual consistently delicious and super friendly. Had the queso fundido con chorizo.. just awesome! Melty goodness with bits of chorizo thrown on top.. the flour tortillas I think are made in the back because they are so tender and delicious.. also had the Swiss Enchiladas.. dynamite! Tender shredded beef laid into corn tortillas covered in green sauce and cheese.. yum! Also they make wonderful refried beans.. you cant go wrong.. real deal Mexican food here!
