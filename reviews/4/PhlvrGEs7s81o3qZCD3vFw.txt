Went for dinner last night. I ordered the Sonoran enchiladas and they were delicious!!! I will definitely be back for the food. I have to try Theresa's special. 

Now the bad part was the margaritas. When I go to a Mexican restaurant I expect a great margarita. The drinks we ordered tasted like the pre made bottles of margaritas sold at the grocery store.
