Woke up craving tacos at 430 and decided to come give this place a try. It's a very tiny place but has a drive-thru window. I decided to go because I like to gather my own salsas and stuff. The place was clean inside but they can really use a new menu. Luckily I knew what I wanted and didn't care about the price. They have a hand written sign for taco pricing and a few pictures for their combos.

I ended up getting two carne asada burritos and a large Jamaica for like $15. I have no complaints about the food what so ever. My food was ready before I was done filling up my four little salsa cups. The meat was very tender. Only thing is, if you don't like spicy foods like my bf, do not get any salsa at all! I had the red in my burrito and got green on the side for him. The green is suppose to mild but this one is a hot mild. Almost seemed a bit spicier than the red.

I will be coming back. Think they have $0.70. Tacos on Wednesdays as well.
