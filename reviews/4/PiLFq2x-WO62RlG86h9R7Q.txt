Haven't eaten at Filiberto's in quite awhile but when they opened in Laveen decided to give it another try. It has been a couple of years since I had eaten there.  This new location in Southern is clean and the employees are friendly. Food was much better than the food I had been served before. It was hot, fresh, and tasted great.  I will definitely be going back!
