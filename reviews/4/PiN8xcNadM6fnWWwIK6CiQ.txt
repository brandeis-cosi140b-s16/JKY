A friend from out of town and I were driving through the Uni area in Charlotte looking for somewhere to stop for lunch when she suggested the giant orange building we were driving by... for some reason I had never seen this giant glaringly bright orange building before, but figured what the hell, let's eat at the orange place.  I was surprised to find out it was a Don Pedro, I frigging love Don Pedro! Why didn't anybody tell me this was here?
The atmosphere is great, the interior is very Mexican. They give you THREE salsas, 3 free salsas when you sit down and warm chips.  Then the guacamole cart rolls on by, that stuff is awesome.  
The staff here is attentive, friendly and helpful with the menu.  And the menu, ahh.. the menu, it's huge! I've had the tacos and ACP, both great choices.  This is truly one of the best Mexican joints in Charlotte and I'm so happy they opened in the University area!

And anywhere I get to show off my high school Spanish skills is a win in my book.
