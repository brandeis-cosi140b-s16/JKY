I really enjoyed the food I had from America's Taco Shop North last night. The Burro de Pastor rotisserie pork was wonderful, though I could have done without the pineapple. The salsa that came with the chips was GREAT! The guacamole was fresh and amazing. The bean and cheese burrito was highlighted by a buttery soft flour tortilla. I will definitely be frequenting this shop. They've done a great job with lifting the curse of that particular corner.
