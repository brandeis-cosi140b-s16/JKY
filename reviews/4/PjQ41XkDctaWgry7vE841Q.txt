I am always looking to support small businesses and this one did not disappoint me. I was a little apprehensive about the appearance on the outside but decided to give it a try. They have a large variety of foods. The chicken salad is GREAT, the place is clean and the staff are very friendly. Don't let the appearance stop you, try it, you will not be disappointed either.
