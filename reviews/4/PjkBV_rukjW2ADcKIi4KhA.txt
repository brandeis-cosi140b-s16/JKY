After a great week in Arizona, my family and I decided on one last southwestern meal before flying home. We lived in Arizona a long time and have many time enjoyed a meal at the Blue Burrito on Camelback and in Scottsdale. I wasn't expecting much from the airport so I was very surprised when everything we ordered turned out about as good as we remembered from the main restaurants. My son enjoyed the blue burrito, which sadly was not colored blue as it should have been. But it tasted great. I ordered carnitas tacos made on blue corn tortilla (which actually was blue colored) and it was delicious.  I would definitely eat here again and would not hesitate to recommend it to my fellow travelers.
