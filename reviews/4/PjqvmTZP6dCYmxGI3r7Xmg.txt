Yay! What a good experience. In fact, so good I went back for seconds and am drafting this review while el cocinero prepara mis tacos. 

So I came in to judge a bean burrito. That's it. I figure if a taco shop can't make a decent bean burrito then why trust them with such intricate creations as tacos or tortas (or God forbid, a quesadilla).

It was good. Real good. And unique. A little smaller than a Berto's bean, and a little looser and with white cheese instead of yellow, but good. The salsa bar is good for a un-gourmet shop. The red and green salsas have tons more flavor than other places, and tons less bacteria aswell thanks to the refrigerated holder. Who would've thought, keeping ready to eat foods at decent temperatures. Shocking!

The pico is good, and FREE! A little too much onion and the few tomatoes weren't quite ripe enough, but I'm not complaining. Not bad. 

Then the tacos came. 1.25 each for choice of meat. I did the Asada and Carnitas, and I'd do it all again, dammit! Little TJ street style tacos with just the right amount of seasoning on the meat. I'm serious, try a bite before you salt it up. 

These went great with the accoutrements. Perfectly paired. 

So for around $5 I had a great, tasty lunch. I might come back for dinner. 

...and somewhere off in the sunset, in a dry and dusty land, a chain taco shop is crying because they just lost their best customer- except on $1 chicken taco Wednesdays, por supuesto...
