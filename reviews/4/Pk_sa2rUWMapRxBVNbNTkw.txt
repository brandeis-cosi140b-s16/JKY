two words: FUNDIDO STYLE!!

Like one reviewer said, if you've been to one Mexican restaurant, you've been to 100.  The same can be said for La Fonda.  There is nothing special about this place, and I've always found it a little slow in the service department.  What separates La Fonda from every other Mexican restaurant is their fundido sauce.  You can make about anything fundido style, which is a generous serving of sauce consisting of cheese, sour cream, and jalapenos smothered over the top of your entree.  I had never heard of fundido sauce before coming here, so I'm not sure if it's something you can get elsewhere or their own creation.  Either way, it's worth it to go there just for that.
