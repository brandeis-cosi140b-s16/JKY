Just stopped there and had a quick lunch. We ate inside, it's a small place in a strip mall. Really good food, made to order fresh! There was a constant line and people in and out. We had a value meal. 2 tacos, and churros and a drink for $18. It was great! 
I would recommend it. The beef tacos were shredded beef. Very fresh.
