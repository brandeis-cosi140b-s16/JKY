After reading that they have caramelos I had to go!  Its a small place but was able to sit inside & it was clean. I had a caramelo & a hotdog. Boy was it good! My husband had the carne asada tacos & pastor torta & he liked both. They have a nice condiment bar with limes,onions, pico de gallo, jalapenos and some other stuff. It was fresh too. The price cant be beat either.
