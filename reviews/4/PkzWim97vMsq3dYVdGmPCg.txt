A spot you can't really stumble upon without some prior planning, since it has no sign and is anonymously tucked behind a tiny entryway (copper doors with bars). So its pretty appropriate that you would need to do some research before arriving. Beyond just finding the place, you ought to be prepared (mentally, physically) and strategic about ordering. 

My takeaways: The real draw are the appetizers here, which on their own are enough to feed a hungry crowd. 5 of us were stuffed after sharing two seriously awesome appetizers: The queso is swimming with fresh spinach and spicy pork sausage, and the garlic appetizer was a meal unto its own with garlic roasted to a smooth pulp, meant to be spread on bread and smothered with the platters-worth of roasted veggies, onions and melted cheese. Then comes the rest of the food, each person's order served basically on a similarly humongous tray lined with a toasted tortilla, and then loaded up with PILES of whatever the dish entailed, e.g. seemingly the whole side of a pig, lovingly braised but far too much for one person to even look at, plus a pint of beans, and equal amount of rice, eggs, potatoes, more tortilla, etc.

Whether you choose to prepare yourself accordingly, know this: no matter what you will probably still trundle away in a happy food coma for the next several hours.
