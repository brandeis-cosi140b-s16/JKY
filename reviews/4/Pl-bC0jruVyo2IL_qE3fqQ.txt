I enjoy going to Manuels. I had never been to this location until last night. 

It is clean, the food is delicious, the service is friendly. The prices are on par with other comparable mexican food places.

My GF smashed her food quickly and was thoroughly satisfied. She told me to give them 5 stars. I told her to get her own Yelp account LOL.

I give them 4 stars. They lost the fifth star because I felt like the menu was pretty limited. What they did have on the menu sounded really good, but I felt like I was lacking options.

I tried the chicken fajitas. They were indeed good, but I was expecting more trim to come with my sizzling skillet. The skillet itself was delicious; chicken, onions, bell peppers, half tomato, and cilantro (on the stems?)...But on the side, just two tortillas, green sauce, guac, and sour cream. I am used to other places also giving me some shredded cheese, lettuce, and maybe pico de gayo. It was good, and that is their design. I guess I just care for a more vibrant fajita. 

Oh yeah and this is the kind of place that gives you rice "OR" beans, but not both (most meals)...I think there's something screwed up with that. Anybody want a Jelly sandwich? Peanutbutter is available if you order it seperate.

None the less, I was full, and my lady was pleased. I will certainly go back anytime. 

Popos is still king.
