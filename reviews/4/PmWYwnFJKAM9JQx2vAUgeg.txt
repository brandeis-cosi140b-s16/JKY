Leaving the club...looking for late night eats...and In-N-Out's closed!  This Chicago kid was ready to commit ritualistic suicide on the spot.

Well, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as we came here, and I finally got to try carne asada fries.  This leads me to believe that Tacos Mexico used to be known as Tacos France (seriously though...what a stupid name).

Whatever...even though they weren't on the menu, they sure did serve the fries.  And while my Californian friends remarked that it's made a lot better near them, I had no complaints.  They were cheap, plentiful, and damn tasty.
