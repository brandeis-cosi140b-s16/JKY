Ordered a bean and cheese burrito at like 11:30pm. Sometimes you just gotta give in... and this time, there were no regrets. 

I did request rice to be in there, too, but I think the drive thru sound system is funky since she had a hard time hearing us... and I didn't get my rice, but it wasn't on my receipt either. Oh well. 

Pretty solid.
