Keep in mind this is not a luxury restaurant and is only for breakfast and lunch. This is a no-frills, quick and friendly service place.  The decoration could use some love, but their business is food, not decoration. They have a very good variety in the menu that tastes really good and is not just sandwiches. I definitively would go back for a quick lunch at a very, very reasonable price.
