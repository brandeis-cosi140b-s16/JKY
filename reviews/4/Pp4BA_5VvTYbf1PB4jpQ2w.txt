Conveniently located across from UNLV, it's just a short walk away from school to get yourself a nice burrito, burrito bowl, or tacos from Chipotle. They serve everything like any standard Chipotle. It can become busy at times, especially around lunch, but if you go during non-peak hours, the lines are usually pretty short and you can get your food fairly quickly. They lock the bathroom here, so you have to ask the cashier at the front to unlock it, and they will press a button which unlocks the bathroom for you. Good food at a good place.
