Not too shabby... Of course the interior isn't much to be desired, but I have always learned that some of the best Mexican places are tiny little run down shacks. 

We hit this place up on a Groupon purchase and was pleasantly surprised by the delicious plates that arrived. The fresh chips and salsa were great, service was pleasant and quick, as our overall experience was above average. I had the tamale/enchilada plate and my husband had the two chicken tacos plate. Both were pretty good and the price was cheap (even if we weren't using our $1 for $10 Groupon).

Thanks for the experience Mi Pueblo Mexican! We enjoyed!
