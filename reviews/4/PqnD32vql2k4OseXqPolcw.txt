Wow!  We never knew this little gem of a place was just a few miles from home. Loved the authentic food choices. The staff were friendly and the food was very good.  I had the Elote Loco and Taco Locos and we ordered Guacamole to share.  Everything was really good and we will definitely come and visit Sabor again!
