Great Mexican food. I go here for lunch often. Quick service, cheap food, good margaritas.

Outside the sign says, "Now Open." That has been what the sign has said for a few years now, which is odd. 

I think they get most of their business for lunch. They are open until 9, but when I drive by after work the parking lot is usually pretty empty.
