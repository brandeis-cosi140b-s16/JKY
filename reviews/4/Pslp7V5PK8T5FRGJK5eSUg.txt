Four stars due to the generally very good but way too loud live music.  We were unable the hear the waitress or the other couple at our table.  Appetizer included very tender shrimp and fresh corn tortilla. The expensive guac was excellent as usual, but the roll up cart for the guac production would not fit in between the tables so we missed the " show."  The drinks at the bar were fresh tasting and refreshing considering the 110 degree heat. My mole chicken was tender, the sauce appropriately spicy. Churro desert was split between four adults.  Lots of chocolate and caramel, although churro was not crispy.  Overall fun for groups.
