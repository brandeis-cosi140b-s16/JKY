I could love Distrito.  But I have to be able to actually order food in order to get to that point.

My husband and I stopped in for an early brunch, around 11.  The restaurant was nearly empty, yet service was mysteriously slow.  It took forever to get drinks, but in the bartender's defense, she looked engaged in important conversation with another employee.  But I was a big fan of the Paloma margarita made with grapefruit soda.  

I tried to order the chicken enchilada.  They were "out".  I then ordered the chilaquiles, but the server came back because they were "out."  How?  They hadn't even been open 30 minutes and no one was there.  Made me think there was a problem with the chicken.  Scary.  So I went with the breakfast burrito because they apparently had eggs and chorizo.  It was good, but not what I wanted.

Now I'm at 3 stars, but I have to bump to four because they have excellent guacamole and The Best shrimp ceviche.  It's so good they should rename it that.  The Best Ceviche.  I look forward to another visit, but will ask for the list of what they do have first.
