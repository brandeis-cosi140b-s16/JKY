Tucked into a strip mall in the NE corner of 7th St & Bethany this gem is easy to drive by. Service was quick and polite. The decor is hip and minimal. Reminds me of done of the down town coffee shops and the open space into the kitchen makes you feel more apart of the cooking experience. I recommend the Paella and Pollo Asado.  The house made tortilla are chewy and fresh. This is another venue striving to provide fresh local ingredients in their menu.  I had their enchiladas with Verde twice with varying success. The first time they were incredibly hot the second much milder and pleasant. Very much with a visit! 

My only complaint was twice when I went they had live music that made it almost impossible to speak with your dining companion.
