Best Sangria I have ever had!

I was with a friend and we were in the area and hungry so I used yelp to search something nearby and ended up here.

Pricey? Yes, quite so... I'm never really in the habit of checking the price rating for Mexican food places but I will definitely do so from now on. The price is the reason for the four star rating. I feel they should have larger portions for the price.

The food was great. I had chicken soup, it was tasty. We shared a chef's special which that night was lamb. It was very good as well. We had the pastel de tres leches and it was fantastic. 

The service was great! The server was right on top of everything and took some time to explain the menu items and give us recommendations. We got there just before their closing time and they didn't rush us at all the entire time we were there.

This a great date place. Look forward to coming here next time with husband.
