Update...went a few saturdays ago and the place was packed.  In fact we got the last non reserved table.  I had the stacked enchiladas which were very good but lacked the spice that the menu warned about.  My wife's burrito was also quite good, and my son loved the make your own nachos.  The highlight of the evening were the hot buttered tortillas.  You could make a meal of those alone. 

The bad news- the service.  First we had to stand around while the hostesses first gabbed with some local wannabe rockstar hero, then when they got around to us they needed to look around and try to find a table.  When we said we didn't have reservations it was as if we somehow offended them. We waited over 25 minutes for our food to arrive and when t did get to us it wasn't piping hot as if it just came out of the oven. 

Its not the traditional Mexican faire, and I am glad that it isn't.  I can only tolerate so many Garcia's, LaFonda's, etc. 
I was glad to see that they are pushing several happy hour specials and have started weekend brunch and the occasional patio pig roast.  

It appears that some of the initial excitement has died down but they are still bringing the people in, which is good-the area needs it.
