I came back, and really had a great experience all around.  The one thing that I will say is my tamale wasn't as good as normal.  It gets an A-.  Seriously, though, I have never had a bad meal here, and ordered chicken burrito and enchilada, and it was obviously high quality meat.  Food is reasonably priced for the quality.  

Highly recommend this place.
