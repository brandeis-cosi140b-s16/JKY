I definitely enjoyed the food that we ordered here. The crispy fish tacos and the bbq taco was very delicious. i do wish that had a wider selection of appetizer, i just ordered chips and guacamole and wasn't really interested in anything else. (but that's just me)

I did go during the slow time so my server was very attentive and made sure that everything was ok. I enjoy the atmosphere of this restaurant and their alcohol selection. I would like to come back and try some of more of their unique tacos.
