It was a perfect spot for a late night meal...and as funny as it sounds- great ice! Haha Its late and nearly empty, so it's a very relaxed "anti-people" atmosphere at the moment. Fits my mood...but this is clearly due to the time of night I stopped in. All the meats were sampled, and all were delicious!
