It's hard to judge fast food because it's just that -- FAST food. There are always gonna be those bad experiences due to whatever it may be ; the car in front of you in drive thru, random employee having an off day, food actually wasn't completely up to par, but more often than not, we get what we pay for, right? I have yet to experience a bad experience at this drive thru. They've always been friendly and food has filled my Taco Bell craving. Love the grillers, love the fiesta potatoes, love the Mexican pizzas (when in the mood).
