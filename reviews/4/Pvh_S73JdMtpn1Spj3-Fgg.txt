A buddy of mine turned me on to this place a few years ago and I've been coming here ever since. I only get one thing here, and they do it better than anyone else.

California burrito - When you first see this thing, what  comes to mind is "how am I going to finish this thing"? But it goes down pretty easily. This burrito is loaded with rice, beef and sauce and guacamole. At roberto's you'll end up paying more for a burrito that is loaded with mostly potatoes, not beef. 

If you're hungry and need a quick pick me up, this is the place to go.
