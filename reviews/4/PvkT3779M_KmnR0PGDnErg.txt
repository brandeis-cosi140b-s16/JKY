The food is delicious and honestly makes me forget Chipotle exists. The only downside is DO NOT EVER cone on a Sunday. Kids eat for free on Sunday so it is nothing but unsupervised kids. The kids run around and don't use their inside voices. This causes the staff to be perpetually distracted and you have to yell at the top of your lungs for them to hear what you want.
