My husband and I just happened to come across this place one Tuesday afternoon. Lucky for us it was Taco Tuesday! $1.50 shredded beef tacos all day. They were AWESOME! The crispy corn shell was the best I've ever had. We put on a little chalula sauce and it was perfection.

The margaritas are pretty good too. I like how they make the sweet and sour mix and use fresh lime juice.  We sat outside and we really enjoyed the atmosphere, laid back and casual. We had our dog with us and it was a good time.

Only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 is because the waiter knew it was our first time there and he didn't ask us if we wanted the complimentary chips and salsa. I only found out after coming on yelp that we had to ask for it.
