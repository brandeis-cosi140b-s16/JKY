This is our go to place for Taco Tuesdays. This is the old Firefly location on Paradise Road. Lots of gourmet tacos to choose from and ALL of the ones I tried were amazing. Tons of beers on tap and in bottles. 

PROS: Puerco Verde taco- shredded pork,green sauce, Chicharr√≥ns & cheese
            Bean & cheese taco - pinto refried beans, cheese & pickled onions.
            Crunchy Taco - mashed potatoes, ground beef, lettuce, cheese 
            Al pastor taco -  marinated pork, pineapples, pickled onions & avocado sauce

CONS: Carne Asada taco (wasn't crazy about it but it was "aight")
