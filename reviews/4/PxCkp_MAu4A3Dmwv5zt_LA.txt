I really like this place. The ambiance is a little noisy for my taste and the service is a little disorganized (when your food is ready you take it to a condiments station to load it up and then, if you have a burrito, you take it back to the counter so they can wrap it for you) however the food was really good. We had Carne asada and pork barbacoa, cabeza and lengua, and all of it was really good. My husband went back for seconds. When a slight mix up occurred (we got a barbacoa taco when we ordered the carne asada) , the manager asked if we would like to keep it while he got us the right order a classy move. 

Also, the red salsa... Super delicious and super spicy. My husband loves spicy salsa and is often underwhelmed with claims of spicy salsa. This one however, fried his palate. We will definitely be coming back for more. 

5 people eating (2 kids)  and the total came out to $45ish.
