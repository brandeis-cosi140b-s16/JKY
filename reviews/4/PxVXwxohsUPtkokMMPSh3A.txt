This place is a really deelish! Fresh ceviche and their queso dip was really good. The only negatives were the servers did not seem to understand English very well so that made it difficult to make sure we were on the same page and when you first walk in you  are hit by a wall of fish smell. The owner was very nice and the food was fresh. Give it a try.
