Stopped here after our flight from Seattle, I was suuuuper hungry so appreciated the fast service. I had the carne asada burrito, it was HUGE and they didn't skimp on the meat at all. Bf had steak and chicken tacos which he liked. The horchata was very good, not too sweet or chalky like some other places where I've had it. Pickled carrots from the condiment bar were pretty bland to me but the jalape√±os were yummy, I'm a baby when it comes to spicy food but they were very flavorful with just enough heat. I can't say I'd go out of my way to come here but I would eat here again if it was convenient.
