This is my favourite Mad Mex location, especially in the summertime, sitting in a window booth. It's usually hard to get on a nice day, but if you're willing and have the time to wait, I think it's worth it! It's a pretty noisy place, so be willing to talk over clanging glass, other loud voices and TVs to be heard, but it's a fun place to go with a group. I'm a vegetarian so I love the Happy Hippy quesadilla. Never disappoints. Lots of veggies, perfect amount of cheese. I only wish the guac serving was more generous (I usually always have to request an extra side).
