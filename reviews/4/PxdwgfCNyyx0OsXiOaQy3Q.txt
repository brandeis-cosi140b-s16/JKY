Very, very surprised! Been driving by this place for a while now. Have been hesitant to try it. So on our way back from our foster kids therapy. We decided to stop by on our way home. I had the carne asada soft tacos. First they are large, and very good. I also had a bite of Natalies chile verde burrito. I liked it because it also had beans in it. All five kids really enjoyed their dinner. Wife had the cheese enchiladas, and said it was worth coming back for. 
The only down side at this place is their decor is worn and dated. Needs to be updated. But this place is well worth it. Glad we tried it, and will continue to come back.
