I was craving some mexican food last Saturday and remembered seeing the reviews on this place and wanted to check it out and I am very glad that I did.

This place was delicious and authentic and the absolute best part is that the have 99 cent margaritas on Saturday and Tuesday ALL DAY !!!!!  I was in heaven. This is just the house margarita...but hell...for that price you can not go wrong.

We had the mini platter that came with tacos, flautas, chimichangas, a big tamale, tostada, and rice and beans. It was all delicious ( wehad our with the machaca). We also ordered a bowl of the Albondigas soup and it was sooo yummy !! Chips and salsa were great too !! We had the fried ice cream for dessert...nothing spectacular...just fried ice cream...but good anyway.

The service here was friendly, fast, and very attentive. I will definetly bo back here and would recommend it to you all !!!
