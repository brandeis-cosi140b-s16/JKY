This place is interesting.  It's got the ambience of upscale, but the owner obviously tries to cover all the bases by making some really down-home dishes.  The nopales salad with white cheese on it is enough to bring me back all by itself.  My only problem with this place, I guess, is I was looking for the place where the locals go, some hole-in-the-wall rice-and-bean joint, and this clearly isn't it.  I'd definitely go back, though.
