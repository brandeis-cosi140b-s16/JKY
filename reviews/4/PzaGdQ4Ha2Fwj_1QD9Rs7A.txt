I have been here a few times so I am surprise to see it seems I have never reviewed this place.
First - Cash only! I almost got in trouble for not having enough to pay the bill, but my amico came to the rescue... Also, they don't have fountain drinks, so if you like coke or so they are by bottle or can.

I usually come here because of the tripitas. I like their burros de tripitas very much. This last time I had one to go and had menudo for dinner there... meh... not a big fan. I don't know, it was like a lot of broth, not much meat and hominy, and not very tasty...  I will try to remember that next time and stick with the tripitas.

Service is OK, our server was in fact very patient... horchata was too sweet. I will try a Sangria Se√±orial next time. : )
