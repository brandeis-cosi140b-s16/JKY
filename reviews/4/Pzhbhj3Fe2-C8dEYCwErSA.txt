This is one of my favorite hidden spots to eat in Oakland, which is surprising because I'm really not a Mexican food lover. But I really want to plan a return trip here. I have yet to be disappointed by Mi Ranchito. For what I pay, I always get a pretty darn reasonable (i.e. big) plate of food.

Depending on when you walk in this place will either be busy and noisy or empty and quiet; I've been here at night during finals week at Pitt and during the day in the summer. Guess what environment I experienced on which days? No, this is not a trick question. I actually came here with a group of 16 when it was finals week, so I'm still impressed by the place's ability to squeeze us in comfortably. The food did take a little while to all get to the table, but I mean, there were 16 of us and it was finals week. Everything we did get, once it arrived, was amazing, and the waiters did their best to help us out as we waited for the cooks to do their job.

I don't usually order alcohol when here so I can't testify to the state of the bar - so no commentary on that. And before you ask: my favorite dish here is the quesadilla - their cheese quesadillas are delicious! 

I'll hopefully be back soon to get my usual!
