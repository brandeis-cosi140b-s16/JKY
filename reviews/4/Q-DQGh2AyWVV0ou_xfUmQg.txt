Top 3 high/low lights

1) free chips, salsa, and rice in the bar area every night
2) great service
3) good food

Had dinner at Pedro's on a recent weeknight!

The place is gigantic and it was nice to be seated right away. The service was quick and we were bought a basket of chips and salsa (gluten free!) and a basket of warm flour tortillas (sadly not gluten free because they smelled DIVINE). I had a mango margarita (Pedro's has lots of options for their house margs) which was great. They have a gluten free menu within their standard menu and as with most Mexican restaurants there are lots of g free options. I had tacos in corn tortillas with veggies and rice on the side. The food was good! And you get a lot for the price. 

I also noticed they do free chips, salsa, queso and Spanish rice in the bar area. We will definitely be back for that!
