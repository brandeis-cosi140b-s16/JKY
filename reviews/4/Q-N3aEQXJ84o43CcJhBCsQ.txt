BOTTOMLESS BRUNCH WITH BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS!

My boyfriend and I woke up so hungry in Vegas... and didn't want to travel far.  We were staying at the Mandalay Bay and wanted something with a little variety.  I love the idea of a tapas brunch menu.  You can order to your hearts content with one flat fee per person... and add $10 a person for bottomless mimosas.  They have so many different flavors, it made my head spin!  I tried one of each flavor... so my head was spinning afterwards for a different reason.  

Service was spot on - they left you alone at the right times and checked back often to see if we wanted to order anything else or needed a refill on our drinks.  This was a nice break away from the traditional buffet style that's so popular in Vegas.  

I will be back!
