I was excited to try a sushi fusion. This place  did not disappoint! The service, food, and ambiance was great! We had the jalape√±o poppers which were delicious, much bigger and more filling than other places. They also gave us some sort of tangy soy sauce with chile powder in it. Made the sushi taste even better especially the carne asada roll. We also had the volcano roll which was good but not as good as the other food. My 1 and 2 yr olds shared some fried rice and loved it.
