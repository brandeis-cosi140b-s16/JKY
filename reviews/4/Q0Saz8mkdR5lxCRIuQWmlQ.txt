Almost everyone is leaving a review for the taco stand outside of Reyna Foods which has nothing to do with this grocery store!
The taco stand is owned by a different person, not by Reyna Foods. They may use their totillas but the food is actually made by Edgardo (the old Taco Loco owner) and recent owner of Edgar's Mexican Cuisine. 

Reyna Foods does carry everything you need to make an authentic Latin dish (I know, I'm from Argentina and I can find anything here) but their prices can be high; like for example their empanada dough. They only carry brand "La Salte√±a" (from Argentina and the best brand out there) they are frozen though. I'm still hoping for them to get Goya or other ones (that wont come to mind at the moment). 
They also have many argentinean brands of Dulce de Leche (I don't care if this one is pricey because as fattening as that is, and as tempted as I can get with one pot, I don't mind not being able to get it). And Yerba Mate, all of the brand from Argentina and Paraguay, and they also have them in flavors.

UPDATE (Dec. 2013): Reyna food has replaced Edgar's tacos stand and Edgar's tacos has been moved around the corner, closer to Pamela's on 21st Street. You can't miss it.
