We enjoyed this restaurant. It has a nice location along the canal inside the shopping corridors of the Venetian. There are not really any walls in the dining area of this restaurant but some tables are located under a roof of this restaurant while others are "outside" under the high blue roof of the Venetian.  The atmosphere is nice. It is somewhat loud because let's face it, you are basically in the middle of a mall.  The food was quite good with a variety of rather unique twists on traditional mexican food. The portions were adequate but not ridiculous.  Prices were typical of the Vegas factor - higher than what they should be for what you get but weren't outrageous.  I'd return to this restaurant.
