Weird to see a food truck turn its concept into a brick and mortar store but given its location to me, there are no complaints!

Went in the other day for the first time (my girlfriend has had their food from the truck before but neither of us have had food from the store) after seeing the carne asada fries on their instagram.  We split an order of those as well as a carne quesadilla, and had a coupon for a free luncharita (which do not have alcohol in them, which mildly surprised me).  

The guy behind the counter couldn't have been nicer! He gave us samples of the flavors for our luncharita and when we went to add on some chips to our order after having paid, he told us not to worry about it.

The Carne fries were, just, amazing.  The only thing I would mention is that the liquid cheese was a little overpowering/overdone but the fries were perfect, carne was tasty, and they also put some siracha on top. A full to go box full for $10, reminded me a lot of carne asada fries from Tacos El Gordo in Las Vegas in terms of portion size.  Two grown adults weren't able to take this down in one sitting (but it was just as tasty the next day reheated!)

The quesadilla was just as tasty with gobs of cheese, though a little smaller than I would have thought given the price, it also comes with chips.

They have a good selections of salsa and the mason jar you get with the Luncharita is yours to keep and bring back for $3 refills.

Overall our meal for the two of us, was $19 (take in to account we had a coupon for the drink and were given a free order of chips which are normally two bucks) which is pretty darn good for the quality you're getting.

I'm sure we will be back!
