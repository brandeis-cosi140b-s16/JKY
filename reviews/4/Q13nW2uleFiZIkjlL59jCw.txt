I was craving this place so I was happy from the minute I parked the car.  I had the 2 tacos, rice and beans.  The rice and beans were fabulous, the tacos were so-so, but still filled my craving.  What I really wanted were chips and guacamole because I saw some other people eating them and they looked divine.  Anyhow, I plan to go back and try more items off the menu.  But for the most part, I was pretty happy.
