Had great food and would have been 5 stars if not for a few service hiccups. All the tables had two place settings apiece and the server did not bring over a third place setting for our party when we were seated. He also gave us only two menus. Come on, now, the place was between the Sat lunch and dinner period and we were the only table occupied for the first ten minutes we were there. Food is excellent. Great tortilla soup and chicken mole. Rice, beans, veggies, all very tasty with generous portions. Guac great and tortillas, too. This place hits it out of the park with food quality, just need to tweak service a little.
