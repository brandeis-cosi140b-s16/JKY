Yum! Very similar to other Mexican places around, except with a little more flavor. (Pretty sure there's lard in those beans.) and so cheap! We almost felt bad using our Bucky Book coupon. The one down side - SO LOUD. Tall space, brick walls, open door, and full of people. We could barely hear each other talk.
