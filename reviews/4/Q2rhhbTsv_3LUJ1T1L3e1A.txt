Delicious margaritas! And for a few dollars more it is possible to supersize them! My dinner was bacon-wrapped beef tenderloin medallions and shrimp. It was a treat for the taste buds.  The chile rellenos, two chile peppers stuffed with shredded beef and doused in cheese, were also good.  But, the true star at Abuelo's is the margarita.  Warning: one supersized margarita can make you feel very happy.  Two would be dangerous.
