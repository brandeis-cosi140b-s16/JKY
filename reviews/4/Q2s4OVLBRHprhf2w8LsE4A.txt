this is the place I go to get real mexican food but tweaked the way I like it. They always make what I want even though it isnt on the menu. It's a carne asada quesadilla with diced green chilies and extra cheese. Oh yea... I've tried a bunch of almost identical mexican food shops like this one in the valley but this one stands out because they remember who I am and were really ok with me asking for something different and maybe strange even without speaking spanish.
