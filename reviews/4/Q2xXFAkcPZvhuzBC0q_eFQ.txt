How I haven't reviewed this before is a total loss to me. The owners are simply terrific!! I am reserving 1 star for the simple fact that we are in Phoenix and Mexican restaurants are a dime a dozen, and there are some that serve out of this world food. Salsa Cabanas has awesome food, but there are a couple that out do them. That being said, no other Mexican joint has the pride of ownership, the friendly atmosphere or the salsa!! The salsa, I'm drooling right now. It's so GOOD!! I used to order a taco and enchilada combo, but I have now gone to two enchilada because the tacos were a little light on meat for my liking. Their refried beans can't be beat! Margaritas are great, but again the owners are what keep us going there every few weeks, and we have been doing that for dinner every 3 or 4 weeks for three weeks. Love it!!
