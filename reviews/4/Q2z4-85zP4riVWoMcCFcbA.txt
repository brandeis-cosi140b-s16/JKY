Robertos Taco Shop, open 24/7 is the place to go for a quick snack--I heard so many great things, about service, and the food.  You don't have to go to a fancy Mexican restaurant for good food, cause Roberto's not only has the taste, but their service is quick and the staff always has a smile on their face, especially the cashiers.  And if you go there often, they remember your order.  Robertos makes the grade and is 4 stars for me!
