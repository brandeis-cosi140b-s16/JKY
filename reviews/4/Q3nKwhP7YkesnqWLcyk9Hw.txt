I'm surprised to hear such negative reviews.  When I used to live in Chandler, we used to walk over for lunch or dinner.  The family who runs the place was always so nice.  I remember enjoying everything we had.  They've been around for years and years, before the Madstone/AMC went out of business.  I think that says something about the restaurant.
