Believe the hype! Cafe Rio has great food. I've tried several of the items on their menu and have never been disappointed. My mouth is watering as I write this review thinking about the delicious sweet pork. They have lunch specials that change with the day of the week. I believe Tuesdays are coconut shrimp taco day, and those are by far my favorite lunch special. I always get a side of their creamy tomatillo dressing to dip my tacos in! Try it! The only reason I'm knocking off a star is for their slow lunch service. It takes 20 - 25 minutes sometimes to get thru the lunch line!
