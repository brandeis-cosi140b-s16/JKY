You will not think you are in a taco place at all. Serious disco funky vibe going on. I loved the neon flashing lights in the windows. We found this place by accident looking for the pizza place next door.  We were starving after attending a Mixology event across the street. From the minute we walked in we were treated like royalty. It is very apparent that Dave the manager just adores his restaurant. He is very proud of it and was a wonderful host, stopping by our table many times and yaking it up with us. I really felt at home here. 

It was not the best Mexican food I ever had but it was solid. What I had was very good and I would go back. Their Gauc is very flavorful and chunky here. It was delicious and I slaughtered the entire bowl. Haha! I was not a fan of their chips and salsa for some reason. I am not sure why. I think it was much more about me then them. Just a personal taste thing more than the quality of the food. It also could have been the Whiskey talking from the Yelp event we just came from. ;)----Oh yeah, I also had a Carne Asada taco that was pretty good. My Yelp buddy had a chicken Burro that she gave five stars to. They are doing something right for sure. I would go back for the service alone. Talk about being spoiled.
