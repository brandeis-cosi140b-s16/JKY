The food presentation is a little lacking, but in over 120 visits, they've never gotten my order wrong. My wife orders the same things every time, but I order something different ever week. The bathrooms are clean and the lobby is well maintained, with super reliable AC, a totally "cool" feature in hot Arizona.

The service is fast, and they are always friendly. I forgot my bag once, and the manager went above and beyond to return it. He even looked me up on Facebook and contacted a mutual friend, so I could get it back right away.
