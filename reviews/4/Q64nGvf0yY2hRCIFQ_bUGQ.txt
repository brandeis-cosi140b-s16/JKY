I have been here once. Thank you Genny C. 

I had the chilaquiles y huevos ($7.95: cut up corn tortillas smothered in red chile and cheese and topped with eggs - i suggest over medium). A huge fan of huevos rancheros, I had never had chilaquiles (or heard of them) before this visit.  They took hold of me! I dream of them now. I wake longing for them. I wish they were served past 10:30. 

As for the restaurant: the place is ginormous! Don't let the security guards in the parking lot put you off. Instead, let them get the door for you and take comfort in a delicious meal served by friendly staff who will greet you in Spanish but just as easily will answer you in English.
