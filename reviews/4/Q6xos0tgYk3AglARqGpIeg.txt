This is an update to an earlier review. I recently revisited Los Arcos and didn't have the buffet. The menu item was superb. And the beer special is second to non in the area. The only suggestion that i have is to have fresh homemade salsa instead of jarred salsa. This will elevate the experience and make it a destination restaurant.
