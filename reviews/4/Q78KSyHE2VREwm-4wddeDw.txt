Qdoba was kind of an after thought for me.  With Salsaritas and now Chipolte near by, I stopped in to the Qdoba location just because it was convenient as I was going to another business in the same shopping center.  The manager was outgoing and enthusiastic, and recomended the Mexican Gumbo.  I have not looked back since.  I dine there at least once a week now, sometimes more, as this dish is truly addicting.  It is a big bowl with beans, and rice if you desire, a wonderfully spicy tomato sauce base.  I add chicken, pico di gallo, habanero salsa, cheese and top it off with tortilla strips.  It is a healthy, filling meal that is over the top delicious.  I still like Chipolte and Salsaritas, but they don't have anything on Qdoba's Mexican gumbo.  Yum-just yum!
