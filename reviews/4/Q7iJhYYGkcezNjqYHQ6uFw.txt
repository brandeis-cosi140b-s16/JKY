Found this place when we were visiting family and wow!!! Best hot dog I've had in a long time. Sonoran style hot dog was a the bomb!!!! Highly recommend this place! Will definitely be back when we come visit next time. Only reason it didn't get a 5 star was because the location was not very appealing .
