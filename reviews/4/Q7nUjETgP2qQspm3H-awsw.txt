My boyfriend and I hit the Yolos bar last Saturday night, before catching the early performance of Peepshow (terrible). 

We each had a Margarona, which is a bottle of Corona tipped into a giant Margarita. It was really refreshing and delicious. We decided to have some appetizers- chip, guacamole, salsa and a shrimp dish. The food was excellent and I wish that we had decided to have a full meal here.

In the end it was a little pricey- three drinks and the appetizers came to around eighty dollars. However, we enjoyed everything and our bartender was very nice and personable. She even took care of fixing a mistake from the kitchen, walking back there and getting our order done right. 

I would definitely go back here.
