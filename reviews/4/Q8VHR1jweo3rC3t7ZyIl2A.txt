I am a fan of their tacos and rice/beans. I came in here for a $5 special on Hooked for 2 tacos and rice/beans. The portion was adequate (I think they could have used a smaller plate. The large plate with the portion given made it look very small!). The tacos I got were carnitas and steak. The carnitas had a slight sweetness that I didn't expect but I really enjoyed. It was delicious and flavorful! The steak was likewise very delicious. It was topped with cilantro and onion, and their accompanying chips and salsa were very yummy. The salsa was so spicy!! I loved it, hah. I would return here for their $1 tacos. I haven't tried their other items but I would be very curious to try their other plates, or their soups.
