this place is 1 of 3 'Mexican' restaurants along Carson Street and overall, it's my favorite compared to the mediocre portion-controlled Emiliano's (tiny portions, mediocre dull uninspired food/expensive) and La Palapa (good but a tiny little space, not good for groups and kind've expensive, also .)
El Toro Loco is somewhat Americanized to suit the American Pittsburgh palate but it's still good n tasty .   The atmosphere is colorful cheery & bright which is nice .
There was previously, another Mexican restaurant in this same space - Taco Loco which didn't last more than a couple years here for whatever reason .  It was a steel mill worker bar, eons ago .
I recommend the Chorizo-Cheese fries as an appetizer .  Cheese & Chorizo were meant for each other !!!
I think the prices are on the high side for a burrito and etc but i'm sure their rent is very high considering it's on the more high-price end of Carson Street .
I don't ever see any kind of advertising or promotion for this place ... they'd be good to invest in some of that and put up a billboard around town here & there as the big Chinese buffets sometimes do ...
Speaking of which --- i'd love to see them offer an all you can eat buffet once or twice a week ... it would surely be a hit with all the scores of college kids who live in the area during the College school months ...  Anyone that's hungover loves a buffet ...
