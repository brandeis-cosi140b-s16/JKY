I love Roberto's 3am in the morning.  I work until 3am on Sunday nights and class at 8am on Monday.  If I go to sleep, I cannot wake up until 11am.... So I always go to this Roberto's to grab breakfast and sit for 2 to 3 hours reading.  Reading at Roberto's?  It is quite weird but I got use to it.  

The only thing about this location is that sometimes Homeless people come to purchase a drink and they sleep at a booth... The staff there is also very friendly regardless of the late hour.  The food is decent.  It's not the best Mexican food ever, but I like it. My favorites are fish tacos and California burrito.  I recently tried the fish burrito but I think tacos are way better just because the fish stays crispy with the taco wrap.  So I like this location.
