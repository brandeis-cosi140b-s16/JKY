The overall quality of Mexican food in Henderson makes me want to cry.  Most of the decent taquerias are at least several miles away on the east side of Vegas.  And with the exception of the Lindo Michoacan chains in Henderson, I haven't found any food that is Mexican and noteworthy within the town limits. . . 

That is until Super Burrito opened recently.  Driving down Eastern a few months ago, I suddenly noticed the place were there.  So I stopped in.  And after the first visit, I've kept stopping in and stopping in and stopping in and stopping in. . .  

Super Burrito is a top notch taqueria.  They do a great job with the classic burritos-- carne asada and chicken.  Well-prepared meat with delicious beans, rice, cheese, sour cream and guacamole in a nice tortilla.  Each time I order one, I weep for my teenage self who suffered by repeatedly ordering Taco Bell, not knowing what he was missing.

If that was all that Super Burrito did, I would give them a solid 3.5 stars, but what pushes them into the four star range are the different sauces and flavors they cook into their meats.  I have fallen in love with their green chile pork.  Spicy and sweet and tender.  It mixes perfectly with warm pinto beans and just makes me happy.  I've also tried the coca-cola pork, which was crispy and interesting, but a little sweet for me.

Each time I go in now, I make sure to ask what meats they have in case they offer something new to wow me.  Whether they come up with new offerings or not, Henderson finally has a good taqueria.  And that's something to celebrate.  I have no doubt that the town council will host a parade in Super Burrito's honor right after they have their first taste.
