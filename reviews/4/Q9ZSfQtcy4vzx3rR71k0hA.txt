Been a fan for a long time.  It's inexpensive, quick, and delicious not a combo you always get.  

I particularly enjoy the Giant Caramba's Burro, granted we generally spit it between three of us, and I also love the Giant Stuffed Quesadilla, again usually shared.  Also they have great grilled fish tacos. 

A great family friendly laid back place to grab food and a margarita.
