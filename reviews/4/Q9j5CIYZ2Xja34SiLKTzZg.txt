If this is street food, then I have been visiting the wrong streets when I am in Mexico.  The ample portions of food here are fresh and tasty.  There is something on the menu to please all appetites.  Small appetites have as many options as large, and almost everything can be prepared as a vegetarian dish.  In addition, those who do not eat gluten can substitute Jicama for the tortillas.  Yes, that's fresh, sweet, crunchy Jicama.  

They serve salads, tortas, tacos, tostadas, and burros all day.  They have a breakfast menu of egg tortas and egg burritos too.  The front case is filled with pan dulce, churros, angel wings, crescent breads, galletas, pasteles and a version of an Italian cream filled horn.  The price on these little pastries can't be beat.  Most were 50¢ with the most expensive in the case at 99¢.  The fancier deserts were in a case next to the register.  They had tres leches cake, and 4 kinds of flan.  They also had large cups of fresh strawberries, and Mexican sodas.  Another case was filled with frozen fruit bars and mounds of ice cream.
