We live across the valley and decided to take a chance on Juana's. It was a good choice. The service was good, the food was tasty and the environment was bright and colorful. 

We had the combo to try our favorites. The enchiladas, tacos and flautas all passed muster. The chili relleno was good but it was just a poblano and cheese. Not as tasty as some we have had. 

The salsa and chips were nice and tasty. The salsa was pleasantly warm with spice. They have a second salsa-if you ask-that has a strong smokey flavor. They said it was very spicy, but we thought the table salsa was hotter. 

The margarita wasn't special. We wouldn't get it again unless it was happy hour.
