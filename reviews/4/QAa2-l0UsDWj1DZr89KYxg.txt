I tend to go to this particular place after work on Tuesdays as they have $1.50 fish taco deal. Their fish tacos are really good. Place is clean, curteous and efficient staff. Their salsas are the best among other fast food joints. Price-wise if you don't have any coupon or deals, Rubio's is a bit more expensive than fast food in general, but the quality and freshness make up for slight premium.
