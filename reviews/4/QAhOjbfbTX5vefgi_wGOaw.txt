Quality has improved from the last time I was here. This is my drive through place when I'm  tired, pressed for time, and want a good family dinner in a jiffy. The chicken is flavorful and juicy. Salsas are fresh. Meal comes with refreshing salad.  I just wish they have more choices for dessert. Overall, a great value for a good meal.
