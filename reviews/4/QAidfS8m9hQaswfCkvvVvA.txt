Hey, you can't go wrong with the brunch.  For around $12, you get a pretty tasty meal and a drink included.  It's a great deal compared to their regular-menu entrees, which were running around $16-$18, not including a drink.  I had the benedict that was on the brunch menu, and, in all honesty, the eggs were very overcooked (i.e. not runny at all, but a hard cooked yolk), but I still enjoyed the sauce and the potatoes that came with it.  And the margarita at 11:00 in the morning ain't half bad, either.
