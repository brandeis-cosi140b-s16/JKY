Sofia's is one of those things that you cant judge from the outside.  It looks ratty and run down on the outside, and on the inside, it looks quite the same.  However, the dissonance between how it looked and how the food was emerged as soon as the chips and salsa were brought out.  Good Mexican places almost always have good chips and salsa.  Sofias was no exception.  After the chips of which we had about eight bowls, we were given the tacos, burritos, enchiladas, and everything else good and tasty.  The food was well made and had great flavor, and the place is small enough that it is pretty quiet and the waitress didn't have to run around to ten different tables.  

This place is small, yet it makes up for its small stature in great service and delicious food.
