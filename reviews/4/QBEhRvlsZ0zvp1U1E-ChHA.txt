Went for the table side guacamole and the Margarita of the month (pomegranate).  Rather than my usual chicken fajitas I decided to try the veggie fajitas.  I saved some of table side guacamole with the bigger chunks and ordered a side of sour cream.  I liked about half of the veggies when they were nice and hot but left some of the bigger chunks of whatever the root vegetable was.  I still had to order some extra tortillas to finish the remainder.

Beats me why four little tortillas come with the meal and more are usually needed to avoid spilling veggies all over the plate and this time my jeans with the sour cream.  Oh well, no one saw that one coming so exited to the WC upon leaving.
