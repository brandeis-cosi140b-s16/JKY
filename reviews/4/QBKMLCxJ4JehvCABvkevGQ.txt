Umm... I swear I'm not ubering to a strip club. I'm only ubering to the Non-GMO & Organic Mexican restaurant inside it...

Everything at El Dorado was delicious and definitely order the $14 guacamole.

Maybe that sounds crazy and yes you can make it at home, but it's a live demonstration of fresh guac to your table. 

Best. guac. I've. ever. had.

I also had a shrimp bowl, which was healthy and flavorful. I had a bite of the carne asada burrito and didn't skimp out on the meat (use their habanero sauce, burns so good).

Free custardy flan with a check-in. Open 24 hours.
