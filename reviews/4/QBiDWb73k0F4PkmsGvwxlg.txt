Tacos! Tacos! They're not just for Tuesday!!!

I had been looking for a place like this for a very long time.  Growing up in Las Cruces, NM, we'd frequent El Taco Tote in El Paso whenever we had to go to the airport.  Now...there is one here in Phoenix!

Delicious carne asada tacos and the BEST baked potatoes EVERRR!!  Plentiful salsa bar with all the fixings: cilantro, pickled onions, jalape√±os, and all the salsa variety you could ask for.  

Make sure you stop by!
