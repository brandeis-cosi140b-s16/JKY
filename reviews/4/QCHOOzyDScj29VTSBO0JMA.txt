I've been here a few times over the years and its a great place for those on a budget. $2 tacos, $3 modelo drafts and $2 margaritas and tequila shots. The tacos are kinda small and nothing extraordinary but they do the job when you have the munches after a long night in Vegas...and they're only $2 each so definitely worth it. Try it out! You won't regret it!
