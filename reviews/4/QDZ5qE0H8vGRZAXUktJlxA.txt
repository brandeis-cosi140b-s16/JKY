I visited Scottsdale in August, for the first time. I was with my mom who lives in Boise. We ate at Pink Taco, mostly because of the hype. I had heard about it before we even planned on going. My mom cracked the hell up when she figured out what the name meant. Oh, mortifying. 

Overall, we had a good experience there. The servers were very pretty and very very friendly. My mom loves to talk to people, and our waitress was extremely nice and took the time to chat with her. 

The food was good. I think it's a tad bit too pricey for what it is, but nothing worth complaining over. I'm sure there's better, more-authentic mexican around every corner, but it was a fun experience. I'll definitely visit the one in LA when it opens this year.
