Man I wish margaritas weren't so delicious and refreshing. 

When you walk into a place and the barkeep tells you they are the inventors of the "Original Margarita", well you might as well stick a fork in me, 'cause I ain't going nowhere anytime soon.

In case you're wondering, the "Original Margarita" is a damn fine margarita.

My barkeep was House, and he was just about as brilliant as his more famous medical namesake.

I started with the Mexican corn. Mexican corn is a truly odd experience for a Midwestern kid who was raised on corn-on-the-cob. Back home, the only way people cooked corn-on-the-cob was in a pot of boiling water, a method which all but removes every bit of flavor from the corn (it's a wonder I wasn't culinarily scarred for life). 

Forgive the tangent here, but if I could travel back in time, I would go back to my grade school self and introduce myself to Mexican Corn (and then we would explode into non-existence when we make contact in the congratulatory high five).

Needless to say, there is a reason the Mexican Corn is pretty much the only picture on the menu. No matter what else you try, you need to try the Mexican Corn.

House picked two tacos for me and kept the margaritas flowing. I will honestly admit I cannot remember which tacos I got, but that may be due to House's master mixology skills. I can say, without a doubt, that they were two of the best I have ever had.

The prices here are quite high, which is the sole reason for the missing star. I'm not completely saying the price point doesn't match the food and service quality, but the prices need to come down a little bit to be a 5 star joint, especially on the "Original Margarita", which hits you at a whopping $10 a piece. 

But the good news, happy hour has the "Original Margarita" at half price. Guess where you'll be finding me from now on?
