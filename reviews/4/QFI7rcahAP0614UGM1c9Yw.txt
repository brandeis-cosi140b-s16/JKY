I've eaten here a few times and, like the four star rating says, I'm a fan.  Great interior decorating and a comfortable atmosphere.  Very cozy.  I also enjoyed eating in the outside patio area.

Although I've never been there when it's been going on, it seems like they have a small stage area for live music.  That would be nice to catch but I wouldn't plan my evening around it.

My favorite is the Mexican sandwich.  Actually it's the only sandwich they have and I'm not sure they should add any others as this is the only sandwich I would order.  Comes with sweet potato fries that are phenomenal.  I LOOOOOOOVE the sweet potato fries =)

Overall, great place to eat for Mexican food but not the "best" Mexican food around.  They're pricey too but since they do have some unique dishes, a great location, and a nice atmosphere in general, I wouldn't pass this place up.
