I have to reduce the rating cause lately they haven't been a great as in the past.  I usually order the need super nachos, which are usually loaded with a bunch of huge chunks of meat and lots of guac, cheese, sour cream, etc.  The last time I ordered them they were quick at making them, like ridiculously fast, I placed the order, paid, turned around went to the condiments counter, and less than 30 sec my order was done.  I thought awesome, special treatment for the Duke at the time. I asked and they confirmed it was my order, so cool.  Went back to work, opened it up, and noticed that they it wasn't my order.  It had all these extra ingredients that it usually didn't come with it, it was very soggy, cold, and had very little meat. I only ate what I could manage to eat and tossed the rest. Yeah it sounds like they gave me an order of beef super nachos that no one else wanted and was sitting around before I came there.  Come on.

Other times I've seen their condiments area not filled and their limes always seem old.  Another time their tacos were burned and meat was completed dry.  But their California burrito was good, only place I've good for California burritos.

They still make pretty good Mexican food for cheap and I always still go here so I'm still a fan but service and quality has just got a little down lately.
