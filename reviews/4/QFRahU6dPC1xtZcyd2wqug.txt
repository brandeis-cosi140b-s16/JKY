I am not a fan of driving to Surprise because of the traffic but this is the only Macayos open for breakfast on the weekend and of course we got there to late for breakfast so I will have to try again.  This location is really nice in a pretty cool area close to the 303.  Service as great as usually and the atmosphere is like all the others...very casual and comfortable.  I love the Macayos chips and salsa, there is lots of garlic in their salsa and it taste fantastic!  I ordered the beef baja chimi and it was so great I ate the whole thing (even after I promised myself I would only eat half), so much for the diet.  Anyway we loved it and will be back again soon, there just isn't enough Mexican food places that serve brunch any more and it is always the best when they do.
