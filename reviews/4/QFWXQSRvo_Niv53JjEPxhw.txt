If La Fonda Del Sol existed in New York City, there would be a line around the block waiting to get seats. The irony, of course, is that Arizonans consider this to be perfectly passable Mexican food, but a far cry from palate-pleasing perfection. I suppose I find myself bitter knowing that such deliciousness could be viewed with such a blas√© indifference by Phoenix's elite critics; in New York, we still seek out the one true answer to the Mexican food problem, yet in Phoenix, the answer is so abundant it produces disenchantment.

Well, friends, we'd gladly take your La Fonda Del Sol. You get to keep the rest of those Mexican restaurants you love, so it's only a minor loss. In exchange, you may have a Rosa Mexicana and a Dos Caminos. Nay, don't thank me.

So, La Fonda.... Truly spicy, homemade salsa; perfectly crisp chile rellenos bathed in cheese, crusty chimichangas battered in love and ambrosia, husk-wrapped tamales that taste homemade; huge portions, incredibly low prices. This is what it's all about.

Yeah, the tacky pastel Mexican decorations are unnerving and the service is slow and often panicked, but these are minor gripes.

When it's all said and done, these idiots forklift themselves into the waiting lines of NYPD Pizza (HA! HAHAHA!) and Oregano's (BAHH! HAHA!) while overlooking the real gem that sits in between them. Well, if you're a New Yorker like me, you're not gonna try either of those wrecks anyhow; go get some Mexican.
