I had the chicken enchilada with their home-made green sauce.  I loved the slices of fresh avocados on top.  Everything was very tasty and fresh.  I would also go with a 5 star food and 4 star ambiance and service.  The menu was less than informative. 
It is located towards the back of a mini-mall located perpendicular to Odana road. So, not really easy to find.  As you walk through the Mexican grocery story, you browse the beverages of your choice and take them to the table with you. I do plan on returning soon.
