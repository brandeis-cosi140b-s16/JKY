After walking through Bally's, Paris, & Bellagio we discovered this was the only place that was open at 5am in the morning after me and my gals had danced the night away and worked up a hankering for late night munchies.

It may not be omigoodness amazing food (we shared chips and salsa, tortilla soup and fries - standard probably pre-frozen / pre-made fare) but it does it's job and for being so late/early the waitress was mighty attentive and bubbly.
