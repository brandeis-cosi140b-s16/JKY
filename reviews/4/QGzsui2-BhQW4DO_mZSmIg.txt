I love Rubio's. The fish tacos and burrito especial always hit the spot. I love their fresh salsa bar and their customer service. 

The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the water cups they give you are ridiculous. They're these tiny cups that hold about a cup of water and I have to refill it about 6 times. Come on Rubio's, don't be so cheap!  Every other place I eat at gives me a big cup for water.
