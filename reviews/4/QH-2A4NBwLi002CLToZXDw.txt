I went here for the first time last Friday and had a lot of fun. The bartender that helped me, though he was a Jets fan, was super friendly and remembered  my order everytime I went back to get more drinks. The drinks were pretty cheap. I also ordered some tacos that were really good. They have a ton of televisions and a small dance floor, as well as a couple pool tables, a beer pong table, and a cornhole set. It was busy but I was able to move around and enjoy myself. I'd definitely come back here to grab a drink and play some pool or hang out.
