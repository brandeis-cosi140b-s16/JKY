Thanks Yelp/Siri for helping me find this place. Being a California transplant in Hawaii, I get Mexican food withdraw. Rivas fit the bill. Affordable and freshly made mexican food...with drive thru!

Like others say, the place looks closed but its just uber tinted. The inside is very clean and they have two big screens with sports on. I was just stoked that I got 12 Rolled Tacos/Taquitos smothered with fresh guacamole and cheese for $7.15. WHAT??? Do ya'll know how much this would cost me in Hawaii and it wouldn't even be that good???? Sigh...

Again, just happy to have found my easy-breezy, Mexican food option when I visit my in-laws in surprise. Until next year Rivas...I hope you don't close down.
