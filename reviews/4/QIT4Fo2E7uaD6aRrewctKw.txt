didn't go to this location, but went to the one on craig road and the one on sunset, ordered the same thing at both locations: carne asada fries, and 5 rolled beef tacos, xtra large horchata.  When I first moved to Vegas, I would look foward to going back to California for Adalbertos or Baldos for the same exact thing, but this is my home away from home...both open 24 hours and both can give you a heart attack...but soo worth it.  This is one of those places where you can only order the carne asada fries maybe twice a month because it's so bad for you... but ohh so good!
