well, we went there at 10pm on a friday and the place was starkly empty.

some burley men were creating a dance floor by clearing the place of its furniture. so we expected a party of reveling dancers to come in (there were like 2 latino men at the bar, so we thought it was like an underground durangeno dance hall on friday nights. incorrect.)

anyway, 1.5 hours later, no one had come in and the burley men replaced all the furniture. no dance party at all! sad news!

anyway, we just drank a lot at the empty bar at the side of the restaurant. who can really complain.

as usual, it was nearly free to drink alcohol. i had two literal tankers of red bull and vodka for like 3 dollars each.

it seemed like the bartenders didnt want us to be there and kind of ignored us but i guess that made it harder to black out, which is a good thing for everyone.
