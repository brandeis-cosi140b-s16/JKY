Addictive bean dip and irresistible salsa--and that's just the free appetizer as you explore the menu. The special quesadilla with chicken is a decent portion with marinated chicken, Mexican seasoning, and sides of guac and sour cream. I also recommend the hard shell tacos and oh-so-honey-sweet fried iced cream. Great value (can easily keep it under $15, even $10 per person), consistent quality and authentic goodness.
