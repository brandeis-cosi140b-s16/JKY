The roomie and I had a late night taco craving,.and finally found this place in a gas station..of all places. Lol. They give great portion sizes.I got the adobada n the carnitas taco. I wanted lengua but they ran out :( bummers next time I guess. Anyways the guys were really nice. The food was great n our cravings were satisfied.  Plus u can get gas at the same time!!! Bonus!!!
