Just when I thought I couldn't find a salvadorean restaurant I found one not far from downtown Las Vegas !! This place is big and comfortable . Only thing was I was on a tight time schedule and the food took twice as long as they had told me when I walked in but regardless it was good and will come back soon ! Oh the pupusas are 1.50 each butnif you buy 12 they are 12$ good price :)
