Food was excellent!! Had Mini Bandeja Paisa which I haven't seen one of these since I left NYC. Also empanadas are fresh & very good. Overall food was great waiter was very nice & even the owner came to our table to greet us & make sure everything was ok. I would've give 5 stars, but food took a little longer than usual. We are definitely coming back again.
