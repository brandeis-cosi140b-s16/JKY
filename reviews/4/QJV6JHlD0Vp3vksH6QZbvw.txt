I like this place...A LOT.
If the beans taste like they were made with lard, I like it. ha. 
Came here for lunch on a Saturday. Place was hoppin. 
Ordered a taco, tostada and some rice. Pretty damn amazing. 
Service was fast. Only downfall, the person in front of me ordered 50 some tacos and that made my wait for food a little long. 
Order to go so you can get the hot sauce packets!
I will be back....with others......
