We just went to the new El Burro. The carnitas and shredded chicken burritos were tasty. But, I don't want to pay $9 for a burrito and not have a place to sit. They will have 8 stools soon. Then we can relax and enjoy. Remember the old Toula's...or trying to forget? Thank you developer Bill Baron and CNNC development cmt. A step in the right direction.
