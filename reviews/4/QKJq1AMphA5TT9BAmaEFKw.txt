New Restaurant.com merchant so we figured we'd try it and very happy we did. Seems to be family run, good service, very friendly.

What I liked about the food was the dishes we ordered were not drenched in sauce. The style is different than other Mexican restaurants we've eaten at and I really like the style they cook in. Everything seemed to be fresh and home made.

Chips are different, I think they are their homemade tortillas sliced and fired, I liked them my 13 yo son did not.

We had two bowls of menudo
Cheese enchiladas
Garlic shrimp

All were excellent. We'll be back even without the restaurant.com, although I'm glad they had one otherwise we would have never known about this great hole in the wall.

UPDATE: Shortly after our visit this place stopped taking restaurant.com.
