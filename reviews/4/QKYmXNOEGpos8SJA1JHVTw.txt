There are soft tacos, hard shell tacos, burritos, torta's, burgers, quesadillias, as well as a lot of other stuff.  It's open 24hours and there are several locations.  I come here fro the soft taco's.

You choose your meat, today its carne asada, then there are onions, cilantro and choice of hot sauce.  I also tried the gorditias, a fried corn tortillia pocket with again your choice of meat, I got the carne asada, onions, and cilantro.

I enjoyed the soft taco's, but the gorditias were over fried, they were very hard and difficult to eat.  

For a quick snack or meal, this place rocks!
