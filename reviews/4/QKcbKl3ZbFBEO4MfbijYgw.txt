We used to go Frank & Fina's when they had a location on Charleston. My wife loved their flan and was having a flan craving the other days, so we decided to venture out to this location.

I had the shrimp fina which was quite delicious. My wife ordered the sweet potato enchiladas. That was also pretty good. I was afraid I wouldn't like it 'cause I don't like sweets. However, it was just a very muted sweet.

To cap off our dinner we shared the coconut flan. It was quite good, and my wife continues to contend that Frank & Fina's Cocina has the best flan out there.
