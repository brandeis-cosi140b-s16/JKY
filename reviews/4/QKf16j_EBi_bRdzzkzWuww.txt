I have been to this location 100 times. All i can say is that  this place is somewhat inconsistent.  Tonight the bar area was a 5 for sure.  6 months ago it was a 2. So tonight for happy hour all bottled beer 2.5 and well drinks 3 bucks. Half off appetizers and an awesome bartender. Ordered the cheese crisp with machaca beef and a sampler.  All was hot to the table and super tasty.  Give this place a go if you're in the area!
