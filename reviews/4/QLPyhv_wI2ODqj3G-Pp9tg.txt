The previous reviewers reviewed brunch and lunch- so I'll review dinner!

Cinco de Mayo brings craziness to Old Town Scottsdale and we popped in here to escape it.  (I think I was lured by the classic rock they were pumping out of the speakers...)  As soon as we walked in the bartender greeted us and we were seated with menus.  The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is great- beautiful glass and iron chandeliers and bright colors.  They have an amazing tequila list- no Cuervo here!- which my husband appreciated very much. 

We had three tapas plates for dinner, which in some places wouldn't be enough to fill you up, but here it worked.  All three were fantastic, especially the Churassco. We also got the Shrimp Barbados and the Double Dip.  The crab fondue with the Double Dip was delicious, especially when eaten with the cucumbers.  The hummus as a little bit of a punch to it so be careful!  The prices were very reasonable for tapas and you can't beat $5 margaritas. 

I very much enjoyed Carumba Cafe and I definitely plan on returning.  I think the next trip may be for brunch....
