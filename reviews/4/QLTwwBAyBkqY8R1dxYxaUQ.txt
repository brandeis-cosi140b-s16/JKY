My wife and I had a groupon for lunch here and it was fantastic. They had great music playing and the food was great. If you are expecting authentic Mexican food here you are an idiot. It is a tex-mex place and their fajitas are great. My only complaint was our waiter brought our food and bill, that is all. He didn't come by at all besides that.
