Our third visit to this location and I'm shocked by the  negative reviews not that they're wrong just not our experience. I told the new manager today that we think it's the best run one we've visited. Service, food and cleanliness at a high place today for sure. He said he's recently taken over management here from CA and plans on even more improvement coming. So, maybe give them a try if they fell short your last visit. Or try them if you haven't because they're really good.
