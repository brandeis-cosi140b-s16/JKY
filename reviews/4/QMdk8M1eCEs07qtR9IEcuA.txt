Great addition to the southside. The tamales are authentic, the tacos (chorizo) are unexpectedly memorable, and both the green and mole enchiladas are flavorful (and I appreciated them not being drenched in cheese- they didn't need it!). Service is friendly if slow.  Among the best Mexican in the city!
