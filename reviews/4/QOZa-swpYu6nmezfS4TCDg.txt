Random Mexican food place that's pretty decent.  My Australian friend and I were in Phoenix for a night during our 2 week road trip.  This place got recommended to us by the hotel guy based on pure proximity, but also for being pretty good.  Despite some semi-shady characters chillin' out front, the place was neat and clean.  The staff was friendly.  The food was also fairly decent.  We tried the shredded beef that this region is famous for, and felt sort of so-so on it.  You can probably find better shredded beef tacos around the Phoenix/Tucson area, but these were not bad by any stretch of the imagination.  We also got some al pastor tacos, which were pretty solid.  All in all, a good experience, and while I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this place, I definitely wouldn't avoid it either.  If I ever find myself there again, I'll grab a taco or 2...
