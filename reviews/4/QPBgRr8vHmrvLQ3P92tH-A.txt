Open late, full bar. Really good food. Everything I had was good, even the flan. Huge menu, great prices. My friend had the Guatemalan plate which was like $20 but it looked great( sausage, red beans and rice, chicken, shrimp, steak, plantains and a salad). I thought it was an awesome price. Some of the servers don't speak English. My first one didn't understand me but She had another server that could speak English wait on us. She could've been a little better about Checking on us more frequently, but I personally enjoy long dinners
