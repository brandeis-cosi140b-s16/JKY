I use to be a Los Betos girl, but I have converted over to Super Burrito lol. I still like them, but I find that Super Burrito has more choices and they have things available 24/7. Los Betos no longer has some of their breakfast items available past a certain time as they once did. And they don't let one do some changes to some of their orders the way they do at Super Burrito. And their churros are yummy along with their tongue tacos. I really dig their Arizona quesadilla. For some reason, I find it better as a quesadilla than as a burrito. It's a good place when it's late and you're fiending for some food.
