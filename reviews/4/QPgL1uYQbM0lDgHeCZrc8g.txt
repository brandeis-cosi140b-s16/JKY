First, the stuff that cost them a star: 
(1) I don't like the high tables. The chairs are so tall my feet dangle and I feel like Lily Tomlin. They were too busy to allow us to sit at a regular table. 
(2) They won't do separate checks. (3) The chips came with only two "wagon wheel" chips. The second basket had none, so only half our group got to try them. The basket at the next table had a bunch of them.

Now, the good stuff. The food was very good. I ordered the green corn tamales. They were almost as good as the ones I used to get in Tucson. The others in my party also enjoyed their food. We ordered the guac and it was good, but the presentation piled it high in a mocohete that made it hard to get some on a chip without pushing the rest of the mountain over onto the table or floor. The two in our group that had margaritas said they were delicious, but friends who went the night before said their margaritas were ordinary. Portions were generous. I'm glad I ordered from the left side of the menu or I would have had to be rolled out the door.
