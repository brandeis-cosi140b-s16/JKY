We Yelped Mexican near our downtown Mesa hotel and the list was as long as my arm, but Rosa's specifically said they had sopapillas and I wanted some sugary fried dough, so I was sold :) 

The spot is in an older shopping plaza.  Once inside you are greeted with cute brick walls and an old school Mexican casita look and feel.  

We had a really attentive server who was on top of drinks, food and generally checking on us that we were happy.  

I started with a few margs on the rocks - they rocked and the chips and salsas.  I personally preferred the red salsa over the sweet green, but the latter grew on me.  For an entree I selected the chicken mole enchiladas.  The enchiladas were rich and delicious. Everything was just a little different than usual and the was a welcome surprise!  And of course, I got my sopapillas for dessert and they were yummy fried goodness (they had flan and fried ice cream too if that floats your boat).  

I am surprised we never went back during our stay, but were so on the go we just didn't make it in again, but I would go back if in Mesa in a second!
