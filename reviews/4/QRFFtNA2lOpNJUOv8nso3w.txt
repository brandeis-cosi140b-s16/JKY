Went to lunch at Los Dos Molinos today and was impressed once again. I always like to ask the server what their favorite thing on the menu is and hate it when I get the most expensive response, today I didn't! I was recommended to the Chicken Enchilada plate. I am normally not an enchilada type of guy, not enough substance for me and usually too much tortilla. However these proved me wrong.

The enchiladas were piled high with moist shredded chicken and covered in Green Chile(not for the faint if heart). Then it was all brought together by melted cheese which was crisped to perfection. Another great experience at Los Dos however if this is your first time there is a reason why each table gets its own pitcher of water!
