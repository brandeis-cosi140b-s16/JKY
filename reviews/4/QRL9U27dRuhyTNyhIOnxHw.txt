This place is seafood heaven! 
They start you off with some of the best chips and salsa I have ever had! The salsa is obviously homemade and the chips were still warm. We ordered some drinks and a half dozen raw oysters to start. The oysters were OK, not the best I have ever had but by far not the worst. 
I ordered the Shrimp & Octopus in Garlic Sauce. It was to die for. The seafood was perfectly cooked. The beans and rice were some of the best I have ever had. I can't get over the beans! 
My dining companion ordered the Crab Stuffed Green Chilies. They were bursting with real crab, but she did hit a few pieces of shell. 
I am in love with this place. I will be back on a regular basis for sure!
