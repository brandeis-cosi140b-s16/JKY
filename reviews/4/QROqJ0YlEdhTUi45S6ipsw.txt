If you're looking for good quality food good drinks and mexican food  this is a good restaurant. Honestly it's not 100% authentic mexican food but still tasty. Kinda of a loud environment especially in the bar area  which is good by the way unless you're looking for a candle light dinner I'll recommend this spot
