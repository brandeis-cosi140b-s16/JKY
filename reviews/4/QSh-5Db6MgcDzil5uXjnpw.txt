Super yummy.  I've moved to  Phoenix from the south east and thus I'm trying out Taquerias every chance I get. When I stopped in to Aztecas all the beer delivery guys were having lunch... you know if 6 or 7 local delivery guys are meeting there... it must be good. The machaca and potatoes breakfast plate was yummy and the tortilla it came with... although there was only one it was a foot and a half across. Good!!!! And inexpensive.
