Local vegan mexican food that's gluten free...what more could a girl ask for?! ...With only a few vegan restaurants around, going out is limited, which is okay, but sometimes its nice to go out...I'm stoked I finally got to try the food here, well worth the wait. I think Tedibertos has the ability to succeed, especially since the location is great. I also completely understand and empathize with the opening of a new restaurant...of course there are going to be some bumps in the road. Nothing is ever perfect, have some compassion and patience people.  We ordered the tacos, quesadilla and nachos, which I personally think kicked some major ass.  We really need to help this place stay open, so definitely stop by when you can! My only recommendations would be try to find more lighting during dinner and start making your own organic wine!!! Good luck to ya'll and ill be back for sure!
