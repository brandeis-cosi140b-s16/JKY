We had just moved into our new place and wanted to grab a bite. Saw it had great reviews and was literally minutes away. 

As soon as you come in you see a menu board on the wall. You can choose between a burrito/bowl, quesadilla, rice, salad, torta, or nachos. Then you pick your choice of meat: steak beef, shredded beef, spicy pork, pulled pork, or chicken. 

They have a lot of toppings for anything you choose to go with...I ended up getting a bowl with steak beef. The guac was great. I had enough for leftovers for dinner later. 

They have jarritos!!! Also they have margaritas for $2 and beer! Lots of drink choices in general. I just went for a fountain drink. This place smells soooo good when you walk in. 

It was hot today and didn't seem like the AC was on but then again, it might have been the heat from the grill and the fact that we just moved a whole bunch of stuff. 

I'm definitely going to be a regular because it was worth it. I wish I could've tried their chips with the guac or salsa. :)
