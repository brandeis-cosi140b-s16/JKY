It is really cool that we now have this famous Tucson restaurant in the Phoenix valley. Hot Dogs are one of my favorite past times and I deciced to go and check them out sooner than later.

This is an old Discount tire store where they remodeled the garage section into a seating area and turned the waiting room into their bakery. The acoustics are rather noisy and they are continuously calling out order numbers over the ear numbing speaker system. 

Ordered two of the Sonoran Dogs with everything on them and a large Carmelo which comes with Beef, Beans and melted Cheese. They also have a really nice salsa bar with plenty of items to enhance the flavors of your meal.

The Hot Dogs were pretty good but not the best in town. The buns are not as sweet as they usually are at other places and a little more on the chewy side. It was difficult to taste the bacon and the flavors were a bit bland. The Caramelo was interestingly good and was even better with tons of added goodies from the salsa bar.

This place gets really busy and they do a pretty good job of getting the food out quickly. It was fun watching the excitement in all the happy customers as they sat down and ate with their extended families.

I'm going to round up on this particular restaurant and figure that they are still ironing out some the typical problems with opening any new location. Come on over and give them a shout out. You will find the experience to be fun and exciting. HOT DOG!
