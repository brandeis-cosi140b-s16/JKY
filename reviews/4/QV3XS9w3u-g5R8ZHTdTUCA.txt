Discovered this a year ago when I did a independent Film called the Governor ( http://www.thegovernormovie.com/ ) here...but I didn't come back till the other night...



10/7/07 ish

Only had drinks no food..

Decor! really like the 50's/new school style...THe added History is a cool bonus...Great lighting Techniques: the little flickering Cool Fake candles to the recessed Florescent 

Drinks: I had a great Bartender...knowledgeable and friendly...why all the Bartender hate? Drinks where like $8 for a Cosmo,  also had Grand menea on the rocks drinks where good sized...

People: I do have to give this a Negative even on Saturday night it was dead! quite enough to talk to strangers but...no strangers to talk to...(-1 star)...although the roof top is a nice romantic ...

(note by November they should have there Liquor license so you should have drinks though out the hotel and will have Drinks on the roof top.

I think when its done there will be true potential of a great place.
