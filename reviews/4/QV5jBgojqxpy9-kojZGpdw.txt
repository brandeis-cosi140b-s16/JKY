4 stars because even though I don't like seafood, the non seafood items I had here were delicious! I got the enchiladas, one of them with green sauce. The enchiladas were excellent, the salsa was great, and the server was friendly. I didn't like the ceviche tostada but that's my own issue--the person I was eating with loved it. If I liked seafood, I would eat here often.
