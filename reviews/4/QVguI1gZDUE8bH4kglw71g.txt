Let me get right to it: we started with the papas rellenas, which weren't all that special, but definitely edible. I had the ropa vieja de pollo which was excellent! I ordered it with moros and an extra side of maduros. The moros - I've definitely had better, next time I would just order rice and beans separately - this made me sad, because moros are delicious if done correctly. The maduros were cooked well! We also had the pan con bistec which was flavorful, but the bread to steak and stuffing ratio was a bit off - too much bread, not enough stuffing. I would come back to try more - especially their happy hour which looks fantastic. I would give this place 3.5 stars, but yelp doesn't allow for that, so I boosted them up a half star because their service was on par ;)
