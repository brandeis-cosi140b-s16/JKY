i really love this restaurant. We just discovered it about a month ago and have already been three times...and we are planning to go again this weekend. The ambiance of the restaurant is perfect. Especially in the winter with the crackling fireplace. Everything we ordered was perfectly cooked and really tasty. The service is also very friendly. Be sure to try the chile potato and a margarita.

The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because of it's lack of vegetarian entree's. However, the veggie food they do have is excellent.
