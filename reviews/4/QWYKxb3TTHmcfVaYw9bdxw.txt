Frank and Lupes is one of my favorite places to grab up some good mexican food. Mind you, it is NEW MEXICAN not Sonoran. Anyway, they have a good happy hour (only available on the patio, which is lovely) and everything I have tried on the menu is great. I would recommend anything with their shredded beef...i just drooled on my keyboard. Eew. Also, some of my favoite salsa.
