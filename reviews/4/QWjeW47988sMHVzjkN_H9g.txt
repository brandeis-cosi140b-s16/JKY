Pretty good airport food when you've got about an hour to spare in Charlotte. Like all the other locales nearby, it's very expensive for what you get. But it's a nice alternative to Burger King. They have express versions of what they sell in the sit down restaurant next door. And they have a bunch of grab and go items like salads, sandwiches, fruit bowls, etc. 

Several choices of meat for your tacos or salad, and the softest flour tortillas I've had in ages. Not spicy but plenty of flavor in the beef. The service was again pretty typical of airport dining, but the turnaround was fairly quick...and in an airport that's priceless. 

Overall a good solid choice for a quick meal during your layover.
