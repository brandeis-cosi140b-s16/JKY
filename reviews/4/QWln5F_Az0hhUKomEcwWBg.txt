Not sure if the heat we were feeling at breakfast was due to the near 100 degree weather at 9am or the spicy Huevos Rancheros from very unique El Encanto Mexican restaurant.

Yes its hot out but that shouldn't stop you from heading up to Cave Creek and giving this restaurant a try. For those not brave enough (or smarter than I am) to handle the AZ heat (especially during the summer months) you can sit inside. If you do dine inside, make sure, especially if you have kids, to get a window seat by the pond to see the ducks, turtles, occasional fish and on our last visit an owl.

We decided to sit outside as we got there early enough before it starting getting too hot outside (misters were on so that made it very comfortable) and enjoyed the live music on the patio. The rustic Mexican furniture fits the theme perfectly with Mexican blankets as seat cushions. The guitar player was really good and my 2 daughters definitely enjoyed the entertainment.

Until 11am on Sundays (not sure if this is always the case so make sure you give them a call before you head in) they have a great brunch to try out some of their menu items. I don't believe you can order off the normal menu during brunch but many of their top items are available during brunch so you should be happy either way. The Pollo Fundido is awesome as well as the Huevos Rancheros.  Everything we have tried so far has been delicious.  Can you tell I am a fan?  

As my 5 year old daughter who is a big fan of Mexican food likes to say after she finishes up her breakfast and gets to feed the ducks, "this is the best place eveeeeer!"  If you are up for a fun experience and great Mexican food give El Encanto a try. You won't be disappointed.
