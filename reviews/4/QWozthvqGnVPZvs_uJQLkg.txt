Brief checkin... (a/k/a more once I've sat down to a meal)...

I've been to the new DTF (ha!) location twice now. Stellar service from fab staff, great drinks, and - just being honest as I've not eaten much here yet - my friends find it to be tasty food. The menu is abbreviated from the Henderson location, but the offerings are still classic Nacho Daddy with, I think, some new surprises? 

I dare say I prefer this location; the layout is cozy and more conducive to socializing,  it's warmer and more welcoming, and, hey, you're downtown! Aaaand, the open garage-style windows = a form of my beloved al fresco #patiolife! 70* on a January day? Perfect!

Looking forward to checking it out more often!

PS, the music is nicely mixed and I've yet to hear (a) the same palsy on repeat, or (b) a bad song.  Poppy, alt rock, Top 100, and others mixed in. A bit of stuff for all.
