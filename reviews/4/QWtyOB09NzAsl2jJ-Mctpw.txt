Went to Bonito's today for lunch and I'm sure I'll be back!

Great fish tacos!!  The "special sauce" that goes on top was all that, it was delicious.  Chips and salsa were awesome, but the beans weren't right.  I'm not sure what it was about them, but they weren't as good as at other places.  Others in my party had the chicken burrito and the chicken sopas -- both of which were reportedly great! 

Service is super speedy -- they are quick and that includes taking your plate as you shove the last bite in your mouth and bringing you the check while people in your party are still finishing up too!  That's better than waiting for the check in my opinion though!
