I know this spot is cursed, due to many restaurants closing at this spot. However, this place seems like the new touch of tuscon desert needs and fills a valid role in Chandler fashion square. To be honest I was not willing to go at first and got dragged here by my significant other. To explain the service I doubt I could do it justice. They were willing to let us sample all their flavors from cheese to several of the beers before deciding. They were very attentive and caring for a chain restaurant. I understand this is the fifth in the chain. The food was great. Actually the portions were larger than expected and the flavor was not skipped. I have tried at least three of the tacos. Not to mention diet friendly for my vegan and gluten free friends. Just wow. I don't normally dish out a four star rating a first time but this place really has it. Even the rice is good. Something most places overlook. It's blooming with cilantro and flavor.
