The prices are the only thing keeping this from being a 5.

Their service is scary fast and perfectly attentive.  This place is a favorite of everybody I work with.

I just had the fajitas this last time.  I don't know if I'll ever order anything else.  It was SO GOOD.  It could feed two people easily!  I might have ordered something made for two people.  I'm kinda embarrassed.  I didn't finish it though.  I couldn't.

I haven't found an issue with any of their food, and the cheap margaritas make a late lunch into a more enjoyable experience.
