Wow what a find! This palce rocks we spilt the fatijs and it waas really good. The kids ordered chese and bean burritos, which were good, and served on chilled plates. The wait staff was very friendly and the decor was cool. We had some coupons so the meal came out to like 35 bucks. I will return to this place when I return to Surprise.
