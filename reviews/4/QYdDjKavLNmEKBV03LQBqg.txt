This place is tucked away and not super accessible, but be ready for some super tasty Authentic Mexican Fare. The salsa is fresh and spicy , the chips thin and warm. Together they make a great snack. You will need it because the wonderful aroma of grilled steak and chicken fills the place and makes you hungrier!  
    I had the shrimp quesadilla and was pleasantly surprised at how full and flavorful it was. Loaded with fresh ingredients and it was on my table just minutes after we placed our order. We also had the queso dip (a must if you have kids) and it was the highlight of supper for my daughter!  They are very  fast for getting your order to you. 
     Don't call ahead an order, it literally is faster than fast food of you order to go when you get there. I have waited longer at Taco Bell every time than here!
