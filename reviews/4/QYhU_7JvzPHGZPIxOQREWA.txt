One drawback of being located in a bowling alley and being constrained to add bowling-alley food to your menu is that you're bound to have a customer that orders bowling-alley fare (which is never anything to rave about) and writes a review bashing the restaurant based on that - which is what one reviewer did. If you are going to try a Oaxacan restaurant, try the Oaxacan food, for cryin' out loud!

You won't go to this restaurant for ambiance, although it does have a charm of its own, in a kitschy sort of way. But the food - wow, this definitely ain't one of the 'berto restaurants that litter the Valley landscape! Come here for the amazing tlayuda with cecina and tasajo (beware - it's a big portion, you might have to share) or the savory chilaquiles or memelitas. Perhaps pumpkin-blossom empanadas or verdolagas (purselane greens cooked with pork)? Decisions, mouth-watering decisions. On a cold day, have a cup of piping-hot atole. Or if it's a cold beverage you want. try the chlacayota; it's a refreshing drink made from a sweetened infusion of the chilacayota squash. 

It's not fast food and you may have to wait a bit as they cook your order but it's definitely worth the wait. And it certainly doesn't hurt that the prices are friendly to those who are on a limited budget.
