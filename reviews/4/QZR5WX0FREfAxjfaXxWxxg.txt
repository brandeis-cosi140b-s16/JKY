Psst, hey Loco Patron, can you open a Loco by my house pleeeease. Like Queen Creek and Price. We'll be your first regulars!

My boyfriend and I go to K-Bella salon to get our hairs cut and while we wait for one another, we hang out at Loco which is in the same strip mall. The staff is really cool and they have great HH prices and pretty decent food. They also have lots of different tequilas to choose from.
