This is an older location and the area is not an economically prosperous part of town like say Scottsdale, but do not let this dictate where you can eat.  The family and I enjoyed a nice dinner here when heading to a nearby Skechers Outlet store and yes, we would dine here again.  The food was very very tasty and explains why we have heard so many good things about Macayo's over the years.

The service was friendly, helpful and genuine.

No complaints here - all reasonable prices, and solid food.
