I had a wonderful meal here on a Friday night. Not too busy and was seated in a quiet room in the back. I ordered the special "candy jalapeno margarita" to start. it was delicious and unique - it tasted like candy and then had a hint of spice as you swallowed. I ordered the combo #2, which was an enchilada, taco and rice and beans. The taco shell was warm, light and crisp....all fresh ingredients. My rice was perfectly cooked and the beans were authentic. Good service and good Mexican food.
