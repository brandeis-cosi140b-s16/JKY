I went here for lunch with my boyfriend over the weekend and was quite happy with the food. Both of us ordered the Joey Bag of Donuts with chicken each, and mind you, it's HUGE! Even heavier if you add cheese or sour cream or guac, but I didn't. They were out of mushrooms and for the peppers they only had green peppers (which is weird since we went on a Saturday afternoon), but I was quite content with it. I added the fresh jalapenos (should have gone with the pickled like my boyfriend) and hot sauce... which was a mistake. After 2 bites, I was picking out all the jalapenos and it was fine till I reached the end of my burrito. From then on, it set my mouth on fire and my stomach started to hurt. Then I figured out, I put my burrito upright and all the hot sauce probably trickled down to the bottom, thus making the end of my burrito super hot and fiery. I'm still thankful that I did get to enjoy the rest of my burrito and the sauce didn't ruin all of it. Also, the give you free chips with your order and their salsa bar has some very nice and flavorful salsas. I'll definitely go back and try to pick my ingredients wisely.
