We visited because of the DDD segment and the recommendation of our driver. It was definitely good and worth visiting, but I wouldn't quite give it a 100%. The original margarita was good but not great. The rice & beans lacked a distinctive flavor. Highlights: the service was very prompt and friendly, and the lemon shrimp taco and avocado pasta salad were exceptional. Well worth the visit.
