After all these years, Rosa's is still one of my favorite Mexican places in the Phoenix area. I've been going here for well over 10 years, and we still make occasional trips to old town Mesa for their signature meats.

Our favorites:
* Plato de carne: basically a huge fajita plate with better meat--you get your choice of meat with grilled veggies, beans & rice, and tortillas
* Chicken chimichanga: their chicken is marinated and always fabulous, and I'm a sucker for a good chimi
* Salmon tacos: big chunks of salmon, white cheddar, and homemade mango salsa--my wife's staple.

I give it 4 stars since those salmon tacos have lost some of their original luster. They used to bring tears to your eyes, but I think they're skimping on the salsa a bit nowadays.

Service is consistently good, as are the chips and salsa. The beans, as others have mentioned, are superb. You won't leave any on your plate.
