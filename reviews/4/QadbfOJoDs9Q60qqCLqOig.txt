Good mexican food.  Was talking with the bar tender cuz we had 4 and he suggested "A meal for Two #1 or #2.  We took that recommendation and order #1.  Really good meal and plenty for 4.  A large plate with a combination of shrimp, chicken and charbroiled steak with onions, tomatoes, red and green peppers, cilantro and more.  Served with rice and refried beans, guac, sals, tow small cheese quesadillas and four totillas.  Yum!  The food came out nice and hot, not to spicy but very flavorful, veggies were not overcooked (which seems to happen at many other restaurants), and the shrimp, chicken and steak were good. 

Nice meal and good recommendation!
