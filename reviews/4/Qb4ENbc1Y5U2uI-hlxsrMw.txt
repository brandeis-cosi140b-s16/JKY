Everything is relative, right? I don't want to give four-stars to a taco place, but as far as taco places go, this is one of the best in Phoenix. You need to know what to order though. Don't get the beef ribs, they are tough and chewy. Make sure you try the carne asada tacos, the cabeza tacos and a Mexican coke. You may also notice that the tortilla chips suck and come from CostCo. This is bad for tortilla chips, but good for the restaurant. They don't have a deep fryer, so they can't fry chips. But then again, they don't have a deep fryer! I bet there is no microwave in the kitchen either.
