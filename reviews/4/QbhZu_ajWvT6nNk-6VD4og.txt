I am so happy this place delivers! Their chips and salsa are delicious, my friend ordered the steak fajitas and I ordered the enchiladas. They were very generous with the amount of meat they give with the fajitas, for only $10 it was a very good deal and it was very tasty! My enchiladas were o.k. but I wasn't expecting them to be anything spectacular. A lot of Mexican restaurants here don't use real cheese and thats a big pet peeve of mine. They were like Dos Reales enchiladas. So now that the Dos Reales on University is closed (the new place is still good, but a little more expensive, and they charge you for extra tortillas, and they only give you two, wtf!!!!),
give Burrito King a try, they're good, cheap, close to campus and they deliver!
