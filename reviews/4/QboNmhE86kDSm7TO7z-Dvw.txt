Took my family to dinner last night and everything was very, very good. I had the Special Red White and Blue Margarita and it was great too. The Hatch Chilis are nice, the 2 kinds of chips are great and you can ask for the Spicy Salsa too! I used my new Free Shopping / Restaurant App called VEEBOW and got $5.00 Off!!  It's always busy here which says a lot!
