Ok. As much as I don't want to admit I have a favorite ANYTHING ending with B-E-R-T-O-S, this is it. I've eaten at this Filiberto's over the years more than any other location in the state. Pretty much because it's close to work and it's the place to go when I want to go to lunch by myself because I'm on a time crunch and brain meltdown and don't want to hear any work gossip or anyone's damn problems or anyone bitching about this, that and the other thing. Me, a carne asada burrito, an horchata and fornicate the rest of the planet - this is MY time. Cellphone off. World will have to wait. Sometimes I'll get the Carnitas plate. Quesadillas are pretty good too. That's about all I get here. Plenty of parking for this location - same mall as Fry's, Miele's, Pei Wei, Habit, Petco, Jamba Juice, and Starbucks among other things. I've been here at night but atmosphere is a little less inviting and a bit sketchier. I just get it to go! Better to come inside too. Freaking drive through line becomes long as hell at night. Cool thing here is the desserts. When they haven't run out of it, I get the flan. Not the best in the world but fork it, it's FLAN!!!! Sorta like what they say about sex - even when it's bad it's still good. I wouldn't really know - gotta get out of my mom's basement more often... Oh yeah. This place is cool during World Cup time because every freaking TV in the place is tuned to the game of the hour. And the place get's packed - people staying to see the end of the game long after they finished their lunch. LOL. Mexican place like this is more likely to have their TVs tuned to soccer than them gringo places - just sayin'.
