This is a fast food chain, so I'm not expecting a dining experience. In fact, when it comes to these types of restaurants, I'm really only rating the food and the price. The food here is great and you can't beat the price. Yes, it seems a bit dirty, and yes the customer service is a bit lax, but I was sort of expecting that.
