I just came to try this place for the first time. Got the chicken tacos and they are really good. The customer service was great, everyone was very friendly. And the place is very clean. 
So why 4 stars instead of 5?  Here's a tip for the manager/owner, don't argue with your employees in front of customers it's really unprofessional.
