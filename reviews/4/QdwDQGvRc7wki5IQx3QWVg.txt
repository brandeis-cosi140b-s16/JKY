I fly to to PHX for work (in the airport) regularly,  and for years have had the same options: Paradise Bakery (which is good but I try to limit bread intake) and a sub-par Mexican joint that seemed typical of airport fare. (and Burger King.)

I was pleasantly surprised today when I got to the food court for a quick, small lunch and found it 100% remodeled with what looks like decent food options from many new vendors. The employee at American Taco Shop informed me they were going for a more local feel with locally owned vendors mostly. 

I was happy to be able to order 2 a la carte tacos for under $6, where at other airports I've had to order a full meal plate which had far too much food and cost nearly $12. The staff was friendly and choices good,  and the food was also good.  

A new generation of airport eateries is taking over,  for which I'm very thankful. Thanks American Taco Shop for making my lunch hassle free and tasty.
