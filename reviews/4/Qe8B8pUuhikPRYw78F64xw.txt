Been here many, many times. I think i have ordered just about everything from their menu (haha) but my favorite has to be the steak burrito and the chicken bacon salad is coming close.
This place is clean, and the employees are nice and attentive. I've never had to take my food back because they messed up my order. I will continue coming here.
