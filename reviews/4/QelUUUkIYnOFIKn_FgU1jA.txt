Yar, Roberto's be a chain restaurant specializing in Mexican delicacies.  They usually look the part: bare walls and unimaginative fixtures.  They're strangely similar to prison chow halls.

This one seems to be upgraded for the area it's in.  Southwestern colors on the walls, tables and chairs that aren't bolted to each other, and an overall aura straight out of the Qdoba playbook.  Staff ability is limited in the English department, but they make a damn good carne asada burrito and rolled tacos topped with guac and cheese.

I want that in my mouth all the time.  Period.
