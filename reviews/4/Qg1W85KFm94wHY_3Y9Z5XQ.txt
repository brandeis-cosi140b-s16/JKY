I love this Chipotle location. They are right across the street from where I work so I like to walk over in cooler weather. It is crazy busy at lunch time. Everyone else that works in the area seems to like this place too... Not to mention all the people shopping at Scottsdale Quarter across the street. If you can get in the door about 11:30, you should get through the line fairly quickly, but things ramp up considerably between 11:45 and Noon. I have seen the line go out the door occasionally. The parking lot gets pretty crazy too, so keep your eyes peeled when you're walking/driving.

The food is consistently good. I have never had a bad burrito here. They slipped up once and threw a big glob of sour cream (which I didn't want) on my burrito, but kindly/rapidly made me a new one when I pointed out the error.

I plan to continue to come here regularly and recommend it to others.
