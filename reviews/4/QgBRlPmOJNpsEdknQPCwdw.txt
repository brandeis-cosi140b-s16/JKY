if you're in the mgm, need something quick and cheap, this is a totally solid stop.
i liked the chili beef and pulled chicken tacos and thought the breakfast taco was a great deal.  For $6 i had 1 sausage-egg-cheese taco and it was a great base to get my day drinking on! and it was tasty, most importantly.
for what it is (fast food in a food court) - it ain't bad!
