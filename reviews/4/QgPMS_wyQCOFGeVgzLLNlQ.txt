Cafe Rio is my new favorite place to eat....with a location close by work I probably stop in here at least once a week. Fresh made tortillas, corn/flour/wheat...yum! My absolute favorite are the chicken tacos on corn tortilla. They make everything right in front of you and you get to choose and pick what you want. Generally I just get it with cheese, pico and lettuce and a side of rice. The shredded chicken is sooooooo tasty and moist. Service is great, they have these lil chants if you are a first timer, if you want extra cheese, etc. Their frequent stamp card definitely motivates me to come back. and I will be back. YUM!
