So I used to come here back in the days of this place's previous incarnations - both Luna Pizza and Dos Amigos Fresh Mex Grill. Both of those places served alcohol. This place is a fast food chain so none of that here. Too bad. I've eaten here a couple of times and did take out a number of times. I've actually never seen this place crowded. Then again, I don't drop in at primetime. Hands down the best thing here IMHO is their Diablo Shrimp Burrito. They make it with their signature Diablo Sauce and that actually has some kick to it. Usually when some place claims a dish is "spicy" I take it with a grain of salt - or actually with a couple of spoonfuls of added hot sauce. The Diablo Shrimp burrito, however, actually IS spicy and not just "gringo spicy." So beware in case you're one of those people that thinks those spicy Taco Bell packets are actually spicy.
