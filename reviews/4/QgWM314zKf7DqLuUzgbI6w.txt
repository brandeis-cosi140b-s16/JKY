So normally I don't go for Filly-B's if I'm sober, but it looked so damn appealing on our way to Vegas last week. Compared to BK, McD's, and the Yum! Brand chains, Filiberto's was the lesser of those evils.

It was relatively clean, cheap as always, and pretty tasty for road food. We were going to eat at Taco Bell (best choice in Wickenburg for vegetarian), but I'm glad we crossed the parking lot to Filiberto's. I prefer real sour cream versus the stuff shot out from a gun. Pico de gallo! And the tortillas are so much better than those plasticky discs. Decent red and green salsa.

We'll stop here again on our next Vegas trip.
