I've been here 3 times now, and every time it's been great.  It is the closest I've come to finding the pseudo-Mexican that I've enjoyed in other cities.  The fried fish tacos were outstanding.  Amazing flavor and the ingredients all balanced each other out.  The waitstaff is really friendly and knowledgeable.  I think the restaurant inside is a little dark, a little loud, and poorly laid out.  All the tables in the front are all bar height, so if that's not your thing eat in the back or outside.  The special guacamole with mango and goat cheese was fair.  I'd stick to the regular.
