Clean and easy. 

Based on all the reviews it seems that this place is a mixed bag. I, for one, was pleasantly surprised. The eating area is clean with a nice layout. The service was quick and pleasant.  

I ordered a big burrito that featured a BBQ sauce. Can't remember the name, but it had a lot of flavor. The ingredients were very fresh and the tortilla was literally bursting at the seams with meat, rice, beans, veggies and sauce. 

I don't care about the Chipotle vs. The World debate. It is what it is. The quality of the food at Qdoba stands on its own and that's all that matters.

They really should have a salsa bar though.
