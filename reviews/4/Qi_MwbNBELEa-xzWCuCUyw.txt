Not sure why this place would need another review; but, just in case there is someone out there who doesn't believe the other 300+ reviews Gazooks is a great little place right Uptown for a quick lunch. And a good one. This was my first visit and we got there just as they opened at 11, so there was no line. By the time we had scarfed down our lunches, the line was out the door and the parking was practically non-existent. My recommendations, if you are thinking of trying Gadzooks for lunch, is to:

 * Come early or late - not during the lunch hour (they close at 8pm)
 * Walk from the office - parking is at a premium 
 * Get the enchilada with an egg on top
 * Try the Christmas Chile Sauces - not exactly New Mexican, but still good
 * The cookies are a good finish to your meal
