What a lovely surprise! I had the Carne Asada and my husband had a shrimp and chorizo burrito.  After our first visit we talked about their food for weeks, just couldn't get it out of our minds.  On our return visit I was worried that I might have built it up so much in my mind that the reality couldn't compare. Happily for me it did. It was even better than I remembered!
