I came here on a Friday night and it was popping but not busy. I was able to secure a table on the patio as soon as I walked up which was cool since it was a nice night out. Service was a little slow at first but they redeemed themselves after. Now I can see why people rave about the tacos. They were fricken bomb! I was expecting them to be as good as everyone said and  they were right. The margaritas were really good to and I'd love to go back and take advantage of the $5 dollar margaritas. Good job Imperial Tacos! Aplausos!
