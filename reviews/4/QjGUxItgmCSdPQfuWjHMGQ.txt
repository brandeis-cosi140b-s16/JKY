I've eaten at this small mexican diner a bunch and really like it- a litle inconsistent, but that goes with the territory.  My measure of a mex place is can they make a good Releno- and these guys get it done.  Have you ever noticed- everything is better sitting at the bar and conversing with the people cooking and waiting on you??  They tend to take better care with you.
