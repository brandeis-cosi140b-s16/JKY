One of my favorite places close to home. tortas (Mexican style sandwiches).  Love the tortas of turkey butt (colita de pavo) delicious with the fresh avacado.  Yum!  My mouth salivates just thinking about it. Love there salad at the restaurant, the take home... it seams, its not the same.  Love their daily soup with a side of their in house potato chips.  The potatoe chips taste like salt and vinegar. Delish!  The chile verde burrito has great flavor, while I'm not a big fan of their red.

The place is very casual.  You can also get some ice cream and fresh fruit drinks like melon, fruit punch, horchata, etc. Oh, there are great sweet treats!

You order, pay and sit.  They will call your number once it is ready.  One thing though... be ready to grab your drink, if fresh fruit drink, if you don't take it someone else will gladly take it for you. :-P
