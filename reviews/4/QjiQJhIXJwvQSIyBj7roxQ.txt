I worked in Chandler for a couple of years and never noticed this place, but came across it on yelp when I was staying out there one weekend.  Luckily I read ahead of time that they do not take cash.  That alone is the only reason to not give this place five stars.  In this day and age you can hook a device to your phone and process credit card payments, so not doing so is pretty unacceptable and unaccommodating.  Beyond that though I walked in and the lady behind the counter was extremely nice.  She took my order and gave me some chips and salsa while I waited for my to go order...nice touch!  The salsa was amazing as was the food.  Great place and I would stop more often, but I just don't carry cash like that.
