Like Roberto's, but better food!  Best chile relleno I've had since L.A. 20 years ago.  They get horchata right too:  Not too watery.  It might seem silly, but more than half the time I've been to Roberto's the horchata is too watered down.   Great hot sauces at the sauce and vegetable bar.  Beef burritos have lots of onions and green pepper --  I like them that way, but if you don't,  then you'll probably want them to hold the peppers and/or onions.  Counter s staff are always friendly and helpful, unlike Roberto's.  There's a reason every time I come in here there's always locals ordering.  They do a taco shop the way it ought to be done!
