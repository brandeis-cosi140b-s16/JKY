Ohh yea. Im a sucka for chip and salsas. Yummmm. I kept going back for more chips. Hehe :)  this place is just any other mexican restaurant. But if course I came during lunch time, not after the club after 3am for the munchies. Haha.
THE BEAN and RICE was so tasty.  Idk what and how they cook their rice, but it has some kind of sweet pure taste to it. I don't even care. I like it :))
