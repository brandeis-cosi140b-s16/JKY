Such a great meal! We bought a groupon and went on the same day. Being the foodies we are, we bought the Groupon for $50 worth of food and ordered up a ton of it. For apps, we had the guacamole and seafood cocktail (be warned, there was raw shrimp and scallops, mixed in with the cooked seafood) for $18.50. It had a lot of seafood: shrimp, scallops, and octopus. They did not skimp on the tableside  guacamole either. So good. 

For dinner, I had the bacon wrapped shrimp with rice and salad on the side. I didn't eat the salad, but the shrimp and rice were delicious. My husband got a mixed grill plate he thoroughly enjoyed. Total bill for two dinners, soda, and apps, was $55 and we had a substantial amount of leftovers. 

Service was attentive and friendly. I would definitely come back!
