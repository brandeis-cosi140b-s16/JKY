Good place to go for lunch. Interesting stuff on the walls, old guns, dollar bills and period memorabilia. It's a tourist area, I went in on weekday around 2 so it wasn't busy. Had fish tacos which were prepared well with crispy pieces of fish. Three tacos stuffed with cabbage fish and cilantro served with three lime slices and some hot sauce. Good lunch for around $11.
