Zabas. Zabas, Zabas. So far I am stuck with their bowls, burritos (shredded beef) and quesadillas, but I am anxiously awaiting their tacos and rolled tacos. Food is always well prepared and fresh, the staff is very friendly, and the store is always spotless ( That stainless steel Back of House is BEAUTIFUL) 

A word of caution: Red Sauce is reserved for satan himself, and while the green looks like a nice and comforting alternative, it will still make your ice water. 

O and the queso is to die for. ( Pretty sure there is cream cheese in it, how could it not be?)

Thanks Zabas!
