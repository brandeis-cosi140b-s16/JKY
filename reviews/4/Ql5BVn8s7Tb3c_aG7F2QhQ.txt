I have been to this place at least 50 times. While they are not my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte, (that would be Monterrey at Windsor Square), they are still good. Las Margaritas is only a few blocks from my work place, so it is one of my regular lunch places. The food is good and their prices are great. They have over 20 lunch items all around $6. They give you tons of food even at lunch. (Compared to Monterrey, who's lunch portion is about half the size of dinner.) The staff is always very friendly and service is good.

 A few issues I have are 1) sometimes their shredded chicken can be a little tough, I think sometimes they don't shred it enough. 2) The orange cheese (cheddar I guess) , though I have learned to live with it. 3) Salsa is so so but I do like their pico.

My favorite dishe is the Chilaquiles. It is tortilla chips cooked with some kind of sauce with shredded chicken and some sort of white cheese. Doesn't sound that good, but it is delicious. Love the vegetarian burrito, the enchiladas (ground beef), Pollo con arroz and Carnitas. Because I normally only eat lunch here, I can't really judge the more expensive entrees.

Overall, large portions of good food, for a reasonable price, served by friendly staff. A solid 4 stars in my book.
