It seems to me that Scottsdale is severely lacking in the Mexican food arena as far as good food at reasonable prices.  Screw this table-side guacamole for $12 business.  Make it in the kitchen.  Not to say I don't order said guacamole.  But let it go on record, I disagree with it.  And I welcomed the addition of Filiberto's on Indian Bend if that tells you anything.

But I was really pleasantly surprised when I finally made it to Caldero.  They have some specialty dishes on the dinner menu that look quite good, but we were there for lunch, so I ordered from the "classics" menu.  And truthfully, if you can't make a taco, I'm not interested in moving forward in this relationship.

Chips and salsa are still free!  That's no longer a given sadly.  The red salsa was good with plenty of oregano and just the right kick for me.  The green was a queso dip, and would make a lovely beverage as far as I'm concerned.  For lunch, I had the chile rojo burro served enchilada style with rice and beans for $8!  Did I mention this is in Scottsdale?  Hopefully they don't talk to the table-side guac folks.  The burro was so stuffed with pork, I almost wished it had a little more sauce though.  I loved the enchilada sauce, too.  I went with charro beans...again delicious...over black or refried.  They also offer lemon cilantro rice in addition to the standard Spanish rice.  I had Spanish, and it was just fine...except for the obligatory peas everyone tosses in there.

Our server was excellent and very friendly, too!  I'm a little worried it was relatively empty on a Saturday afternoon.  But I'll be back and do my part in ensuring it stays open.
