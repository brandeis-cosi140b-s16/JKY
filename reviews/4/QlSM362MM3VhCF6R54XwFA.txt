Having lived in Pittsburgh for almost a year, I've still been on the hunt for a Mexican restaurant to call my staple "go-to." Mad mex, steel cactus, and chipotle just weren't cutting it. Closest had to be los cabos in lawrenceville but you order at a front counter so it didn't have that authentic restaurant feel. I was SOSO excited when I saw that a new Mexican place was coming! 

First impression was that this place is huge! Could easily get lost. The chips were good, salsa was pretty tasty, always a plus. I ordered the chicken fajitas and my husband got the enchiladas supremas. Everything was pretty good. My portion was huge and quite tasty, enough to take home. The reason I'm deducting one star is that in our favorite Mexican restaurant in my husband's home town, most entrees are served with rice, beans, guac, pico, and sour cream. Here, very few entrees came with those fixins for what was still a relatively pricey meal. Very tasty otherwise and we'll definitely be back!
