Truly home cooking style Mexican food served by a friendly staff with the owners doing the cooking.  The Chile Rellenos are excellent, and my wife says the Enchiladas are the first she's had in a restaurant that come close to her grand mother's New Mexico style Enchis... Very reasonably priced and there is usually several sports events on the TV's facing the dining area. They do a great job of preparing each meal fresh, but doing so very quickly. I highly recommend Rio Rico because it is great food at low cost and we should support independent restaurants like this. This is not a national chain.
