I'm a native Arizonan who has been eating authentic Mexican food since I was 3 (learned about flour tortillas when I asked my Mom why the man at the next table was eating his napkin.)  My husband is Mexican American who learned to cook from his Mother.  I think Ocho Locos is trying to be slick when it should just be basic and authentic.  That said, we like it and drive from Cave Creek to eat there a couple of times a month.

Ocho Locos has many of the same authentic recipes with which La Pinata (19th Ave. and Osborn) has stayed in business since the 70's.  Green corn tamales are about the same....yummy.  They have tweaked some of the other recipes to adapt to the snowbirds, but most are authentic, but tamed.

My husband prefers their Carne Machaca to any in the Phoenix area (for great, go to south 4th in Tucson for Carne Seca, Carne Machaca etc.)  The shredded beef tacos had a bit less flavor last visit than usually, but the beans were great as expected.  

Appetizers are half price at happy hour.  They have daily specials at least during the week.  I find their prices much better than the Mexican Restaurants in Cave Creek and the food selection better.....of course, the atmosphere at the El Encanto's is better.

We have never had service that was exceptionally good or exceptionally bad.  Usually the service is about average for area restaurants that are similarly priced.
