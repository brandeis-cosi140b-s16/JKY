This is my kind of place. It's located in what's nearly a "hole in the wall" in a strip mall next to a buffet restaurant.

This is a 'taqueria' by the most pure definition of the word. This is street food in a restaurant. I've ordered all the traditional tacos, and they are all delicious. The tortillas are perfectly cooked, the portion size is spot-on, and the radish, along with the toppings for each taco are fantastic. I could eat a dozen of these at a sitting, but I try to stop at 3.

I've also tried the refried beans and the rice, both of which taste amazing. The beans are creamy and mild, and the rice is savory, but not over-salted.

This place is authentic, and the owner is very friendly and engaging. I only drop one star for a few reasons: I wish that the chips and salsa weren't charged after the first basket (it's a low priced/loss lead food item, so not sure why they charge for extra), I also wish the wait staff was a bit older/more seasoned. Finally, I wish there were some milder salsas. I love Mexican street food, but this gringa in Charlotte can't take the heat! Their green salsa is the mildest heat-wise. I'd like more flavor and a bit less heat as an option.

Still, 4 stars from me, and I recommend this place highly. I'm developing a craving again, just reviewing it! We'll be back soon!
