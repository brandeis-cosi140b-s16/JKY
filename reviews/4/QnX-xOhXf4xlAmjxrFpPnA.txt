I was instantly enamored with Raul and Theresa's, texting my bf that I'd found our go-to mexican food place, and during the chips and salsa and guacamole I was right. I wish their mild salsa had a little more texture to it, but the hot salsa flavor was FANTASTIC.  They were very patient with my order because my son is allergic to wheat and dairy so I was very adament about no cheese or flour tortillas.  They kindly accomidated our special requests.  I ordered the carne asada burrito and I couldn't wait to get it but it was a little lackluster on flavor.  I will be back, I didn't order off of their specialties part of the menu so I will be back to see what they think is the best of their food.  The waitress I had was lovely, my only feedback is that she didn't anticipate any needs, like ask if I wanted another margarita, or more guacamole or anything like that. She easily could have sold me on quite a few more items. 

Very clean, very modern setup but not too fancy.  No complaints on the ambiance.  Our waitress took our check.
