I was a little worried about consistency after reading some of the recent negative reviews, but the place was on point tonight. Service was fast and friendly and the decor inside was entertaining lmao went with the make your own combo carnitas taco, chicken enchilada and carnitas tamale. Easily the biggest tamale ever loaded with pork. Great refried beans and the rice with cilantro was da bomb. All for 8.95. Fresh made tortilla chips with delicious salsa included, and........I ordered extra guacamole and they didn't even charge me. Need I say more?
