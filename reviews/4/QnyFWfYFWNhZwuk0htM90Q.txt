Sat down here for lunch with my sister on a weekday. We sat in the outdoor area. Unfortunately the table we had was only half shaded (they have giant umbrellas everywhere for the tables). My sister sat under the sun and got a little flushed but it was lively and fun, not overwhelming. Our waitress was really sweet and attentive, and the food came out quickly. The portions are pretty generous! And really delicious. The drinks themselves are really fun and great too! I would definitely come again, maybe at night so I can see all the lights strung up around the umbrellas.
