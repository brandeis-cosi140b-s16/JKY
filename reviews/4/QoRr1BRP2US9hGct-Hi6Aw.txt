I come to this location quite frequently since it is right by campus and is also on my walk home from school/work. I don't feel like Chipotle is anything special, but it is still good and you get a decent amount of food for the price. I like the fact that I can see the cooks cooking the meat and preparing the other ingredients so I know it is fresh. I usually get a burrito or a bowl with everything in it. My favorite meat choice is barbacoa or carnitas. I love their guacamole and chips.
