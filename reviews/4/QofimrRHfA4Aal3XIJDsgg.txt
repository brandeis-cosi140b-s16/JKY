Love this place! The tortas are huge as well as almosteverything else on the menu. Ordered the asada torta which was plentiful, friend of mine ordered the quesadilla which was huge. Also had a banana liquids which tasted just like my Mamita made them when I was younger. They a cept debit cards now which is great. The server girl was cute too!
