I love their food, especially the chicken Baja burrito. The Baja sauce is outstanding! And I love the refried beans. It's hard to find good refried beans in Vegas. It is my favorite Mexican food.

With that being said, my biggest complaint is that I do not like their chips and salsa. It's been the same for 15 years - I didn't like it then and I still don't like it. But because I like their food so much we keep going back. 

The atmosphere is a bit old school. I like it but think that it does need some updating. They used to have great coupons in the newspaper but they stop doing that quite some time ago - bummer! We don't go nearly as much.
