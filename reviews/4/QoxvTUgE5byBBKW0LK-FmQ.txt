With great relocations come even greater food. Only had the opportunity to get over to their old location near the Flying Saucer once and for some reason it wasn't all that memorable. When a co-worker mentioned going over to their newly opened establishment, I figured, ok, why not. Give em another go. Well, I was pretty impressed. 

I don't remeber them ever having a lunch buffet before, maybe they did, just not sure. But in any case, it was pretty awesome if I must say so myself. More than just not bad for $7.50. Although I didn't take notice, I'm sure they have the same menu items as before.

The new layout is definitely worth noting. Great atmosphere, and a nice bar set-up which I think I'll be back to hang out around. Gotta figure out the drink specials next.

Great staff also!
