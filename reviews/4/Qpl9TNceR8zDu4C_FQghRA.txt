This was the first taco stop on last night's taco tour with Jon and Amy H. I must say, the tacos here were fairly legit. They allow you to taste all of the meats before ordering, which was a nice touch. Several of the meats were very spicy, and I appreciate that very much. I liked the cochinita pibil, the tinga chicken (surprisingly the spiciest, which is awesome cuz tinga can tend to be bland), and the green chili beef. The adobado was good too. The husband and I split the 5 street tacos (for 7$...Holy Deal!!) and got all the toppings on them. The salsas from the salsa bar added just the right amount of heat and flavor to make for some yummy tacos. I especially liked the light green salsa. The tacos were decently large and they were not stingy with any of the ingredients. Now, these aren't my favorite tacos ever, but they were the best of the night. Will be back!
