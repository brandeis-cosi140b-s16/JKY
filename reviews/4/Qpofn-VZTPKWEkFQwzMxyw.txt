Really good food. The free chips and salsa is awesome. Thick warm chips and 2 salsas. The top shelf margaritas are worth the 2 for 1 price during their daily happy hour. Had the shrimp tacos and they were extremely good. The taco was packed with shrimp. The black beans were tasty and definitely not canned. I will come back and eat again for sure!!!
