Monday's are free fries day!!! 
Very great place, friendly staff and you get your money's worth. However I wasn't a fan of the drinks.. Soft drinks are 3/4 of ice. I had to get multiple refills. Refills we're free.. And I had the rib taco nice but 2bucks worth of food, if you know what I mean. I wish I took a picture with something to compare the tacos with. My mother got the burger it was nice size for what I paid, I just so happened to come on a Monday, staff informed me it's free fries day (free with only if you purchase a hamburger). Thanks for reading.
