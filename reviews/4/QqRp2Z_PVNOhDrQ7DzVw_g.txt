huuuge portions, and tasty food!

Just a heads up, most of the staff doesn't speak English, though the menu is in English and in Spanish so you can make a choice and then point if necessary. Even though members of our group speak Spanish fluently, our pale skin immediately sent the hostess for the English speaker on staff. Can't blame them, I guess, but in case she's not there when you are, you can still get a good meal!

As others have mentioned, the menu is fairly large, and encompasses a few different regions. We ordered everything from stuffed plantains to chicken and steak tacos to pinchos to a beautiful shrimp and fish dish, and some were accompanied by fantastic house made tortillas. I ordered the chicken pinchos. YUM! Perfectly cooked, a nice sauce, rice, salad, fried plantains, and a small odd shaped hot dog tasting thing (we've made our best guesses, but I'll just tell you it mostly tastes like a hot dog and looks like it went through a cookie cutter). I couldn't finish my large platter, and actually most people couldn't finish their plate. Hello, 4th meal!

We asked if they had any draft beer, she said "yes", but it was all from the bottle. Oh well. Pretty good service, jukebox, delicious food, I'm ready to go back!! CMYE?? (and pay at the counter on your way out)
