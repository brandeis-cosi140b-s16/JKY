Have been to this restaurant a couple of times now. Interior is very nice and comfortable. Prices are similar to a Rubios but in my opinion the food is better and in spite of ordering at a counter, food is served on actual plates. Both times I have had the chicken enchiladas suizas and it was delicious. My husband has tried both the shrimp burrito and the carne asada burrito and loved them both. Their beans are hands down the best I have had. They have a wide selection of hot sauces and a pretty impressive salsa bar.
