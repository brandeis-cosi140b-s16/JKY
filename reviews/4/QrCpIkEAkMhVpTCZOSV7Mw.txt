I found this restaurant while at the Bite of Las Vegas and tried their Pork Nachos and Coconut Bark and was blown away so then I looked up the locations and this happens to be just down the street from my house.

Located on the corner of Tenaya and Warm Springs, end cap of the retail space facing Warm Springs. The place is clean and friendly as you walk in and are greeted with Aloha! and the sound of Hawaiian music. 
There are several tables and bar table top settings however this location is not too big in size. There is an outside area set up for seating, however, every time I have been here there was not tables outside. 

The ordering style is basically a walk up to the counter and start at one side and work your way down the other as the employees prepare your tacos, burrito, nachos, or salads. Basically similar to any subway or cafe rio type system. 

The are quick to ask for extras and tell you any up-charges for certain items. 
I have had tacos; one steak, one pork, one chicken and also have had two burritos, one pork and one chicken since the times I have been here and all were great and of course made with the toppings and rice, salsa, etc, that I chose. 

I also love the Coconut Bark! its certainly a sweet so if that is not your taste than be ready because goodness of sugar, chocolate and coconut is coming at you. 

There is also a self service drink system with refills while your dinning in.

Again, I personally like this Hawaiian Food and find it better than a few other places in Vegas and of course the employees all have a great Hawaiian Spirit. 

Mahalo!!
