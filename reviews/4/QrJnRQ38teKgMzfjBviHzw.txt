Very happy with our meal here! Sitting outside in December is a whole new world for us! 
Walked in and immediately greeted by the hostess. Offered an outside table if we wanted which sounded like a great & different idea for us in December! 
Chips and Salsa right away! Awesome Chips, Salsa was boring and not chunky like I prefer. 
Awesome and helpful waitress that was very attentive, offered to explain the menu in full, but we pretty knew what we wanted! 

Started off with a Happy Hour Dip Trio(Charro Beans, Queso, Guacamole) and I went for a $5 H-H Classic Margarita on the Rocks and my wife went for the $5 H-H Mixed Berry Margarita. We were even asked; Salt, Sugar, or Nothing on the Rim! 
The Dip Trio was yummy, standout being the Guacamole. Super fresh! Beans were nice and creamy with tiny little pieces of bacon, Queso was a tasty addition as well. 
Margaritas were great as well! Mine was just a perfect example of a Classic, wife's had a nice, but not overwhelming Berry Flavor! 

We also ordered the Shrimp and Crab Ceviche which was very simple, yet divine. Most places simply over do the Citrus, not the case here. It was present, but didn't dominate the dish. Awesome shrimp and crab pieces in there!
 
Moving on to our actual meal. My wife went for the Chipotle Shrimp Tacos with black beans. Again, perfect Shrimp, nice flavor, awesome Tortillas!(More than likely homemade) 

I went for some goodies from the H-H Menu; Beef Taco, Pork Taco, BBQ Pork Torta(Think Big Slider Size) Every thing was great as expected! BBQ Pork was tender with great BBQ flavor and a little heat. Beef and Pork Tacos shared the same tenderness with lots of flavor! $3 Happy Hour Tacos(BIG) and $4 Happy Hour Torta! M-F 4p-6p

As you can see, YES we ordered a lot of food! And pretty much ate it all short of some of the beans and chips! A place that we will definitely go back to in the future when we're in the mood for more of a sit-down type of Mexican Dinner!
