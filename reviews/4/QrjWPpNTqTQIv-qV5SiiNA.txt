Diablo's Cantina, which of course is German for "Heavenly Nachos", is attached to the Monte Carlo on the Vegas Strip. The nachos there live up to their namesake.

It's pretty expensive to eat here in general. For example, these nachos I speak of, which were the Combo Nachos with chicken and skirt steak, were a whopping $23 when we had them on a Tuesday night last week! Ok, ok... it was Cinco De Mayo, but still. The menu online reflects a price of $18, so perhaps they upped the price for the occasion.

In any event, the nachos here were awesome. Nice combination of crunchiness and gooeyness, and smothered with delicious Mexican fixins. For $23, I guess you expect them to be good, but they were so filling that there's more than enough to fill up two hungry, margarita-drinking hooligans out on the town for fun. So, $11.50 a person doesn't sound too bad then.

Also, they had margarita and taco specials in light of the holiday (is Cinco De Mayo a holiday? I don't think Mexicans celebrate it... just us American drunkards).
