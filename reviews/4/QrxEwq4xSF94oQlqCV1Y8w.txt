One of the best things I can remember from high school were the numerous trips to Zaba's with friends for weekday lunch/dinner and random weekend excursions. Since going to college, whenever I'm back home, I always want Zaba's at one point during my stay.

Similar to Chipotle in its menu and cafeteria-style set up, but light years better in taste, quality, and selection. Zaba's offers so many options for the health-conscious: brown rice, wheat tortillas, sweet potatoes, fajita vegetables, and a killer (as well as super fresh) green salsa. Their menu spans from the typical (carnitas, carne asada, and chicken) to the alternative (shrimp, fish, and vegetarian options). 

Yeah, I may have a Chipotle in Seattle. I'd rather just wait to come home and eat Zaba's.
