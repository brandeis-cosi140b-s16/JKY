Reasons why I love this place:
1. Horchata with all kinds of goodies inside, like pecans and cantaloups and strawberries, I mean these are "real" and not those freeze-dried stuff. My poblem with it is it only comes in one size--32 ounces, which is like two meals for me.

2. The salsa bar...never knew there could be so many kinds of salsa! That alone is an adventure in taste-testing. My personal fave is the jicama one, which really is more of a relish but who's checking. 

3. Chicken mole and pibil...they do it right. Their mole could be a bit spicier for my taste but that's what the salsas are there for. I had the chicken mole as a taco and the pibil as a burro (separate occasion, alright, don't think I'm a pig now).

It's a great date place, I think. It's small, it's quaint, in a good neighborhood, and the satffers are very friendy. 

I love this place so much that I didn't even care about the tiny creature scurrying across the floor near the front door. That's  not their fault though. That was just an unfortunate situation. Not a reflection of them.

So try it.
