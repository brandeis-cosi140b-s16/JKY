Chipotle close to my home? Yay!!! I like Chipotle and the fresh ingredients they use. I like that you could build your own burrito or bowl. They have one of the best tortillas & guacamole. Try the sofrita if you want all vegetarian. Service is fast, price is reasonable, place is clean. We are now regulars at this location.  :)
