Didn't know this place was an Iowa bar hangout until recently when we popped in on a Saturday Morning. The game had just started and we got the last table outside(there was nothing open, even a bar stool on the inside). I haven't been here at night but at least during the day it's pretty chill. 

They play the game when it's on and not music like other places. The food was actually pretty good. The portions were large which were expected. We tried the bbq ribs which were really good and I had mahi tacos. The boy had carne tacos which were also really good but the bbq ribs were the best.  Overall the service was great - drinks were never empty and the outside bar loaded with TVs was impressive. It's a high contender against out other fav's for weekend football for sure. Definitely a younger crowd but they're old enough to not be d*bags.
