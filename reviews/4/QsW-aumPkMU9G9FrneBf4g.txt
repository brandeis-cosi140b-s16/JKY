I have only been here for drinks, but the sangria was pretty good. The bar wasn't packed, but the super pregnant bartender was more than a little bit rude and slow (but maybe that is ok? I don't know. I have all the respect for her working while pregnant, but if you can't handle it... or maybe she is always slow and rude and I am just attributing it to her pregnancy? Who knows.) 

Anyways, I wouldn't want to know what the service is like when it is busy. There were empty chairs at the bar and I still had to wait for 12 minutes to get a drink.
