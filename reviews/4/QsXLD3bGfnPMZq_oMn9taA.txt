In my book, and the collective book that my friends are forced to share with me, Z-Tejas is synonymous with fun. How do you make it a good night? Follow my directions carefully:
1) flag over your waiter or any other waiter (or anyone that looks like a waiter) in your vicinity
2) say the following "6th street, frozen, salt"
3) drink
4) repeat

Seriously though, the margaritas are excellent. I haven't tried any other drinks here, but I'm fairly certain they'd be just as good (okay maybe not as good, but close enough).

The food is tasty too. Don't go in expecting authentic Mexican. I don't know why you'd go into a snazzy place called Z-Tejas for authentic food anyway, but that's between you and your brain. The Diablo Chicken Pasta is awesome. The Jerk Chicken Salad is excellent too. I have friends who get the Pork Medallions, and they seem to love it.

If you go and see a large group that's being loud ... look for the devilishly handsome Indian dude and come say hello. Okay I'm kidding, I don't even live in PHX anymore.
