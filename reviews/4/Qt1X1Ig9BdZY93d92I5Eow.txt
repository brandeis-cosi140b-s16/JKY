Came here strictly to eat after seeing another friend Instagram a pic of his meal on Instagram.  The price is great considering it was a lot less than places I had eaten previously while in Las Vegas.  The food was on par with what I expected.  It's very similar to Bullrito's or Chipotle.  I also had a good time watching the staff across the hall at the Goretorium scare the people walking by.  I would recommended it if you're in the area and need to grab a quick bite.
