Came here post movie for some lunch. After watching Riddick, all that action made us super hungry and Chevy's was a convenient walk from the theater.

The staff was super friendly, and we enjoyed two giant sized margaritas that came with super nachos as recommended. Surprisingly it was a deal when ordering this combination instead of ordering margaritas separately. I enjoyed my drink so much that I ended up spilling the last bit, and you know what the waiter did? He gave us several coupons for more discounted margaritas and food! Bring on the fun! 

The steak fajitas were really good! I feel like you get more meat and fresher less processed meat here than you would at Chilis, but regardless I enjoyed them. It was such a treat to see the tortillas made before your eyes and then eat them fresh immediately. Despite being a chain, I'm a fan and i don't know why I didn't return sooner!
