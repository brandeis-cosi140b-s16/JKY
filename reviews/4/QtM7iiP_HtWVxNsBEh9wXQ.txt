You can always trust those hole-in-the-wall places to put out amazing tasting food.

I've been wary of trying Mexican food here because I came from an area where Mexican food and the like pretty much dominated next to Asian. Plus my two experiences trying Mexican food here were lackluster.

Got a recommendation to try Atoyac for their tacos and yes, yes, yes this is what I'm talking about! I got the chorizo, asada and pastor tacos with horchata of course.

The horchata has pecans added to it (if you'd like) and is so good! Not too powdery, refreshing, not overwhelmingly sweet or cinnamon doused. 

The tacos come with grilled onions and jalape√±os and two salsas. The asada and chorizo were my favorite. I'm used to tasting the subtle sweetness from pineapple that  gets infused into the al pastor when roasted, but didn't get that here. Yummy salsa verde too, helps cut through the richness of the meats.

Giving the shop only four stars because I ordered 5 tacos and got only 4 in my take-out box albiet charged for the missing one. Also after getting my tacos, I realized I never got my Horchata once I got in the car- but the woman helping me told me it was a mistake and got me my drink. The order and service was quick.

Solid tacos here, can't wait to come back to try the rest of the menu!
