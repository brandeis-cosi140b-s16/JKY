Actually, a little surprised at the food, given that it is an airport restaurant.  Also, they started serving lunch at 10am, which was good for me since I had already taken an early morning flight to get to Phoenix and had my share of breakfast.

Had two tacos with ground beef on corn tortillas.  Could have had a little more more pico de gallo or salsa or something, but they were stuffed enough to fall out and I had to scoop up with my fork.

The iced tea was brewed and also good.

The tacos and the beverage was $14.48 before gratuity.

Had both tables and shared high toppers.
