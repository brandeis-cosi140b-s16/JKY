I wanted so bad to give this place 5 stars, but I just can't, and for one reason: the store bought tortillas.  There are a few things I look for in my Mexican food establishments.  The meat is actually seasoned and flavorful (something two chain operations out here really miss the mark on), the selection of meats offered (let's face it, if lengua, cabeza, pastor, etc are on the menu, you definitely aren't at Fili B's), and I am a sucker for street tacos.  This place hits all three on the head!!  When I read the other reviews I kept noticing yelpers were mentioning the store bought tortillas and I didn't think it was such a big deal...  But it was barely even warmed up!  My burrito felt cold in my hands.  In the future I will probably skip burritos and order a carnitas plate.  The street tacos were probably made with store bought tortillas as well, but they were so yummy and at the perfect temperature, I really can't complain.  Oh, and the two guys on shift when I visited were both very warm and friendly.  I will definitely be back.
