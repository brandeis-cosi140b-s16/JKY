Chipotle is a godsend for my little area of Phoenix, where it seems quite difficult to eat vegetarian unless I cook at home. While there always seems to be a line out the door, it moves faster than you'd think. On top of that, the food is awesome! I have never once been disappointed with my food and neither has anyone that I have exposed Chipotle to. For having such a small and specific selection of items, the set-up is great and possibilities seem endless. I love that the meat served here is natural, meaning no hormones and better taste!
The atmosphere is cozy, clean and simple. 
The only reason I had to give this place only 4 stars is due to service. When you go thru the line and the staff asks you what what you would like on your salad, tacos or burrito, they ask as they are already spooning it on. On more than half occasions here they have had to remove ingredients or redo my food, but they never mind having to do the correction. So if you see a topping that you would prefer not to have, my advice is to scream it out before your food makes its way even remotely close to the item. I can promise you won;t be disappointed with your end result, though.......always yummy!
