I think we found a good one!  You could officially call me a fan of Azteca.   I came here with a party of 11.  The chips and salsa were pretty good.  I, personally, could have used a little more kick, but what can I say?  I'm a spicy kind of guy!

The margaritas are phenomenal here!  Between my fianc√©e and I, we ordered a pitcher.  My 3 enchiladas were absolutely awesome.  

Service was great!  They even came out and sang happy birthday to our friend.  Awesome job Azteca.  I shall be back!
