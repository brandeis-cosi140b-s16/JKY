The salsas(green & red) at Los Dos are the fire!! I haven't found hotter or tastier salsas at any other restaurant. 
I have frequented the Central Ave location a half dozen times. Really cool atmosphere(rumor says it used to be a mortuary) with the courtyard and the intimate dining area. Just not convenient for me at all. 
I have only been to the Wash and 10th Street location once but it had the same great salsa and the food is always good. The atmosphere is lacking, but it is a great location to go for dinner before a D-backs or Suns game. Everything I have had is good, but I always end up dumping a bunch of salsa on whatever I order anyway and that makes it pretty great. 
I find the drinks are a little pricey, I believe I paid $10 bucks for a decent rocks margarita and $12 for a prickly pear margarita for the Mrs. 
In summation the salsa makes this place a 4-star joint.
