For some reason, I was expecting not to like PURE Taqueria once we walked in the door. Perhaps it was the big sign that said Restaurant.com coupons were no longer honored that peeved me. Perhaps it was the 5 minute wait to be seated on a Saturday afternoon because the front of house station was completely abandoned. I don't know, something just set me off.

But at the end of the meal I had to admit, nothing was tremendously WRONG with the place. I might have just been in a grouchy mood. The service was good, and the salsa and chips were tasty. I enjoyed the $2 Tecate beer special. That put me in a better mood.

I ordered the pork tacos. My husband ordered the fish tacos because they were hailed as the best fish tacos in Charlotte. I liked my tacos, but I wasn't a huge fan of the rice, which seems bland at best. I took a bite of my husband's fish tacos. They were good, but I've had better fish tacos elsewhere in Charlotte, so I wouldn't put them on a "best" list. They needed more spice and flavor.

Overall, we found PURE Taqueria to be a neat place. We'd go back, definitely. I just feel bad for those folks who might have bought Restaurant.com vouchers.
