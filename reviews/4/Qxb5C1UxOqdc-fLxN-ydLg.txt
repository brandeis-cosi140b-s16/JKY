Stopped by here with the partner in between classes at Phoenix College.  We were pleasantly surprised.  Had the Burro and the Tamale...both were excellent.  We also found a great spot if you just want to go have a couple of alco-beverages and some chips and salsa.  Salsa tasted fresh which is a +++ in our book.

Love that they have Double Bubble in the bathroom and at the register.  That stuff rules -- even if it tastes like wax seconds after you put it in your mouth.
