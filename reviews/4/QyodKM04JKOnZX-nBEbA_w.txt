Solid joint, intimate, woody.  My date and I got a great table in the corner by the private room, which was nice because the main area was pretty loud on that Saturday night. 
     On the downside, a large party of drunks stumbled through to the private room near the end of the date.  They needed an asskicking, but perhaps they were regulars and the management let it slide.  It happens.
     We had the brie toasts, a perfect little appetizer.  I had the pork tender-loin, which comes out skewer style, perfectly done with a mint jam garnish.  The sweet potato stuffed chili pepper seems to be a regular side dish there.  It was a new one for me, sweet and fiery, it was great!  Creme brulee for desert was top notch, smothered in berries. 
    
      I would have liked to spend more time there, so I'll definitely be back for another round some day.
