This place is really hidden behind the ghost town that is Metro Center but that shouldn't stop you from trying this place.  The food actually really surprised me.  I haven't been able to find much authentic Mexican food here in Phoenix and this place is a little closer to home!  The tacos had a really good crunch and flavor.  The rice tasted like it was fresh and not hard and crunchy like some other places.  The prices were reasonable and I would definitely come back again!
