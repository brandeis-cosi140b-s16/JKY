Small shack that reminds me of an old photo-mat. Only a small outside patio and a drive thru. This was my first time here. I ordered a carne asada, and a carnitas tacos. Carnitas was outstanding! Carne asada was very tender although could have used a little more flavor. Overall I like this place and next visit to Casa Grande I'll be back.
