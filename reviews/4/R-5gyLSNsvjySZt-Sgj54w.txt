We enjoy La Loma Mexican Grille and their unique Tijuana carnitas in addition to their other solid items on their menu.  As to the service in La Loma Mexican Grille - yeah they may not be the most out going, but then again they aren't all over you as well.  Come in, go to the counter, order, find a seat and wait for your order to be called or brought to you.

Make sure you get both bottles for their salsa and taco sauce (which i prefer).
