I do not understand the bad reviews from other Yelpers. This place is fantastic, yes I agree the staff behind the counter isn't always 100% on their game but non the less, food is always delicious. Not sure about you, but I go to a quick eat place like this b/c I'm hungry and want tasty food, not to get praised and smiled at by teenagers behind the counter. If you're still leery of the reviews, go in for Taco Tuesday- all their tacos are $2 so give it a go.
