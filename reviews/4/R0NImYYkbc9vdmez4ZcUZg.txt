This place is pretty good for small chain Mexican food. (They are in about 3 states but not California)
The prices are reasonable. I ordered take out for 12 people and it was about $90.
The chicken burritos were pretty good and the guacamole was very good also but the side order was not too big so you need to get a couple large orders. 

The yellow salsa is spectacular! I do not know what it is made of but it is very tasty.

If you like hot, HOT, then order some grilled jalape√±os and take bite out of them, whoa, probably better to chop them up and add them to the food but, careful they are seriously hot, at least the batch that we got

Clean place and good service also
