Had dinner with my parents at Los Gringos. The staff was welcoming and helpful. The chips were fresh and the salsa was very good. I had the carnitas plate. The pork was tender and the sauce had the right amount of spice. The grilled vegtables, that were included, were fresh and crisp. I will go again.
