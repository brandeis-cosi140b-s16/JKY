I love this place because it's right next to my dorm and also, it's one of the few Mexican restaurants that I've found that actually sells a Mole (molay') dish (chocolate and poblano chile's if I'm not mistaken). Try the chicken Mole and you'll really like it... very authentic.

Chips are great, as is the salsa. You can tell its family owned... you can ask for Mexican cokes too I think. I've gone here twice and I'd go again whenever the stomach callers.

Sometimes they have a wandering mariachi guy. I always feel awkward when they come around because then you feel like you have to tip, but I think he sensed we were poor college students so he didn't come by.

I'm not sure what you ordered that you didn't like (to the first reviewer).
