Grabbed a quick bite here today and I was impressed.  I thought this place would be like a Taco Bell but was suprised that the food was actually pretty good.  They mostly have a simple mexican fast food menu but, they also sell burgers and have a small breakfast selection available all day.  I didn't have any problems with my order however another customer from the drive-thru came in with a complaint.  They fixed their mistake quickly and without hassle.  Prices are good and the portions are huge.  They also got an A from the health department, so I'll be back.
