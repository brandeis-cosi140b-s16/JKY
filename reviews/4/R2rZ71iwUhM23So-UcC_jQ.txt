I reviewed a couple of reviews from previous individuals.  

This place was great!  I was able to get seated quickly and greeted by my server.  

I asked the server for the his recommended margarita and his choice was on point.  

They brought out corn bread which is one of the best I have ever had and the street tacos were there too.  

My wait period for the tacos was very minimal.  

I would definitely recommend trying this place out.  

Previous reviews said that the guacamole is great so I definitely make another trip to try it out.
