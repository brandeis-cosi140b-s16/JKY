My husband and I found this place after purchasing a gift certificate from restaurant.com.  It is in a strip mall south of I-85 near a chinese restaurant and a Family Dollar.  The decor is pretty "Mexican restaurant kitsch".  I noticed that there was a bar, but we sat near the door and didn't venture further into the restaurant, so I couldn't comment on the bar.

We were presented with menus by a woman who seemed nice, but obviously spoke no English.  She pointed to the drinks, and waited expectantly.  We both ordered Cokes, and they arrived quickly, along with 2 bowls of a spicy soup with sausage, beans, and vegetables.  I don't know what it was called, but it was YUMMY.  

Another waitress came to take our order.  This place has an extensive menu!  Most of the items have english translations on the menu, but not all of them.  I noticed everything from your standard tacos and tortas to beef tongue, octopus, and several types of ceviche.  

We both ordered the "Tres Compadres" platter for 14.50.  It comes with a pounded chicken breast, 2 pieces of skirt steak, and 4 grilled shrimp.  The shrimp was slightly overcooked, but seasoned well.  The chicken and skirt steak were FABULOUS.  Flavorful, tender, and juicy.  The plate also comes with a large serving of rice (also tasty) and homemade tortillas.  The entire thing was excellent.

We shared an order of flan for dessert.  It was dense, and tasted faintly of cinnamon.  My husband commented that my flan is better, and more smooth.  Theirs wasn't bad, although it had very little of the caramelized sugar sauce.

In all, we spent about $17 before tip (after the $25.00 GC), and we were thrilled.  We intend to bring my in-laws in for a yummy, casual lunch.
