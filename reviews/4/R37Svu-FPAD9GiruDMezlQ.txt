This this a little taco truck that you must stop at the tacos are $3 or $3.50 but they at packed!! When you ask for every you get guacamole beans pico de gallo and cheese. They half grill fry their tacos and it give it this crunch that is amazing. The quesadillas are so cheesy that you forget the tortilla and if you get it with everything....forgot about eating a taco unless you don't mind not driving anywhere for a minute. They only have three stools so best to get it to go or if you are only going with one or two friends. I have seen the bust out 20 tacos in about 5 minutes!!! So the service is pretty fast. Get taco truck on the east side my one downside is...no drinks serve drinks and you guys could own the east side and have that last star!!!!
