This place is pretty great.  Really good (but not excellent) food and reasonable prices.  They have an odd policy noted on their menu that only the first bowl of chips are free.  Pretty much every other Mexican place has unlimited chips, so that is pretty weird.  I still give it 4 stars since it is close to home and good, cheap Mexican places around here are really hard to come by. I have tried many others around and this is the best by far.
