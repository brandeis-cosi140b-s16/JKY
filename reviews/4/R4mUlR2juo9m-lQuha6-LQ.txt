Oh oh El Pollo Loco! For the longest time I have ignored El Pollo and I am sad that I have. This El Pollo is not in the best part of town and I am sure this review food-wise can go for all El Pollo Locos in general.

I did the drive-thru here and there was a bit of a wait, even though I seemed to be the only car there. It was probably about 10:30 PM on a Thursday night. However, the lady working the drive-thru was nice. 

Here's what I ordered and the main reason I'm writing this review. Chicken tacos and tamales! They were delicious. What I loved was the simple, yet flavorful taste of the meats and the tortillas. The tamale seriously was amazing. I almost thought I was eating a tamale not from a fast food establishment. As a side note, I believe they only do the tamales around Christmas time.

I have had their chicken on occasion as well and I declare it to be much better than KFC. If I'm going to get a "fast food" chicken I will definitely pick El Pollo Loco over the Colonel.
