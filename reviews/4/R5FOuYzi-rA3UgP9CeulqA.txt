Got to admit that I hate eating alone....but I'm house sitting and not in the mood to cook. So at the advice of my daughter I looked on yelp for something nearby.
Found three amigos...and people were waiting for seats. So I felt sure it had a local
following.  Went right in and asked the waitress at the bar if I could get take out.
No biggie ... Saw some giant margaritas all around me....so I ordered one and she brought me chips and salsa.   Drink was great...could taste the cilantro in the salsa.   So there I was alone at the bar having a great drink w/ chips &salsa,...take out was ready so off I was.   Great spot. Food was decent too
