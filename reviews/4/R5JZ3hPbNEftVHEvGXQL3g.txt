Ok, Casa Rasta has changed the menu (website says under construction, should have taken a picture).  No Tacos but plenty of variety.  Will miss my favorite tacos that are were not available anywhere else.  Had two Sopes, a chicken and chorizo that were good.  SWMBO had a burrito, jerk chicken I think, that was very good, better then my sopes.

Still BYOB, but was told that they are in the process of applying for a liquor license.
