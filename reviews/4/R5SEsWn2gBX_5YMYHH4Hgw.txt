I love this place the food is awesome alpastor is AMAZINGGGGGGG. But the dude behind the bar CAN NOT pour a beer it honestly brings a tear to my eye for all the anchor steam he wasted while pouring ONE BEER, I wanted to jump behind the bar and show him how to pour a beer or put my mouth under the tap.
