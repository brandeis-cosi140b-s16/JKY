Not sure why, but Carlsbad seems to have fallen out of my rotation. Turns out I should put it back in. Stopped in for an early dinner on Sunday with a couple of friends. Service was good and the food was good. 

We split green chili covered nachoes to start. Very good and a bit spicy. I had the carne adovada. It was less spicy than the nachos, but still good. The black beans were off the hook good. Spicy! Rice topped with cheese was good as well.

All in all, good joint. Well worth a stop. 

CT, you are back in the rotation.
