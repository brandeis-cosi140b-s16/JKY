Okay being from el paso (bordering with old Mexico and new Mexico) it's only common sense to know that Mexican food is mexican food. Whether it's tex-mex or New Mexican. Tortillas, tamales, burritos, chiles, all come from Mexico. New mexicans have a tendency to avoid being  Mexican.  Tejanos are proud of our Mexican heritage unlike new Mexicans.  Just calling a spade a spade. Anyway this joint could be more vegetarian and gluten free friendly.
