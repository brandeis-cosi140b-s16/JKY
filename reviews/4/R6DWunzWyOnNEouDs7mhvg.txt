I just love this place.  First of all you can't get food in Phoenix generally after 10pm and this place cooks until midnight!!!  Second of all its great food - although it is a little spendy.  Try and hit up some of the happy hour times (sit at the Bar only) also there are sometimes reverse happy hours 11pm-midnight.  

This seriously is a great place to take someone on a late night date.  PLEASE enter by going down the stairs on the right.  It is really cool downstairs.  There is also upstairs seating and a bar but downstairs feels like you are in Boston!  

They do not provide high chairs or booster seats so get a sitter and leave the kids at home.  

Valet parking which I find annoying but it is tough to find parking at times.

Dress code - well its still Phoenix but it wouldn't hurt to step it up a notch.
