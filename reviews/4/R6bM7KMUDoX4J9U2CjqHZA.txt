Roberto's has the best carne asada burritos and the fixin's at the salsa bar are tasty. Red and green sauce and spicy carrots and lime wedges . Also enjoy the 3 rolled tacos with guc .I do agree with some of the reviews about the place being a mess. But that is some of the appeal to most taco shops. I mean risking your life for good tacos and burritos is exciting and I also agree this place is perfect after a late night of drinking.
