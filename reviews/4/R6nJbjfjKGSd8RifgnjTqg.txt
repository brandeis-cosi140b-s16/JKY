I really enjoyed my breakfast burrito (I actually shared part if it, as it was a decent size), and the caramel flan was absolutely delicious.  The quality was naturally far higher than a fast food breakfast burrito from Sonic or McDonald's.  This abbreviated Fox concept is a great break from the Burger King and McDonald's airport food of my childhood!  

It also made me a little sad to see Modern Burger still around after the sad, partly self-inflicted demise of Modern Steak and it's Modern Burger window at Scottsdale Fashion Square.  Ah, memories.
