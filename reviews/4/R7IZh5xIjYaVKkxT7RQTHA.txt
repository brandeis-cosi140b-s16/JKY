I hope we're talking about the same place, but I found their food truck near 17 and sat under the tents right before lunch.  Had chicharron tacos, buche tacos and cahuamanta tacos.  Still debating if buche is stomach or udder (as the server explained it).  All three were really good - the chicharron being the best as you can imagine.  And at a 1.50 each - even better.
