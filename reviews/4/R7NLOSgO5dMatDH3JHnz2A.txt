I have been to La Comida a few times for lunch.  The entrance is very fun and unique. The food is authentic and very delicious.  Two items that are a must try on the menu is the prickly pear margarita and the corn.  The service is excellent and the waiters are very friendly and pleasant.  They know everything about the menu.
