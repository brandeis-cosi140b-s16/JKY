It's all relative. If this place was back home in SF, I'd probably give it 5 stars.  But in a city full of excellent, cheap Sonoran joints, this one rates 'very good' in my estimation.

I tried the chicken burro on a recommendation thinking it would be one of those dinky little burros I usually get here in Phoenix. But this was a full-sized affair; not Mission burrito big but enough to make a meal out of. 

Not knowing that, I also ordered a couple of tacos. The carne asada wasn't as flavorful as the best I've had, the old original America's Taco Shop on 7th. The barbacoa was lovely. 

Their chips reminded me of Fritos but the red hot sauce and little cup of frijoles a la charra were outstanding. So was the guacamole that accompanied my tacos. 

Next time I come here, I'm going to get the 1/4 chicken like just about everyone else in the place was eating.
