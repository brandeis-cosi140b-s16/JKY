This place is great for that late night munchie. My wife and I ate here on a Monday night and we thought it was going to be like Robertos. The menu is identical but the quality is above and beyond Robertos. We ordered Chicken Tacos and a Cane Asada Burrito. The Chicken Tacos were stuffed to perfection. There was an even blend of cheese and lettuce. Not to forget the chicken was seasoned great. The Cane asada Burrito was stuffed with all the goodies and they didnt even charge me for all the extras. The price was exceptional. We spent $8.00 and got (1) Carne Asada Burrito with extras (4) Chicken Tacos and (1) Large Fountain Coke. So I have to say $8.00 well spent!!!
