We tried El Rico's today after buying a Weforia deal a while back.  I had heard great things about this place from friends and had been wanting to try it for a while.  We went on a Saturday at about 11:30 am and there was only one other table in the place, but around noon the place really started filling up.

The margaritas were very tasty.  A little on the sweet side, but good.  Chips and salsa were also very good.  The chips were fresh although the salsa could have been just a bit spicier.  I had a veggie burrito and it was just gigantic!  Very good though and I still have half in the fridge.  The BF had the steak fajitas which he said were really good.  Also a very large portion so he has half in the fridge.  The only thing about the fajitas are that the flour tortillas that they brought him were the big giant burrito size which made it kind of hard to make a fajita.  Maybe it was just a mistake, or they were out of the smaller ones.  Who knows.  The other weird thing was the bathroom.  It says on the door "only 1 person...please lock door" or something like that.  But inside it's giant and there are two toilets....but no walls separating them...and no mirror.  Strange.

Anyway, our waiter was very nice and made good recommendations, which the BF just loves.  We will definitely go back.
