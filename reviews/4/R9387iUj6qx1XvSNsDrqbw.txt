Because it was too cold to eat upstairs on the patio, we ended up at the counter in front of the kitchen, which turned out to be great. This place has an amazing wine and beer list, with detailed descriptions. The menu is varied with options like game dishes, Thai food, fish plus a large offering of Mexican food. The staff is pleasant and fun. Try this place!
