I'm a serious Chipotle-lover. I don't know what it is about their burritos and bowls (relatively simple items), but it's addicting. This new location is no exception. They have been very fast and pleasant in my experiences so far. It's about a mile closer to than the Baum location which I previously frequented, so that's also a plus.
