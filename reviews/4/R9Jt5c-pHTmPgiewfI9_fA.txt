I went for lunch at La Cabana with some friends and we really enjoyed our experience. I'm half Mexican and I've to say that I enjoyed not only the atmosphere but the wait staff and the bartender were really great.

I ordered the Taco, Enchilada and Tostada combo, with an order of rice. The chicken taco (as all my items were chicken) was delicious! The enchilada was full of chicken as was the tostada. The rice was perfect for me. The taste was authentic and tasted just like my family makes.

My friends and I definitely enjoyed our time at La Cabana and can't wait to head back to try the Fajita warming grills! What a great idea for a Friday GNO or just a big b-day party! Great to have a new Mexican restaurant in town that has more of a Taqueria feel and is welcoming. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food.
