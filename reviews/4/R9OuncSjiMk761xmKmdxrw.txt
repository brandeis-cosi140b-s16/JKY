This is an unassuming little taco shop that has rockin burritos.  Breakfast burritos, carne asada, chicken and more.  I've yet to be disappointed with the food or the service in general.

Only reason I am not giving this place a 5 out of 5 is due to a couple of times where I had John S.'s issue.  Got a chicken rather than machaka burrito and also got a sausage breakfast burrito rather than a ham another time.  The food was great and these have been rare occasions in my experience, so 4 out of 5.
