Who doesnt love this place?! COME ON! Ok, well I could live without the salsa, but the pico is ooooooh so good. I also dig that they offer Sol beer which is not easy to come by. I admit, I am not one to order the same thing every time I go out to eat, but I just cant stay away from the arroz con pollo. ARRRRRIBA! Take a bunch of amigos/amigas and enjoy a margarita or two and eat up...then go home with the leftovers. My guy and I had leftovers and I made a freakin casserole with them for god sakes. So much food!
