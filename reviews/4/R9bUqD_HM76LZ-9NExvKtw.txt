We found this place down the street from our hotel. Ordered the carne asada plate x4. The service wss a bit slow which was probably due to frequent clients coming in to order.  The guy at the counter was very friendly and kept everyone's attention with his conversation.  The food was actually very good. The carne asada was moist and flavorful. The Mexican rice was perfect as well as the refried beans.  The next time we visit Phoenix,  we'll definitely stop by again. Gracias se√±or counter guy from Ecuador.
