My wife & I just dined here and I still don't know quite what to make of the place.  But I'll be back, rest assured.

We had Tampiquena & Special Chimi.  The Tampiquena (sp?) had nice Carne Asada, fresh guac, rice & beans.  The Special Chimi was filled with tender, flavorful all white meat chicken.  The sauce on the Chimi was very different but I liked it more as I worked through my meal.  It was a cheesy white sauce with flavors of chili verde.

Speaking of chili verde, one of the 3 items that came with the tortilla chips was green chili (as well as frijoles and a nice red salsa) that was surprisingly complex.  It was slightly sweet, had a mild bite and a faint smoky flavor.  It worked very well mixed into the frijoles.

How they pull off BBQ I don't know, but I'll update when I return.
