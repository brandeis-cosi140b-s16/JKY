If you dare to venture into the hood of south Scottsdale, and I mean way south (you know the scary part where you may find a stray cat, but never a cougar),  you'll find Huauchinango Mexican Grill and me most likely stuffin' my face.

English is a second language here, both on the menu and for some of the servers, but it's not enough to keep me away.  First stop, we ordered a total of 4 tamales, a taco, and a side of beans for about $8!  Even if the food tasted like crap (and no I don't have first hand experience of what actual crap tastes like, but I can imagine), it would be a good deal.  But guess what, the food is great!

All the tamales were on the hot side, but the green was the milder of the three I sampled, and my favorite, too.  I've also had both the carne asada and carnitas tacos and I couldn't have stopped eating long enough to complain if I tried.  They're small street tacos on soft corn tortillas so order a bunch!

So head over, grab a seat (they'll take your order from the table if you like), and prepare to feast on a dime.  Word of warning, prepare to smell like the grill after you leave and don't be surprised if you're given a plastic spoon to eat with.  Regular flatware one day, only a plastic spoon the next.  If I could reliably get a real fork, I might "fork" over that 5th star.
