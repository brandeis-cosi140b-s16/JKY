I moved here from So Cal 4 years ago. Since I've been here this is the closest I've had to one of my favorite places from back home. This is also the first place I've been to in Wisconsin that not only knows what a proper skirt steak is, but how to make it. 
Also what they make is an avocado sauce, not guacamole.  Also the best I've had in Wisconsin. 

The service was great, the people were extremely nice and the food came out timely. I also spoke with the owner for a bit which was nice. He explained how he actually flew to Cali to research before they place opened. It's awesome to hear the passion in his story. 
There is only one con though. The only reason I didn't give it five stars has to do with the portions. Back in So Cal if you spend as much on a burrito you get something twice as big. I'm sure if the portions get a slight face lift then they would have the poor college kids flocking. At 7 or 8 bucks, you should have a burrito big enough to take some home.

As soon as I get downtown again, I'll be back for sure.
