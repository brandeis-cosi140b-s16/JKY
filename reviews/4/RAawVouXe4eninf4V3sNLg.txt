Pretty dang good tacos. Tried them for the first time today. Husband ordered carne asada and I had al pastor. I tried one of his carne asada tacos and I def favored the al pastor because it had more flavor. These are not your typical minuscule (two bites and it's gone) tacos. They're actually a pretty decent size. Served with a side of guacamole (a bit watered down for my taste), red salsa, limes, grilled jalape√±os, and cucumber slices. They offer various types of tacos, so I'm interested to see what the others taste like. Will def stop by again.
