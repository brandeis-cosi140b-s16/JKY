If any place reminds me of my high school days (other than my high school itself), it's definitely Amados. Located right down from Marcos de Niza, it's a student hotspot for lunch time and after school! And being a 24-hour restaurant, it's great for a bite any time of the day. They offer seating outside as well which is lovely when the weather is nice! 

Even better news? On top of their already great prices for whopping meals, they offer a free bean or egg and potato burrito with any purchase over $7!
