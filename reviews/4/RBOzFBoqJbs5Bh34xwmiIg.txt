A truly incredible experience! The Aria is a piece of artwork in and of itself, but I was not expecting the decor of Javier's to be so incredible. The tequila tree, the lighting, the ancient carvings...lovely atmosphere.

The food was amazing--I'm an avid salsa eater, and can be a bit picky, but it had the perfect bite! I highly recommend the margarita infused with cucumber--I had my reservations, but it was so refreshing, and offset the bitterness of the tequila perfectly.
The quesadilla with shrimp and dungeoness crabs was nothing sort of miraculous.

The service was a bit slow (I was with a large party, and the servers weren't even close to getting everyone's food out on time--we all ate in shifts), and the food is somewhat pricey, but it's definitely a venue to visit.
