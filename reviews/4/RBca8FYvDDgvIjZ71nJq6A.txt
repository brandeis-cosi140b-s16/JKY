Well, now we can make our own bowls for a variety of prices. It actually is a pretty good deal and can be healthy if you go with the right picks. There was at least five categories and at least four choices of stuff in each section of which you picked either one, two or three things to put in the bowl. Think I chose Chicken breast, cojita cheese, rice, beans, avocado and a mango salsa and a green sauce topping. It is just about 7 bucks without the drink and tortillas (extra $1.50). This location is pretty spiffy inside and looks different and better than some of the other well worn Loco's around town. There really is almost too many choices now though with a double meat menu, bowls and a 500 calories menu. I guess more is better as long as it's good. Mild salsa does have a jalapeno kick, be warned.
