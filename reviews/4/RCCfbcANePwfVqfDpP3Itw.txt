My husband and I have been here a few times now.  We love that it is walking distance from our house and the outdoor patio is great!  Staff is always super friendly and courteous, even when we are "those people" bringing our stroller with infant.  Food is awesome and so is there sangria.  Everything I have eaten has been phenomenol, with the exception of the wings.  The wings need a lot of help!  They were fatty, and rubbery.  Not a fan.. but everything else is A+
