I love the authenticity of the decor and cuisine. I celebrated my birthday there. It was a blast. The salsa and chips were savory and spicy and had you wanting more. The portion sizes was pretty plentiful I left with a to go bag. The waiter we had reminded us of a family member serving Sunday dinner he was laughing and joking and also very friendly. I had the "combancion mary y tierra" (Grilled steak and shrimp) which was DELICIOUS.... It was an enjoyable experience. I truly recommend for authentic Mexican and a good time....Try this place...
