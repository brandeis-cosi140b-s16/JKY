I live right across the street from Robertos which is awesome cuz I love this place. From their BIG breakfast burritos to their GIANT chimichangas, this place has it all. $1 chicken tacos on Wednesdays are great as well. A little oily but still good. The only thing i think they should change is that they should make their own in-house horchata instead of the machine one. Other than that this place is fire!!!!
