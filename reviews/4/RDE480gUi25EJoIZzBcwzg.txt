Great little place for dinner. 
Service started out horrible, but after being seated Gabby our waitress turned that around. She was nice and truly cared about her job. 
Food was delicious! The burritos were stuffed with all ingredients ordered, not just the typical rice & beans. There was plenty of steak.
Price for 2 people was $22. Not bad for both of us getting full combo meals. 
I will most defiantly return.
