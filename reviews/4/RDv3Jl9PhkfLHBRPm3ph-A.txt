Located literally next to the main entrance of Sapphire Gentlemen's Club, it might look daunting at first.

But once you're inside, it just feels like a really nice restaurant.

Items selected:
- Signature mahi tacos
- Signature shrimp tacos

Both came with rice and beans, and the quality was great. Chips came with three sauces - habanero, roasted tomato and salsa verde.

As seen on the billboard they tout no-GMO ingredients, but it doen't mean anything unless it tastes good. Good news is - it does!

I'm impressed - now they are officially one of my favorite Mexican (though Americanized) restaurants in Vegas, on par with Imperial Tacos & Beer.
