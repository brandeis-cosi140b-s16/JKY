I was pleasantly surprised by this place after going here for lunch.  For some reason I thought Zapatas was "upscale" mexican (with upscale pricing) but I was totally wrong.  I think this is due to the fact that the only other location I know of is in Ballantyne and things tend to be a bit elevated whenever you go to that end of town.

There's a decent lunch menu offered to go with the complementary chips and salsa - which was awesome.  I'm a huge cilantro fan and you can tell they make their salsa fresh (not out of the bottle).

I had a chicken taco salad and was surprised at how big the lunch portion was.  It was packed full of chicken and the sour cream and guacamole was off to the side so you can choose to make your salad "even healthier" if desired.

Service was great and quick.... definitely a great spot for lunch and I am assuming a good spot for dinner as well.
