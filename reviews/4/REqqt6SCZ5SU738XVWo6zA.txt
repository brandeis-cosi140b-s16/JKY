Ah, Chronic Tacos.  I discovered this place many moons ago when I lived in Southern California.  When I heard they'd be opening one here, I was definitely stoked.

Since then, that location in Summerlin has closed but Chronic Tacos lives again inside The Palms!  Great days.

The service is always on point, which is a breath of fresh air.  It sucks that it's now in the food court, making it a little awkward and rushed sometimes but the food quality is just as great.

For a long time I got their Chronic Carne Asada Fries, but since I have been making an active effort to eat healthier I switched to their chicken salad with dressing on the side.  Both are huge portions and very satisfying in their own right.  Everything else I've ordered here has never disappointed, either.

What's nice about the new location is you can ask for a sample - if you're not sure if you'll like a specific meat's seasoning, try it before you buy it!

Also, Baja sauce.  It's delicious.
