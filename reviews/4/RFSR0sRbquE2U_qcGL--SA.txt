Better-than-average Mexican fast-food chain. They got an extra star for having Vanilla Coke at the soda fountain (which has free refills). You can get the Tres Tacos deal for about $6. Choose steak, chicken, or fish tacos. The prices are resonable, and true to their name, the ingredients do taste very fresh. The salsa bar is kept clean and filled and has choices to suit any spice tolerance.
