Just enjoyed a pretty lovely dinner at the bar. We walked up and the wait for a table was 50 minutes, but the bar is first come first serve and we magically found two seats next to each other at 7:30 on a Saturday night. Kismet. 

The bar is big and comfortable, a wrap-around that's probably big enough for 30 people. My only complaint is there wasn't a place for my purse, I would love a hook for it underneath the bar. Our server was attentive and we got a smaller pitcher (about 2.5 beers) of good beer for $7, which I thought was a pretty stellar deal.

The complimentary chips and salsa came out hot and spicy. The salsa was good to me, I love cilantro and smoky heat and it delivered. I ordered three tacos, the standard, carnitas and tuna, and also got the refried beans. It was all delicious, from the tortilla to the toppings! My favorite was honestly the standard - it was the quintessential street taco. Delicious marinated chicken with smooth avocado and a great pico on top. 

I'd definitely recommend it, and we'll for sure be back!
