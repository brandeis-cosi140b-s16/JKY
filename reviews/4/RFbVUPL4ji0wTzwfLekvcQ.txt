The best chips and salsa I have had in Arizona.   I buy it from the restaurant for parties at my house.  I am a regular lunch patron.  You can't beat taco Tuesday.  The tacos are large and filling.  The hard taco shell stays crispy as opposed to some other places I have been where the shells have been soggy.
