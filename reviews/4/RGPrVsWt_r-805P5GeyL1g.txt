We ordered a selection of things and ended up loving the pork tamale (the masa was so light and amazing) and the ground beef empanada (the flavors were delicious).  The relleno "shell" is thicker than I normally like it but the sauce!  Oh, the sauce is divine and makes it so yummy.  The carne asada burrito was OK but very light-tasting flavor-wise.  And the rice was a very pleasant surprise - I'm not usually a big rice fan, but this was cooked perfectly and very light.  

The location is convenient, the owner is passionate and the server was very enthusiastic and friendly.  

We will definitely come again.  We want try the mole enchiladas and some additional empanadas next time.  

We used the Yelp coupon and paid $20 total for a bunch of food and waddled away very satisfied.
