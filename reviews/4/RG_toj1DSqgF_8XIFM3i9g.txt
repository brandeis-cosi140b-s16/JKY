I love that they have tofu tacos and a salsa bar on the side. What I don't like is that its pretty expensive for fast food. I know I spend way more here in comparison to Chipotle next door. I mean, if you're looking for a tasty burrito, this isn't the place. But, for some tofu tacos, I'll come here.
