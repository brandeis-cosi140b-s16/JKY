Susie's is fantastic. The Albondigas Soup is out of this world. They serve a mild and hot salsa with a complimentary basket of chips - both are outstanding. The beef tacos and cheese enchiladas are very good. I'm a big fan of Susie's! They've been there for over 20 years so they're doing something right!!!
