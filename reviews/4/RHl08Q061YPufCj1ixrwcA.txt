I've eaten here a few times.  Food is always really good.  Service staff is friendly.  Most of the time I get the green chile cornbread which is one of the best dishes on the menu.  I also got the shrimp tacos.  Flavor was great but I was turned off by the shrimp not being deveined.  Otherwise a 5 star.
