One of my new favorite places!  I have been 3 or 4 times now, service was great with the exception of this last trip.  I particularly love that they don't shy away from spice.  They fully embrace it which is fantastic since most places make things a lot less spicy.  We've had a few different item's all portions are generous, even the lunch portions and I haven't had anything we didn't totally love!
