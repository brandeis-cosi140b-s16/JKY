So either you like Taco Bell or you are a communist, so I won't waste any of this review trying to explain to you how awesome beefy 5 layer burritos are, I will just talk about this location.

Pros
- its basically always empty around 4th meal time so you never have to wait in line
-the staff seems to get only medium high while at work, compared to most taco bells where they get Greatful Dead concert level high- this results in a lot less screw ups in your order- yay for moderation. 
-the food comes out warm- not hot like a real big boy restaurant- but not the cold gross beans you get at many taco bells after 11 when they have long since stopped caring

Cons
-it is like a 2 minute drive further away than 2 other taco bells and my time is valuable- those Hello Ladies reruns aren't going to watch themselves
-I love Mountain Dew, mainly because I'm an extreme sports athlete- however I HATE baja blast. The Mountain Dew at this location always tastes a little Baja Blasty which sucks
