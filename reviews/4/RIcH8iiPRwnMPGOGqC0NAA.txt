Yeah it's another chain mexican type place but I'd say it's the best chain mexican type place out there.  I like this location for it's extra clean store and competent staff that didn't scowl, grunt, mumble or slouch while taking my order.

Lobster Burrito, $8.79, ugh, bad price, but great burrito, it's not all that big but it sure is tastey.
