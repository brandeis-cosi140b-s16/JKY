Some dishes are under $10...others slightly over.  Don't pass this place up!  I tried the Mahi Mahi Tacos, they were ok and just the right amount of food.  My husband had the Burrito Loco with Chicken.  He too thought there was just enough food and just at the right cost.  Paying extra for a side of guacamole (it was big enough for both of us to share), our dinner was about $25.  Not bad considering we asked for extra sides.
