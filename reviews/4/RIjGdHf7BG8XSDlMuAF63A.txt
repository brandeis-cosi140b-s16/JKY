My friend and I decided to eat here tonight for dinner after work, to grub on some hot carrots from their salsa bar.  I haven't been here before and thought it was an authentic Mexican restaurant, but once I got in, I realized it was more like a dive Mexican fast food joint, like Roberto's.  Their salsa bar was exactly like Roberto's as well.  

Please be advised, there's a lot stuff on their menu and nothing's worse than holding up the line because you're still deciding, so maybe getting hold of a take out menu or asking a friend prior to going so you know what you want.  This place fills up fast!

I got the Carnitas (pork) burrito for $4.75.  WELL WORTH THE PRICE.  Their burritos are HUGE!  This burrito is filled with guacamole, onions and cilantro.  The pork is crispy and soooo flavorful!  I was a huge fan.  I even told my friend that although the flavor is just like Roberto's, the one thing I've noticed is that as I bite into the burrito, I noticed that there is no dripping oil from the bottom, like Roberto's.  I was stoked!

The fact that the place filled up fast really proved how good the food was.  I know that there are more Roberto's restaurants out there, but quality always prevails over quantity.  Mexican food is probably the last thing I would choose to eat, but when I do, I know I will be choosing Fausto's again!!
