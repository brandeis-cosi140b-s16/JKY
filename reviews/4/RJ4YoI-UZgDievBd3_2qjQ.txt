Had the build your own combo, with the shredded beef enchilada, the chile relleno, and a shredded beef taco.  It came with spanish rice and refied beans.  

The food was good, taste was spot on for tex-mex which reminded me of Texas, and the service was quick, friendly and attentive.  Not the most exciting Mexican food I've had for sure, but for today, it was a good meal.
