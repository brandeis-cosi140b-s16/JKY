i luv how u can get pretty much everything u need for a carne asada grill session.  they got real hardwood charcoal for cheap.  i'm not really in2 sour cream, but the fresh creme con sal is so good i really have 2 stay away from the stuff or i'll go thru a tub a week.  they have a great selection of cheeses, ne kind of meat ur lookin 4 and they will put it in a marinade that tenderizes perfectly, fresh juices, salsas, and an awesome made-to-order deli.  if they have the bacon-wrapped hot dogs, highly recommended with the worx!  from the deli, i like pretty much about everything.  tortas to chile verde, tacos dorados to menudo.  

their produce is crazy cheap, but not the best i'll admit.  of course, if u're lookin for a one stop mexi-shop, this is the place.
