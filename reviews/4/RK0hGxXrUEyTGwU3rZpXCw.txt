We came here and ordered the steak and shrimp combo fajita plate. 
I want to give it a 3.5 star, because the flavor was above average, but the shrimp was tiny. It sorta reminded me of the frozen mini shrimp you buy int he bag, and just defrost. 

The grilled wings were actually good. They gave us the sauce on the side, so we could control how much we wanted. For grilled chicken wings, I think it was quite legit. 4.5 stars. 

I did love the layout and interior of the place, especially the draft beer section where you swipe a card and get a drink. I thought that would be fun with a group of people or even as a date. 

As for the nachos, I haven't tried it, and I'm not sure if I really like their method of using cheese that is melted in a pot (like velveeta) versus the real shredded cheese that's on top of nachos. So, I guess one day, I may try it, but because I'm particular about my nachos.

Service was a 5 star. I loved our server, and he was super fun to talk to. I think that was the highlight of our meal besides the good food. 

I give this place a 3.25 stars for their food. Service brought it up to a 3.5.
