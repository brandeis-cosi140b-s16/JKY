This is always a hit.  It's my go-to Mexican restaurant in the area, and the food never disappoints.  I wouldn't call it terribly unique, but the food is really, really solid and they have lots of great options.  I love the taco salads and enchiladas especially.

The one thing I can't figure out is their salsa strategy.  There are chips and two different types of salsa.  One is served in a little cup and is way too spicy for me.  The other (delicious salsa) is served in a carafe, so you have to pour it in something to use it.  Puzzling, but not a huge problem.  I definitely recommend Ajo Al's.
