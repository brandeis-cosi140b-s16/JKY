Worth the visit!  Go for  the  BBQ  Mahi Tacos.  Mine where loaded so it made the price for two wort it.  Had to finish with a fork it was so loaded.  It rivals Fish tacos from the west coast.  Vickie was a great host serving at the bar making great local Tap recommendations.  Next time I am in town I will definitely be eating there again.  It only gets loader as more guest come  in so go around 5:30 before the rush and you will be fine.
