I like this little place!  I love Mom and Pop restaurants.  I usually order either the sopes e carnitas, or gorditas.  I have tried a few other things on their menu like the shrimp cocktail, carnitas plate etc., but the gorditas and sopes are just good.  

For those of you who are wondering what a gorditas even is...its a corn tortilla "pita" pocket that is stuffed with protein of your choice, cheese, onions and cilantro.  Sopes are handmade corn tortilla dough "cups" that are fried, then topped with beans, protein, lettuce, tomato and cheese. Like a tostada but better.

This is not a fast food taco joint, so be patient, all the food is handmade by a gang of women in the kitchen!  Comida especial!

There is a very large color menu to help us gringos order with a wide range of choices!  Ala carte or plates...
