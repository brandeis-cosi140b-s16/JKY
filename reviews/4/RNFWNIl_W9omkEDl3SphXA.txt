My go-to for affordable, solid Mexican food. Whenever I've had a crap day and just want something hearty, and a little greasy, I stop by on the way home and pick up dinner for the whole fam, and an horchata for me. 

Everything I've gotten has been really delish -- especially the shredded beef. Maybe not the fish tacos. They were OK, but I would not get them again. 

I also walk out of there with probably 50 little containers of the various salsa, in different combinations.
