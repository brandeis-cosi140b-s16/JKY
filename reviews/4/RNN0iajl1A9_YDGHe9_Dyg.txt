Ahhh, El Pollo Loco. When I tell my coworkers I'm going there for lunch, they stare at me like I am a crazy person. Obviously, they have never been there.
First, let me offer a disclaimer *I ALWAYS GET THE SAME THING*. So the 2 piece combo (breast and wing) with sides of coleslaw and rice and flour tortillas is the only thing on the menu I can vouch for. But it is wonderful. I order that and LOAD UP on the spicy avocado salsa, which is amazing. Seriously, I could drink that stuff by itself. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. 
Anyway, I make my own little tacos with rice, coleslaw, their broiled chicken and avocado salsa. It never disappoints. 
The staff here has always been kind to me, and you can get in and out of there quickly, which makes it a nice lunch stop.
I gave four stars because I wish the restaurant was a little...newer? The bathroom has been closed for repairs a few times that I have been there, so maybe it's time to replace it or something? Either way, I will keep coming back.
