I really enjoy this place, its connected to Surf City Bar & Grill, aside from that your greeted by a very friendly staff once seated your given complementary homemade chips with a roasted red pepper salsa (yum). The menu is simple but if your looking for simple this is a great Mexican Cuisine Casual eatery for North Las Vegas. They do have a children's menu and the staff is very patient even with the most obnoxious little ones (my lil guy). My favorite is the Grilled Chicken Soft Tacos with Chipotle Tatar Sauce Muy Bueno! 

Recommend for a laid back atmosphere.
