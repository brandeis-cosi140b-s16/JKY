Let me start off by saying...I am Mexican.  The food was pretty good.  Homemade chips, taco shells.  The Mexican rice which is my specialty had flavor, which is rare for Mexican restaurants.  Reasonably priced, kid friendly and there were things on the menu for those family members that don't like Mexican.  A family of 4 ate for 24.00 including drinks.  Will definitely go back!
