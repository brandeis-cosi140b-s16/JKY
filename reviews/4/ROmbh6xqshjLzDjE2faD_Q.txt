This was Naugles when I was growing up. Although I miss them, Del Taco does an great job to accommodate you if you crave old menu items. Their new value menu is pretty darn special. I love the 1/2 bean and cheese burrito with green sauce ( I mean, do I really need any more than that? ha! ) And the mini bacon quesadilla was delicious. I love the fresh brewed Tetly, also. Face it. They are awsome in a pinch, late night drunk food, and early morning quick bite. Just try not to get to technical with special orders in the drive thru ; )
