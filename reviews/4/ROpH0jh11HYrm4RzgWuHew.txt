I was out in lovely Queen Creek, Arizona this past week visiting my brother and his fiance√©, and she noticed a coupon while perusing a recent free supermarket circular.

"Buy one burro... get second half off...HMMM!"

Not one to pass up the deal of a friggin lifetime, I snatched it from her along with her car keys and, though I am pretty crappy at driving a stick, made my way to JIM'S BURROS!!  A new Mexican spot right across "la calle" from the Queen Creek High School.

Once there, I looked over the menu.  GREAT PRICES!!  I got the breakfast burrito with cheese, chorizo (hot damn that stuff's good!), egg, and sour cream.  I love me some sour cream.  BUH-LEE-DAT!!

She managed to straggle in as well (she's a runner) and she order a white tamale and some burro (I dunno I wan't paying attention).  

They were ready in about cinco menudos.  AY DIOS MIO!!

It was good too.  And filling.  She had to have half of hers put in a doggy bag for later!  

the long and short of it???  Check out JIM'S BURROS the next time you find yourself in the QC!!
