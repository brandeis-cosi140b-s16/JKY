Popped in for a couple breakfast burritos with the wifey this morning. Good sized burritos with plenty of eggs, taters & bacon inside. The tortillas were cooked perfectly, where they're slightly golden brown & crispy.

My only complaint was the burritos seemed a little dry... A lil' sour cream on the inside would compliment them nicely.
