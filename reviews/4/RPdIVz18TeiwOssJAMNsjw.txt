One of our favorite spots! Service is kind of slow, but the delicious food always makes up for it! My boyfriend and I always start with table side guac and the ahi tuna tacos. For our entrees, I enjoyed the crab enchiladas and my bf the Chilean sea bass. The Mexican apple pie is a MUST HAVE! Overall, I say go!
