This food truck on what is mainly a parking lot on Buckeye Rd. near 7th Street serves really tasty, inexpensive  tacos to go or to eat at your leisure in the covered area next to the truck. The tacos come with fresh cucumber slices and a fried jalapeno and can be spiced up with the sauces that come in the standard plastic squirt bottles. I tried the asada, pastor, carnitas, and lengua tacos and they were all excellent. I also noted that while lengua tends to be on the dry side in most other taco places I've tried, La Hacienda takes the time to slow-braise the lengua so it comes out tender and juicy. This is one of the fastest and most inexpensive meals you can get in the near-downtown area.
