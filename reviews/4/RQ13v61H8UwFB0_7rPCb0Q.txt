happy hour from 12pm-7pm was the best on the south side of the strip! The waitresses are hot, the drink deals are top notch and every hour they change via 'The Wheel' which some cute girl spins. My boyfriend and I spent at least the first 1-3 hours of our afternoon here on several different days. 

I've seen other reviews from women on this place about being ignored at the bar or sitting without a refill. I think this is just jealousy, the waitresses are beautiful but I am a perfectly straight woman and I got great service here, every time!

Try the Calamari, for 12$, it's a meal for two!
