This place is the real deal. When you walk in it is very clean and has a really nice decor. They have different stations for meats burritos, etc. 

I tried several tacos the carne asada, carnitas, and al pastor. The best was the carne asada. We got a side of chips and guac which were plain and it turned brown pretty fast. We obviously had to try the street corn. I don't even like corn and it was sooooo good. cheesy and a little spice YUM YUM! 


There really isn't anything to comment about the service because they don't really wait on you after you leave the food stations. It is also pretty nice that they have a bar there.
