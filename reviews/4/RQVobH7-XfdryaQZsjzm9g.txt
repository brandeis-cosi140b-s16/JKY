Here on business and drive past this old church morphed into an absolutely wonderful space for having a taco and a beer. No this is not your neighborhood taco vendor. The space is beautiful, I would live there if possible. Sunday has some specials so look at the web site for more info. Do look at "events" too hint hint. 
Started with the taco of the day which was a crispy catfish taco. WELL DONE taco guild well done! On to the Al Pastor....yes again a winner! Finally rounded out by the cherry beef something or other taco and this one owns the crown for tacos. Habanero straws, great tender beef, blue cheese.... Hells yes !!! I may update to full 5 stars but I need more exposure
