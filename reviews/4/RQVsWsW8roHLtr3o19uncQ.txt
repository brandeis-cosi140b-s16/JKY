We really enjoyed this place.  Not curbside appeal or interior ambiance but no great Mexican restaurant I've ever dined at has. Outstanding service in terms of friendliness which made up for some of the forgetfulness.  Good chips but salsa needs to be much spicier as it is a little amateurish :-). My food was outstanding. Rudy, the owner, stopped by our table to say high and he was very friendly and interesting. I'd return.
