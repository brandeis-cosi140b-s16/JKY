Want to grab a quick lunch and afraid of inconsistency, this place is it.  

We arrived at 12pm for lunch and yes, there was a line, but the line moved super quick.  The ingredients were fresh.

I had the barbacoa burrito, and I could only finish half of this.  It was huge!  The barbacoa meat was tender, but not as flavorful as I would have liked it.  If you are on a low carb diet, you could also get the bowl, which is everything inside of the burrito, minus the tortilla.  The price is reasonable as well.
