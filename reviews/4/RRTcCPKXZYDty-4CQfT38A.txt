Great little fast food place. They don't use any lard in any of their food or animal products in the rice. I ordered a veggie taco with beans, rice, lettuce and tomato. Each order comes with chips and they have numerous salsas to choose from on their salsa bar. I ordered a single taco which came wrapped in two corn tortillas. It was so full I was actually able to make two tacos! They offer wheat, corn, and flour tortillas to suit dietary needs and preferences. Thanks for being VEGAN friendly!
