This is the bomb! As I'm typing this I'm thinking of there pico de gallo and carne asada burrito.  It is a simple but family feel burrito shop.  I usually go there during lunch time and the staff is always friendly and polite. All of the ingredients are very fresh and the beans I'm told are made daily.

For me, mexican food from a small shop has been a drunken late night pick up or something for a snack because it was always too greasy, but this place isn't like that.  There pico de galo is the BEST!! I hate tomatoes if that makes any sense but I can eat this stuff for days. 

When you get a chance check place out.
