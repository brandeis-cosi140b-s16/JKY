Consistently good service.   Food is always good too.  We stop here on our way to and from Tucson several times a year.   They serve Sonoran style food,  as is typical in Arizona,  and they do it right!  Their salsa is the BEST!!!  I mean it, best I've had in 40 years of eating out in the southwest.  I just love the right amount of onion and cilantro,  and Macayo's is perfect!  Beware though,  if you purchase the bottled stuff they have for sale, it is NOT the same and not any better than any other store bought salsa (which none of,  in my opinion, are worth buying).  It's a great small chain of restaurants.
