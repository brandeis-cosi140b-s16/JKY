Another great addition to the Yard. Modern, funky takes on traditional Mexican food. Lots of heat,  lots of heart in every dish,  plated in controlled portions and accompanied by one of the best guacamole bowls I've ever had.  Make sure you get at least 1, the ingredients will delight! Wait staff were wonderful; great recommendations of tequila, efficient service in spite of a late sitting, and plenty of funky decorative touches made it a great dining experience.  Get in there.
