Came here for lunch and ordered the tostada with carne asada instead of chile verde. It was good! The meat was tender and full of flavor...it was layered with black beans, meat and had lettuce, red onions and tomato on top, it also came with a side of chipotle cream sauce. I would have liked some avocado and maybe Mexican cream but I think I'll ask next time. My friends ordered the tacos and a torta, there weren't any complaints and we all finished every bite! The waiter was very friendly he even asked if we wanted waters for the road since it was extremely hot! Such a nice touch. Overall I was happy, it can be a bit pricey (the tostada didn't come with any sides) but for the quality I think it's worth it. I am going to check them out on a night out or weekend, the margaritas looked amazing and I heard him say everything was fresh.
