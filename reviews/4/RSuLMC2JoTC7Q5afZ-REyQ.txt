Consistent quality home-style Mexican food with fair prices and a reliable staff.  #2 Cheese enchilada and Beef Taco w/ rice and beans and a large drink for under $10, and I am recognized and greeted as a regular customer: muy bueno!

While this location is part of the largest franchise of home-style Mexican food restaurants in the Las Vegas valley (apparently overtaking or inheriting Roberto's locations ), this location is remarkable because of the people that work there. They are always __-patient-__ , friendly, and polite. I've witnessed people order and change their mind then be undecided etc blah blah blah. One thing is certain: I would never be able to do their job, I would scare more customers away than I served. These people at this location are very good at customer service. 

I hope anybody who reads this review and visits this restaurant places a buck or two in the tip jar knowing most people are just too cheap to recognize the good people who make the good food and have to put up with the snot-nosed El Lay princesses in their unwashed hair and flip flops.

I wonder what it is about Las Vegas that brings out the classless, entitled behavior we have all witnessed.
