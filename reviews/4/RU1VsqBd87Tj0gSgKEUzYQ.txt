Coming from P-Town (Placentia 714) I am accustomed to decent Mexican food at average prices.

The girls and I were staying at the Stratosphere and after a hard morning of drinking we wandered down to the restaurant level on our way up to the Observation Deck.  After grimacing at over priced McDonald's and cringing at the scent of hot dogs and pastrami we found El Nopal tucked in the corner. 

 I was pleased to find that the food was decently priced as this was a total budget weekend for me.  The three of us opted to split shredded chicken nachos which we devoured.  I've never encountered nachos where you have more "stuff" than chips and these were them.  We also ordered a side of rice in hopes of soaking up some of the booze in our bellies and it was actually really tasty.  I think the three of us were satisfied for about $8.  Woo!  

The next morning we rolled, bleary eyed, out of bed and all we could mumble was "eggs, bacon, breakfast burritos..."  My two eggs and bacon and a Nerga Modelo was under $10.  The eggs were cooked well and the bacon was gloriously greasy.  Throw in some toast and hash browns and I was almost human again.  Vanessa R. said the tacos were sub par and other non-Yelper friend said the burrito was ca-ca, but I wasn't grading too hard I suppose. 

I will gripe about how long it takes just to place your order.  Both visits in a 36 hour period began with us watching the lone cook work the griddle while we waited for someone else to appear to take our order. We got no "be right with you" or "just a sec' which goes a long way with me.  It also a shame there is so little seating.  Whenever we walked by the place looked packed and before I had put my napkin in my plate a woman was breathing down my neck like a vulture.  Also too bad they close pretty early.

Next time I stay at the Strat I'll stop by and see if this was the booze talking or just the prices...
