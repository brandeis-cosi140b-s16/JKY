I love this place... the atmosphere is kinda trashy but what do you expect from a place that is open until 4 am and frequented by the drinkers of madison?!
The food is good... You get a ton of it at a great price... they have Mexican beer and a bunch of different types of margaritas, which are pretty good :)
The servers there are also super friendly, which says a lot since I am sure that they have to deal with a lot of trash.
If you are in the area and have a hankering for some Mexican, it is worth the stop
