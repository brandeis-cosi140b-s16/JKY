Burrito the size of my head? Yes please! That's exactly what you will get here as the portions are HUGE! I was so excited to find a traditional Mexican restaurant in Charlotte, especially down the street from me. I love me some dirty Mexican food and when I say dirty I don't mean gross. I mean the down home loving traditional Mexican joints where you order a number 1-10! And that's exactly what Don Pedro's is. The food is awesome and I've always had a great experience. 

My favorite is the chicken burrito (house special), two taco combo or the chicken fajitas. Yes I've been here a lot ;-) All of them have been awesome. The food is always steaming as it comes to your table and the servers are great- however there have been a few times we've had slow service, but the food made up for it. Hence why I gave this a 4 star review instead of a 5.
