You betcha previous reviewers! Oh so good!Oh so weird!Oh so politically  incorrect name and Panda Bear decor, But that's half the fun!  The black beans are great. They have the best snickerdoodles I ever had out of a bakery. Beware your stomach may get upset, if it tends to be sensitive. The food can be a bit greasy depending on what you order.
