We finally made it out to Chevy's after having their chips and salsa at many an event with our friends.  As always, they were pretty good - tasted way more fresh than the chips at El Toro/Dos Reales.  I ordered a steak quesadilla and it was huge and awesome.  I've been craving another one ever since we went!  My husband got something called the Chevy spread?  I dunno, something like that, but it had all kinds of enchiladas and stuff with it and he said it was good - even the corn frittery thing that was on the side.  Looking forward to going back.
