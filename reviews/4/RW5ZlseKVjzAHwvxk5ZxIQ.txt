My wife and I are from California, and when we were looking for a place to have breakfast, we found this whole in the wall that we fell in love with. They do the best Huevos Rancheros and carne Asada tacos. Really reasonable prices and their service is decent. I will recommend coming here if you want to have Mexican food and don't want to spend so much money on the strip.
