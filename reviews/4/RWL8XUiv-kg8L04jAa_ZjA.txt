I love chipotle! I officially give up on online ordering from this location due to past experiences of it never being ready, but its not like I'm gonna stop eating here its like my favorite yummmm! Sucks I have to do pick up orders for different locations when I wanna stop in a rush and run in and out on my way to work to have a delicious burrito for my lunch, but can't afford to be held up! Dinner on my way home, I can handle waiting on from here though! ;)
