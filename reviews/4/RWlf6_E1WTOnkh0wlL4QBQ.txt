I just ate here last night with some gal pals and we were all in agreement that this place is great. Walking in you can hear the live music and you can see almost the entire restaurant. The band playing when we were there was just perfect for this place, mostly guitars and just mellow tunes but they also played some salsa. I forget their name (sorry), they came in from SF... 

After about a 10 min wait we were seated in the main dining area near the band. The decor is beautiful! I haven't been during the day but at night the lights are very low with plenty of mood lighting. The music was playing at just the right level so that you could only hear the conversation at your own table which was nice.  

I shared the chicken burrito, which proved to be a good idea when I saw the portion size. The chicken was flavored very well and the burrito was very good. A friend had the shrimp and mango spinach salad, the server did warn that it was spicy and she was very right! We didn't get to try the drinks this time but are planning to go back soon and try a few more things!
