Coming from the best Mexican restaurants in Chicago, we've been searching for a place in AZ that can match that standard. This place is GREAT! Service is attentive, decor is hip, music is bumping. Levi gave us great recommendations of green chili chicken and steak tacos. The steak was perfect! Cheese match ups were delicious! Steak quesadilla was so, so good with the beet cream sauce. Their red salsa was enough spice and heat. Only reason why they didn't get 5 stars is because the drinks were serviceable and not wow. We'd make this place our weekly spot if we lived here.
