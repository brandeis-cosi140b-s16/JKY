It's "TAPAS," not "TOPLESS."

This restaurant located at the corner of W. Charleston and Desert Foothills opened on November 1st, brought to us by the same group who run John Cutter right next door.  
I enjoy tapas places because you get to sample lots of small plates, ordering more of those you like.  It's a mini-buffet that comes to your table.

Our group of four ordered:
-bacon wrapped dates:  unlike another tapas place in town, these are really dates wrapped in bacon.  The dates are not stuffed with anything except their own sweetness.  Solid.
-meatballs:  I needed a dish with more protein, so I ordered these.  Nothing spectacular.
-bread and butter:  carbs!  
-oxtail:  my favorite dish of the night, which I only had to share with one friend.  I could have had another order all to myself.  Fall-off-the-bone meat and a nice sauce to go with it.
-ahi:  I'm allergic to fish, so I only looked at this.  The friends liked it.
-garlic shrimp:  I had one.  Nothing special.
-asparagus:  this was another winner for me.  The grilled spears tasted great.
-croquetas:  deep-fried cream cheese, bechamel sauce, and ham (I think)--what's not to like?  I liked.
-manchego cheese:  served in three chunks with some toasted bread on the side.  I like this cheese, but wish it had been sliced for us, or at least give us a cheese slicer so we can do it ourselves.
-Serrano ham:  too salty, but that's just me.
-flan:  YUM!  The sauce has cinnamon in it.  My pal could have done without the cinnamon, but I loved it.

I also had a glass of the red sangria, which was not too strong, just the way I like it.
Our server, Omar, was very attentive the whole night and the food came out very quickly.
The bar in the middle of the room has video poker machines and there are several flat screen TVs throughout the restaurant, so this is a great place to come and watch sports in a non-smoking environment and with good food that isn't your typical bar fare.
Overall, a great time was had by all.  It's a welcome addition for the locals who live in the neighborhood and we'll definitely be back.
