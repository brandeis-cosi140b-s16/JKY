The decor and style of this place made me think that their menu was going to be the complete opposite. Surprisingly it was not. The atmosphere was great. The only complaint I have is that the tables are too small. 

Food:

We had the chips and salsa with fresh guacamole. The guacamole was awesome. We had the calamari as an appetizer and this dish was rock solid. It had a sweet spicy sauce with mandarin oranges and it was superb. The squid was cooked to perfection. I had the smoked short rib and my friend had the chipotle shrimp. The short rib was so tender that you did not need a knife. The shrimp had a great flavor over a bed of rice. Both dishes were awesome. For dessert we had the mango madness and mexican crepes. Mango ice cream with a mango custard.Crepes with walnuts and caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream.I liked the mango but the crepes did not really wow me. We should have gotten the chocolate flour less cake.

Service:

Warm and friendly. Our server was always checking up on us. I would give her a B+ for effort.

This is a awesome place to start any evening. The food is good and the price is not too overwhelmingly high. For a strip property. You cannot beat this place.
