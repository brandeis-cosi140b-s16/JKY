Taking my oldest son to airport before holidays. Wanted to stop and eat before his flight. I seen lots of corporate resturants. Drove past I could smell the rich smell of authentic mexican food. Sign read that it had been in business for like 40 or 50 years. I didn't have to see yelp to know this was gonna be good, this just validated consistent good quality. I think they deserve four stars. Was suprised by price. But the food more then made up for it. Chips and salsa good. They are spicy loved it. They made sure to offer you refills or a extra pitcher to hold at you table. Ordered two tacos no tomato, with cheese enchallada rice and beans. The shredded beef tacos did not have a crazy fried shell crisp. More of a corn shell crisp tasked baked. Meet fresh and flavorful. And no tomatoes .thx! Rice was fresh didn't try beans. Enchallada sauce was wonderful. Grew up near mexico in San Diego. Best mex I have had in three years. On my way made small talk with cashier hostess. She said with pride the story of this family business. My wait for my serve was quick and the place was packed. I was excited that many people can't be wrong. If im in the area I will come back. Happy holidays.
