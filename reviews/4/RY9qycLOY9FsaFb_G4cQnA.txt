Maybe I got there on the wrong days and nights, but I have never found the employees friendly or helpful. Our server and the 
manager were more like automatons than people. Maybe it is because I am 61 and not in their age group. Most places make an effort to greet you and/or learn your name. Not here. Still, the food is fresh and delicious and the TV or music is not blaring. I will continue to eat here but will buy a dog for friendship.
