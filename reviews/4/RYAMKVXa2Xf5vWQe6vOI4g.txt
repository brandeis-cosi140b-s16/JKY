The Hard Rock Hotel has this sweet little cantina, the Pink Taco. Its down the hall from the gaming rooms and kind of next door to 35 Steaks and Martinis.

A hipster Mexican bar, the Pink Taco is a hot spot filled with cool decor from low rider bikes to hub cap lights, to an awesome bar that is the tower of tequila. Additional Dia de los Muertos curios as well as OG Mexican wrestling swag adorns this hot pink spot. Think Luche Libre with mas tequila. 

While I didn't get to partake in any of the food the Pink Taco offers but I did sample a couple of the tequila masterpieces. 

Enter the Cadillac. They drove two of those bad boys right into my living room. The Don Julio Silver, Triple Sec, lime, lemon sour, and Grand Marnier started my engines up right. Like a "72 Eldorado coup de ville rag top with twice pipes. Those caddy's were drop top cool baby.

Then I saw it. The Chupacabra. The elusive blood sucking beast of the night came to do me in. The Don Julio Blanco, lime juices, jalapenos, ginger beer, and some chili salt to lick off the rim. This was one cool hot drink! The pepper had the right amount of bite to make you crave another. Viva Chupcabra!

The Pink Taco is a cool spot to start up your hot night at the Hard Rock.

I'll be back.
