A small place right in the main hub of downtown Fremont St. This place serves tasty Mexican street food, but pricey due to a hot spot location. The burritos are $9 and you get to pick what kind of stuff do you want in it. They even let me put both carne asada and carnitas (i really wanted al pastor, but they ran out) meat mixed in for no extra charge, but wanted to charge more if I pick more than one hot sauce. It tasted good. Their Carne Asada Fries are bomb and is definitely the thing to get! No wonder the fries cost the most ($12). It must be the added nacho cheese that made it tasted better than the burritos. The food here is pretty spicy if you choose the hot option, but nothing painfully.
