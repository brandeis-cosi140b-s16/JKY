The food's greasy and really isn't a good combination with alcohol unless you have a really good book in the bathroom.

Nevertheless I still crave the chicken salad once in a while.  I would get it with all the fix'ns:  chihuahua cheese, peppers, sour cream, avocado (not guac... avocado :) ), extra hot sauce... (which they make fresh, btw) 

I never thought that I'd miss this place, but man I do.  I've had few dishes at any Mexican place that I've enjoyed as much as their chicken salad.

Oh and if you do get the chicken salad, get it to go.  You get waaaaay more.
