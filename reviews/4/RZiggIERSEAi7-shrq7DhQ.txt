I'm glad we made a reservations!  On Wednesday at 8:30pm it was packed, which is a good sign!  We were greeted right away and were taken downstairs to their cozy basement (or cellar I should say).  It is very inviting with wooden ceilings and rafters with alluring stone fireplaces and leather lounge chairs.  I felt like I should be drinking scotch or bourbon down there!  We were seated by our waiter who was quite charming considering the full bar of people chattering away.  I should also note, we were placed in a great spot in the corner where you could observe the busy room or simply enjoy your company as if we were in a room to ourselves.  

We ordered two glasses of wine, and the Mushroom Brie Toast to start.  The toast was pretty unique and tasty, with a variety of mushrooms piled on perfectly toasted French bread with the perfect amount of cheese laced atop. For an entree I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad with a soy vinaigrette.  It was good, with a healthy portion of perfectly cooked ahi, but the salad was kind of boring to me (mixed greens and tomatoes).  The vinaigrette was a bit on the soy-y side for me too...Yes I know that is what the dressing is called; I just expected something a bit more exciting and less salty.  

My date had the NY strip.  It was prepared to temperature and covered in mushrooms, which we probably should have thought of pairing with and alternate appetizer...I think he had his fill of mushrooms for a month hahah!  But it was good nonetheless.  The asparagus was was gone first, so I am assuming it was delicious and the mashed potatoes (came in a little pot on the side) were just kind of boring.  Personally, I would have served the potatoes on the plate with the steak to soak up the wonderful au jus!  

All in all we had a wonderful evening, in a great atmosphere, with great service and good food.  I would recommend it and I will be back!
