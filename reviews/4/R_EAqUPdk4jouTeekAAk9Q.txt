We have eaten here 5 times over the last 30 years -- the first 25 of these, I was living in Los Angeles and would come in with relatives who lived in Chandler. The last 5 years, we've seen a steady improvement in the decor and atmosphere, but the same exceptionally prepared dishes that I enjoyed on the first visit. We love the bean dip, salsa, and endless chips that precede the main course. We've tried the fajitas, and various combinations of enchiladas, tamales, chili rejano that were just delicious -- spicy enough, without overpowering the slow-cooked, meaty aromatic qualities of this food prepared the way it was originally intended. Never a bad experience with the food. One visit was a little noisy from one child sitting in the booth next to ours who sounded like a whole group of kids yelling at once. Besides that, we've always had a great time, truly attributed to the great service and friendly servers.
