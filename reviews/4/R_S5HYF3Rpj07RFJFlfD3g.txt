Drove out to this  restaurant/saloon for lunch. Beautiful drive..very scenic. Slow and winding so keep in mind. Lots of tourist folks hanging around...but sat at the bar on a couple of saddles. Walls covered with dollar bills and currency from all over the world. Pulled pork BBQ sandwich with fries and a couple of 'Mule Oil' draws...ok for a lighter brew. Service fast...Karen is a character, but handles the crowd with a great attitude. Would recommend.
