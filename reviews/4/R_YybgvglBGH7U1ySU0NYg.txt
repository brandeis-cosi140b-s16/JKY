On my way thru the airport getting back from business travel, I had to stop and grab my favorite burrito. The flavors are so fresh. I just wish the employees were a bit more friendly like the guy that helped med here the first day I found this place. This is the second time I've run into a sarcastic person behind the counter at the airport location. But the food is soooooo good.
