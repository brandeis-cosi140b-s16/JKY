Okay, okay... It's not Gallo anymore.. I was heartbroken, too. 

I had my reservations about going here, due to the spotty reviews and everyone saying it just wasn't the same... 

It isn't the same.. However, it wasn't awful. The main thing I miss about Gallo was the shrimp and grits, and the fried cheese thing, but hey, I can burn cheese in a pan at home. So out with the old, and in with the new. 

Downside: The bar area with the black walls, DEPRESSING. Put some artwork up, it's a bar, not a funeral. Also, the bar tender could try to smile once in a while, if your job is that awful man, don't do it. 

Upside: The fish torta, my new favorite, and I really love the El Jefe, so grumpy pants bartending gets a few extra points because that drink is outstanding... 

So give Tranquilo a whirl!
