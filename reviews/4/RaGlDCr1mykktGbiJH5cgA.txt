drunkin chicken nachos .... a MUST !!! I have been here a few times and every visit is better then the time before! food Is great , fun environment and awesome staff!!!!! when you are in the mood for good Mexican I recommend trying it.... 

assume rent is high in a place like Planet Hollywood... pricey mexican american food in a casino so thus the 4... 

still think the drinks are awesome and the bartenders are actually knowledgeable so I try to revisit them when in PH
