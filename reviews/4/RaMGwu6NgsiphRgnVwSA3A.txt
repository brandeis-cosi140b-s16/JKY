Chips poco and  green salsa with beef. Open air and AC inside. Drink good

This is right across the street from The Wigwam.  the food was good, you got a lot of it, and the cost was very reasonable.  I got Chips poco and green salsa with beef.  They were not too spicy.  The marguerite was excellent.

Considering they were hosting a large bridal party, they were very attentive to a single diner.  I got everything I needed or requested very promptly..  Definitely worth the money.
