What can I say about Chipotle?  Chipotle is kind of weird, it's like if In-N-Out burger sold burritos.  It's one of those places that isn't everywhere.  If you have one then you'll find yourself there every once and awhile.  I really like Chipotle even though I only get one thing there.  Yes, ONE item off the menu!  I get steak tacos, soft, a little bit of pinto beans, mild salsa, hot salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce "animal style." LOL, jk.  Yeah, that's what I get all the time ever!  I know you are probably thinking that Ernesto is so cool, I should try and order that too. Go ahead and try it and you can thank me later.  To sum it up even if there is a line they move pretty fast and there is always meats available.  So check it out and enjoy! Cheers!
