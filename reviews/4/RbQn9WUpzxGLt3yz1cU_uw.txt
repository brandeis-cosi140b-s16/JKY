Pepe's is on a small list of taco chains in Vegas that I enjoy visiting.

Most of my encounters with Pepe's follow alcohol consumption (something beautiful about that sequence btw,) but I think I would  still enjoy Pepe's on its own.

I am a fan of the carnitas, lengua, and birria.

The food is good, but the value is great!
