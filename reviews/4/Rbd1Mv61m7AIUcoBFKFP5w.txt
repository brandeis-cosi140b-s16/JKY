Very busy and crowded restaurant for lunch. Went with a group and needed to get orders to go in order to make it back on time from a one hour break, Long line, staff moves very fast. Colleague said her enchilada was cold. I ordered the salad with a very fresh, homemade tortilla bowl. Salmon was seasoned well over the salad. Lots to choose from, very filling meal, decent prices. Outdoor dining in great spot with lots of surrounding shops.
