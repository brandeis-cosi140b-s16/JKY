In a city full of crappy fast food chains, its refreshing to walk into a friendly place with a unique offering that tastes good and won't leave you feeling like a McFatass afterwards. The meats are delicious and if you haven't been there before, they'll probably offer you a taste of a few so you'll know what to get. The portions are good and they are super friendly. You can tell they try hard to show that they appreciate your business which is why many people there were regulars. 

My wife is a total food snob and would never imagine going to any fast food place besides In-n-out (gets 'em every time, doesn't it?) When we walked in, her first question was, "is this fast food?" I mumbled something about giving it a chance. Well, we did and we both liked what we got and will definitely be back to try other items on the menu.
