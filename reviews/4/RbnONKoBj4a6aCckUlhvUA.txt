I guess looks really are deceiving sometimes. Pancho's is hidden away in a small shopping center, and put together as if the decoration process was abandoned before opening. Don't let any of that scare you away though, this place stands out where it matters most: the food.

Everything seems very fresh here, the corn and flour tortillas are all hand made and delicious.  They don't seem to advertise this, but they should because their tortillas are better than most tortilla factory restaurants I've been to. Fresh tortillas being the key to a great Mexican dish, it's no surprise that the food is quite exceptional. It's not the best I've had anywhere, but it's certainly the freshest and best tasting taqueria style food I've had in Las Vegas. 

My only real gripe is the chips and salsa. The tortillas are good, but when fried, they make chips that are thick and kinda hard. The three salsas that were served tasted pretty bland. About half way through our meal we asked if there was a hotter salsa available and they brought us a really good molcajete style sauce that was spicy and full of flavor. I definitely can recommend this sauce, but you have to request it.

So far, I've tried the chicken chilaquiles, tacos, and burritos and all were great. Definitely will be coming back!
