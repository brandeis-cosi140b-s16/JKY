This location is just , ..........OK. To add to the 24hr drive thru comment everyone is leaving , they sinply forgot to say its only open 24hr on Fri,Sat and Sundays. So its really not open 24hr a day ... Just the three days which im not sure why but all the other bertos are open 24hr 7days a week 365 year. Not the best when it comes to getting orders right either i think its because the drive thru person taking orders and working the window sinply does not pay attention probably because they are too busy with the young children as workers. Im sorry when you are at work please stop texting on your phone and work ,Its called your on the clock for a reason and its called a job .... Anyhow they just opened this location and its progressively getting better i might add... And yes i live in the area of melrose and glad to have a location super close.
