Viva Salsa is in the heart of Boulder Station.  It's a small little place that is easy to navigate.  We got to the restaurant and there wasn't a line at all.  Now, for those who haven't read my other reviews should know that I eat Ultra Low Carb during the week.  So, I won't eat the tortillas, chips etc...  It wasn't a problem here though.  I ended up having a tortilla-less carne asada burrito.  It was really good and filling.  My sister and her husband were raving about their burritos as well.  They liked them so much they went back and ordered two more to take home.  The atmosphere is really laid back.  A few high tables that overlook the casino and the Kixx Bar.  It's a good place to relax and people watch, if that is what you are into.  Because there are definitely a cast of characters that tend to walk around this casino.  But, that is for a different review.

*side note: I was taking a ration of crap from my relatives in tow.  They were saying "you're not one of those guys that takes pictures of your food are you?"  So, out of my new insecurity I only got pictures of the front of the place and not my food.  So, next time I go, and there will be a next time, I'll grace you with a picture.

I say, a job well done and I'll be back as it is relatively close to home.
