I recently stopped by this establishment and was very surprised at the quality of the cuisine. When we stepped in there was a huge pot of meats simmering away while an open prep kitchen showed just how much pico de gallo this place must run through. 

The set-up is a lot like a fast casual restaurant and the menu is posted on the wall. Simply pick a option and customize it with meat/rice/beans/veggies/salsa and voila! Deliciousness. 

I ordered the 3 steak tacos with corn tortillas while the fella got a steak torta. The tacos were amazing and I love how they heat up the tortillas before they proceed. I would definitely get these again and don't shy away from the spicy, pickled onions. Completely amazing.

The bite of torta I had seemed a little lackluster - I have had others that I preferred more but that's a personal thing. The prices are great and definitely worth it for the freshness and character that each dish possesses. 

I would definitely recommend this place to any looking for an incredibly cheap-eat and tasty option. Also, they serve fountain soda, blended drinks, and beer. Perfect.
