This place was amazing from the rice to the enchiladas salsa verde to the corn on the cob elotes I believe it was called. But yeah me and my boyfriend wanted some good Mexican food and we heard nacho daddy was some weird white people twist on Mexican food so we were not down for that haha. But thanks to the ever wonderful yelp we found this place!!! It's very small but the food is delicious and I didn't have anything that I didn't like. My only complaint is that I wish their menu was bigger and the prices weren't so high. But other than that this place is definitely worth trying and even though I'm a little cheapo it's worth the money too. Support this local business and give it a try they definitely deserve it.
