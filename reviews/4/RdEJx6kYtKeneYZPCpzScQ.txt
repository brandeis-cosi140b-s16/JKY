Wandered in after visiting Mob Museum and so glad we did!  Smoky Latin food with incredible depth of flavor.  We had the tortilla soup and burrito bowl, which were both exceptional.  In addition, Ancho rubbed chicken wings were fantastic.  Add Mexican craft beer selection and top shelf margaritas, and this is reason enough to head downtown for lunch
