I tried this restaurant for the first time a few days ago.  Although they have not been open a long time and much of the building is not used yet the dining room was very nicely done and the service was fast and friendly.  The food tasted great, was hot and did have a homemade flair to it.  I would recommend this as a good home style alternative to a lot of the chain Mexican joints.
