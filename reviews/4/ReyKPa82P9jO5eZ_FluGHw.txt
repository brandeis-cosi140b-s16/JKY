Good food -- a bit pricey for the portion sizes but all prepared well. Meat dishes like the Hanger Steak Asada and osso bucco contained tasty prepared meat that was very tender to the fork and deliciously prepared vegetables and potato on the side. The seafood dishes like the sauteed shrimp and scallops and seafood paella also contained nice large juicy pieces of seafood, although only a few pieces. The rice on the paella as surprisingly flavorful although a little wet. The crema catalana I tried was also prepared very nicely with a crunchy caramelized sugar top over tasty custard that wasn't too thick and tempered with just the right amount of citrus. Overall, the food texture, temperature, and flavor was great -- however the small portion sizes for the price make me hesitant to award the final star.
