I love Mexican food and dishes. The GF and her daughter don't care too much for it though. The end result is I don't get to enjoy Mexican food too often but I found a perfect loophole. 

I just say "hey sweetie my car is dirty and needs a full wash inside and out" this gives me at least 20 minutes to drop off my car at the gas station for a full service car wash/detail/and fuel up. Once done I head inside and place an order for some of the best, top notch Mexican food on this side of Vegas.

Being a Gringo I normally like ground beef tacos and don't like the shredded beef ones but here the shredded beef is perfectly seasoned and grilled to ordered on an Iron Flat top. They throw the onions and peppers on the grill and that fuses all the flavors together with the meat. Simply stated its delicious.

The enchiladas and the sauce is damn good as well. Probably 2nd in Vegas. (There is a hole in the wall dive place in south Vegas that beats them in my opinion but that's about it). 

Only downside to this place is that its an express and shares space with a gas station. Seating/parking can be minimal especially on the weekends when everyone is getting a car wash/ fuel but by paying for that full service car wash your car is in their hands for at least 20 mins and that is plenty of time to get your food cooked and consumed before leaving with a near spotless vehicle.

It may seem weird to go to a gas station for a taco but trust me its worth it!
