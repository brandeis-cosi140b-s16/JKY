Tucked away behind a bridal store and tuxedo rental shop in a little Mexican themed strip mall on the East Side of Madison, is a wonderfully authentic Mexican restaurant called Taqueria Sabor Queretano. They just got a new printed menu today, my first time trying this business out.

My husband and I ordered the menudo soup and lengua taco. I ordered a horchata drink - think Big Gulp sized! ($3).  My lengua taco was $2, and it was actually big enough to make into two tacos with the double tortillas we received.  The menudo soup is also a hearty portion size - we had to ask for the "small" size ($7), otherwise, it would have been large enough to feed at least two, likely three people. 

The service provided by our waiter, Mario, was good. I think Mario was the only waiter in the shop who speaks English - the owner/chef seemed to rely upon him for translation when I'd asked how long they had been open.  He said three years now. Wow, that's a long time to be open and not yet have a yelp review.   All the customers who walked in were from the neighborhood.

I will definitely be coming back here again - food was great. Ambience was decent - a flat screen TV plays telenovelas in the background, a huge fan to cool us down from the heat of the food, and cases and cases of jarritos piled high up against the walls for storage.  But everything was clean, people were friendly, and the food was seemingly authentic.

there's a grocery store next door - La Hispana - that sells limited produce, household things, rotisserie chicken, boxed horchata, etc.
