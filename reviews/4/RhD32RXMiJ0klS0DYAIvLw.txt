The place is simple and homie. The place needs a TV or some sort of entertainment because the wait for the food takes a while to prepare because it is authentic Mexican homemade. They should also provide a salsa bar and chips to munch on while the food is prepared. I didn't see any chunky salsa, just the traditional red and green. The drinks were not given to us when we ordered, but when the food was ready. The staff was friendly. The food was good and reasonably priced. The place was clean. I'm not sure if there are refills on drinks. Next time, I am going to call the order in, and then go pick it up.
