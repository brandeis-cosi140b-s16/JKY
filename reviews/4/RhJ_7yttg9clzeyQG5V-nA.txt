This place is beautiful! And it has a great patio, as well as a great open-air room that isn't really a patio, but isn't really inside -- basically, this is a great place to come with your friends for a drink after work or on a lazy Sunday. Which is what I did yesterday.

We sat down outside, were promptly given some water and our drinks (I had the white sangria, which wasn't quite as good as I had hoped it would be, but it was only $5 and it was tasty). Then we had some chips and salsa -- if the salsa here is any indication of what the food tastes like, then it gets good reviews from me. The big bowl of typical salsa was OK, but the two little containers they gave us were way better -- one was a tangy green salsa, the other was a spicy "chile arbol." They were really complex, compared to what generally passes as salsa at big Mexican restaurants around here.
Service was great, too.
Can't wait to come back here.
