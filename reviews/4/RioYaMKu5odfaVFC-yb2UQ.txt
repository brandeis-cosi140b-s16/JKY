After about a year of the guys at work insisting that I go, I finally went.
 
Foremost, our waitress was really nice. A great waiter/waitress can usually make or break a restaurant experience. She did a great job taking care of us. Although the sun was shinning in my eyes half of the time, the environment was still pleasant. The music was just loud enough to hear but not so loud to have to talk over it and the dining area was roomy. The food wasn't the best food I've ever tasted but it was still worth the experience.
 
Cornbread - Amazing. You'll find little pieces of corn while you eat. It's literally corn and breading. It's the way cornbread should be.
Bottomless basket of chips and three salsas - The chips were pretty good and while the salsas had a lot of flavor to offer my mouth they just weren't as great as I was hoping.
Wild mushroom enchiladas - Delicious and different but it could have been served a little hotter. Not spicier, hotter as in heat.
Baked seafood enchiladas - My boyfriend's entr√©e. He enjoyed it and was most thrilled about the barbequed shrimp the enchiladas contained.
Tropical Guava Mojito - Very sweet but still sooo good.
Stoli Blueberi Cosmo - Amazing. I could go back just for the Stoli Blueberi Cosmos and cornbread and leave happy. Best drink of the evening.
Prairie Berry Lemonade - Kamikaze in disguise. If you don't like fruit pulp I don't recommend this. There is lemon pulp in this drink. It's served with floating blueberries also. I loved it.
 
Do I plan to go back? Very likely. If not for the food, definitely for the cornbread and drinks.
