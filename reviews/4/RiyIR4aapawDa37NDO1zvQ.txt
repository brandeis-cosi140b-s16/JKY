I went here for the first time the other day since I've heard such good things about it. I've been told it's a lot like Chipotle. I got a chicken bowl with guac. It was pretty good and easily comparable to Chipotle as far as taste. I like that they had a lot more options to choose from. Next time I'm gonna have to try their other menu options, but so far, I enjoyed my meal from here!
