Took the family in despite the mixed reviews. First off, my service was excellent from beginning to end. I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant experience.  Everyone really liked there food (and I've been to nearly every Mexican spot in phx). I ordered the camarones a la Diabla and also added chicken, they made it even though it wasn't an actual option. It was literally perfect,  and very spicy. My wife just had rolled tacos and was satisfied with her meal. Kids didn't complain so that's always a win. Only negatives would be the water and the salsa could be better and the $3 Margarita was really syrupy, but it was only $3.. All in all a very good experience and a great dish. Will be back for sure.
