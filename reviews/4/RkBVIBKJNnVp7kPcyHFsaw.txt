Everything was tasty.  The salsas are great, very fresh!  We got our order to go, parking is VERY limited which was ok when it was a donut place (you're in and out) but maybe not so great for a restaurant.   Prices are very reasonable, filling food and friendly staff.  My only real complaint is that the vegetarian options are kind of limited.  Sure they list veggie as an option for most items, but don't order it thinking you're going to get a taco or sope or huarache with grilled veggies instead of meat.  You'll basically get the item with NO MEAT, just the toppings listed, even though you pay the same price as one with meat.  I'd love it if they added some grilled veggies so at least it seems like a vegetarian option instead of an afterthought.
