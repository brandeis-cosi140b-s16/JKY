3.5 stars.  I was parched one hot summer day so I stopped by for some diet coke.  I've always steered clear of these places because frankly they look sketch.  No one wants to eat somewhere called "The Crazy Chicken."  Nevertheless, decided to get food because it's impossible to resist while you're staring at the pictures on the drive thru menu as you wait for them to take your order.  The guy in the box introduced himself by name (nice touch)!  They have big windows throughout the drive thru so you can see what's going on in the kitchen and watch them not spit in your food as they make it.  Luis did a great job on our chicken al carbon tacos and rice, bean, and cheese burrito off the value menu.  Better than Taco Bell meat pump.  Also, their selection of salsa comes in plastic containers not ketchup packets.  All in all, pleasantly surprised and definitely converted.  I'll be back.
