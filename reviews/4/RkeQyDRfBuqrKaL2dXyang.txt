Great food. Very friendly people. Our waitress was cute and very pleasant. The manager took the time to ask how everything was and talk with us about our plans while i am in town. I had the 3 tacos and a side combo. Chicken taco is flavored well with mango, beef taco was a great traditional taco, and the fried avocado was unique and awesome. The rice on the side makes it a perfect sized meal if you're hungry, and for $12 you can't beat it. Nice crowd here during the day but not too rowdy. Good for a younger crowd and young at heart as well.
