GLORIA, GLORIA, GLORIA!!! So, the previous night a few of us went to STK and the service that Gloria provided was by far above and beyond what we had experienced the night before.  She was attentive, colorful and made an AWESOME guacamole.  Having owned several restaurants coast to coast you get a good feel of what people can turn into and she definitely will be in a management role the way she is going.  If you end up at El Segundo please ask for her, to guarantee, that you will receive top notch service.  
As for the food, well, there's some need for improvement.  I understand that this a chain on the strip, and everything is measured, but when I order TACOS I want my meat over flowing.  I don't want some anorexic looking taco! I had three different types and I wouldn't order them again. Don't get me wrong, they had good flavor, but don't be cheap with the meat.
Drinks were priced competitively, $5 Shots of Cazadores, $3 beers and I forget the rest because I had one too many shots! Anyhow, I thought it was a nice gesture that Gloria introduced us to the General Manager who in turn bought us a round of shots.  Usually, its the girls who get the FREE drinks, so we were happy that we finally got a hook up! The pour cost for the 3 shots is probably 70-90 cents each, so even though they ended up losing $2.70 at most, because of their generosity we will definitely be back to spend some more $$$ the next time we are in Vegas.  
Great service, great happy hour special!!
