i don't have to mention how good the chips, salsa and bean dip are here but i do have to tell you the flour tortillas are to die for!   i am seriously thinking about just ordering a stack of those next time!  The beef machacha is much better then the chicken, the pollo ranchero is def a favorite,  and my boyfriend says the chile relleno is delicious.  Service is awesome and the margs are strong!  check this place out :)
