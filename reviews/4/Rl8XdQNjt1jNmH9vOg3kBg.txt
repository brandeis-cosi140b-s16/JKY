For quick service and always satisfying my taste for lazy comfort food, this place rocks. Do not come here for great service or ambiance, its a take-out place more than anything else.  I've tried several of their dishes but always resort back to my classic/no-frills order: two chicken tacos. These fill me up and have a respectable amount of chicken in them. The fried taco shells and shredded cheese is what I'm really craving but since the chicken actually provides nutrition it's a nice balance. 
I don't care for the albonginas soup - too oily. They do a very good job of keeping the salads healthy as long as you don't eat the shell it's a good healthy meal. The nachos are. .... nachos. Order those for your drunk friends.
Back to my point - in my experience stick with the tacos if that's what you're in the mood for. I'll choose these tacos over Best Little Taco shop or Blind Pig any day. ¡Olé!
