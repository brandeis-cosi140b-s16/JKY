I love this place. I have the chicken tacos, chicken taco salad and the machaca beef taco salad. All very good. Love the chips and salsa. Love the service. Went there the other nite told our waiter that the last time we came my son ordered the Carne Asada Burro dinner did not get beans and rice but got charged for it. My son ordered it that nite again and the waiter only charged us for the burro to make up for it. Really cool. My other son really likes the Chimi. My boyfriend loves the cheeseburger not a great Mexican fan is he but he goes with us for the burger. I will continue to go here.
