Bo Bites is coming
Is gonna review
Somebody's restaurant
Is giving me thrills
Guess I'll just give them a try

Oh yeah, alright, taste good, so right

Bo Bites is ready to blow

At The Revival....ooh oh
Your food is a heartbreaker
At The Revival....ooh oh
Your food is a life maker

The Revival is a little off key place away from the crowded Mill Ave.  My first impression of the place was wow this would be a cool place to hang with a live band!  The place serves up what I would consider Southwestern and American fusion food.  

I came here with a date on a Wednesday night so the place was pretty slow overall.  I didn't care for having the staff hanging at the bar since as a manager of the business; that bothers me much.  I ordered a Whiskey and ginger and proceeded with ordering for the both of us.  The menu was split from small versus large plates.  We shot for the small plates so we can share.  We ordered the Braised Duck Taquitos, Steamed Mussels, and Patty's Fish Tacos.  The mussels were excellent for a chilly night as it was when we attended; warm chipotle-chorizo sauce giving it an extra kick of spice along with some crustini bread.  The fish tacos had a subtle bite and a minor kick of chipotle; crunch from the cabbage, but one thing I notice most was the corn tortilla which tasted homemade.  The duck taquitos was well plated, topped with radish and red onions and surrounded by a tomatillo and pablano sauce -- Oh yeah probably my favorite of the night.  

We finished the night with some Mexican Chocolate and brownie to an already great night of eats.  Overall, a great place for a foodie to grab some experimental bites! - Enjoy!
