Kudos to Macayo's! New menu, clean flavors, clean presentation, solid service... The main man did the build your own thing with an enchilada and a tostada and I had a chicken chimi... All very tasty! Our only complaint was with the chicken on our nachos, it was canned chicken. Not sure why when they used very tender, moist, flavorful chicken in the chimi. The nachos were very good, they would have been great with the shredded chicken. They would have been outstanding if chicken asada had been used!

But this is a HUGE turnaround for Macayo's and for the better!
