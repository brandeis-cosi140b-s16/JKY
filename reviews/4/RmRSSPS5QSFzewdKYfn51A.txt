My sister LOVES Someburros so today while shopping, I decided to stop by for some Mexican food "to-go". It was day 2 since their grand opening but since I heard so much about it, I had to go. The line was obviously long, but worth it. Food was great. I ordered the chicken fundido which came with rice and it was only $5 (it wa their special for the day). Had to pay an extra $1.50 for chips (boo). Ordered a cheese burger for my son, it was large and in charge. I would for sure go back....

The only gripe is that people who are waiting for food "to go" kinda lingers around the front because there really isn't anywhere for us to go and wait without taking up table space for people eating at the restaurant.
