Finally had me some good mexican food in Henderson! I decided to give this place a try. Went for the super nachos with steak and a shrimp taco. The place was nice and clean inside and the lady who took my order was very friendly. The steak used for my nachos was very tasty, unlike the Alpo they try to pass off as carne asada at some other places. The chips were warm and crispy. My nachos were piled with goodness. The Shrimp taco was amazingly delicious. Will gladly give this place another visit to try out more from their menu. I highly recommend this place for folks who enjoy good,fresh mexican food.
