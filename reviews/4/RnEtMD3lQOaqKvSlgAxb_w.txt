Great food and fast service!!! The verde salsa is so good!!! I got the carne asada and carnitas tacos meal to go. The tacos are stuffed FULL! And they are very tasty (got mine without sauce so I could add my own) The only thing I wish they would do for to-go orders is wrap the tacos in foil so the tortillas don't get wet and soggy.
