This place is located in a strip mall on higley road. I was thinking when I first saw it this place may or may not be good. Turns out it's pretty awesome. The food is great the set up is nice. The salsa bar is yummy. The burritos are very good and they offer a lot of options. Also the breakfast is bomb!!!! Try it out!!!
