Second time this winter season that we have eaten there!  Food is good, chips crisp and the service was very good.  Salsa was tasty but weak, but adding some of the red hot sauce from the squeeze bottle at the table allowed us to make it as hot as we wanted!  Nice touch.  

Service was fast and we were checked by the waitress several time to make sure every thing was right.  Other staff wandering by also asked if we needed anything or cleared plates.  All in all a good visit.  I'm sure we will be back before leaving the area.
