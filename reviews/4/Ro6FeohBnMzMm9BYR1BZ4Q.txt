I have driven past this place many times over the years, but it always looked a little scary, and with Someburros nearby, I would just always go there. The other day I knew I would be in the area around dinner time and wanted to see if there was anything new in the area worth checking out....the reviews for Espos were all recent and talking about the awesome green chile (my personal fav) and how they had recently spruced up the place, so I decided to give it a try.

The interior is still very old school Mexico, but it was clean.  The banner outside says something like "We have the BEST green chile" so I definitely had to give that a try, I ordered the Green Chile Cheese Crisp (Quesadilla) and the cheese enchilada plate to go, the food was so cheap, it was like $10 for both!

The food smelled amazing on the long drive home to Scottsdale, and I couldn't wait to try it.  I went with the enchiladas first, many times what disappoints me most about enchiladas is the bland sauce, but this red sauce had a nice bit of heat to it and was really flavorful, I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed my $3.85 enchilada plate!  I moved on to the Green Chile Cheese Crisp, my only complaint was that they had not cut it into pieces, it was just a giant folded over tortilla, but as soon as I took my first bite all of that was forgotten...it was AMAZING!!  It reminds me of something from my childhood, the beef was so tender and flavorful, it wasn't spicy but it had some heat, I was in heaven!  I didn't get a chance to try any of their refried beans, so that will be on my agenda next time, but I will always have to get something with the Green Chile!

If I lived closer to this place I would definitely be a regular, I will now be skipping Someburros and heading straight to Espos when I am in the area.
