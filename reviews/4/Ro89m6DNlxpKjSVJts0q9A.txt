Food is great, but the drink specials are very confusing. When a drink special says margaritas I think all drinks on the margarita menu.  Evidentially certain drinks fall into different classes of margaritas ( not explained by the menu or server). I have been burnt twice by this which is no big deal it's only $3 dollars but menu needs to be more specific on what is what instead of blatant trickery. So go for the food and not the drinks very over priced at $8 for a tall skinny glass 75% ice.
