Awesome place!  For a local neighborhood Mexican restaurant, Julio G's can't be beat!  The service is always consistent and good.  The staff is friendly and the food comes out WAY fast, which is good because then you don't have time to eat too many chips.  The have changed ownership in the last year or so and with that came some improvements.  I'm not sure where they are purchasing their meats but it has definitely improved.  The chicken especially.  I love the combo platter in the middle of the menu.  You can pick and choose and try out different items all served with rice and beans.  The green chile tamale is a favorite as are the fajitas and the Tijuana tacos!  The leftovers actually taste good too.
