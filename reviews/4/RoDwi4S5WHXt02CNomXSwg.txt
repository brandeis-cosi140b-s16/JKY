=====================  REVISITED 12/12/13 =====================

Came here last night after our weekly Thursday night meeting with two other people and my wife. It's obviously a popular place, it was quite busy. 

I've eaten in countless Mexican restaurants . Arizona definitely has some of the best Mexican food and Manuel's is one of the best. Everything people ordered was terrific. The salsa is  freakin' awesome! The flavors, textures, and spices of this salsa are unmatched by any other. I could eat their chips and salsa all day long I'm addicted to it. The chips were fresh & hot. The best part is they brought you as many bowls of them as we wanted.
.
PORTIONS: Are plentiful. You won't leave here hungry that's for sure.

FOOD: OMG the food is so fabulous this has become my favorite place to eat Mexican food. My experiences with Manuel's are simply top notch and it is for this reason when I crave Mexican food  it has grown to become one of my favorite places to eat. The food is always hot, fresh, and tasty. SERVICE:Always great service.  Staff here is always upbeat pleasant, attentive , friendly &  professional.
 PRICE: The price IS very reasonable. AMBIANCE: Nicely decorated. Family friendly & great for dinner with friends or business associated. CONCLUSION:  RETURN FACTOR 50-50....%.
