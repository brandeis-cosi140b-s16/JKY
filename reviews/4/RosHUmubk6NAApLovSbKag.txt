Excellent traditional mexican food with fair prices. Miguel does a great job in the kitchen using quality ingrediants. Tried the fried shrimp platter and carnitas, muy sobroso! Basic chesse and onion enchiladas are superb.
You've got to try this mom & pop casita soon. You will enjly.
Beer only, bring your own wine. Cheap date!
