Tucked away in the shopping center on the west edge of town is La Canasta. There are two rooms: the smaller representing the original kitchen and dining area, and the larger being a former adjacent business, with access portals between the two. I prefer the smaller of the two; the larger with its white office-type high ceiling and bright fluorescent lighting  feels like I'm eating in an insurance office or something, despite the repaint and a few wall pictures/artifacts. 
But it's really about the food and service, and no faults found here. Chips and a mild/medium salsa are offered promptly, with bottled hot sauce brought on request. The menu offers a decent selection, my personal favorite being the chile relleno combo dinner. Service for me has been prompt and friendly, and if you've still got room, the churros or fry bread make for a fun dessert.
If I may add a thought, and with all due respect, I am a little apprehensive about this restaurant's future in its present format. The signage does not stand out, its out of the way location is not the greatest, the anchor store for this part of the mall is out of business, the interior is not particularly inviting, and the no alcohol situation is a turn off for a lot of folks who like to have some wine, beer, or a marguerita with their meal, which is available elsewhere at competitive places like Anita's Cocina and El Ranchero. I say this because they serve arguably the best Mexican food in town, and I very much want for these nice people to succeed. 
The prices are fair, there is ample adjacent off street parking,  and the menu offers breakfast all day, so if you'll excuse me, I'm off for some Huevos Rancheros!
