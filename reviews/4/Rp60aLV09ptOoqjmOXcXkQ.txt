Great staff! FAB food! LOVE that you can ala carte the tacos and add or take away from what you need. Beans..yep. Beans .. Nope. Margaritas .. Icy.. top shelf .. Premium.. strong! Who's driving again??? Love the way that the flat shell is brought instead of greasy, carb laden chips all taken from some plastic bag and greased down and tossed before you with some jarred salsa. I love this place. It brings class to the cocina. I always get the Mezcal chicken tacos. Eat one. Bring the rest home for the next day. Splurge on the beans and flat shell and salsa. Tres bien!
