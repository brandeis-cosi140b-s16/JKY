I've been going to Chipotle for years (I even lived near its very first location!) and have thoroughly enjoyed their burritos. I even contacted the company to argue for a location to be brought to my old college campus. So I will happily refer someone to head over to any nearby Chipotle for a good take on your classic mexican/american burrito. As you may tell this review is for Chipotle in general and not any individual location (though I have gone to this one).
My order typically is: chicken burrito with extra white lime rice, black beans (sometimes a little extra), green salsa, chunky tomato salsa, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, guacamole, and I think the chipotle tabasco hot sauce is an excellent addition every other bite or so. 

Also, just get a cup for water and squeeze in some lemon juice and a couple packs of cane sugar for a refreshing fresh squeezed lemonade. Skip on the soft drinks and save them for somewhere else.
