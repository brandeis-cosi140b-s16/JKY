We stopped by for a quick bite to eat. i was told to come try the tacos.  its a really cute but very small place.  Clean and organized.  Very good salsa bar.  The seven chili and mexicana salsa were my favorite.  We ordered queso fundido...i liked it. One of my favorite dishes to try at new places. It did not dissappoint.  Only bad thing was...they could have given a few extra pieces of tortilla with the queso.  We tried the guacho and white fish tacos.  The guacho was excellent.  The white fish wasnt anything special.  Needs some extra seasoning or maybe a spicier sauce instead of the cabbage and white sauce.  I would come back and new stuff because i was pleased with my first try here.
