Nice mid-priced option for good food and fun atmosphere.

We sought this restaurant out on a recent visit to Vegas because we both remembered it fondly from independent visits to Vegas years ago. It continues to be a nice, mid-priced option for good food and fun atmosphere. You aren't dining in Vegas's finest here, but you also aren't paying for that. It's in the mall part of The Venetian. Think of it as an excellent, mid-priced lunch option as you move about the strip. The restaurant juts into the canal that the gondoliers come down. A major 'stop and sing' point for them is right where you dine, separated by just a railing over the water. The chicken mole was amazing according to my husband. My slow-roasted pork (in a banana leaf) was ok. The speciality drinks were good. I really enjoyed the pina, served in a coconut, but felt it was a small amount of liquid in the actual drink.
