If you're looking for authentic flavor, but in a hurry this is THE place! My personal favorites are the Carne Asada Fries and some Empanadas!  The fries are so big that it is definitely a two person job!  Everything is fresh and made to order!  Also has lots of healthy options for those of us watching our figures, so that makes it even better for me.  I feel like I get my cheat in without doing any actual damage.  Good stuff all the way around!
