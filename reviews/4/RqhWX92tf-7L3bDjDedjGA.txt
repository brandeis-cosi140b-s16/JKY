I really like this place...a lot!
I wouldn't call myself a connoisseur of mexican food (I like a lot of the places here in Phoenix and Scottsdale...a by-product of being raised where everybody thinks Taco Bell and Taco Time are "mexican food"), but I know what I like and Ranch Market's cafe is terrific!!
I met a couple of friends here for lunch today, and was, as always, happy and full when I left.
I had tameles today (my touchstone for the best in mexican food)...they were great...hot, soft, perfectly spicy, with the sauce ( I do believe I am getting aroused!  OK back to business.
I have had burritos, various tacos, the hot dogs (nogales style), the sopa's and you know what? They are all really tasty and the people at Ranch Market are really nice.
The prices are cheap (esp. when you compare the prices to some of the pricier mexican restaurants that, frankly, don't measure up, taste-wise and quality-wise to this cafe).
Lastly, I could make a meal of their chips and salsa, fresh made, warm, spicy...I'm getting hot again.
Go to Ranch Market, enjoy that cafe, you'll be glad you did!
