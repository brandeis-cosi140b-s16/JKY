I have been eating at this joint on and off for 12 years now and I can honestly say that their Carne Asada burrito is the absolute bomb.  The Super Nachos come in a close second tied with the three rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole.  I have tried some of the other "bertos" out there but this is hands down the best of the lot.  Stay away from Los Betos.
