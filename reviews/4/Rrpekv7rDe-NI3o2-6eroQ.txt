I went to Plaza first time today. The Carne Asada was fantastic. Yes, the beans were a little thin, but they tasted ok. I really don't go out to Mexican food for the beans. My husband had the pollo carnitas and he said they were really good as well. The service was good, though they need another server, ours was pretty busy.  The tortillas had been kneaded too much so were a little tough. They tasted good, just tougher than I generally like them. The guacamole was fresh tasting. 
 As another poster stated, DON'T DRINK THE WATER, seriously it tastes like pool water, get a filter! Ruined all the drinks because the ice is made with the same water.
