Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and even late night, it is a good time for Amados.

the menu is pretty standard for a Arizona Mexican food shack, the beauty is in the execution. From the beans made with vegetable shortening to the tangy neon green guacamole and bold shredded cheese all of the flavors here POP!

This place also excels when it comes to condiments, There is an amazing red sauce, a very spicy tomatillo green sauce, fresh sliced jalapenos, a cabbage pico de gallo, peeled and sliced cucumbers and spicy carrots. 

Last trip I had an old favorite a bean burrito, A pleasantly warm and soft tortilla wrapped some great beans, prodigious application of red sauce made it a great meal.

My friend opted for his usual, carne asada fries. Basically chili cheese fries done the Mexican way.

The place it self is not the fanciest, and there are signs of abuse from the hordes of highschoolers that descend to this place late on weekends. I was one of them just a decade or so go. Time may has passed but I still enjoy the quality value food at Amados.
