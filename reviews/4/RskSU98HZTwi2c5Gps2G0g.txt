"Welcome to Moe's!" Yep, they shouted at me when I walked in. I wasn't super hungry, so I went with the "Joey Junior". It's a smaller sized burrito but it still comes with the rest of the basket filled with chips. So there's still a huge amount of food!

I topped the chips with a few healthy scoops of salsa from the salsa bar and ended up taking the untouched burrito home for the next day's lunch. It was still excellent.

Large seating area with a TV or two that were tuned into a sports channel. And free wi-fi. Excellent!

I love Moe's!
