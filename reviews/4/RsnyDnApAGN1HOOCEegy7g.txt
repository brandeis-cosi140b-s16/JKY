Stopped by for the first time tonight and really enjoyed the food. I got the chili Verde burrito which had just the right amount of spice. Husband had the ground beef taco which he loved and a beef burrito which he also enjoyed. We also ordered a carne asada quesadilla for our son, the steak was tender but could have used a little more flavor. Overall a great experience. Everyone was very accommodating and friendly and allowed us to taste some of the food prior to ordering. We will definitely be back.
