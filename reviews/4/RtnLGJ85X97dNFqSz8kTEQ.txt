It is not new, it is not hip or sheek, but it is casual, and quite good.

Start your meal with the signature bean dip, chips and salsa. In reality this is all you need for a meal but it is polite and delicious to try the other offerings. 

I oped for the chile relleno. A large chile stuffed with cheese battered and covered in a rich red sauce and more cheese. What is there not to love.

The red enchilada sauce here is deep and rich it pairs well with the cheese. 

So give the old local AZ chain a try I bet you will like it.
