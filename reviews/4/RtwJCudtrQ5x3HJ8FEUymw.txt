Went here for a pre-concert dinner a couple weeks ago. Got to say, love the ambiance and funky decor of the place!

The service was very friendly and knowledgeable but really really slow. It was a Sunday night, and busy, but it was no excuse to take more than 10 minutes to get our first cocktails.

The cocktails are so fun! Go for some of the margaritas and specialty drinks. We also had a flight of excellent tequilas. If you like tequila, this is the place to go.

We were trying to eat light before our concert so my husband and I each opted for one taco. He got the duck tongue taco and I got the oyster +lychee taco combination. Both tacos were excellent. Very interesting flavor combinations. 

Following our tacos we got a plate of the lamb wontons. They were delicately folded and full of lamb goodness. Beautifully presented!

Lastly, we shared an epic churro dessert. The churros were worth it. Each one was crispy, fluffy and best dipped in the Mexican hot chocolate sauce. 

This is a great place to come for some interesting small plates, good atmosphere...but don't be in a hurry to get out!
