Went there to watch a hockey playoff game Sunday @ 6:00. Place was not busy and we were seated right away. Waitress came over right away and took our drink order. We ordered the wings and fish tacos. Food was decent and reasonably priced. The place started to fill up. Looks like a lot of regulars. Food was good and priced right. We'll be back again.
