Oh, Julioberto's how I appreciate thee.

I live down the street.  I am white, lower middle-class, educated, a 15 year veteran of the food service industry and a bit of a food snob (read:  fast food frequently isn't entirely made of FOOD) so believe me when I say that this place is the real deal.

Yes, the humans who work here occasionally make mistakes.  They will also rectify their errors if they are made aware of them.

The food is consistently fresh and delicious.  I've been advised by people of the culture Julioberto's represents that it is a spot-on example of home cooking, Mexican style.

The drive-through makes it easy.  They have patio seating which only does anyone any good during the tolerable months (Oct - April)

Yes the building is old and shows signs of wear - they spend their efforts and money not on superficial things but on the food that goes out the window.

Don't listen to me, or any of the others - go try it for yourself  and make a decision THAT way... the only way that's really valid.

PS the pork adobada is divine.
