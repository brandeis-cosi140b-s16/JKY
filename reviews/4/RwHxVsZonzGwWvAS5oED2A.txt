I've been there 2 times, each time using the yelp discount. The first time was okay. The hubby and I order chimichangas and wings for the kids. The second time was better. I ordered the carne asada burrito, the hubby got the chimichanga again and this time instead of wings, fingers the kids. Overall the food is good and fresh. I would go back again.
