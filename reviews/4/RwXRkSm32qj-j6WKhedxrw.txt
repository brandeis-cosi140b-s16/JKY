I love enchiladas. They are my favorite Mexican food. 

When I saw this place - I thought "What? An enchilada-only place?" I think it blew my mind. Coming from NYC, should expect the "specialty" restaurants that specialize in one type of food only (e.g. Mac and cheese, meatballs, etc.) but in Phoenix? 

Anyway, a friend and I stopped there on a whim. I was not surprised, but amazed at how good this was. The concept is really "line" style - (read: Subway) where you pick your tortilla, then your meat, then your toppings and slide on down. 

I ordered 2 enchiladas. First, the tortillas. I did the half wheat/half corn. They are super soft and chewy, with a soft texture. Next, the chicken and then the cheesy potato fillers. Both delicious. Gadzooks offers two vegetarian options: one is potato/cheese for the filler and the second is spinach. Then the topping - green salsa please. Some cheese on top - and into the oven it goes to warm up and crisp up the cheese on top. Just like a pizza. 

The last time I was there - I tried the tortilla soup. I love tortilla soup - in all kinds and types. This was rich and perfectly seasoned. I will definitely get it again.
