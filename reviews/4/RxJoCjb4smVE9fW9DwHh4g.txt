Been here a couple times now. Both times the service was great. Very friendly and helpful staff. First time was pretty busy and the food was good. Second time had less guests and food was great.  Brought a couple people with us the second time and they loved it. Homemade food and great explanations about the recipes origins etc.  Our server is the daughter of the owners and really took pride in everything. We ate outside on both occasions and really enjoy the plants and atmosphere. The prices are higher than Cilantros and Tacos And More but it's not a fast food joint so that's normal. They provided separate checks with no problems and even had a great conversation about Rocky Point. Plan to make this place a regular. So glad to find another enjoyable non-chain restaurant in Maricopa. Keep up the good work!
