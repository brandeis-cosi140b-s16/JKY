I came here last night for a private group event, so we had apps + margs & sangria.

Honestly, I've had much better Mexican food. This is basically a step up from El Segundo or some other Mexican chain. I tried the bacon wrapped shrimp, chips & guac & salsa, quesadillas, & soft tacos. Also, this used to be the old Diego but it looks like they took down a few walls on the outside to make the space appear more inviting and make it look larger. Diego seemed pretty closed off.

The reason for the 4-stars is because the service and servers were nothing short of awesome. Very personable, always coming around with food and drink refills. Making great rapport with everyone and cracking jokes, making sure our glasses (literally) were never half empty. Service is a huge factor to me when dining out, and this place just killed it. Felicidades!
