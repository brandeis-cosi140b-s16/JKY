Funny decor, very nice waitstaff and owners and really delicious home cooked food is how I would describe Don Lenchos.  I especially love their fish and shrimp dishes.I always get the shrimp cocktail which to me tastes like a kind of gazpacho with shrimp in a very slightly sweet, cold tomato soup with onions, cucumbers, peppers, avocado, and very many icy cold perfectly cooked shrimp.  The seafood burrito in white sauce and the garlic shrimp are two other favorites. Queso fundido with chorizo and the caldo de camar√≥n are also fantastic.  But everything on the menu has aways been fantastic.
