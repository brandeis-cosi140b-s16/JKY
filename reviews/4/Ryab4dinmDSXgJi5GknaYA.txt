This place is hands down the best place I ate at during my weekend in the Phoenix area.

The outside is a little off-putting.  A small BRIGHT yellow building with heavy bars on the windows... and you walk in to tables covered in bright plastic table cloths, rickety tables and chairs.... but...

This is extremely good Mexican food. We were the only white kids in there. I had the camarones de rancheros, which was really good.  I had originally ordered the al a diabla and thankfully the girl working the cash register had me taste the sauce first.  I thought I was going to go numb it was so hot.  The rancheros shrimp were great though, really flavorful with an excellent, spicy sauce.  Good rice too.

D and J got carne asada tacos which they thoroughly enjoyed.  Next time I'll get the ceviche which looked amazing served in a gigantic margarita glass.
