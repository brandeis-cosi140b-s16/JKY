One must overcome the look of the neighborhood and it's neighbor "soup kitchen". I used to volunteer at this "soup kitchen"  and the street people are not a danger to this neighborhood.  The restaurant is a large and open room with about 10 booths and 20 tables, an aquarium and loud loud Mexican music!  Did I mention it is loud?  Five or six waitresses, friendly, helpful and patient rush about serving the quests.  A Friday early evening, my wife and I were the only non latinos in the place.  The food was as beautiful as it was excellent.  We ordered shrimp quesadillas (9.99) and a deep fried whole red snapper in garlic sauce (13.99) both excellent. The portions were huge!!  The snapper was 12 to 14 inches long!  I have taken off one star for the overly loud music.  The bathroom and restaurant were clean and service was good.  We will surely return! Perhaps with ear plugs :)
