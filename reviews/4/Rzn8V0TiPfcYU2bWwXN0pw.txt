When people say "quesadilla", too often it means a flour tortilla rolled around some inert cheese, and heated till drippingly sad.

But here, a "quesadilla" is a big, crisp, bursting, flavor bomb - - a crunchy flavor delight.   The rich-corn-flavored tacos, too, are sumptious (great meats).   I took one of each to an early afternoon meeting last Friday, and if we could have harnessed the salivation at the surrounding tables, we could have solved the energy crisis using hydroelectric.

This is a hidden gem  (just TRY to find it).   The flavors are bursting, the prices are wonderful,  and the staff are wholly accepting of people who might not be native, while still cranking out glorious things at fabulous prices that  local mex-chains (read: Pedros?!?) could never even conceive of.
