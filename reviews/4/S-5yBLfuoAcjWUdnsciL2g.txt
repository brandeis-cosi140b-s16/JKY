I am loving this place and am already excited to go back to try more!

It is right across the street from Postino's, which is one of our faves. The night we went here, we literally tossed a coin to see which restaurant we should go to, and Joyride won. I'm so glad we went because I was very pleasantly surprised as soon as I walked in the door. The decor, colors, lighting were all fabulously 1960's style, but strangely enough has a very clean modern feel to it as well.
We were seated in a booth which looked out on the welcoming patio with a fireplace.
I ordered one of the freshly infused waters and the enchiladas and the bf ordered the machaca burrito. After downing our delicious chips & salsa, our food came and the presentation was (almost) as delicious as it tasted.
I am an enchilada fiend and order them almost every time at a Mexican restaurant. I loved that half was drenched in mole sauce, the other half in verde salsa. I wasn't a huge fan of the verde sauce, I have to admit. It was a little too thick and peppery. 
My boyfriend's burrito came cut into two halves and was delicious!

We will be back for sure. Their happy hour and lunch specials look great.
