You know, in a town not really known for healthy choices, much less fast, healthy choices, this place really does fill the gap.

They have bowls and salads with REAL avocado, not some green mush that they try to pass off. You get actual thick slices. That and they toast your tortilla, melt that gooey cheese, you get real red beans, not some processed fattening stuff that will clog your arteries and you get it all FAST.

It's not the ideal choice or necessarily the healthiest, but it sure does beat TB or DT when you want fast, fresh Mexican!
