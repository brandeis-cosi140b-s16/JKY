[Solid 3.5 stars]
Not your ordinary tamales.  These are large moist and fresh.  I first encountered them at the Phoenix Public Market on Saturdays and occasionally on First Fridays, with steamers full of a variety of tamale flavors to please the Vegan, Vegeterian and meat lover alike.  

With fillings from traditional Pork Red Chile and Beef Red Chile to Spinach Mushroom, Shrimp, Chicken (red or green)  or my favorite Green Chile, Corn with Cream cheese.  You have to check out their menu of choices they always seem to have something new or seasonal.  They have them warm in steamers or frozen to take home for later.  [They defrost and reheat very well.  Reheat in the wrap or wrap a moist paper towel over the wrapped tamale to ensure it won't dry out.]

A fan of their moist delicious fluffy masa, I am not a fan of the shrimp tamale I had and the tamale traditionalist part of me found that the Pork Red Chile had too much cumin for my flavor.  I can always count on the goodness of the Green Corn Tamale (Corn, green chile and cream cheese).

When I forget to pick up a few on Saturday I can always find them in the freezer at Phoenix Public Market.
