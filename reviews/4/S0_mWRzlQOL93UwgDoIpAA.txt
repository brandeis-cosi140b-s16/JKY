Better flavor than Chipotle.  Quality ingredients, great guacamole, and fresh ripe spicy tomato salsa (sweat inducing).  The Gorda burrito with shredded beef was expensive ($12) but considering the size (bigger than chipotle) and airport location, it was well worth it.  This place satisfied my 'last chance' Mexican craving as I waited to board my flight.
