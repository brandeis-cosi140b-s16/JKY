I'm a big fan of Gourmet Tacos and this place has both a swell selection and some really tasty options. They even have Burritos and many other Mexican favorites.

Been to Dan's older location before it closed and today came in here to check out his new tacos. This is always a great way to try out the fillings and definitely gave me the excuse to go Taco Crazy.

Just order at the counter and get some Frees Chips. They have a cool Salsa Bar with a nice assortment choices. You can even request their Spicy Habanero Salsa that they had stashed away on my last visit.

Ordered the 50/50, the Pastor, Braised Brisket, Crispy Fish and the Grilled Mahi. They were all very delicious and I could have easily eaten several more. Really loved how tender the meats were and how they combined and layered the flavors.

The tacos are pretty small and about a buck a bite. So order several of them to get filled up. Would like to see a tortilla that does not fall apart like mine did. Maybe a little more time on the griddle to crisp it up?

Can't wait to come back and try out some of their other items on the menu. This place is rather small inside and it can get very busy during the lunch rush. Saw several people getting their orders to go and they were happy to dash out in a hurry.

Located right next to the French market with a parking lot that can be a bit of a challenge. Ended up in the north lot by the cleaners and turned my front wheels so they couldn't tow me away. SIMPLEMENTE DELICIOSO!
