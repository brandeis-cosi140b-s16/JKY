Cantina 1511 is a very nice Tex-Mex restaurant. The service was great. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. The ambiance screams modern mexico with an American twist. From the outside walking in, Good luck finding parking, I had to park on the street because parking is limited. Luckily the neighborhood is a pretty good one so I had no problem with that. I had the "Enchiladas de Pollo" which was pretty damn good to me (it was plated nicely/ could of been better but I'm not picky about that). Yes, it was on the cheesy side but I like cheese. The chicken was a little dry, that's were all that cheese came into play. I think they would of had a 5-star dish on their hands if they brined the chicken first and then grilled it. Overall I was happy with my dish. The dinner party I was with had the some of the dishes pictured, 1. Chimichanga (looked F'n Delicious) 2. Ancho Chicken Quesadillas (the chicken chunks were actually pretty big). No one complained about their food but I can say the prices were moderately higher than your average Mexican restaurant, that would be a major downfall for me to go back to Cantina on a regular basis. If your ever in Charlotte of course I would inform you to check out this place for any special occasion. Just make sure your ready to spend a little more on Mexican food.
