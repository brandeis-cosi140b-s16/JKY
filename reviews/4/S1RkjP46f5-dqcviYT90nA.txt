Super!
We've been a few times and I keep forgetting to review. The location is easy to find on Saguaro from Fountain Hills or off of Shea.
Their salsa are fabulous - I'm gonna guess homemade because I swear it had a little kick to it today that I don't remember. 
My favorite dish us the Chicken Fondido  (or something like that). It comes in 2 sizes, the small portion us perfectly sized. I. Love. This. Dish!
Today the hubs had Chile Relleno con Pollo - he said he thoroughly enjoyed it.
The wait staff is always polite and attentive. Indoor and patio seating available. Bar and the have a TV behind the bar, Cuz sometimes you want to get away for a Dos XX'S and the game!
We love this place! Will go back again and again!
