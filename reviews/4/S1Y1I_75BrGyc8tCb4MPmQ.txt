I love this restaurant! I discovered it my junior year here at u of I and have been a fan ever since. The service has changed over a couple years and the chefs might have too, but hands down they have the most fresh tortilla chips you will ever have. The queso is great as well. One of my fav dishes is the chicken fajita quesedilla and the steak nacho supremos. You can never go wrong with those choices.
