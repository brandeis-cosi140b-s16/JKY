I grew up eating Chico's Tacos (I'm not old, lol), and it's definitely one of my favorite quick Mexican food joints. The salsa bar is fantastic. I suggest the beans (no lard!), shredded beef tacos, the Achiote Chicken Salad (yum!), the cheese enchiladas....

I need to add though, Management changed last year and they sadly adopted flashy, in-your-face menu boards and jacked their prices a bit. No bueno. I haven't been much since it changed but it's still good.
