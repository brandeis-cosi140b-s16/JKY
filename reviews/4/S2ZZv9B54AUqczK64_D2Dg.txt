Good Mexican Delivery Food!

In a town where delivery food is dominated by pizza and pseudo-chinese, it was nice to find a Mexican restaurant that would deliver to my house.  

I ordered a "Taco Order" (3 tacos) and a Chorizo and Potato Burrito.  The tacos were good.  The tortillas were NOT the usual pre-folded Taco Bell things.  They were made just as I like them...crispy on the outside and still soft on the inside.  The meat was a little salty, but still very good.  The lettuce was still crisp when it got to my house.  I guess that's a tribute to my delivery driver.

The Burrito was very good.  Filled with Chorizo and Potato goodness.  Once again, the tortilla was exceptional.  

While they told me to expect a 45 minute delivery time, the food arrived in 30.  In all, I've got no complaints.
