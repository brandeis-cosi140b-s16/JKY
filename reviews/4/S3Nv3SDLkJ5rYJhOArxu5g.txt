I love that when I eat here they have real plates and bowls not styrofoam.  There food is great.  I love the chliaquiles.... There so good if you like spicy.  The rolled tacos are awesome and so is there breakfast burrito.  They are very friendly and I have never seen it dirty here at all.... It's really a nice quiet spot we like to go and we can eat in peace with out chaos
