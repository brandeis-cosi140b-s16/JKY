Love love love this place. So glad its right by me.

The staff is always super friendly, it's never packed, and like the other locations, the food is amazing.

I always get the carne asada quesadilla. My hubby, the carne asada tacos *plain* on flour tortillas (he's very picky and theyre very accommadating).

Oh and did I mention that their guac is like crack?
