For a quick fix for mexican food I love Caramba.
I aways get the Pollo Fundido and cheese crisp. This time I added the the Caramba special  - a ginormous burrito to eat the next day.
As usual, it was good.
The restaurant is always clean. Generic sterile looking interior. Staff is always friendly too.
