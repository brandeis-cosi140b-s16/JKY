I was misinformed about where this place was located and ended up walking 20 min more than I thought I would have to. However, the walk was worth it and I was quite pleased with the tacos here! 

I am always in the mood for some tacos and Tacos El Gordo has a good amount of options, except they don't have chicken, which is the lamest kind of taco you could get anyway.... 

You basically stand in line for the kind of meat you want and it could get a little hectic, so brace yourself. I got 2 carne asada tacos, which I thought were a little too dry, 1 head meat taco which was super tasty, and 1 spicy pork which was delicious!! 

This place is worth a visit if you're willing to make the trip here!! The food is good and cheap compared to most of the places on the strip.
