I love Azteca!  This location is large and bright, and is a great place for larger groups.  Although it always seems busy, I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated.  My favorite meal is the chicken fajitas, and the serving is more than enough to share with another person.  Service has always been fast and attentive.  Top shelf margaritas are generous with the liquor. ;) 

My only complaint is that they recently changed their chips and I really dislike them!  They are thick and seem stale.  But, I'll still go and skip the chips, and have the complimentary sopapillas for dessert.
