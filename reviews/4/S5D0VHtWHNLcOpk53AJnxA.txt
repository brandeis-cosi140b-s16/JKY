While I was skeptical of the whole fusion concept, some of the dishes were pretty inventive, I'll give them that!

The Viva China (oysters + soft beef tendon+ peppercorn sauce) taco was quite tasty as was the Huitlacoche noodles with mushrooms and Mexican corn truffles. The best cold dish has to be the Palmitos (hearts of palm + grapefruit salad) which was ideal to combat the Vegas heat. 

No matter what the server suggests, the shrimp mojo (shrimp + fermented garlic sauce) is not worth it for the tiny bits of shrimp. It's something a Chinese mama could make for a lot less. 

Drinks were amazing; Mexican mojitos, mimosas and what have you. They do magic with Mezcal here!

For what it is, this resto does solid lunch and dinners, and the drinks aren't too bad. Drop in if you're stuck outside Marquee or just for a quick bite before checking into your room.
