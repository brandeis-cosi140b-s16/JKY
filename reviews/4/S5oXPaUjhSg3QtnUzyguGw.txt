this place is good, simple and fast. Tuesdays they have deep fried beef tacos for 99 cents so I stay away from here on that night.
The Al Pastor tacos are super super gooooooood. I havent ever had a bad thing on this menu. The fish tacos, are nothing special, but still not bad. 
The owenrs are always walking around, checking on tables and super nice guys. 
Really cool art on the walls
