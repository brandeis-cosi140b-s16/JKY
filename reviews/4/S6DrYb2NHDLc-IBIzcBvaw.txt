I have been wanting to try this place for years. It did not disappoint. Pricey, yes..but that's Vegas. The difference is that they serve big, filling plates. So, you actually get your $$'s worth. The margaritas are FANTASTIC. Chips were amazingly fresh and crispy and I loved that they served three different salsas. The shrimp tacos were heaven, but my hubby got the carne asada which I think were the best. GREAT service and worth a try!
