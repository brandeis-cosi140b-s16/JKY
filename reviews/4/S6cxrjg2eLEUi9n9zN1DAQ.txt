My husband and I are pretty picky when it comes to Mexican food, we did live in Phoenix for 2 years after all! We loved cucos! The decor was more north woods than Mexican, but it gave the place a Wisconsin-Esque charm that we loved. The chips and salsa were free, bottomless, and tasty! I got a combination platter of a quesidilla, burrito, and enchilada and each one was delicious! Guac also came with the entree, which was nice as most places charge extra. All entrees were very affordable. Service was a bit slow but very friendly, we will be back!
