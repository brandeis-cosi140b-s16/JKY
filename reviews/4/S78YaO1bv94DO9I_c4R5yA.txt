I come here for their fish burrito. I LOVE IT!!!!. It is crispy fish with cabbage, special sauce and pico de gallo. I've also tried their huevos ranchero it was good, although I'm not a big fan of runny eggs, I still ate it. I didn't like their ham & egg & cheese burrito, the ham was too salty. Other than that the service is good, drive- thru is always busy.. I'm happy that they're back to business.
