Yes, I'm addicted to anything that ends in ***bertos, and although I'm not hispanic, I seem to have acquired a serious taste for this kind of food.   This was my first time here, and I was expecting a drive-thru as most of these places have but did not mind having to go inside to order.  It definitely has that cheap/fast/authentic mexican vibe with bright colors and a big picture menu.  The fact that I was the only white chick in the place made me feel confidant that I would not be disappointed.  

I opted for the green chile burrito which was delicious...smaller chunks of pork than I'm used to with more of a kick than I was expecting and a perfectly hot and chewy tortilla.  Nice selections at the salsa bar and decent service.  Definitely a solid four stars.
