Forgive me Aunt Chiladas! I`m so ashamed to admit that I live in your neighborhood, have been coming here forever and just now writing a review! Better late than never!
Ok what I like about this place: Best Happy Hour around- drink specials and free buffet! On Fridays they have live music and it gets packed. On beautiful weather the patio areas are great to be hanging out!
Sundays- awesome brunch with a chocolate fountain.
Margaritas- frozen, on the rocks, top shelf, etc- love them here!
Chips and salsa- love the flaky, crispy chips here! Not a real fan of the chunky salsa( I like mine hot!) but you get two kinds- the chunky and a red mole style which is spicer so me likey!
Grreat  place for groups!!! And the patio is dog friendly!
For Cinco De Mayo- come here! All day live music fest!!
ps, the inside is more intimate for dinner, I am a fan of the sour cream and chicken enchiladas! I love coming here!!
