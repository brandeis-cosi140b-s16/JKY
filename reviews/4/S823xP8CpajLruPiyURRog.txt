Having visited a few times, we've found the food to be consistently good, consisting of decidedly fresh ingredients served in big portions. On each visit, the waitstaff has been attentive and quick to fill water and tea glasses, as well as offering the next beer or margarita. 
Speaking of drinks, I had the best big ginger (whiskey, ginger ale) I've had in Charlotte, despite it being a decidedly odd drink order for a Mexican cantina. 
I should say, we find the ambiance to be a large part of the charm. When you look up, you'll notice high ceilings and a wall of elaborate, colorful Mexican wrestler masks. The theme is continued on the small LCD television screens that adorn some booth walls, where a crazy, strange zombie/vampire/dwarf/Mexican wrestler movie shows on a loop. We found the latter immensely entertaining, but can't say with certainty that they show anything other than the movie on these TVs. Sports fans, you may want to call ahead if you're wanting to catch the big game.
