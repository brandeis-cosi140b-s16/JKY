We went here on a friend's recommendation for a birthday party.  So glad we did! Great food, drinks and atmosphere. Try their specialty tequila shots.  The pineapple tequila tasted like pineapple juice, but after 2, I was definitely feeling the tequila!  We had the fish tacos that were large and freshly made.  Can get a bit "college-y" later in the night and on weekends. If you like tacos and tequila, check it out for happy hour or dinner. Fun place!
