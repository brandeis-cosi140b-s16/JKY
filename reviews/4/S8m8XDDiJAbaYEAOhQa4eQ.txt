The best salsa I've ever had - and the only one I can actually eat by the chipful. The chips are always fresh and never stale. Service has always been fast and friendly. Prices are cheap, especially for lunch. 

I usually get the enchilada (ordered with no onions, green sauce) with rice and beans, all around $7. 

I could eat here everyday and never want for anything else.
