Ok great Mom and Pop place. This is one of those places that you are glad to find on Yelp because they is only one of these. As far as Mexican food place this is a great find. A little of that sonoran style cooking witgh a little authentic north Mexico flavor. I always go by the beans. The beans reminded me of the beans my mom makes at home. They were made today and not out of a can. And the chips and salsa are good. The salsa has a bite to it so if your are mild salsa person, beware.I recomend this place
