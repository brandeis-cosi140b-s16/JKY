For fast food, this place rocks! It's open 24 hours, has amazingly huge fresh portions, and always has a good-size handful of customers that seem happy with their food :) I love the chicken taco salad, although I wish the shell was corn instead of flour. The beef rolled tacos with guac are tasty and the fresh salsa bar that includes gardineria and fresh cukes is a plus! yummers!
