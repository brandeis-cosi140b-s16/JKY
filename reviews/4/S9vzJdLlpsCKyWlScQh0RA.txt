I will give this 4 stars because it's cheap and quick.  The drinks are really great prices ($5 margaritas & daiquiris) and the food is pretty cheap too.  I wouldn't say that the food or drinks are anything really amazing or unique, but it's a great place to get something quick to eat and drink.  I had a cheese quesadilla for $5 and it was enough food for me and tasted pretty good.  The drinks tasted good too, but I'm not sure how strong they really were.  The only real drawback was that it was very busy when we were there and it was tricky to find a place to actually sit down and eat.
