Authentic Mexican fast food! tt looks like it took over an old Wendy's from the architecture of the place. As soon as I saw that this place was packed with Mexicans, I knew this place had to be good. 

Right when you walk in, you see where you walk up an place your order. Everything is prepared on the spot, as efficiently as a Chipotle assembly line. You see the meats cooked right there in front of you so the aroma is mouth watering. Your first stop is the guy serving up adobada which he slices off a skewer and you see all of the juices running down.

I ordered four different tacos: adobada, carne asada, lengua and cabeza for about $2 each. All of them were generously filled with meat, onions, cilantro and sauces. The corn tortillas are made fresh as is everything else. 

All of the meats were tender and flavorful but the standout star was adobada. I made the mistake of eating that first, and although all of the other tacos were good, they paled in comparison to the amazing adobada taco.

I had the flan for dessert and it was good, not the best I've had but worth getting if you have a sweet tooth. 

I'm sad that this place is all the way on the other side of town. I won't be able to go to a Roberto's or Amigos Tacos without comparing them to the yummy goodness that is Tacos El Gordo!
