Really great food, really terrible ambience. I recommend getting it to go because sitting down to eat will just depress you. 

When we walked in I thought that the place was under construction as it was nearly empty, consisting only of a few cheap table on a concrete floor. No music, no tv, nothing on the walls. It was nearly empty and nearly silent, not a good first sign.

Despite this poor first impression we decided to stay and eat. I am very glad that I decided to give the place a second chance because the food is both tasty and reasonably priced. Their chicken is well seasoned and moist so get that.

Pros: Good food, good prices

Cons: Order at the counter, zero ambience
