Went to this place to make sure it was as good as man vs. Food made it seem! Was not disappointed it was delicious, I orders a Milanesa nothing but perfection!! The only reason why I give it a 4 is because of the crazy loud music they have playing, god I can't even Hear my self thinking I had to scream for them to get my order and for a person who talks loud like me to scream it must have have super  loud that they could not hear me!
