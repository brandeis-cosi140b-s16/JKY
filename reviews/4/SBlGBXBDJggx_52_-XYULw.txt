Could not believe how much I loved their carne asada - their sign "Best Carne Asada in Phoenix" wasn't some marketing ploy. I don't know who voted or where this info was published but I don't really care, it was GOOD. Not chewy or rubbery or half burnt - flavorful and delicious. 
I got the signature Vampiro Carne Asada taco with melted cheese, guac and carmelized onion. Just one, but could have eaten two for lunch with only minor regrets (my only complaint is that pulverized lettuce heap on top - any more pulsing in the food processor and that would have been lettuce mush). My dining mates got tortas, and raved. 
As a Mexican food traditionalist, I balked at the "Our beans do NOT contain lard!" sign, but perhaps some more healthful diners out there (and vegetarians) would appreciate that bit of info.
I also ordered an America's Corn - or Mexican Grilled Corn, which is grilled and slathered with mayo (hey, don't knock it til you try it), sprinkled with chili powder and rolled in grated cotija cheese. It was on special that day for $1, but I was immensely unimpressed. Too bad. Maybe I'm just spoiled by Gallo Blanco's version, as that baby'll knock your socks off.
As a special treat (it was my bday after all) I picked up a Mexican coke - yummy out of a glass bottle and with cane sugar instead of chemical crap. We enjoyed the picnic-style patio seating (a little loud with 7th St just feets away) but otherwise a nice spot. Will def come back for a HH, which is $2 Mexican beers (Corona, Dos XX, Tecate, Pacifico) and I want to say $1 tacos but don't hold me to that. 
I have to admit I am a fool for writing them off for a year due to their uninspired name and Dos Gringos-esque branding and atmosphere. But don't make my mistake; this place was fantastic.
