Love this place!  I have lived in Ahawatukee for many years and have been going to this place for years.  When I think of tacos, I think Los Taquitos.  There carne asada is fresh, well seasoned and flavorful.  Also try their supreme breakfast burrito, it is to die for!  It is high quality and really inexpensive.  It's not a sit down restaurant type of place so you may not want to take a date here.  The drawbacks is the sitting place within the restaurant, you don't have many places to sit and when you order to go, make sure to check your food before you leave.  They have a tendency of missing things in your order or not giving you the things your ordered.
