why eat the same old sbarro pizza, wendys, kfc, or any other fast food chains at the fashion show mall when you could eat that anywhere else??? Taco Maker is the perfect place to satisfy the munchies for mexican food. GREAT food, high quality ingredients you can actually taste not like taco bell or del taco where the food is cheap and unhealthy. Taco Maker is NOT like those other fast food mexican chains because they use fresh products and the chips/hardshell tacos are made daily and not kept in storage like those other places. All the meats are delicious and there is a wide variety. Management has changed recently so the quality is much better than it was before. HIGHLY recommend if your ever at the Fashion Show Mall Foodcourt.
