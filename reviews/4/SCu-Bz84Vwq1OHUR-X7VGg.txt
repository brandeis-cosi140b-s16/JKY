1 Carne Asada Taco + 1 Carnitas Taco + 1 Chicken Tamale = $4.19. And you will want seconds. The wholesome and quick-griddled soft corn tortillas are the star of the Tacos - noticeably better than any I've had in town. They're fragrant, toasty and pita-like! The Tamales are very savory, with a generous filling of green chiles and good quality chicken. All of the above items were specifically recommended by the cashier. Saw an Asada Nachos bowl at a neighboring table and was impressed by the looks of it. Great execution here, quality food made with effort. No odd burnt bits of beef or overly grisly pork like you'd might expect from a $1 Taco. I would choose two La Mexicana Tacos vs. one from Tacos El Gordo, everytime.

The 'red' picante-style sauce on the salsa bar is fantastic and packs some heat. One sauce cup per 2 tacos works well. Cheap fountain drinks ($1.25) too!

I am sticking with this place as my go-to Mexican spot, at least until the 2nd location opens (on Durango & Spring Mountain) in a few weeks. And yes, it's better than Roberto's, Baja Fresh, Chipotle, Agave, the Michoacans, and Lotus Of Siam :)

Good quality, cheap, and heartburn-free. My new favorite spot to grub!
