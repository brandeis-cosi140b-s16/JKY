Stumbled on thus on our way to the SMOCA. Someone recommended it once before so stopped in.
The staff was friendly and the food yummy. We both had the Sonoran Enchilada - my sister had it the way it's listed on the menu, I had them add shredded beef to mine. It was really good, the corn patty underneath was a great surprise. I suggest a side of rice, adding a little extra yummy texture to it.
Clean, friendly, good food, and an adorable room with a blue glow!
