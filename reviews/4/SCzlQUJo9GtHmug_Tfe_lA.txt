Monterrey Mexican Restaurant is a great value for mexican cuisine.  It is located in the Black Lion shopping center next to CiCi's Pizza.  Monterrey has a friendly staff and the food is consistently good.  The portion sizes are reasonable, and is usually very busy on the weekends.  During the week it has little to no wait time and the staff is quick to bring chips and salsa. This is a family friendly atmosphere, and offers an outdoor patio for dining.

Would recommend to anyone who enjoys Mexican Cuisine.  

Two thumbs Up.
