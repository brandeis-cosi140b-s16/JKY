If you blink, you'll miss this place. It's next door to Sam's Gentleman's Strip Bar. And it's not technically a food truck, more like an oversized tacos cart. 

This place is great for a late nite taco fix. 
Al Pastor Quesadilla is delicious. Chorizo Tacos are more spicy than you expect from Chorizo. Carne asada is not the best quality meat tho, unless you like ur meat with more fat. But if you can eat around the fat chunks, these are decent. And all the tacos come with grilled onions...yum!!

Burritos are made with bomb refried beans. Like ur momma used to make with extra lard. Lol. Horchata was also freakin delicious! 

Go for that Al Pastor meat if u come here. It's super juicy and flavorful.
