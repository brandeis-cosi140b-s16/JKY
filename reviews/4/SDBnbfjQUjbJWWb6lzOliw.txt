The view is awesome either during the day or night. It's a panoramic view of Las Vegas from Henderson. The food is above average, but the guacamole was dynamite. They make it right at the table with fresh ingredients. My favorite is the fish tacos but the beef ranchero wasn't bad. You can always find a 15% off coupon. Great people and great service.
