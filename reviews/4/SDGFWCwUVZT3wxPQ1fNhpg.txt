YUMMY!  Had both chicken and beef and YUUUUMMMMEEEE!  I'll pay attention to the saltiness I never noticed that, but from what I know I could eat at this place everyday and never get tired of it... And it's not 15 bucks for a meal!  You can get the 2 peice chicken combo for 5 bucks7 bucks for beef... water, bing bang boom you got yourself a nutritious meal, for cheap!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
