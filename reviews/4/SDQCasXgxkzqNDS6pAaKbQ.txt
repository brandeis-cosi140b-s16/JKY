The best mexican I've ever had, hands down. I've been to all the hyped places; Z'Tejas, Chevy's, Gardunos, Macayos, Tia Rosas, Carlsbad Tavern, Blue Adobe, Arribas, Salty Senoria (horrible), Pink Taco (deplorable). The food here is as quality as I've had with mexican. 

I find many mexican places give you little taste with a heavy supply of starch and cheese. Their Carnitas and Lamb Chop are slow roasted and bursting with flavor. Margarita and salsa selection leaves a little to be desired, but this place is a can't miss. Save room for dessert, because the Mexican chocolate cream pie is simply amazing.

Alright I'm cutting back to 4 stars, the plates are great, but the margaritas could be better, and the chips and salsa leaves something to be desired.
