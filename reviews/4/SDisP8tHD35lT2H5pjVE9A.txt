Good news and bad news, mostly good. First the Mussels in red chile broth are truly incredible, good enough to make the reputation of any restaurant. They are a special now but I hope they hang around for awhile. This place has tremendous potential but needs some fine tuning.

The Guacamole is just OK, it's fluffy, lacks density and real avocado flavor, nicely seasoned though and the chips were great. Could be just the bad avocados available in Winter, we shall see after the Spring thaw. Tacos al Chivo [Goat] were the best meat I have had outside of the Cabrito in Nuevo Laredo; as good as the meat was we were not given any salsas, onions or other items to dress our tacos.

Tacos al Carbon were tasty but needed a lot more carbon, next time I will use the two magic words "bien doradito" when ordering them. Which brings up our server, who seemed to be somewhat confused and had a difficult time answering what I thought were fairly straightforward questions. Also, they were out of quite a few items and we were not told until we tried to order them. BAD, VERY VERY BAD!

My GF thought her Tacos de Hongos were unevenly cooked and she was correct but they were still quite good. The rice was rather bland as Mexican rice generally is, however we enjoyed it very much, they were also out of beans-see above. They should keep salt and pepper on the tables as most dishes were very lightly salted. On their Facebook page and most of the photos here all the tacos have double tortillas, we received only single tortillas.

Overall we enjoyed our meal and will return next week, especially if they still have the Mussels*. I understand that they have only been open for a short time and were slammed with more business than they could handle, because of the very early good press they received. If they can iron out the kinks this will be a world class Mexican restaurant.

*We will not make the mistake of sharing an order again.
