Today at work we decided to order Mexican food for lunch.  Someone had mentioned Garcia's, and they also mentioned the "best" Garcia's.  I thought to myself, if you are talking about the Garcia's at Metro Center Mall or near Arrowhead YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!  If this is what you consider to be the "BEST" Garcia's than you are FAR out of line...

Somehow, I knew something was different as soon as I looked at the menu.  First, THE PRICES ARE NOT NEARLY AS EXPENSIVE AS THE CHAIN!!!!  I was pleasantly surprised at the cost of the combination plates.  Second, the menu stated THE ORIGINAL GARCIA'S.  Original I thought?  Hmm...something definitely was different.  Last, I found out it was located on 35th Ave and Encanto.  I knew immediately I was in for a different treat.

I placed my order, chicken flauta with rice and beans for $6.75.  Didn't expect much but was surprised when the meal arrived.  

Observation One: HOLY SALSA.  I am NOT messing around!  They gave me two large salsa containers (one hot, one more pico) for my to go order.  SCORE!  But hey, where are the chips?

Observation Two:  HOLY GUACAMOLE!  Literally!  This stuff wasn't watered down with sour cream.  It didn't have an odd brown color from being too old.  It was super fresh, super delicious, and super avacado-ey.  AND, my flauta was covered in it!

Observation Three:  The flauta was fried to a perfect consistency.  The chicken was not dry, and the flauta was of a reasonable size.  The rice and beans were delicious and mildy flavored.  I added extra salsa to them to kick it up a notch.

After I ate the food I decided to go online and do a little bit of research about them.  Come to find out, the shady and lame flavors of the Garcia's I was accustomed to were from their sold brand...I now know about the authenticity of this location!

In either case, give it a try.  Delicious flavors for an affordable price!
