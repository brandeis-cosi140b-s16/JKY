Chipotles is good, fast and fresh.  They have giant-sized burritos that are stuffed with your choice of ingredients.  They are so big you could probably split one between two people.  Everything is pretty good, but beware the spicy peppers.  Something super HOT snuck into my non-spicy burrito and sent me to tears.  Hopefully it was just a one-time accident because that was painful.  Otherwise, I'm a fan.
