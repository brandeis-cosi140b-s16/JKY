I hadn't realized Dos Reales had closed the first time I came here.  I was in the mood for cheese smothered goodness, and I quickly realized that was not what I'd be getting.  I was disappointed, and the meal I had ordered wasn't the best, so I didn't really plan on coming back.  The reviews here made me decide to give it another chance.

I finally came in for dinner the other night.  It wasn't too crowded, so service was pretty quick.  The food itself was good, but nothing outstanding.  I ordered the enmoladas.  They came with grilled carrots and potatoes, and those were very good, but the rest of the meal was less flavorful than I was hoping.  No major complaints; it just wasn't the best I've had.  Also, they do have a vegetarian section on the menu now, just in case anyone's wondering.

I've also stopped in a couple times to just grab a margarita.  The monster margaritas are very reasonably priced, and when you live across the street, it's super convenient.  My advice?  Get the monster margarita on the rocks.  Every now and then I'm in the mood for a flavored, blended margarita, but when you have 42oz of frozen margarita, it's just too much.  Way too much brainfreeze to enjoy an otherwise delicious margarita.

Overall, I'd recommend the place if you're in the area looking for non-cheese smothered Mexican.  I'll probably be stopping in a time or two more at least for margaritas.
