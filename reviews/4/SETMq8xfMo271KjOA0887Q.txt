Mmmmmmmmm Chico's.  I consider Chico's to be on the high end of the Filiberto's/Eriberto's/Algoberto's type places.  It's good, fast, cheap Mexican food that is heavy and greasy and you want to be sure to have no plans after eating, so that you may lounge around feeling large.   They have a pretty good sized menu, with a few vegetarian options as well.

The chips are good, which is a huge deal to me, as many of the fast food Mexican places have terrible chips.  Salsa is even better, and they have several kinds that you can help yourself to.  Add in a cooler full of beer and some Flan, and I'm una huera muy contenta.
