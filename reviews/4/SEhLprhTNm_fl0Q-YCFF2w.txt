I appreciate this spot because they're clean: in the dining room, the patio, and even the bathroom! The food was average. Then again, I only had a taco. Fair price and you're treated well. Also, a good place to hang out with friends because there is a beautiful  patio with lots of shade and a view of Broadway street.
