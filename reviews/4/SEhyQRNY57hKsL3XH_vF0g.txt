My favorite quick Mexican lunch. The giant carambola is the best value ever. I eat here twice a week for lunch with people from work.

They are quick and the food is great. The only annoying thing is they are kind of skimpy with the salsa. I hate those little jars that you can put 1 chips worth in.

Highly recommend
