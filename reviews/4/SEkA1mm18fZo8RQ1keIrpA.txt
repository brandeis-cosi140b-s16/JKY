We went here the morning of 4/21/2015 and the food was outstanding. We are from Texas and there is no lack of good Mexican food here.

The food at El Dorado was super fresh and super tasty. The service was good, but a bit surly at times. I would say whomever was serving our table is a great employee, but probably needs a different position that does not involve customer interaction.

As others have said, the location is a bit odd, but the food more than makes up for it.
