It's been a while since I've been to Chevy's.  Too long.  I absolutely LOVE their salsa.  Love the smokey/roasted flavor.  Their chips are great too - light & crispy.  They also have a prickly pear margarita that is QUITE tasty.  But really, it's their salsa I go for.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.... mmm, salsa.
