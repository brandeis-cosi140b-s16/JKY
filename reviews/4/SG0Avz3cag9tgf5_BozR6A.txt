Have been here a number of times and really like the place. Although they've taken it off the menu, if you ask, they still do a shrimp quesadilla. It has black beans in it and is really flavorful! Enough for two people if you have a small appetite. Anyway, was in there last week and ordered a white Sangria. At $8 with no fruit in it, except for slices of lemon and lime, I thought it was a bit "up there" from a price standpoint. So, Barrio, if you're reading this, please do something to improve the Sangria. Your customers will appreciate it. The salsa was just right (not too spicy), but the chips were a bit hard and tasted more like pita chips than tortilla chips. Otherwise, no complaints.
