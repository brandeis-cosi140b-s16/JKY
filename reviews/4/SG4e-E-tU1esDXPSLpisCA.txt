I'm pretty pleased with Plaza Bonita.  WAY better than its predecessor, Ketzall.  PB has done a terrific job updating the decor and making the interior feel special - if it weren't for the huge plate glass windows you'd forget you're in a strip mall. 
The menu is diverse, with lots of options beyond the typical Sonoran favorites.  So far I've had a wonderful beef chalupa and super moist pork tamale.  
I totally appreciate bean options - you can get regular refried, whole pinto, or whole black beans here.  
One negative - I didn't particularly care for the salsa, it was a bit too runny and bland for me.  Otherwise, this is good utility Mexican food!  Keep it up, PB!
