Saw this on Diner's and dives,  While it may appear to be a typical fast food place located in a gas station the food is so much better than the other 'to's' places, like poliburto'a, filibrto's, losbeto's,etc.  Service is generally fast, the al astor is a favorite of mine as are the carne asada taco's.  They even deliver to the surrounding area.
