Well, the staff could be friendlier, but what do you expect from an airport, primarily to-go food, in Vegas later in the evening, right?  

Look, it's an AIRPORT.  And a not-so-new one on top of that.  Food is pricier than outside the airport in general.  They won't have the best staff in the world (like friggin DUH).  It's in VEGAS, they are serving tons of silly drunk travellers which I'm sure is NOT very fun to deal with.  

I usually have really high standards for service and hospitality, but, in this case, I say give them a f*ckin break.

Why am I giving them this many stars?  Well, their food was really good.  I expected to pay quite a bit because it's in an airport, and yet, the taste of their burrito actually exceeded my expectations.

I ordered a Garlic Lime burrito with prawns, with a bottle of water.  The burrito had a perfect balance of tangy lime and a bit of heat, with Spanish (tomato based ) rice and grilled prawns, all wrapped up, piping hot.  

Honestly, I would pay a few extra bucks to eat their burrito over other typical airport food any day.

The only thing I wish they had, were more fresh/healthy side selections.  I would have loved to tack on a little side salad or a fruit bowl to my order but I didn't see any.  But still, I didn't feel too guilty about my food choice, especially compared to Mega-Chain junk food places also stationed in this airport.

Hence, my first experience at 360 Gourmet Burrito results in a pretty happy 4 stars.  Will totally buy food from them again the next time I am stopping by this airport.
