I was hesitant to try this place given some of the early reviews, but I was hoping the new owners would make a go of it where several others have failed so we decided to give it a try tonight.  I'm so glad I did.

We were seated promptly--it was not busy--and our hostess asked if it was our first visit.  When we said yes, she explained some things about the food, the menu, and the restaurant.  She then left and got our iced teas.

I ordered the new pollo con mole which is not the chicken listed on their online menu.  They recently replace the pollo limon with the pollo mole.  My wife ordered the pork Yucatan pibil.  With the meals came a soup or salad and we both got the black bean soup.  It had an excellent flavor, but there was one thing missing.  The soup is pureed black beans and I would have liked some chopped or whole beans for texture.  Still, it was very tasty.

Our main dishes were excellent!  The mole on my chicken was rich and had great flavors.  I liked it because it wasn't heavy on the chocolate which I find with some restaurants.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed her pork Yucatan.  Portions were large enough we each could have brought some home for lunch tomorrow, but I, of course, pigged out and ate all of my chicken.

For dessert, we shared--sort of--a large piece of tres leches cake.  Yelpers note: with a check in and the purchase of an entree, you get a dessert.  They also have free wifi.

Service was excellent all night.  The manager came over and spoke with us about our dinners, and our iced tea was always refilled promptly.  

I am so glad I gave Baja California a chance.  We will be back!
