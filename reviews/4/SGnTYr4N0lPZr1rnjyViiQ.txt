i graduated college 3 years ago... i'm not a south side person anymore. it's fun once in a while, but i'm just really over the super crowded bars with people trying to dance all over you and drinks that are half the size and double the price. but i end up on carson street often for concerts, and when i'm early and need somewhere to grab a drink, i always feel my options (of places i'll like anyway) are limited. so, i was killing time before a show at club cafe and my boyfriend suggested this "really cool taco place across the street". i was not disappointed.
yo rita is small. we were two of three customers when we walked in. one bartender and one cook on duty. yep, my kind of place! i got the hibiscus margarita (love flavored margs that aren't frozen, and that's often hard to try) which was delish and not TOO sweet. then we ordered food. we split the empanada. it was tasty but extremely small - they aren't kidding when they say small plates. we each got a taco - yes, one singular taco, normal size soft shell, but surprisingly filling. i got the veal one, which was excellent.
we each had a shot of tequila (which our bartender gave us a summary lesson on because neither of us drink much tequila) and hit the road.
i really liked hanging out here - it was chill, good drinks, good food, nice service. but there's a reason it only got 4 stars. the food is TINY portions. the prices AREN'T tiny. one or the other should step up their game, i don't even care which.
