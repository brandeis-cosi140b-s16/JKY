I was a Cuban stuck in Vegas due to a storm.  A friend easily cheered me up by taking me to a place that prepared dishes like my grandmother, perhaps because its mostly Cuban staff with owner onsite.  Great palomilla steak and tostones.   Mojitos excellent mixed in classic island style.  get the appetizer plate with drinks for sure.  

Hasta la proxima!
