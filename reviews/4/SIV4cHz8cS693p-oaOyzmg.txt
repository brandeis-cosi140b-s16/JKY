My biggest complaint is that they are not open on Monday.  Seems I always crave the sol on mondays.  They have an excellent selection of combos to choose from.  Quick service, limited dining area.  El Sol is owned by the same family that owns El Zocalo down the street.  Same great food, slightly cheaper pricing and quicker service.  Truly a treat.  Their baked goods are too die for as well.
