Good location for those who work in the mall. Prices are almost the same as any other location off the strip which is great. But as it is on the strip and in a mall, depending on the time, may be a line (as with every other chipotle location)

Came here to buy lunch for a friend who was working. Ordered a burrito bowl to go. First person didn't put much rice, even after asking for extra rice. Almost seemed like a normal amount at any other location. The steak was cooked perfectly (on sight, dunoe taste since i wasnt the one eating it) medium rare. Added mild salsa with hot salsa on the side. sour cream and corn. Asked for cheese as well. This was the first place to "evenly" put cheese over the entire bowl (which meant more cheese than the one who was eating it was used to. 

Overall, good experience. 

Random note - saw someone making a burrito that was ahead of us. They stuffed it SOO much, that the first tortilla broke. Used a second tortilla to fix. Oh my god that burrito was at least a pound or two. D:
