This place was awesome, flat out. We went here on a tip from my future mother-in law, and it was fantastic. Friendly and attentive service from the staff, a BANGIN' Cadillac margarita, and best of all, awesome eats! I had the carnitas. This perfect portion of pork was nice and moist, and flavorful beyond belief! Another point for the hand-made tortillas that are "hecho con amor".

We all cabbed it here, and when we were done, the waiter went outside to flag us a cab! Now THAT is good service! We WILL return!
