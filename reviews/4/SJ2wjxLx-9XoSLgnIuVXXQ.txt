I work right around the corner from Andale and try to get by there at least once a week. I'm a huge fan of the Chicken Enchiladas and the Carne Asada Fries myself. They also recently told us that they'd be willing to make different dishes and soups from scratch if we let them know ahead of time since we are regulars... where else are you going to find great service like that!
