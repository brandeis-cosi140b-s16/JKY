Always skeptical of a cool name, I still managed to be lured into Pink Taco. I braced myself, because my expectations always run way too high when I like the name of a place. Pink Taco, however, lived up to the hype in my head.

Salient pink and funky decor set the vibe in this place. The three salsas that come with your chips slap you silly as you decide what to order. The taco menu is what I came for. I was happy to see some variety. I ended up going for the fish tacos. I asked for no rice and beans and our server offered to substitute vegetables. A kind gesture--but they were a little greasy and odd tasting. Upset stomach problems were imminent.

The fish tacos are a subtle masterpiece. Nothing about the description prepared me for their goodness. I was expecting a disappointment. The place was too cool, the salsa too good, but every dog has his day. I think it's Pink's serrano-cilantro sauce that helps make this an outstanding taco. The batter on the fish is also quite tasty. I wanted to slap the chef the tacos were so good. 

Thus far I've only found one other fish taco worth jabbering about on my taco journey and this one has supplanted Berryhill's in Houston's fish taco. In fact, it has buried it.
