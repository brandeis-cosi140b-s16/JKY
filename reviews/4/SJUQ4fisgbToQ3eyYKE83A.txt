I have eaten at Chipotle many times in Cali, this was my first in Vegas.

Well its a chain, so it is pretty uniform as it relates to the quality of food, it is good and fresh, pretty well priced, quick and easy.

The one thing that did stand out here is the beer and margaritas! LOL only in Vegas and right across from the university as well! Go UNLV!
