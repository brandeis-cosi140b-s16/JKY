After walking around shopping,  what is a better way to sit down, relax and enjoy a fresh veggie bowl.. yummmm. The mild and hot sauce is super delicious!!! Yummm.
Brown rice, bell peppers and onions, black beans, sour cream, corn, all three sauce, a little bit of their guacamole, cheese and lettuce.  Two squeezed lemons and Booooom. Delishhhhh
Im so needy, I need hot sauce inside my bowl anddddd extra hot sauce on the side as well. :))

Great and friendly customer service!!!!
