Wasnt expecting to find street tacos in Pittsburgh and was in for a nice treat. The tacos were reasonably priced at $2.50 each. It took me about 3 of them to fill me up. You get to sauce your tacos yourslf and the gauc sauce wasnt extra! There's no way I'm going back to Chipotle after finding this place.
