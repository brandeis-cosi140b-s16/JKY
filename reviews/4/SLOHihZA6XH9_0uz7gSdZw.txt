Very good food.

Small local place, not easy to find.  But well worth the effort.

Had a carne asada torta, chicken enchilada and quesadilla to share between two people.  It was a lot of food...and it was all good.

This is one of those places that really makes me wonder how chain mexican restaurants attract customers...let alone stay in business.
