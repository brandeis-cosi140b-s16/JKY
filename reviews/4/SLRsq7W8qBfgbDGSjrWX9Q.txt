This place is one of the better Taco Bells I have been to, the service is usually pretty fast. The employees are cheerful and dish out good manners. It's always clean inside, as well as the bathrooms. And when it is busy they are usually on top of keeping the tables clean. Drive thru is also pretty quick as well. If you are in the mood for tacos and are in the area I recommend stopping at this Taco Bell, it is also a Long John Silvers so if tacos is not what you want you can have some fish
