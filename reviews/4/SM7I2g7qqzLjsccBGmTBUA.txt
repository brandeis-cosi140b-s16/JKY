ROCKING guac they make at your table - so fresh. Waiter recommended a lighter, white con queso which was a $1 side - perfect. Caesar salad was delicious too. Marg flight was ok. In general a little too much sour mix but the blood orange math was the best for sure. Nice staff and overall I'd recommend --
