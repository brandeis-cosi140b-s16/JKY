Can you say homemade tortillas??! OMG!!
This place is HUGE!!!  We were seated by the window facing Maryland Pkwy in one of those curvy window alcoves like families go to with kids in a Wendy's.  It was kinda comforting.  We drained our water glasses and tried to get the waiter to leave a pitcher to no avail.
However, we split mixed fajitas (beef, chicken and shrimp) and it came with bell peppers, onions + beans/rice/guac and the evil sour cream.  Both of us got fideo free with the meal.  Chips were good, salsa okay, bean dip decent.
The best and most surprising thing was the tortillas - we had flour - they were so warm and beautifully mis-shapen in homemade-esque fashion.  So we got more and just ate them when the fajitas ran out.
Note..the menu is as big as the place.  Bigger menu than even the Michoacan restaurants I think, if you can believe that.
