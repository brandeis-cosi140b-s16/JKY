I love the entire atmoshpere of this place. Both the indoor and outdoor seating areas are very warm and inviting. All of my meals have been delicious and very well prepared with various flavors of the southwest. Food is always fresh and the extentive selections keep me coming back for more. 
My service has always been outstanding and I love the wine selection. A very quaint getaway!
