In a city full of great Mexican restaurants it's hard to differentiate yourself from the crowd. Let's admit it, we all have our favorites... so we had to admit being a bit jaded when asked to try Caldero by a friend. (okay we admit, we even put off going for a few weeks). We were wrong, and we fully admit our mistake... see we can act maturely! Located on Thomas, east of Scottsdale Rd., Caldero impressed us with their unique Mexican food at very affordable prices. Looking for the standard Americanized Mexican... you won't get that here. Instead you will find authentic regional dishes prepared with care and handed down by the owner's mother, who still oversees all the sauces. And the sauces are what sets Caldero apart from the pack. I'll let you in on one of our 'little secrets'... want to judge a Mexican Restaurant... ask to taste their Mole Sauce. If they don't offer Mole... run.  I can vouch that the Mole sauce here passed the test with flying colors, great consistency, not too sweet, right amount of kick. Yep, they had us at the Mole.
