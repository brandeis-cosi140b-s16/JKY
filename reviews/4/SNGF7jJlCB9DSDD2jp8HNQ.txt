This place has delicious breakfast burritos... huuuuuuuuuuge breakfast burritos. The have a variety of different breakfast burritos, so many ti choose from. They use fresh vegetables, real meat, and all fresh ingredients. The Burritos are soooooo good and sooooooo filling! I would eat them all day everyday if I could... the one reason it didnt get the 5th Star... is the price... its not over the top expensive... but just a tad bit for breakfast. Its not that expensive, again... only a tad bit ... Oh, well and they dont have breakfast tacos, at least thts wht the guy said... only Breakfast Burritos I'd definitely recommend it for those looking for great breakfast burritos!
