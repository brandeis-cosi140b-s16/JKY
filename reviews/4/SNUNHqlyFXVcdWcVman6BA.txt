My significant other and myself stopped here to take something home. She heard nothing but good reviews about this place so we decided to give it a try.
We were greeted promptly, from a couple of employees with smiles. We let them know we were ordering take out and were told someone would be with us shortly, which someone came out in a a minute.
We ordered our food, which she got a some type of chimichanga, and I got the Monday dinner special. The food came out in about 10 minutes, and we had a 10 minutes drive home. (Also, not sure if this matters, but our food came out on plates with plastic wrap around in, everything given to us in a box lid)
We chose well. Granted my tostada and taco wasn't cripsy because it was wrapped, it had really good flavor. As a matter of fact the whole plate tasted good. From the rice, to the refried beans, taco, enchilada, and tostada was well worth $8.99. Even the chips and salsa were good.
I am sure I would have given this place 5 stars if we were able to experience this place eating inside.
