So I must admit that my wife and I basically ate here by default on New Year's Day.  We were at MGM for the Justin Timberlake concert and were looking for a decent place to have dinner before the show.  Just about every other restaurant at MGM had about a 45 minute wait.  We didn't check the buffet or Rainforest Cafe, mainly because their buffet is terrible, and I'm not eating at Rainforest Cafe when I'm on vacation.

Anyway, we came upon Hecho en Vegas, which is located close to where you enter the arena.  My wife and I had just eaten Mexican at Javier's the day before, so we were a bit skeptical about eating it again.  But, it was either that or the food court, so we chose Hecho en Vegas.  They quoted us a wait time of about 20 minutes, but it was more like 10 minutes.  The restaurant is loud, fun, and vibrant.  I honestly had very low expectations going into dinner.  We were seated and were quickly given chips and salsa.  I thought they chips and salsa were good, but were certainly a cut below Javier's.  I preferred the green salsa to the red.

Our server was very friendly, and took the time to answer any questions we had about the menu.  For our meals, we each ordered two enchiladas, which came with rice and black beans.  I ordered one chicken with red sauce, and one cheese with a white cheese sauce.  I thought everything was really good, so I have to say that this place far exceeded my expectations.  My wife agreed that her food was good as well.

For as much as I really despise the MGM hotel, I can't say anything negative about Hecho en Vegas.  The food is good, the people are nice, and the environment is fun.  I wouldn't hesitate to eat here again if I was in the mood for Mexican food.
