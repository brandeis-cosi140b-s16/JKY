We come to this location often for breakfast,  lunch & dinner. Unlike some of the other reviews posted, food has always been consistent,  hot (which is one of my review hot buttons), price point is good, portion is great. We started coming for the breakfast chorizo burrito recently when Starbucks dinky expensive and chilled center sandwich straw broke the camels back.  This breakfast burrito is huge & can be shared depending on who is sharing. I took off 1 star because the coffee is not kept up,  sits cooking in a pot. Not recommended for the coffee.  Starbucks should stick to coffee,  not food, Los should stick to the food not coffee.  Enjoy here very much!
