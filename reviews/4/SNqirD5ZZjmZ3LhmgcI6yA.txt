Here's why I'm only giving a 4: 

I love Blanco -- I've been to the location in Tucson more times than I can remember, so when I left Sky Harbor and realized I could have Blanco in Phoenix, I was psyched. 

Service was excellent, and we hit happy hour, but unfortunately, at this location, I felt that the kitchen was a little lazy. I got my favorite BBQ pulled pork tacos, but they were missing the slaw and onions that take their flavor from delicious to HOLY TACO HEAVEN. 

Don't let my review sway you, check this place out. But maybe try one of the other locations? Hopefully management will take this as a heads up, and I'll be able to update my review. Until then, you'll find me in Tucson watching the sunset with the Blanco Mango Jalapeno Margarita (and my tacos done just right).
