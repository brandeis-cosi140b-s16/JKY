Always a good place to get filled up-twice even sometimes. Service at this location has always been the best out of any location I've been to. I really wish they still had the Mole and a few other choices that made this place unique.

Hands down though, this will always beat some other greasy fast food place if you are in a hurry. Oh yeah, $1 taco's on Tuesday's make for a great, quick, cheap meal.
