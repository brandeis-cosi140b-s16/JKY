My 3rd review of a Guy Fiero-visited joint.. 2 here in Phoenix metro and one in Flagstaff.

This is TRULY a little strip mall dive.  Walk up and order, industrial-strength seating (i.e. hard/indestructible), etc.  None of that is a bad thing at all.. just trying to be sure everyone's expectations are set properly.  I wasn't sure if this was a sit-down joint or not, based on all I'd seen/read.  Now I know.  Frankly, I prefer it this way.

The tacos looked mighty good and I HAD to try them.  But I was also lured by the cheese crisp, with carne asada.  $6 for a combo with no steak, only $6.75 with.  Holy cow, there was a TON of steak in this thing, and it was humangous!  But it wasn't what I'd call a cheese crisp, it was really a quesadilla, at least by all of my past Mexican food experiences.  Nonetheless, it was pretty tasty, and a BIG meal by the time you threw in the beans & rice (which were very average).  I also got a chicken taco, on corn tortillas.  The tortillas are tiny, but they load the thing up with a lot of meat and fixins, so at $1.15 (!), they're an awesome deal, and VERY tasty.

On the Brak-o-meter, the taco rates a solid 5 stars, the cheese crisp a good 3.5 stars, and value rates 5.. for a composite average of 4 or thereabouts.  I wouldn't necessarly advise you to drive way across town for this place, but if you're anywhere in the immediate area or passing through, it's definitely worth a bite.
