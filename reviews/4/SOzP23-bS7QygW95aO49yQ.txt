We loved it! We like the bar side. I agree the other side looks a little cafeteria like. I think they decorated like that to match the complex. We went for happy hr. their regular margaritas are great and they are only like three bucks. The food was delicious and fresh. We plan to go back many more times. The salsa is addicting!
