I really like this place, especially for happy hour! My boyfriend and I stop by here every couple of weeks and this place never disappoints. The staff is always friendly and nice and the food is also good. Try their carne asada tacos in their happy hour menu, they are pretty basic but good. I also like their chicken tortilla soup.
