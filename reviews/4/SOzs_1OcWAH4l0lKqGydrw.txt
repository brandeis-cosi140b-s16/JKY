I enjoyed my $7 birthday meal of grilled gourmet shrimp tacos with rice & beans and only paid $1 something. Rubio's gets kudos for their e-mail club with this awesome birthday deal. 
The grilled shrimp tacos come with bacon, avocado and a yummy white sauce. Add picante salsa and it's the best meal ever! The restaurant is clean, service is fast and they serve consistently fresh and tasty food.
