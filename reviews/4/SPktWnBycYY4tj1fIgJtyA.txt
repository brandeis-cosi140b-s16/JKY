There were four of us at dinner with the food arriving somewhat sequentially. This is not family style, but somewhat of a  "share if you like style", which doesn't always work that well if there are only three tacos w four people. However, everything was cooked to perfection. We sampled each other's plates and agreed that the chicken mole was the best dish. If you want to talk at the table, however, don't get seated near the boisterous bar area. There were men high five-ing and laughing loudly. Ask for seating away from that area unless you're wanting to sit and just watch the singles.  There does appear to be a big singles scene there...
