Wife and i went here as we were staying at Blue Green Resort.  Chips and salsa were very good, and the margaritas were excellent too. Not the fastest bartender but she did a great job making them. Wife had chicken enchiladas which she said were very good.  I had tacos al pastor which were also very good.  We have truly been to hundreds if not a thousand mexican restaurants over the past 40-50 yrs and this was certainly good enough to come back to again.  Staff was very friendly, place is very clean and worth the visit.
