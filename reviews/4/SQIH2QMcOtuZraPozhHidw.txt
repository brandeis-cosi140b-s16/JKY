Got up this morning after a long night of food, entertainment, and gambling. I was hungry with a capital H. I decided to give this place a go. I ordered an omlette with tomatoes, green peppers, ham, onions , pepper jack cheese, and mushrooms. White toast and no potatoes. The omlette was very tasty and I enjoyed it very much.

 This is a nice quick option if you dont have time for room service
