This review has been a long time due for Salsa's. This place has great salsas (as it should!) and drink specials all week long. The service is quick and impeccable as they are very attuned to your requests. 

The last time we came here we had literally 30-40 minutes to order, eat and get to our movie. They know my husband and I so well that we don't even have to ask for the various salsas or even drinks! 

They have recently revamped their menu and have added many different dishes aside from their usual fare. There are many different vegetarian options as well that are very good. The side of vegetables that accompany many of the dishes are cooked to perfection with the right amount of seasoning. The portions are rather large and can even be split between 2 people. 
 
My only qualm would be their house margarita - I do not care for the pre-mixed drinks that are more sour mix than tequila so I steer clear of that. Other than that, great choice for any meal, even an impromptu quick weekday dinner.
