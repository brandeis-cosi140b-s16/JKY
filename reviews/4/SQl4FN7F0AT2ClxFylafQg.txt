This was my first time at La Loma today.  My friend and I stood there waiting because we didn't know we had to seat ourselves.  We finally realized it and then even had to go to the counter to get our menus where we discovered that is where you also place your order.  We sat down and looked over the menu.  Everything looked good.  I love chili rellenos, but I have a problem with the ones that are served omelet style as I feel you are too lazy to make them properly.  We did order and our food came in a decent amount of time.  The food was absolutely delicious.  I cleaned my plate.
The restaurant is spotlessly clean and so is the ladies' room.  The counter servers were friendly. I think the prices were okay, could be about a dollar cheaper on the entrees.
