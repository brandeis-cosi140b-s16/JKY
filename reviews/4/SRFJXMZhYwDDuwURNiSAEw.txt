I love this place!!! Better than the other huge franchise in the valley. The cashier is so sweet and the food is always great. I hesitated going for awhile, because from the street it's not that impressive and if you're from here you know that getting good food here is a crap shoot. But I was running late one day so gave it a shot. The carne asada burrito is so good and the rolled taco supreme is just beyond words. Tricky to eat, but amazing. Wasn't crazy about their milk cake though, it was soggy, like it had been frozen and defrosted
