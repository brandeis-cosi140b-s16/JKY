I've been meaning to hit Eva's as soon as I moved here, but never actually went until now. I've been to the other location for lunch and it was ok. The Eva's on Pinal is awesome. As soon as I sat down the chips, salsa and bean dip appeared in front of me. The bartender, Brad gave me a few beers to sample. I'm a beer snob and this is the first place in Casa Grande that I've been too where I had choices beyond Sam Adams Draft or Fat Tire Bottles (not that there's anything wrong with that, but I like variety). Granted, they didn't have any beers I loved, but whatever. I didn't want to sit home alone and drink awesome beer; I wanted to go out, damnit!

I had the barbacoa platter. It came out fast! It tasted great. The rice had an interesting texture. I got it with black beans. I also got a side of guac, just because I like guac. The entree was definitely awesome. Great flavor. The service was spectacular. After my first beer I was thinking I wanted something else. I asked if they do mojitos. Brad said he would make me one but the mint was old and he would have to use a sugar packet instead of simple syrup so it wouldn't be the best. I decided to try wine instead. There was one called Sangre Del Toro. I just wanted to try if based on the name alone. Maybe I was a chupacabra in a past life. The manager let Brad open it just so I could get a taste. I ended up ordering a glass. It was very drinkable. I would go back just based on customer service alone. 

Oh and the decor! It is the nicest looking restaurant in Casa Grande. It's huge, it's clean, it's hot. The architecture, the art, the everything is muy bueno.
