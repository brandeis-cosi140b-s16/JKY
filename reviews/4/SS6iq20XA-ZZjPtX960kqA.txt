Nice hidden treasure in the Queen Creek downtown area.  I ordered iced tea to drink, and it was most excellent - definitely tasted fresh brewed.  I also had a guacamole tostada, which I give 5 stars to.  In addition, I tried a green and a red enchilada.  They were pretty good, but I had to take them home because even though they were a la carte, they filled an entire plate each.  Service was excellent.  Prices were very low.  The only reason I didn't give Rudy's 5 stars is the salsa was good, but not great.  Definitely a place I would recommend!
