I love Federico's on 32nd.  Easy jump from Scottsdale open 24 hours a day.

I usually stick to the steak, egg, and cheese Burrito.  It's is large and under $5.  The drive thru is quick except for lunch time and 2 A.M.

The Enchiladas and Tacos are great and the combo plate is a lot of food.  The rice is good but the beans leave something to be desired, I like a creamy refried bean myself.  These are not that good.
