I chose Gonzales Y Gonzales for convenience and I was really hoping for somewhere that offered options that catered to everyone. They have a separate vegetarian section! Score. Located inside the New York, New York Hotel & Casino, this little Mexican restaurant featured some different options I've never seen before. Pork belly in an enchilada!? Chipotle mashed potatoes with crispy potatoes inside a taco!? They also feature fresh guacamole made at your table, even guacamole that included pesto in it! I ordered the combo with a taco and enchilada, and that taco was awesome! The cilantro rice was an interesting addition. She got the tres enchiladas that included, shredded brisket, shrimp and pork belly. Overall I enjoyed my meal and was glad they had options for everyone.
