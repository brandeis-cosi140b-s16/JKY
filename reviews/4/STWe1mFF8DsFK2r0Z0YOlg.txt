Went there on a slow Sunday with some hiking buddies.  The place is more appealing inside.  Nice warm atmosphere that can accommodate larger groups.  The menu has plenty of choices and the food is good though not excellent  I had the California Burrito which is vegetarian but I also added chicken. Complimentary salsa and chips.  Beer and wine only and those are limited in choices. Pleasant service.   OVerall a good experience.  I will be back.
