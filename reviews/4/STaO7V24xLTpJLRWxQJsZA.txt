I love this place, so much so that we're having our rehearsal dinner for our wedding here. There's a good story to that, too. When we first spoke to the manager (I'm pretty sure it was the manager) he said that the patio was taken the night we wanted to reserve it. A few months later though, the patio opened up and he called us to let us know. I was pleasantly surprised to know he had kept our contact information all this time and thought to follow through with us, too.
Besides having great customer service, their food is good, too. I love their beef chimichaunga and it's delicious every time.
