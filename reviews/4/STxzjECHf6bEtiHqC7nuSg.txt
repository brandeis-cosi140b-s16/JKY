This was my first time at Gran Agave and I went at lunch with my husband. Being from TX any time I spot a new-to-me Mexican place I have to try it.

We both ate the complimentary chips and salsa, which were good. My husband ordered the beef burrito with refried beans and rice. He generally doesn't care much for Mexican food, but Mexican being my favorite I drag him everywhere. He liked everything he had here. 

I ordered the number 8 off the regular menu (they have a small lunch menu) which consisted of an enchilada (in my case, beef), tamales, rice, and refried beans. Though it is a simple thing I was delighted to see they had tostadas as a lot of places in Pittsburgh don't. I added a tostada with just cheese on it to my order. I meant the creamy nacho/ dip type cheese, but the melted white shredded cheese was good. The beans were good and obviously freshly made, not your generic mass ordered premade stuff. The rice was good, though not my favorite ever. The enchilada was a good and familiar taste like the ones I had growing up in west Texas. What I really liked though was the tamale. It reminded me of home. The way it was made reminded me of the homemade tamales my dad used to buy from his coworkers. Though the beef and pintos on top were good I quickly scraped them off to get to that old familiar taste. I am getting a plate of tamales next time we go there.
