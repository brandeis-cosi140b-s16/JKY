Traveling through Charlotte? This is right off of I-77, open late and was a great place for a quick meal- we were in and out in about 30 minutes without being in any huge rush. It was a nice break from rest stop fast food options. 

Food was standard American-Mexican style. Lots of cheese, not terribly spicy or flavorful, really, and the standard menu choices. Portions were absolutely insane, which means a bonus snack further along your route if you take leftovers. 

We had queso, fajitas and a combination plate for $26. Plus, free sopaipillas for dessert!  Service was curt and efficient, which worked fine for us.
