Holy Frijoles! 
This is one damn good place to get a burrito. Bringing home a bean and cheese burrito from Frederico's is like bringing home a delicious, oozing, salsa-fying, two pound, mouth watering bundle of joy! Except you don't have to bail it out of jail for stealing that cop car on spring break or pay for it's college education. The deal here is that it costs less than $3!

This is my new addiction. I seriously can't get enough and that could be dangerous, but I'm not sure more for whom or for what; my wallet, my waistline or for the people in the surrounding vicinity of my backside. :-)
