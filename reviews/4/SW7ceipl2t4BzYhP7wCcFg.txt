This place is great.  It's beautifully decorated and has a light and airy feel due to the ample natural light from the windows.

I have to note than I hail from Texas, and I didn't think the chips and salsa were quite as exciting as other reviewers have mentioned... That, however, didn't stop me from eating a good basket or two while I waited for my entr√©e. (I'm a sucker for these types of starters at any restaurant!) :P

I had the Combo Two with a shredded beef chimichanga (at the recommendation of fellow Yelpers) and a chicken enchilada.The pico de gallo is a must-request with the combo dishes.  It was fresh and delicious and probably my favorite part of the meal! Again, I wasn't blown away by the chimichanga despite the rave reviews, but I enjoyed it along with the enchilada and found the meal to be quite satisfying overall.

As a whole package (ambiance+food+service), the experience was great and I would definitely go back. I have my eye on the carnitas for next time.
