Ok, I've been a big Richardson's fan since back in the day and love the Rokerij as well. I've been going there since literally before it opened (the dry run) and have always had good food and service that ranges from acceptable to great with one notable exception. On that occasion I called and complained just to make the manger aware and she made it right and made it impossible to complain any further. This is an insider place that I tell and take out of town business guests to as well. Although I liked it more before the remodel when it was a bit more formal and different from Richardson's. Now the menus are much more similar but Rokerij has tapas items, I think they call small plates almost all of which are awesome, especially the Brie Toasts with Steak. I remember when they first changed the menu we went in and someone said, "Wait a minute, this is the same as the damn Richardson's menu", we looked at each other and said, "Sweet" and enjoyed our meals anyway. My cork-dork friends like the wine list and I like the cocktails. The atmosphere is nice but casual, dark wood, big booths, fireplace and etc. they have a decent bar downstairs (and one upstairs as well) where you can also eat if you want to sit in a line at the bar (also three booths and another fireplace with couch and club chairs) but it makes me a bit claustrophobic to be locked in there. Parking is easy with the new lot they added and the place is busy most nights of the week so if you are going with a group call ahead.
