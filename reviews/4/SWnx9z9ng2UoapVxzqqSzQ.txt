Went here today, March 19/12, and we totally enjoyed our meals.  This place is not fancy and, in fact is the anti-fancy, but we don't care so long as the food is good.

I had the Red Jade Chicken, which was crispy deep fried deliciousness, along with the Egg Foo Yung.  My sides were Jerk Fried Rice and Black Beans.  Everything was really good and nothing was greasy.  I wasn't too sure about such a combo but I'll be ordering that same combo next time I go.  My hubby had the Quesadilla and I believe it had only cheese but then you'd get a little bite of ginger which popped that Quesadilla up to another level.  It was really good and, again, not oily.  He also had the Chinese Barbecued Pork, along with the Black Beans and Chicken Fried Rice and I asked him if he'd order the same again and he said, "You bet!" so he definitely enjoyed his meal as well.  To top it off, they delivered our meals to the table with cookies for dessert and I'm here to say that those cookies were very, very good.  Can't beat a free cookie either!  

Needless to say, we were both really full when we left.
