This location would receive 5 Stars but every time I go thru the drive-thru, they rush me and never put everything in my order bag. I end up missing items that I have paid for and I never feel like dealing with getting my stuff back. I'm a regular here and I didn't think I'd have this issue but I do. The dine in service here is good. They're very polite and at tentative to my service. The inside is vey very clean and stocked with condiments.
