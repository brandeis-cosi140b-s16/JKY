I'd say I go to Chipotle every two weeks or so and this is usually the spot I go to. 
(This location is the closest to me, but even if it wasn't, I would still choose this location over the one on Las Vegas Boulevard)

For the most part, the servers give you a good amount of food! The one thing I always fear about heading to Chipotle is that I get jipped on certain things. 

I'd say this location needs a little better handle on its cleanliness (there's usually napkins and stuff scattered around the drink area), but overall, it's nowhere near dirty to the point where you can't bear it.
