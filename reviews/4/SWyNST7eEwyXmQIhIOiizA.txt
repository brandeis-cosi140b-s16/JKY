This is the best Frybread place I have had in a long time.  It's a bit heavy on the stomach but it is "Fry" bread.   I would say that though the food is good it's not the most accommodating place for kids.  The tables and their arrangement make it difficult to bring the family with you.

It's worth trying though!
