OK, seriously people. What the fudge is up with all of the signs? was there a sale on ink cartridges at Office Depot?

I know I complained about the handmade, ridiculous signs that the Revo folks have covering the beautiful, tasteful decor in my last review. But I swear the things are reproducing like rabbits. Now there is a kids menu taped to the back of each register, a framed, printed review on the counter, a tent sign and chalkboard in the middle of the dining room with a review taped to it, and I swear to god, there was a microphone behind the counter that they were using to call orders back to the kitchen, like it is a 1980s Burger King.

I love love love the food at Revo, but please don't let the place get out of control so soon.
