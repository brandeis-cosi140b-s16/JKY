Great food poolside at the Palms for not much money...really?  Absolutely.

The Mexican food isn't the greatest ever, not by a damn sight, but it is good.  The chips are always warm and nice, the margaritas are excellent and there is always a lot of food.

The main reason to go is for the pool scene.  You get to sit next to the pool, in the shade, and stare at half dressed hard bodies while eating good good.  If that doesn't sound good to you, it is NOT the place for you.

Cheap. Casual. Solid food every time, and I have been there at least 20 times.  Good times.
