Take advantage of online ordering (or phone app ordering) to order ahead and then walk in, skip the line, and pick up your food! It's great! The online and app ordering process is very easy, and lets you highly customize your order. Once you place your order, you're given a time when your order will be ready, and that time has never been more than 15 minutes from when I hit "send."  My only problem is that there are a few items missing: you can't order a kid's meal or a simple side of rice or beans. Other than that, it's a very efficient way to place an order.

At this location, there are a couple of nearby "restaurant only - 15 minutes" parking spots.  Order ahead, use one of these parking spots, and you're in and out in no more than 5 minutes.
