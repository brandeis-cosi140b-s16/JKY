great chicken!  i dont do the sides. i try to just eat the chicken, peel the skin, salsa, and sneak a small pce of tortilla. 

i'm getttin this tonight. 

i forget about this place sometimes, and i dont know why. the service is always great, and the food is hot. Contrary to the name, the chicken hasnt made me crazy......well crazIER.
