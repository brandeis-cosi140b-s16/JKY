I miss Amado's carne asade burritos!!!!! It's less than $5 and you can get a huge horchata with it! Aaaaaaaaargh! Makes me mad that I left AZ!

And everything on the menu is really cheap, too! Plus, they're open 24 hours... but don't go late otherwise you'll run into the drunk people coming from the Tempe/Scottsdale bars! 

Authentic Mexican food.. as everyone there is Mexican and very, very friendly.
