Been here twice now - friendly staff, nice environment with a good choice of Margarita's and more. I was given a free guacamole coupon at the nearby Hyatt Place (ask for one!) and so started with a free dish of table side guacamole (3 avacodo's) followed by taco's with all the trimmings and two excellent margarita's. then a free Hyatt shuttle to a good night's sleep!
