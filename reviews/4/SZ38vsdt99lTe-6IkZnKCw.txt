Had the pleasure of trying this place out for the first time today. Really great choice if you want some fresh and flavorful Mexican Food. 

After choosing what you want to eat you can decide what ingredients you want inside the same way you would at a Chipotle. My friend ordered four street tacos ($5.59) and I ordered the wet burrito (~$8). We were really impressed by the various types of meats they offered here, I think there was about 5 or 6. My friend got each of his tacos a different flavor and then the man working, who I think was the owner let us sample the flavors we didn't get. We both agreed that all of them were amazing. Watch out for the green chili though, the spice tends to sneak up on you! My wet burrito was also fantastic. However I will probably switch to the pork next time instead of the red chicken and pass on the roasted corn. 

As we were getting ready to leave the owner asked us if it was our first time there and if we enjoyed the meal. We meant it when we said we would be coming back! Overall we were really happy with the food and excellent customer service.
