We were looking for something to do on Mother's Day so we opted for a drive. Since I have been wanting to come out here for a while we headed that direction. We had a bit of a drive just to reach the Apache Trail but it wasn't too bad. The road once you past Goldfield becomes very curvy so plan on taking your time and just enjoy the ride. It seemed like around every turn was another "Wow look at that" view. We stopped a few times along the way to enjoy the scenery. When we reached our destination we enjoyed looking in the gift shop that had tons of cool stuff in it. I could have spent way more time, and money, in there than I did. The also have a little general store where you can buy drinks, trinkets and candy as well as ice cream. The ice cream seemed to be very popular. We decided to go ahead and have lunch in the saloon. 
The saloon was not too busy although they had a large stack of pagers so I imagine some days there will be a wait. The saloon itself is pretty unique and I thought the saddle bar stools were awesome. The good was reasonable priced and pretty good. I would definitely return again the next time we are out for a drive. It was fun playing tourist for the day
