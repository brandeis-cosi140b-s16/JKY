Tried this place for the first time tonight.  Food was excellent and a good value for the price.  Portion size is large and the food tastes fresh.  The tortillas were fantastic.

Only bit of confusion is with the menu.  Ended up spending extra money on a beverage because I didn't realize that combo plates come with a fountain drink.  Didn't see this indicated on the menu anywhere.
