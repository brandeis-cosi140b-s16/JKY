"What do you feel like eating?" is probably the most difficult decision my bf and I ask each other all the time. Sometimes it takes us forever to come up with a decision, other times it doesn't. But thanks to Yelp, we found this place and both agreed on it right away. 

Right away, our drinks arrived along with our chips and dip. Dip was beans, tomatillo sauce and a chipotle roasted salsa. All delish and packed with flavor. I don't usually like beans, but these were pretty good. The bf also put in an order of guacamole with crab. Their guacamole was also really good. It was thick and chunky with big pieces of crab on top. 

Now for our main dishes. Since I was getting full from chips and dip, I opted for a cup of chicken tortilla soup and a side salad. My cup of soup was a huge serving for it being in a cup. It was ok, nothing special. It was a little on the salty side so I wasn't able to eat it all. I also got a side salad, which was AWFUL!! When it arrived at the table, there was so much cheese on it. Then I noticed the reason why it was covered in so much cheese was because the lettuce was old and wilted. I asked our server to just take it off the bill and she was shocked that my salad looked the way it did. She was nice about it and took it off. The bf's carne asada burrito was the highlight of the meal. The meat was so tender. Although the burrito was on the smaller side, it was packed with so much meat, cheese and beans that we both got full from it. 

Definitely a good spot for Tex-Mex food! Since I live so far away, I doubt I'll be eating here any time again soon. If I'm in the area, this will definitely be a one of my options though.
