Great street tacos! Tried three: brisket, carne asada, and chicken fajita. All of them great! Had the house margarita and strawberry. Both very good and only $5! We sat at the bar. Great customer service! The manager came and introduced himself. Very friendly staff. Beautiful atmosphere with reasonable prices.
