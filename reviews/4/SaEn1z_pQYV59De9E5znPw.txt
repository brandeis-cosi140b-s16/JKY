The food was delicious. I'm a  
Cali and these tacos were the real deal! Pastor tacos with pineapples cut off the stand are addictive! Carne Asada tacos were also also very tasty! Next time I need to try the burritos.

If you don't enjoy their food you don't know what real mexican food should taste like. Super satisfying and I highly recommend them.
