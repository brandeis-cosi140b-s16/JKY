San Felipe's is a really fun atmosphere. It's great for happy hour (2.50 flat tires!-and many more specials) The hostesses were very friendly and helpful and the servers were great too! My friend and I went for happy hour and then decided to get a table to eat. We waited a little but the server was super nice and brought us out free chips and salsa and a brownie sundae dessert! I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a fun and social atmosphere. It gets pretty crowded for happy hour and the weekends but all the better to mingle and meet new people! The food was good too!
