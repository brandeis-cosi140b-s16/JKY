This place is a real find. One of the best places for Mexican on the east side. Everything is fresh. The juices, the fish, the tortillas, everything. I have had the tortas, tacos, enchiladas, I'm always satisfied. The fish taco has numerous pieces of fried fish sticks that I always want to pick out of my taco and eat them plain they're so good. And something about the green salsa here gets me every time. Only reason they don't get 5 stars is cuz they are a little dirty. I've never wanted to sit and eat here. Doesn't mean I haven't but I prefer to get it Togo.
