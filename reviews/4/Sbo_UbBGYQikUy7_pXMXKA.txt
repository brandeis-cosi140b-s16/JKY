I had lunch here today and it was GREAT! I use to go to Chuy's at Metro Center and they had great food! I had a Doctor appointment near this location today and the old manager at Metro Jason was the manager here today! Great Food,Great Service! Try it you will like it.

I live in Glendale Arizona but it was worth the trip to this location! This review shows I live in Dallas but I don't?
