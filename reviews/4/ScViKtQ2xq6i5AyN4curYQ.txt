Chevy's five years ago was crisp and fresh and the salsa was great. The tortillas were hot and fresh and the staff engaging. It was a lovely place to have fun. Then it took a nose dive in every single area and it didn't seem to care. Quality and service and food, man we had some nasty times and stopped visiting. We thought fresh my ***. If you had made a suggestion of going to Chevy's I would roll my eyes. Thanks but no thanks.

On a lark, maybe desperation, we went back this weekend. They have updated the menu, the staff, the service and the place is back functioning again. I asked management what happened and they divulged the handling of parent company Pepsi was a disaster for the Chevy's branding and they have been sold to new people. It shows.

If you used to enjoy Chevy's and then over the past few years stopped, then it's time to go back. The fire shrimp is back, the service is back, the machino is working and things remind me of when I first tried them out. We were full, and satisfied. If you have any issues with your new experience they are listening now. Welcome Back Chevy's.
