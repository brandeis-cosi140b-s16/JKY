I toyed with three stars and decided on four. 

The cons: chips were a little greasy; salsa was served in mini-carafes (why make it difficult to enjoy the salsa?); decor is a little kitschy, as others have observed.

The pluses: gazpacho was fresh and good; food was fresh and well-prepared; lots of veggies; frijoles charros were delicious; service was good.

I wanted Mexican food for my night in Scottsdale, and I got it at Los Olivos. I went back to my hotel full and satisfied. Not overwhelmed or surprised, but happy.
