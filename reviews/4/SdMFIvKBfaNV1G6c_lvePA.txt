Doce Taqueria is just like a gourmet cupcake shop, but for tacos. They're open late and serve their fare up quickly, making them one of my top choices in the neighborhood. Generally speaking, I love the chicken and pork tacos and find them marinated to perfection with crisp, fresh toppings. The staff are extremely friendly (less so when you get closer to 2am, but I don't blame them for dealing with all the drunken shenanigans) and the price isn't too extreme ($3/taco). The only reason I am giving four stars instead of five is because on my most recent visit, the tacos were just so-so, indicating some consistency issues. They also really skimped on the avocado, which is one of my favorite parts! On my previous visits, all varieties were excellent, but something was just 'off' this time around and my boyfriend agreed (he had a different variety than I did). The shop is super tiny, so seating is tough. All in all, my favorite pick for a quick snack or late night food on East Carson.
