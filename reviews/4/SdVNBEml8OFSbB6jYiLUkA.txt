Maybe the best $20 lunch I've ever had. For $8 you can pick any two tacos with a side and a drink. My husband and I met for lunch and really enjoyed our meal! I had the Korean Pork and Jalapeno Mahi Mahi. Would definitely order both again. And while the Mexican street corn IS tasty - I don't need that kind of mess... especially since I don't typically travel with dental floss. That being said lunch was delish, and such a great value! I could have done without the blaring music though - and service was a touch slow given we were having lunch early - at 11am - and we were the only people in there! I will definitely be going again soon!
