Continuing on my whirlwind tour of Phoenix Mexican restaurants, I stopped by here for lunch today. I wasn't disappointed, but wasn't blown away either -- save for by the green chile burrito. That was fantastic. 

I also ordered carne asada tacos. I found them uninspired. Still searching for any carne asada nearly as delicious as that of the dearly departed original America's Taco Shop. 

For something new, I also tried the Monterrey taco (stuffed with shredded beef and scrambled egg) since it was at the top of their 'house specialities' menu. Meh. It was really soggy and dripped lots of oil. But it was tasty nevertheless. 

Oh, their tortillas rank among the best I've had, and their chips are really good too -- light and crispy, with red and green sauce.
