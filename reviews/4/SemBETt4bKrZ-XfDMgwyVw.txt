Yes they more than happily deducted $10.95 from our tab! Save money baby!


I have been going to Super Mex for the last 5 years since I moved to Vegas. I came upon them when they had their grand opening (durango location) they had sent out two for one coupons in the area mail which of course was an awesome opportunity to give them a try. I think I recall the Manager informing me they originated out of Long Beach, CA years ago. Glad I did.

My two favorites on their menu is the "Green Chile Pork burrito" mmmmm in which you have the free choice to order light medium and heavy cheese for all of the cheese lovers like me! The pork melts in your mouth! I kid you not as it has happened multiple times over and over! Ok so my second fave is the shredded beef tacos! Nobody makes them like they do, these tacos melt in your mouth as well. They should have named the business after their shredded beef tacos! Order the combination meal with three shredded beef tacos! Oh my, oooo ohhhhh, awwwww yes...yes...yes. In my opinion rather than Super Mex, the restaurant should be named "Melt's in your mouth Mex"
