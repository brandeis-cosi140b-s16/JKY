carne asada fries! fully loaded nachos! the grande breakfast burrito! these are the awesome things we get and split between myself, the husband, and a 3 and 1 year old. it's more than enough food to satisfy all of our appetites as well as any mexican food craving. i totally dig the salsa as well. it's nice to go somewhere and feed an entire family for around $10...and that includes a delicious horchata.
