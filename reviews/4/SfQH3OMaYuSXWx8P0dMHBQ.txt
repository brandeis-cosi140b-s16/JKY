The food here was good.  I ordered the enchilada and chile relleno plate.  I was told that this is "the place to go" for Mexican food in Henderson and, although I can't really make a solid complaint against the food, I expected a little more.  The decor was what you would expect for a Mexican restaurant - bright, colorful, and fun.  The hostess and our server were very friendly; the service was great.  I will return, but I'm definitely still on the hunt for my favorite Mexican food in Henderson.
