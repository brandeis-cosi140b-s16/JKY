I love taco Tuesdays at Filibertos, and this is the one closest to my house.  I  usually go to the one on Main and Dobson, and had forgotten about this one.  So this last Tuesday I go here to get my regular order of tacos.  They are very crunchy, cheesy taco goodness.  Every bit as good as my favorite Filibertos, maybe even better.  This may just become my regular Filibertos!
