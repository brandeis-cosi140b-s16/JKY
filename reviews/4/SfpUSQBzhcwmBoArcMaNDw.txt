Believe the hype! This is a great little hole in the wall spot for some authentic Mexican (and American ) food.  Since this place is across the street from Chandler High expect to see High School students lounging around the site. I had the bean and cheese burrito with the famous "red sauce" and a beef taco. Typically, I would not eat a bean and cheese burrito because I am a diehard carnivore, but this little log had some soul! The burrito was a little on the messy side but what decent burrito isn't. I really liked that the burrito was toasted- it raises the flavor to the next level. The taco was very neat. Shell crunchy, meat moist with lettuce and cheese and of course I added the red sauce! I can't wait to go back and try other items. Too bad this place does not have a drive through.
