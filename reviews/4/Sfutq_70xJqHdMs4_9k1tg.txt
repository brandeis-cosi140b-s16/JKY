Mexican food for $ with fresh sauces and sides to go with that?

This is what you call a prime example of a GREAT Roberto's. I understand that many of the Roberto's have different owners, but this location sets the best example.

I love that the price is reasonable for the taste! Carne asada burrito always comes out cooked well with just enough guacamole to inspire your taste buds.

I think having horchata available is a MUST in any Mexican restaurant. The service for a Spanish-speaking employee is amazing! They always understand how I want my order. I do not have to say anything in Spanish. 

Always remember that they are willing to customize the food, although the generic menu is great as it is!

Recommendations:
Carne asada [plate, burrito, nachos, fries, or taco]
Shrimp burrito
Chicken taco
Bean burrito [chimichanga style or wet] - add spice
Horchata
