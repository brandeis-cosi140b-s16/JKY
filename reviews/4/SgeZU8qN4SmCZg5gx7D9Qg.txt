As a UNLV student I always find myself at chipotle for lunch in between classes or picking up something to take home after a long day. This particular location is ALWAYS busy, therefore the foods always fresh ! Even though all of the employees are fairly young, the service is great. They'll let you sample things you haven't tried, and suggest a new spin to put on your burrito. Love love love. 

I only doc 1 star because the lines between 12 and 2 (lunchtime) are lonnnnnnnnng. And they will not make quesadilla style burritos during lunch rush (lame).
