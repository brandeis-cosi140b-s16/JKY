Tucked in a quiet corner of Old Town Scottsdale, Los Olivos is the kitschy landmark best known as the oldest Authentic Mexican restaurant in the area.  Upon first look, the building, built in the 1950's is spewing charm. Designed by the Grandfather of the current owners, the space is architecturally pleasing and interesting to the eye.  Unfortunately, the building wears it age. The stucco walls and dated floors are stained from fiestas gone by.

During my visit, I happily watched as the highly intuitive and competent wait staff wiped down mirrors and did basic cleaning between serving the few occupied tables throughout the dining areas.  The complimentary chips were crisp and salty, and the salsas, although a tad watery, were perfectly spiced and served in carafes, making for a table full of messy plates. The Carne Asada meal was served with a green salad, yellow rice, a giant fresh cooked tortilla, rough chopped pico de gallo and refried beans. The green salad was surprisingly filling and topped with a gratuitous serving of shredded cheese. The Carne Asada was well seasoned, although for the price ($16), I found the meat to be a bit tough and overall underwhelming. The mushroom enchiladas were again, decent and large, but not worth the price of $14.

I would describe the food at Los Olivos as comfort food: a salty, cheesy, plate of fatty goodness that would cure a hangover or call for a mid-day nap. The service was friendly and welcoming, and the building's kitschy design makes for great photo opportunities. All in all, the pricing is consistent with Old Town Scottsdale, yet not on par with the quality of food. If you are looking for Authentic Mexican food that will blow you away, I would try elsewhere. However, I would recommend Los Olivos for the atmosphere and attentive service. I'm looking forward to returning for a night of Margaritas and appetizers. Los Olivos' charm is the perfect companion for an evening of laughing and drinking with friends.
