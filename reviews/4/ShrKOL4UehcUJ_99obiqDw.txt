Chuy's was pretty awesome! The decor was bright and funky. Very retro. 
The service was EXCELLENT!! If you go hopefully you'll get seated in Thomas's section. He was on point the whole night. I don't know about you but when my service is excellent that makes my whole experience that much better! 
Ok so now for the food. So frkn delicious! I had the chicken tortilla soup first. Let me tell you this is THE best tortilla soup I've ever had! It was so flavorful. Next I had the chicken and cheese chile rellenos. They were amazing!!! The batter they used was wonderful. They came out so crispy. I would recommend getting the chile rice over the Mexican rice. Although the Mexican rice is good the chile rice was herbaceous and had a better flavor. My bf got the Elvis combo and omg! It came with sooo much food! We have tons of leftovers. 
Oh yeah get the jalape√±o dip with your chips!!! You have to! Just do it! You'll thank me later
