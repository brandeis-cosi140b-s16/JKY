super-happy that there's a mad mex within a mile of my place.  even happier that there's quasi-outdoor seating with the huge, beautiful garage windows out front.  the margarita varieties are great, and you can get a big azz one for $7 during happy hours.  the wings are pretty spot-on considering you're at a mexican joint, and i'm a big fan of their medium salsa.  plus -- complimentary valet is usually pretty convenient instead of fighting the ellsworth shadyside parking scene.

why did i dock a star?  sometimes the waitstaff are too busy chatting with their friends to bother taking care of you.  also, the valet service guys sometimes give me a hard time for having a huge truck.  an actual quote: "where do you want me to put this?!"  really?  that's sort of your job.

anyway, i digress.  the food is good.  the margaritas are great.  and, someone may or may not park your car or truck for free.  totally worthy of 4 stars.
