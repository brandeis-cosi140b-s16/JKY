I'm a fan of Chipotle, and this was the first time visiting this location. There was no kids menu posted but when we asked they said they could do kids items. The guy starting our food was really nice. They were out of brown rice (frowney face). Overall, food was good but it seemed a little disorganized. We had to wait for someone to come finish our order and take our payment.  I think they were getting ready for the dinner shift because most of the employees were preparing food in the kitchen.
