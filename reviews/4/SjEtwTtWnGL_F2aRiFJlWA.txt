Solid Mexican food. Don't ask me about authentic, I'm not ethnically predisposed to be an authority of the food. Its good and like Mary J. Blige  said, thats "all I need to get by......"
Lengua (cow tongue) tacos.
Carne Asada Fries.
Spicy chicken nugget burrito.

I saw a dude order a carne asada fries plate and a giant tortilla, then pour the entire plate onto the totilla to make a giant carne asada fries burrito, brilliant!!!!!
