We stopped by the restaurant for lunch around noon on a Thursday to find this place stuffed to the rafters. I can't say I have ever seen a lunch place  as packed as this, except maybe Roosters on a Friday. There were a lot of Hispanic folks which really spoke to the authenticity of the place. We were given a booth in the back (it is surprisingly large in there - like the Tardis) and two large menus by a man who seemed almost comical in his "very tired of the day and of his job" air. I almost felt bad for the poor guy.
The menu did a good job of presenting itself as authentic while still allowing for explanations of what each dish was comprised of for gringos like us. 
Mine was essentially a deep fried burrito, filled with #4 spiciness ground hamburger, with a pile of lettuce shavings, some tomato, one plop of sour cream, a wee bit of beans and a queso poured over the top which, unfortunately, ruined the fried crispness. My husband had the enchilada. This was one of those circumstances where we had all the same ingredients, just folded differently, that happens in American Mexican restaurants now and then.
Also, the salsas they brought out (without explanation): 2 cute milk bottles. One had nothing but pure red and the other was a chunky, garden-style salsa. We needed to experiment to see what was hot (the red) but they wisely brought out three little bowls so we had one for each salsa and one for a mix of the two. These were either a 2 on the a hot Scale or an 8 so mixing is wise.
The bill was something like $17.
Overall, this was really good. I think it is a matter of finding your favorite dish and they'll probably do that one spectacularly. Once they ditch that queso....stuff.
