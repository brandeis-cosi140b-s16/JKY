My first year of law school I ate at Pinky's and Burger Co. almost everyday. Needless to say that'll pack on the lbs. pretty quick. After a while, my classmates and I would explore more and venture into Southend or Dilworth if time permitted. 

But we were really happy when Picante opened up since it's still near campus and it's a change of pace from your burger/diner style joints. 

How's the food? 

It's pretty good. If you are a fan of Chipotle, Qdoba and Moe's, then you'll probably like Picante. The chicken, steak, shredded beef, and fish are really good. They occasionally introduce specials and new items to the menu too (buffalo chicken or philly cheesesteak burritos). They have drink specials and even do punch cards for free burritos.

The owner and his wife are super friendly, as well as the rest of the staff. The price is pretty much on par with the competitors, if not a little lower. 

I'll definitely be making my way to picante in between classes soon!
