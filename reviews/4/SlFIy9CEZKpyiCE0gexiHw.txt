WOW!

We drove by this place a few times before deciding to go in tonight for a celebratory dinner.  We loved the entrance (very quaint) and were pleasantly surprised by the "unique" interior decor.

Our waitress was AWESOME!  Very friendly and patient with us... we don't eat Mexican food much and I had no idea what most of the menu said.

Also, I am mostly veggie.  That being said, the menu is mostly not veggie!  When I mentioned this, not only did she have the chef make an entire plate special for me... they also made the tortilla soup veggie for me!

The cantaloupe juice was TO DIE FOR and the fresh guac and chips were delish.

Hubby loved his mole and... whatever else that was meat that he ate.

We will definitely be back!
