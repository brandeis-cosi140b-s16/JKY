A friend told me about this place months ago. I just didn't have the opportunity to come here until now. I pulled into the parking lot and was surprised how nice the place was (because of the area I figured it may be somewhat ghetto lol) nice, older, well kept building. Service so far was nice and friendly. Smells good  :)
I always have a hard time ordering at a Mexican restaurant, since I'm Mexican I've had it all and I usually end up eating the same thing lol. Well I decided to stray from that this time. That didn't make it an easy decision tho. I saw the same things I saw at every other Mexican place. I decided to look at the appetizers. I ordered Mexican Pizza, because it came with their house made chorizo on it. I wasn't sure if it would be enough to fill me up so I ordered the beef tostada.
Well the Mexican Pizza was good sized and delicious. But I wanted to at least try the tostada while it was fresh. Both were really good. The pizza was awesome! 
I'll definitely be back.
