We ate here for the first time a couple weeks ago and it is definitely going into our regular rotation.  This is the only place I have ever found in Phoenix that has true Mexican style seafood dishes.  Their cocktel de camarones was fantastic!  I got shrimp flautas which were also very good.  My husband was pleased that they also had a few non-fish items on the menu and so he ordered the carne asada.  The only negative thing I have to say is DO NOT order the fried banana dessert.  I can't remember what they called it, but it was not good at all.

A couple of caveats (really, responses to the negative reviewers) for those of you considering trying this place: 1 - it is in Guadalupe so there are no frills here, this is a casual mom and pop dive.  2 - it is Mexican style seafood.  Don't order fish and chips and expect it to be good.  That is not what you go here for.
