Walked in to the sound of a couple of guys playing some fun music in the restaurant.  Really set the tone for a nice, casual, relaxing night.  I ordered mango smoothie which really hit the spot after a hot day.   Looked over the new menu.  Lots of really interesting mexican type dishes.  In the end we had the bowl of nachos for appetizers, a Cyn Burger and the Southwest Turkey burger.  It was all perfect.  

About the Cyn burger, it is like nothing I have had before.   A real unique combination of Jicama, some kind of goat cheese, and bacon.  It rocked!!  As burger fanatic, I can be critical.  No need here.  The Cyn burger was simply awesome.  Make sure you order the sweet potato fries with it. 

We were looking for good food in a very comfortable environment.  Cafe Carumba was the right choice and more.  We will be back!!
