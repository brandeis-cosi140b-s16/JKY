I've been here a few times now for all the fun EDM extravaganzas that they put forth. I'm pleased to say that I haven't been let down once. There aren't that many bars in North scottsdale that are actually worthy of bragging about. 

Its a bit of a hidden location, but hey. Who cares? There is a pool, cabanas and a young crowd entertaining crowd that fills the place with good times.  The only thing that kept this review from being 5 stars is that the bartenders jip you on drinks. I would like some alchohol with my little cup full of ice...

Looking forward to Zeds Dead on the 8th.
