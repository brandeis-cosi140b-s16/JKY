Only been here once so far so my review is only based on the tacos. I came here for the 75Â¢ tacos. I ordered 4 carne asada tacos. They are quite small but definitely have a lot of flavor. And whatever chipotle sauce they put on top was pretty hot. I like it hot but some people may not. I also got Horchata and it was pretty good. Overall, not a bad hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint.
