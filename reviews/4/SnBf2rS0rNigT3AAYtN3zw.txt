This is hands down my favorite late night, less-than-sober food stop on my way home from a long night of debauchery.  I've been here countless times, but I've only ever had the carne asade burrito, because it's THAT good that I'm not willing to stray from it and try anything else.

The food here is quick, greasy, simple, and satisfying.  It also withstands the ultimate test, going back while sober, where it is equality as delicious.  If you're in the UNLV neck of the woods, don't waste your time on Roberto's, because Felipito's blows it out of the water.
