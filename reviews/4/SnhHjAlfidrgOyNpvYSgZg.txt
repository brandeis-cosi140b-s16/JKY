I recently ate at Las Fuentes for the first time.  I'm not really a connoisseur of Mexican food because I don't eat it that often but I did think it was pretty tasty.  The portions are enormous - I highly recommend sharing a plate with whoever you're with.  The restaurant was nice and clean and the service was great!  Overall I give it four stars. Although it was good, it was a little pricey for Mexican food.
