I would give this place 5 stars but I think 1 time they got my order wrong & gave me beef instead of chicken. Maybe I just wasn't clear enough?

That saying, I live on 35th Ave & will drive all the way to 7th just to eat here. Why? Because I TRUST it!! I've been here countless times, all sober except 1 time. The ex who got me addicted to this place had been here countless times before me. I've NEVER gotten sick & he hadn't either.

I usually get a chicken chimichanga combo (beans & rice) with sour cream & guacamole on the side. The chimi is always fantastic. Perfectly crispy & huge with cheese on top. They don't put anything BUT chicken in. If you get beef you get onions & green bell peppers mixed in. With a drink this costs about $8.50.

The sour cream & guacamole has never been bad & always tastes just fine.

There was 1 time that the beans were way too salty but they're usually perfect w/ melted cheese on top.

I love the free pico de gallo. YUMM!!

I've also gotten the fish taco's a couple times. They're perfect except the sauce is strait mayo. If I don't think about that then I enjoy the foodgasm in my mouth just fine.

I've gotten a breakfast burrito once but can't remember exactly what I got. I do know I asked them to add an ingredient & they did with no prob. I remember that tasting way better than I thought it was going to.

For a drink I always ask for a large horchata, no ice. It's perfect. Not gritty or fake over the top sweet. I like mine with a strong cinnamon flavor & this place has that.

Oh, & by the way... the guys working here have always been nice. Yes, I've waited a tad longer than I'd have liked to (maybe 2-3 times) but the guys having good senses of humor makes up for that.
