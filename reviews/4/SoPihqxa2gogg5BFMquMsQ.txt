I will have to disagree with some of these reviews. My kids and I stopped in on Wednesday evening and had great service. We always have. 
Attentive staff all the way around. I had the chicken and steak fajita plate, no beans, no rice, no tortilla's. I ordered rancho style and expected it super spicy, but no so much. I've had Arriba spicy before and my mouth was on fire, but no big deal.  I also forgot my sunglasses on the table and they ran out to the parking lot to give them to me. So we remain big fans of Arriba.
