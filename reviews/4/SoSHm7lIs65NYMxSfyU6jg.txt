Let me tell you, I really don't have a lot of motivation to write this review at this moment.  Why?  Because I just ate a big ol' burrito from El Burro and I'm about to pass out.

Wow.  Tasty.  The rice, bean and cheese burrito hit the spot.  I impulsively made the decision to drive over from the East End after work to check out this place.  Glad I did.  What you'll find when you get here is a small take-out establishment that's pretty bare bones both in terms of decor, space and menu options.  You could chose to sit and eat here, though I wouldn't plan on it during peak hours as seating is limited.  What it lacks in appearance and food variety is more than made up for in execution.  I found my burrito to be 1.) gigantic 2.) fresh 3.) incredibly tasty and 4.) nicely appointed with hot-sauce that was actually hot.  Woah.

I'm docking one star because there is an extra charge for guacamole on your burrito.  That's a bunch of BS.  For what it's worth, the guac is indeed amazing.  Some of the best I've had in the city.  Nevertheless, it's a crime to charge extra for such a thing, especially with a burrito that's already priced at $7.
