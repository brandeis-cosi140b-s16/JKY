I felt that I had to write a review after seeing that Don Ruben only has 3.5 stars. I mean, every time I eat here I'm pleased. 

I like that the atmosphere is cozy and visually interesting--definitely not a hole-in-the-way type place.

The service is always good. It may be better for us because Don Ruben is my parents' default "date-night" restaurant. Today, the server came by at least 3 times to check on us, in addition to taking our order, bringing the food, and closing the check.

 If you want to split a plate, they'll plate it that way in the kitchen and give you extra rice and beans for $1 extra. My mom and I did this, and still had carnitas left over. Some places make you feel bad about splitting a plate, but our server was totally gracious and offered the $1+ deal to us. After tax and tip, our total tab was under $20.

And of course, the food. I've never had the $3.75 margarita because my mom likes 1800. We didn't get it this time because it was noon on a Tuesday, but I've had it before with 1800 too, and its muy deliciosa. I'll admit the chips and salsa aren't the bestest ever, but they're still solid. We usually get the carnitas because they are BOMB. Slightly crisp, well-seasoned, keep picking at them after I'm full. I've had some of the other offerings, and recall being pleased. 

Everyone seems nuts about the blah American diner next door, but I'm all about Don Ruben.
