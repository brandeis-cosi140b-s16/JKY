I've eaten at this Chipotle way more times than I would like to admit in the short time that it has been open.  It's the perfect quick and affordable meal before hitting up a game or event at the Arena.

The quality of the food and the service is as good as any Chipotle.  I'm really impressed with the facelift they have given to the space.  The old attendant, Moe's, had a very similar concept to Chipotle.  Chipotle could have been lazy and just slapped a new coat of paint on the walls, instead they redesigned the layout, and created the much more modern and inviting look that their restaurants are known for.
