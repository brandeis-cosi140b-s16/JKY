I know Macayo's isn't authentic but it is damn good! The chips and salsa here are great I always ask for their hot sauce because its better than the mild. I've tried almost everything on the menu and I've never been disappointed. I recommend ordering something with baja sauce. It's amazing and I always order a side of it with my meal. I love the food but this restaurant needs to be remodeled. The carpet is old and the tables are worn out. At least keep your restaurant up to date when you are charging $12 an entree.
