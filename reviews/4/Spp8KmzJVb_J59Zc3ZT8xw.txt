I have been eating at this Chuy's since 1996. The mahi mahi fish tacos are one of the best menu items. The chicken here is made fresh daily and charbroiled with a coal fire grill. They offer a variety of Mexican beers. I find the margaritas to lack luster and they taste virgin to me. Sad to hear that they will soon no longer exist as Chuy's......name change coming after being plastered all over news for having undocumented workers behind the scene. Everyone needs a job right?
