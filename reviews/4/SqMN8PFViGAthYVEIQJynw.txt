Been here twice in 2014.  Much better food and service than several years ago. We had combination plates with enchiladas, tacos, tamales, rice and black beans; and burritos too. All food was fresh and served hot. Kids menu has lots of choices and both my kids like eating here. Sundays and Mondays in May the entire menu is half off so expect a little bit (10-20 mins) of a wait.
