Great Margaritas!

Be careful not to fill up on chips, salsa and bean dip before dinner.

For some reason, this place is always slammed.
I definitely recommend going here early.
Service is great!  They have lots of servers and people refilling waters and removing plates, etc... 
Went on a Friday night and there was a full on mariachi band playing.
So, if you are looking for a quiet meal... it's not going to be here.
This place is fun and loud.
Their menu offers LOTS of options.... Chicken, beef, pork, fish, etc...
I always have a hard time deciding what I want.
And I usually take home half of what I order because their portions are large and after the chips, salsa and bean dip, I'm mostly full when dinner arrives.
All entrees are served with rice and beans.
And if you get something that comes with flour or corn tortillas... oh man... hard to choose.  Their corn tortillas are not the usual dry corn tortillas.  Their corn tortillas are AWESOME.  But then so are their flour tortillas.  But because I don't get to enjoy corn tortillas like theirs... I usually get the corn.  I highly recommend the corn tortillas... Get Them and Taste the difference.  All corn tortillas should be like this.  :)
