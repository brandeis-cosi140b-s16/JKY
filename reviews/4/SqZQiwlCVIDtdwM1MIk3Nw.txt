I'm giving 4 stars as a guest of the hotel. As far as restaurants attached to little hotels go, couldn't ask for much more. Ate there twice for breakfast and once for dinner, and found it affordable and tasty enough. The breakfast voucher totally covered my breakfast cost, and they give you one for each person in the room. $12.50 was totally enough per person. Patio seems very dog friendly. We also had drinks from the bar at night, totally satisfied. It's adorable, and the only criticism on that would be definitely trying too hard to hit all the "hip" points, becoming almost a parody. Whoever designed this hotel and restaurant has my vote to develop Hipster Disneyland - someone obviously created this place with a "how to attract millenials" handbook in their left hand. While definitely immediately noticing I was being heavily pandered to, I'd also say it was lovely. Servers seem incredibly stressed out, and forget little things. While I'm usually easily annoyed at that, it's clear its not the servers faults and this place is just getting started with their procedures and getting the flow of this place down. I would totally recommend this hotel and restaurant combo to friends.
