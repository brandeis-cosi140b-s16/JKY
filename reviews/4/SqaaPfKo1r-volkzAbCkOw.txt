They give you an easy to understand menu to figure out what you're looking for. I ordered the rice bowl with their seaweed brown rice and grilled fish. I recommend if you get the fish, try it with the white rice instead. The seaweed rice was good, I just think it would have had a better taste with white rice. Overall, service was wonderful. We were the only customers that were there at the time. My boyfriend had a chicken burrito which was really great! However, we weren't completely full when we finish, so this was kind of a downer. Should have ordered a side to go with the meal.
