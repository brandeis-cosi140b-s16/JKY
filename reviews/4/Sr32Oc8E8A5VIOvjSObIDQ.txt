I used to come to this location a lot (until they opened one up in South Park mall). I like the service here. The staff is super friendly and while it does get busy, I haven't had any issues there. 

It does get busy and the parking here in horrendous. 

But outside of that, what's not to like. Excellent burritos and burrito bowls, fresh ingredients, fresh guac, fresh chips, great salsas. The prices are also pretty reasonable too. 

Chipotle is solid and it's consistent. It never disappoints.
