Cabo Fish Taco is one of my go to restaurants when I have people visiting.  Great food, great atmosphere, great drinks enough said.  There's typically a wait on the weekends but it's worth it.  The El Cheapo margarita is a great way to pass the time and I highly recommend their Mahi Mahi tacos.  I'm also a fan of how their decor supports local artists.
