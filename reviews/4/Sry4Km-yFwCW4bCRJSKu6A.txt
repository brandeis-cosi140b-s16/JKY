The food from here is pretty good - I'll definitely return ! We got a pitcher of margs, nachos, and we all ordered a different entree which everyone was happy with. 

I got the tostadas with mole sauce and it was great. I also tasted some of the burrito my husband ordered and loved that dish. I didn't have the rest of the food but everyone was very happy. 

The space is a little cramped but it's cute and the waitstaff is very friendly and helpful.
