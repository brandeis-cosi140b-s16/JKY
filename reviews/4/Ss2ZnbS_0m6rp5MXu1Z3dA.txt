Passed this restaurant a thousand times on my way too and from work, finally decided to stop in and am so glad I did. The food was delicious and the service even better! I had the cheese enchiladas which,  i admit, hard to mess up. Came with a small salad or soup prior to the entree. The service is top notch here. The staff is very attentive with a good personality to boot. I will definitely be back to this hidden gem.
