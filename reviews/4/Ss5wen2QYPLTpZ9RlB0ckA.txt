I went here for lunch with a coworker and we both got the lunch special that came with a cheese enchilada and a green chili tamale. The price was reasonable for lunch about $8 if I remember correctly. You get chips and salsa when you first sit down which is good because it helps to distract you from the slightly slow service. When our food finally came, it was really good. A big plate of cheesy goodness. Definitely not healthy for you though since everything is covered in cheese. This place reminds me of Macayos a bit but in my experience, I prefer this place if I were to choose between the two.
