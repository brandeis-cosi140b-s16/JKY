I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Border Grill because I wasn't a fan after trying their restaurant in Los Angeles.

I thought the outside patio would be a nice comfortable setting for a casual business meeting. While I was waiting for the others to arrive I ordered a lemonade and was brought tortilla chips with three different salsas. The tortilla chips were crisp and tasted like they had just been fried even though there was no visible sign of grease. I also enjoyed the freshly squeezed strawberry lemonade which had a balanced flavor. I ordered the house  guacamole, tortilla soup, and a chicken Caesar salad. Both the house guacamole and the chicken Caesar salad were executed well. The guacamole was seasoned well and the avocado had a lot of natural flavor. The chicken in the salad was grilled to perfection and the Caesar dressing was just right on the anchovy. I wasn't as thrilled with the tortilla soup. The tomato broth was a little thick, it had big chunks of unmelted cheese, and it didn't come out hot. 

Our waitress, helped us out with a discount for locals and told us about the Sunday Brunch where you get unlimited plates. I like the concept of all you can eat plates because the quality of the food is normally better, you don't have to hassle with other people, and it's more sanitary. I will be back eventually to try brunch.
