We just moved to Fountain Hills, we were familiar with Senor Taco having been to the location just off Shea. 
We truly like Senor Taco, but I dare say that this one is better than the other... just slightly. 

We aren't fans of fast food in general, and this isnt exactly fast food. Its made to order and quick food. You can tell that this is fresh and good quality.  It is super yummy. 

It's really close to the house. We will definitely be back to this location!
