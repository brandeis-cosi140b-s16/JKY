Pretty good cheap Mexican Food in the Copa.  
We got out of there with 3 big burritos and a chicken cheese crisp for under $20.  The carnitas were flavorful and not fatty tasting.  The steak was tender and also full of flavor. The red salsa is nice and smokey - not too hot.  The chicken was tender, but could use a little seasoning.   The fresh guaq was chunky and delish. 
I liked that the meats are up there in a case so you can see what you're getting - not some kind of mystery meat.   In addition to fountain coke, they have bottles of Mexican Coke (lets hear it for real sugar!). 
There is some inside seating - but it's a very casual order at the counter take out kinda place. 
We'll be back!
