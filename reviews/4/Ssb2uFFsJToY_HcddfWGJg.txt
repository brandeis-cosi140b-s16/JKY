We went here Friday night for dinner.  When I first walked in I loved the atmosphere.  We started off with a guacamole appetizer.  The guacamole tasted very fresh and authentic, I would of liked a little more spice. I love horchata and order it whenever available.  I liked the touch of the cinnamon sprinkled on the top. My entr√©e was the chicken chiliquiles. This was a great meal and tasted good.  Again I love heat and there was none.  I will be returning, I will just special order and add jalepenos to my order. We ended our night with a strawberry Tres leches topped with ice cream, this was super moist tasted really good.  If your taking children they eat for free under the age of 10.
