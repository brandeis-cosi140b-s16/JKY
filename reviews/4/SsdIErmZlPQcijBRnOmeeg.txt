Let me just start out by saying I am not a big pork fan, but Cafe Rio's sweet pork barbacoa burrito is TO DIE FOR!  I could eat this everyday and not get tired of it.
I've even tried to find yucatan-style pork recipes in the attempt to duplicate this at home and it's been a "bust" so far....

Not too crazy about their chips; I prefer the lighter color, no cornmeal type, but I DO love their homemade tortillas and often order extras to take home. 

Also love their mint limeade drink; will definitely try to duplicate that at home since I have lots of mint growing in the yard!

Between Baja Fresh and Cafe Rio; it's a "toss" as to which one is my favorite.
