In the age old war between Zaba's and Chipotle, Zaba's always wins out for me.  So much so that while the Eastern location which is closest to me is closed down in preparation of a new location opening soon, I drove all the way to this location instead of just settling for the Chipotle down the street.   That's partially not true as I was somewhat in the area before deciding to get some take-out for lunch, but it was definitely much less convenient than going the Chipotle route and dammit I still took it.

This location seemed much nicer aesthetically than any other Zaba's I've been to.   That's not to say that they usually aren't nice because they are, but something about this one just seemed a step ahead.   It was packed for lunch but the employees were on top of their game in within a few minutes I was out the door with a couple Zaba Bowls to go.   

I did my usual, a zaba bowl with brown rice, shredded beef, corn, green salsa, and lettuce.   It's about as healthy a meal I can put together at any of these fresh-mex joints that I can still enjoy.   I found it to be a good version of the same thing I've gotten 100 times at the Eastern location.   The shredded beef was nicely spiced (I've had it on occasion lack spiciness which I believe is due to it not being stewed long enough to soak it all in) and the veggies were fresh and as tasty as veggies can be.   My rice was a little mushier than I normally like it, so that was my only minor gripe.   I also shared a bag of chips and they were spot on as usual.   

A good value became even better recently with the introduction of the Zaba's reward card with which every 10 entrees purchased you get the 11th free.   Points are doubled on Sundays.   Since I go to the other location at least 2-3 times a week and buy for 2, I average a free entree every 2-3 weeks.   WHAT HAS CHIPOTLE DONE FOR ME LATELY?   Exactly.
