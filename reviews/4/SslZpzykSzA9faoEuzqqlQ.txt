The atmosphere is really nice for a fast food restaurant. It looks as nice as any sit down Mexican place and is very clean. The food is a bit salty (and I love salt so that is a lot coming from me!) but it's definitely the closest to authentic Mexican that I have had in Concord, NC so far..including sit down restaurants!
The staff was friendly and very accommodating as well, even after our toddler poured her entire drink all over the floor (again..sorry about that!) 
Will definitely be returning.
