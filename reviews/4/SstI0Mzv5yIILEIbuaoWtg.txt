I've recently moved to the area and this is rapidly becoming my go to place for cheap yet delicious and authentic mexican food. Everytime I come, I find new things I enjoy on the menu. The fish tacos are my favorite so far, with the chile relleno being a close second. The service is always very quick, although could be a little friendlier. I love utilizing the salsa bar. The salsa verde in particular has a nice bite to it. The lobby and salsa bar are always very clean. There aren't many tables inside, but it has an outdoor patio with two big tables and string lights overhead. The surrounding neighborhood is a little on the rough side, hence the loss of a star. I have only been here during the day, so can't say anything about the dinner service or crowd. The food however will definitely keep me coming to this place regularly.
