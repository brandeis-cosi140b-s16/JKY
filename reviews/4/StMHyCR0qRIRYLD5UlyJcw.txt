I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at this place. Yelp reviews convinced me to try it out. Food was very good. Tortillas tasted fresh and homemade. The pork carnitas was very tasty, as was the veggie burro. Only complaint was we showed up with the lunch rush and had to wait nearly 30 min for our food. Will be back.
