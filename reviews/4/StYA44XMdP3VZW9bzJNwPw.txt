Made my debut here for happy Hour with a group. Great deals with most all drinks and appetizers half price. The blood orange margarita was about 4 bucks and it is made with all fresh juices which is a huge bonus especially at that price. I guess I could have ordered food, but the chips and salsa were free and bountiful. Salsa was average, no spice, but chips were fresh and crisp. The patio was nice as well. The only caveat is this is part of that Sam Fox empire, the restaurant king of Phoenix, so if you don't feel like greasing his already deep pockets (14 places or so), head elsewhere.
