I met with my dinner group there tonight.  It was selected by a gal who frequents it. There were 5 in our group. We started with the delicious blood orange margarita's that the server recommended and they were delicious. We enjoyed chips, salsa, and the fresh guacamole as the appetizer. I ordered the short rib tacos, and others ordered enchiladas, fish tacos, and grilled fish. The sides were beans and rice.  Our service was outstanding with refills given frequently. The atmosphere was modern and comfortable. I would definitely go again and would recommend to others.
