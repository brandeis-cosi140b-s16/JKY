I don't see why America's gets such a low average rating. Prices are within a dollar or two of a cookie cutter 'bertos where the food you receive is questionable at best.  But food here is fresh, tasty, and unique. Is it unbelievable or absurdly cheap? No, by its darn good. 

I got 4 tacos today for $2 each. Carne Asada is the best.
