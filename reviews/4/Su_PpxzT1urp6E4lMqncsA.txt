Its a Chipotle.  Ya get what you expect.  The kids love it.  Wifey can eat healthy there.  
I don't really consider Chipotle to be very good as a mexican cuisine, but for what they serve, its darn tasty.  love their chips, and their guac.  and their pork is excellent, too.
Not saying this specific location was, but be sure to watch when they are dishing the protein; sometimes they ca be skimpy on the meat, especially if the line is long.
