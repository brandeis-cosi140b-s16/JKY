Good Mexican food and great prices.  MUCH better than the Mexican takeout place just down the street on Grand Avenue (Humbertos).

The have a great daily special everyday except Friday and Saturday.  We usually go on Monday for the .99 bean burrito.  It's .89 extra for cheese,  but price is still unbeatable.
