I have been searching for a good alternative to Roberto's since I moved to Las vegas and I found it! Dare I say, i might even like it more!
If you get anything from this place, check out the chicken tamales or their rolled tacos, both are absolutely AMAZING!
I have never had a problem with the staff, other than sometimes a slight language barrier, but we always figure it out.
Love, love, love this place!
