Have to follow suit. On the out side and when you walk in there are two things you will either imeediately notice or will soon notice. One it looks and smells like any typical dingy taco stand in Phoenix. But do not let that dissuade you. There is obviously a reason why dispite the ambiance and spotlessness; or lack there of this place has 4 stars. That brings me to the second reason...

The line that are either there or soon will. This is because the food is pretty darn good. I will say for me it is better than any whole-in-the-wall taco stand Ive been too in the valley.

Realy good food, generous portions, salsa bar, good prices, and lots and lots of bustling happy customers. Eh smells funny and the tables are not kept up as much as we may want but yup a fair four star earn.
