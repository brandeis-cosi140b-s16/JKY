Good mexican food in a northern scottsdale?  oxymoron. 

But seriously, not bad.  Definitely not half as good as the mexican travel trailer stomach-ache-for-weeks food, but certainly better quality.  To start, our server was absolutely fantastic, bringing chips and salsa right away and making great suggestions.  Being new to the joint, we had no idea what to order with the humongous menu, so he kindly pointed us in the right direction. 

Pretty good (and pretty strong :):):)  margaritas to start with, though i'd opt next time for rocks vs frozen (super icy - good if thats your style).  My guy took our waiters word and got the pollo fundito --- AMAZING.  ridiculous flavor but not overdone at all, certainly would recommend it to anyone and everyone.  I unfortunately was indecisive as usual, so i went for the choose two, going with the steak tacos and chicken flautas.  Pretty good, pretty fresh, but honestly nothing super special and kinda lacked in flavor.  

Good portions, fresh food, great service, and comfortable atmosphere.  I'll be goijng back, but i'll be sticking to the specials.
