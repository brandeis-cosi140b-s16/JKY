I am the only one in my family that like the "Bertos".  They are my first choice when eating alone.  This is by far the best in the city.  Menu is no different than any other berto, staff is average, leaning toward the "I am here but don't want to be here".  But, the restaurant is the cleanest Berto in the valley.  Food is consistently good, not dried out.
