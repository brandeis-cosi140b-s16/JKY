This Del Taco is awesome! I usually go once a month to satisfy my craving and get the cheesy deal. For $4 and change its pretty good! The quesadillas are on the greasy side but not bad. I've always gotten good service sit-in (seeing their employees eat here during their break is a reassuring feeling) and through the drive-thru. Plus their churros are my fave, hands down.
