So after having a not-so-great experience with the service at our most recent visit to Chevy's, I decided to make a comment through their website. I was pleasantly surprised that I had a response from the regional manager. . . THAT DAY! We are a fan of Chevy's food which is why I was really sad to have the negative experience, but the quick response from the management side was unbelievable. I hope internally the problem was resolved, but as a customer they've won back my loyalty. I will visit again. Thank you!
