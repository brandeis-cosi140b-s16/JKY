We heard of this place because of the resort we were staying at. There was no wait, and our waiter was very friendly. We were given free Top Shelf guacamole by showing our key card (we were staying at the Scottsdale Links Resort) and it was pretty good. I ordered the chicken fajitas. They were great. Caramelized peppers, and all the fix-ins. I would definitely order this again. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the pricing. It was just too much money for my budget, but the portion sizes were fine. (Unlike the other reviews, I had leftovers to take back). 

I would definitely come back again.
