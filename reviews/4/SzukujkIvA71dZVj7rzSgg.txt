This joint was recommended by a friend... So we decided to try it. On a Friday night (maybe around 8:00pm) this place was fairly empty. We were greeted at the door promptly and seated immediately. The server was very attentive and polite. I ordered the "Enchiladas Suizas" with green sauce and they where just ok, It came with a small portion of rice beans and a wanna be salad. 

Would I try this place again....? Maybe, will I crave it? I highly doubt it

I've had better tasting Mexican food
