We were driving around a bit aimlessly, looking for a spot to eat. Toto's looked promising. I had the chicken nachos,(I'm quite the nacho hound), for what they lacked in looks, they made up for it where it counts-taste. We all were very pleased and this is the best mexican food we've had in town( we've been to gardun'o's  and pink taco). The fried ice cream was great as well.
