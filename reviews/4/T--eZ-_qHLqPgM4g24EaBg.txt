Went in today for lunch, it was my first visit. Not too much to the exterior or interior, but they had the requisite lunch special menu items (tacos, tostada, mini chimi, etc...) from 4.99 to 5.99. I went with the chicken chimi and it was fresh and tasty. Good chips and verde salsa. I found the red too hot however.

I also found their refried beans to be darker and better tasting than other places, and they didn't seem to have as much lard in them.

Will try their shrimp cervix he next time for 10 bucks.

I dinged 1 star cuz I asked for a lemon or lime wedge (whichever they had the most of) in my ice water and they missed it both times.
Good value.
