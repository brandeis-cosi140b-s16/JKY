Terrific neighborhood spot, lovingly designed space and menu with charming outside patio.  The chips are exactly like you'd find in Mexico, not a commercial batch, and the salsa is bursting with flavor.  Well worth the $4 charge to eat some prepared in house. Others have mentioned prices, which do seen a bit high in a town where middle-of-the-road Mexican food is plentiful. However, the limited menu offers little gems and, my personal favorite, the jalape√±o margarita, is the best I've experienced since The Cantina in Cave Creek closed.  While the service is a tad detached (let's face it, it IS nice to think the server is pleased you're there to drop $50 a couple), it's refreshing not to have to deflect  'Hi, I'm Elliot, and I'll be taking care of you tonight!" We were the only table last Thursday night. Early dinner, I confess, but hope this independent restaurant gains a well-deserved following.  A gem.
