The food is HUMBLE and features some Jalisco dishes that many people are looking for,such as Bistec, Mole, Menudo, Birra, and Posole. My meal I had recently here was Steak Poblano. The steak was fork tender and covered with fresh tomatoes , Poblanos , & onions .Everything seemed fresh and the place was very clean. They make their own tortillas here daily and Howard Seftel had them on a top ten list according to the menu here.

Meals that I tried so far have been carefully made  and were not greasy. 

Service is usually good, but sometimes it goes European Style. (your order gets taken,food comes out and that's it.....that is how it rolls. It's a Mom and Pop business.
