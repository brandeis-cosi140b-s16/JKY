Yes, this place has really great tacos. I was very happy they expanded to the Phoenix area. They first started in Juarez, Mexico and then El Paso. 

Being an El Paso native it is nice to have some really good Mexican food from your hometown. I would give it five stars, but I don't want to be biased.
