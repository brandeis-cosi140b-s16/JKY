Always wonder why I forget this place. Drive by on a weekend night and see multiple armed security guards - and usually a fight or two in the parking lot, BUT - go earlier and get a lot of food for a decent price. Service - excellent. I do recommend 

Only a little loud from the TV's - if you know Espanol, this is not an issue.
