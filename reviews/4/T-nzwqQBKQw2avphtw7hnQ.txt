Wife thought it would be fun to stop in here for dessert last night and they didn't disappoint. We only got a plain fry bread and drizzled honey on it. It was fantastic. Service was good and the place was very clean. We sat on the patio. My only complaint was the smell outside, it wasn't to pleasant. The odor appeared to be coming from storm drain. Not their fault.
