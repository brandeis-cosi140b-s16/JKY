4th time dinig at Vida and it is still as good as ever. The table side Guacamole is HUGE, but extremely fresh. Every bite of it is a burst of different flavors. I also have tried the carne asada quesadillas and tacos, the corn queso fresco (side item and it's ah mazing) as well as the shrimp and fish tacos w rice and the 2nd time, plantains. All very awesome with little or no grease (you know how mexican food can be...)

The atmosphere is inviting with a funky "wooden" floor you will have to see for yourself. 2 thumbs up on the sangria, it definitely lacks that awful "sangria bitterness" and that is why it tastes sooo much better than most places.

Staff needs a little more training, but I respect the fact that its all so new. On another note, they are super friendly and timely.

I will be dining there a 5th time, 6th time, etc etc you get the picture.....
