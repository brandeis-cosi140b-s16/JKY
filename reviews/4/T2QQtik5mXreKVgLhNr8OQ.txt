You haven't had a bean burro until you've had one at Casa Reynoso. This is one of the first places I ate at when I visited Phoenix for the first time a few years ago and the cheese crisp lives in my heart as one of my top five comfort foods.

This place is no frills, a hole in the wall if there ever was one. It has a lived in look to it and the decor could use a spruce, but I don't come to look at the walls, I come to eat. It seats maybe 50 people so avoid the lunch or dinner rush because there will be a wait! But it's definitely worth it. Casa Reynoso has a pretty simple menu of burros, tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, enchiladas and would fall under the category of just another Mexican restaurant if the food wasn't so consistently GREAT. As a new Arizona local I have to say I'm loving the fact that green chiles are an option pretty much everywhere and CR is no exception.

As mentioned, the cheese crisp (with green chile of course) is a favorite. A crispy tortilla topped with delicious melty cheese and green chile. It's cut up like a pizza and meant to be shared, but really I would fight someone to eat the whole thing.

Prices are dirt cheap-your most expensive meal is maybe $15. The portion sizes are generous and they don't skimp on the meat. Service can be hit or miss, but I've accepted it for what it is...I do it for the cheese crisp!

If you're looking for a casual meal and a place where sweatpants can be worn without judgement, Casa Reynoso is your place.
