Ok, so we know it's a chain and have seen plenty of locations everywhere. I'm giving a full 4 stars for this location because of the manager on duty the day I visited. The employees were all kept busy and the orderliness of the place showed that. I was hesitant to try the fish tacos because I'm just getting into fish (kinda) and usually chicken-out, literally, when it comes to tacos! But, the manager was so friendly and helpful and descriptive of what I would find when I tried the special, that I couldn't resist. Glad I couldn't! Delish, even for being "slightly fishy", and a nice spicy flavor with the mango salsa relish stuff!
