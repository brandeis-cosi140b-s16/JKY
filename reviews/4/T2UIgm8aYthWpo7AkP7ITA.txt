Wonderful place with a great atmosphere. Didn't eat any of their special entree's but the egg rollls, calamari and spinach salad with chicken were all wonderful. Not the standard pub fare but a cut above - the jalapeno cream for the calamari was good enough to eat with a spoon, and the chicken in the salad was moist and smoky like great BBQ. And their ice cream was divine - not the usual out of the carton stuff 

 The service was terrific.  And the nightly specials on drinks and wine are incredible. At 50% off many of their wines are cheaper than you could buy them in the store, and they have a wonderful selection.

With only a few nights in the area we're planning to go back here again - it was that good, that comfortable, and that great of a value.
