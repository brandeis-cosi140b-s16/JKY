I've been here twice now, once when it first opened and once again during lunch this past week. I think they have gotten into their groove, and like most Chipotles deliver a good product. We were lucky enough to go on a nice day, and with plenty of outdoor seating enjoyed our bowls in the nice sunshine. I ordered the steak bowl and really the only thing I can fault is that the steak was a bit chewy. I definitely do not think it was the cook but the quality of steak that was used. I would stick in the future with the chicken, but was craving red meat at the time. The employees were nice enough, and knew what they were doing. Also this location sends out coupons to the surrounding area, so we were able to get a BOGO bowl, awesome.
