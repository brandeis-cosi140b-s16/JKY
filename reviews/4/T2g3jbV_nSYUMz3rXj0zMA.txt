A great patio bar with full service. Gotta love their huge margaritas, they rock. I love the patio after a nice long ride on the Harley. Cooling misters, fantastic service, ice cold beverages, all the food is wonderful, and those that like a smoke can indulged on the patio. Can park your bike right next to the patio and walk in - no need to enter the main restaurant.. I have been going there for a very long time and it is still a top place relax, get a an awesome margarita and some super food. I rate the waitress' 10 of 10.
