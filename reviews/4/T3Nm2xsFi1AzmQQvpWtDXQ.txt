One of my favorite Breakfast places!
I have ordered the Eggs Benny, Florentine Omelet, The Migas, Huevos Rancheros and the Stuffed Bagel Sandwich...Everything i have had, i have enjoyed.
The atmosphere here though is so great.  even if you are sitting inside-they make you feel like your in a latin street alley.  very cool.
I also recommend their Soy Chai Latte (Best in town!).

Enjoy!
