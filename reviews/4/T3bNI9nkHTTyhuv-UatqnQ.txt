1900 does one thing amazingly well. Their drinks are unique fresh and you can tlel they put energy into their drink menu. I had a guava mexican mule and my girlfriend had a great vanilla infused marg.  Checking the menu it seems the drinks rotatae and I see a great passion fruit Marg i would try next. 

The guac is also great but for the food I say stick to the basics such as tacos.  The more expensive items just don't deliver.

Service is friendly and competent. That is all I ask for and they delivered.
