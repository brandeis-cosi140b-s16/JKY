Great food for the price. Have been twice now both at lunch time. One during the week and then again during the weekend. Very busy both times. During the week, the service is great, fast and friendly. The food was cooked to perfection. Went on a Sunday, and although the food was just as good, the service was a bit slower. However, the food was just as good. 
1st visit - Had the grilled fajitas. Homemade and very good. Comes with beans and rice. The rice was fluffy and didn't taste like Phoenix water.....which most Mexican restaurants serve. The beans tasted as if they were made just minutes prior to serving. All you can eat chips and salsa made the whole experience worth it.
2nd visit - Had the grilled chicken salad burrito. Extremely fresh and so very yummy! It also came with beans and rice and both were cooked just as well as the 1st time. It did take forever to get our check and the to-go drink we ordered, but all in all it was worth it.
Will go again.
