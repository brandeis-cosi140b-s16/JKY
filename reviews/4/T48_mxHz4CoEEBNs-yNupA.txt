Went here today and very much enjoyed my lunch.  

I shared with my husband and we had the shrimp burrito red enchilada style and the fish burrito the same way.  Both super tasty.  The burritos were actually fairly light, not a heavy lunch like a typical burrito from most Mexican restaurants.  The red sauce was very good as was the texture and taste of the tortilla.  The shrimp and fish were excellent, very fresh tasting.

The burritos came with rice which was very good and a little side salad of lettuce, tomato, and cucumber with some cheese sprinkled on it, the veggies were all very fresh and crisp.

We also had the shrimp ceviche and it was very good as well. 

The salsa that comes with the chips was also tasty.  It was not spicy, which I like, but for those looking for some spice you won't find it in the salsa that came standard.

Only thing I wasn't impressed with was the iced tea, very weak and tasted a little dirty.  But hey, next time I'll get a margarita instead!

I liked the atmosphere, felt like being in Mexico.  The service was friendly but a little slow, also very authentic Mexico!

Overall, definitely recommend it!
