Lucky me it was happy hour when I arrived at Galleria Mall!! I could use a pre-shopping drink & a snack. Sat at the bar and ordered my favorite fresh fruit strawberry margarita & taquitos. I love the chips & salsa they bring over for you to munch on while you wait. I was going to be a good girl and only have one drink..since they are huge..but the bartender was sweet enough to hook me up with one free. That gets 5 stars! I went about my shopping in a much happier mood thats for sure!!
