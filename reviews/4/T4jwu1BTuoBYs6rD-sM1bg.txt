I had to work today on my birthday.  Since it was just me and my girlfriend who moved out here and we're broken up, I didn't have anyone to spend my birthday with, so I ended up just getting some quick chow.

I mentioned it was my birthday and the friendly lady said;  "you're not spending it alone because you have your friends here at Del Taco"

And they gave me a free cookie to go along with my food.

And....I'm crying a little right now because this tiny act of human kindness just made the biggest difference.

Try the Epic steak and guacamole burrito, ifs awesome.
