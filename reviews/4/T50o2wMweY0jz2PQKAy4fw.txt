Today we decided to give Moreno's a try and had our first Sonoran hot dogs! In case you're like us and have never had one, it's a hot dog wrapped in bacon which was topped with chopped tomato, onions, pinto beans, salsa, chilies, ketchup, mustard, and mayo all nestled into a light as air, fluffy bun. We both really enjoyed them! Also I'm really big on having house made chips and salsa so we got a side of that so I could give it a try. The salsa was great! Nice texture, flavor and spiciness. However the chips were...eh. I wish they made them from scratch or at least bought better quality, more authentic chips. These reminded me of something you would find at any grocery store. The place was clean and festive inside, and the staff were friendly enough. We'll go back so we can try some of their other items.
