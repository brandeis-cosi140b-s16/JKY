Got the burritos verde. Tasted very good. However I asked for no sour cream and the waitress even repeated it back to me but they put it in it. The service was fast and they checked up on us a couple of times so that's good. Prices were reasonable. Salsa and chips were fresh and I liked how the salsa wasn't super chunky but I would have liked it to be a bit spicier. Will probably go back sometime.
