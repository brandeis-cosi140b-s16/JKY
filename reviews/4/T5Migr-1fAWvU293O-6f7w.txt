I bought a groupon for this place because I LOVE mexican food and it was a great deal. We sat on the patio because the weather was so nice. I had a sangria that was just ok. I liked the blue corn chips, but many of them were gross and rubbery due to the amount of  grease. The red salsa was by far the best. We went for the queso asado app and freakin loved it. It was a block of cheese the size of a deck of cards, grilled and topped with what our server said was cactus, but tasted like mild chiles. It came with warm tortillas and was fantastic!

For the main course I had chicken enchiladas and my man tried the buffalo ones. Both were pretty darn good. And beans and rice weren't necessary because the enchiladas were stacked, not rolled and it was a good sized portion. I did order a side of veggies and basically dumped them on top of my enchiladas. Corn, zucchini, squash and tomatoes- they really added to my enjoyment of my dish! 

We were stuffed and couldn't do dessert, but I know we'll be back so I'll get to that next time.
