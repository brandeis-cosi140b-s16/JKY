We dined here last night based on yelp reviews and it was close to our hotel. The place is not all that fancy - located on a busy main road with a bunch of construction going on. Once inside we were greeted by our very friendly server. Chips, salsa and pico quickly followed. My husband is extremely picky about his margaritas and our Texas margaritas on the rocks did not disappoint. Our food arrived quickly and portions were generous. I really enjoyed my mojarra frita. I order it often, and I particularly like the way this one was seasoned, and was extra crispy. I was surprised this place wasn't busier on a Saturday night. It might be the location, or the road construction but based on food, drinks and service, I would give them a try if you're in the area!
