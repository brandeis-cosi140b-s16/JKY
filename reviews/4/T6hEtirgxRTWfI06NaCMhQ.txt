This new spot is located right between two existing kick-butt restaurants -- Delux and Zen 32. And it is owned by the same group. Revo B is sure to be a hit with the trendy Biltmore crowd looking for a relaxed place to have healthy organic mexi. It will remind you very much of Blue Burrito. We ate there tonight in a soft open/evaluate the restaurant opening. Revo specializes in organic fresh ingredients including Harris ranch meats and top shelf fish--see the website. If this new kid on the block is anything like its bordering siblings, we will have a big winner. I ordered the carne asada burrito but got the Chicken Fajita burrito. The floor manager apologized and promised to make the kitchen aware of the mistake, but did not offer to replace. This burrito was free and really good so I didn't care. The rice side dish is very tasty with corn and lots of butter --shades of latin risotto. My wife had the same meal but in a bowl and she loved it. We also had their flavored lemonade --raspberry and mango and they were both done well. There is a choice of three different salsa/hot sauce toppings, but we couldn't hear the girl behind the counter (am I 100?) and so, just nodded our heads. I got something green and hot and really good. RB- consider posting these salsa options somewhere on the menu. Being the soft open, there were mistakes being made with orders around us, but nobody seemed to mind too much. RB is the kind of place where whatever you get, you will like. They have some kind of donutty-looking deserts displayed but won't be ready to serve until the full opening. Dining area looks cramped, but the stools help make it a lot more open than it first appears. There is decent sidewalk seating which will be popular when the weather is cool. There is also a walk-up take out window. Looking forward to coming back and also reading other reviews.
