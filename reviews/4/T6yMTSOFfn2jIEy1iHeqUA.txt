We came here to eat before going to the marquee pool cause we were starving. I know I know, we're going to have a full belly right before we have to be in our swim suits.. but we can't go hungry! This is not the Yelp way! Deciding between Chinese/Mexican and burgers, since they were the only two restaurants right next to marquee, we decided on the first. When in vegas and you want a decent, quick meal without spending a ton of money, I'd say this place was pretty good! One thing I did not like -1 star is that they charged me wrong! I looked at my signed receipt and the amount charged on my card and noticed a $15 difference! It's too small to even complain about but that wasn't cool...

We ordered: 
Silencio taco - duck tongue, definitely interesting. The lychee flavor wasn't very strong though
Pancita pastor taco - pork belly, had too much sauce
Rainbow congee - not the normal items that you usually see in a congee, but still tasty to me
Unruly monk noodle soup - this was way too salty
Ten treasures noodle soup - yum!
Like water chocolate - fried quail egg and dragon fruit - definitely a unique mix but worth a try!
