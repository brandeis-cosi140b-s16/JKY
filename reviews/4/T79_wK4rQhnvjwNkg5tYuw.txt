Hands down the best friggin taco I have ever had! The spicy pork was all I ate! Little confusing layout (ordering tacos from different sections) Love the mexican soda fountain machine too with all the odd cream based sodas! Tip ask for the handmade tortilla instead of the prepacked ones! Its WAY better and fresh!
