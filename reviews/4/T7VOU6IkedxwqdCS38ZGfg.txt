Better than Chipotle! My family and my friends have been frequenting this little walk-in, build, grab and go Mexican restaurant for years. Much like Chipotle, they give you options on the wall when you walk in, such as; "Burrito, Quesadilla, Salad, ect..." You pick your meats, toppings and condiments. If you get the combo you get chips, salsa, a drink, and these delish cinnamon and sugar chips! And at a very low price. Pretty much you get all of that for what you would get for just a burrito at Chipotle. I think the quality of everything from the meats, to the lettuce and salsas, are better then Chipotle as well. Its also not a chain. I love that! So save your money and come here instead!!
