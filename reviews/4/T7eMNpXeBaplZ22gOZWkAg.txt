It's so great to find one restaurant that's NOT a chain. I feel so bad because they are always empty inside when we get there. The chips and salsa are tasty, the food has always been good. I've been there twice, with two other people both times and everyone in my party has always enjoyed their meal. Their menu is large and varied and they do have an "A la carte" section. Another great thing that I just discovered last night, they have a sweet happy hour with $1 9oz. margaritas, that's right, you heard me, A DOLLAR!! The service has always been friendly and helpful, albeit the gentleman who served us last night didn't have much to say, but he seemed just shy more than anything else. It's clean, friendly, tasty and cheap. Go give it a try! Help support something other than the Applebees, Taco Bell, Panda Express and the countless other chain restaurants that are ubiquitous in Ahwatukee!!
