Just came here today. No mexican roots but I know my mexican food.  Great street tacos. Your chioce of soft corn or flour tortilla. I had the asada, pastor and chicken fajita tacos. Chicken fajita was the best.  It was tender juicy and delicious.  The pastor came in second and was flavorful. Asada taco was a little dry and had a small bone that could have broke a tooth! Horchata was made in house and yummy. Not too sweet; the way I like it. Salsas were fresh and delicious too! Tomatillo salsa is awesome! Nice little salsa bar and free chips for those eating in.  All in all a great little place and one I would come back to. Nothing to look at but good food. I look forward to trying other things on the menu but will probably pass on the asada taco next time.
