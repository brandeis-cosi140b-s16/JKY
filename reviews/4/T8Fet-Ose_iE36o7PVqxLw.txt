This place was pretty good. We went not knowing what to expect. I got the flautas. When I got them I was thinking it wouldn't fill me up but it actually did. Their queso isn't the "normal" but it is still tasty. My hubby got the bangin chicken burrito and said it was great! Next time I will try the cookie dough dessert.
