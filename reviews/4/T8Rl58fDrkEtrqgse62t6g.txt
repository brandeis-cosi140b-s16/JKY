Would be a 5 stars but due to poor customer service it looses a star. We specifically asked for separate checks, the server said no problem...when we went to check out the young girl just pointed to the sign and said we don't spilt checks...I let her know the server told us it was ok (as we asked him at least twice) but she just shrugged her shoulders and said Nope. So since we didn't have an itemized check we couldn't even do the math, it was the most frustrating check out I have ever had! 

So make sure you have cash and remember what you order and the price if you have a group.

This has been a restaurant that me and my family starting with my grandparents we come here at ever trip to Vegas. The food is amazing no matter what you get. But I have to say that the check out girl and not accommodating your customers made all of us reconsider coming back the next day with our group. Bad customer service and it's so disappointing!

I can say that they do amazing food and the chips and salsa are amazing and everything is huge like the al la carte tacos and burrito. Like I said my family has been coming here for 30 years for a reason.
