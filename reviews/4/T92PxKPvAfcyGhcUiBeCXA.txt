I love this place! It reminds me of Texas. Their tacos are always yummy and so are their margaritas! I just wish they salsa wasn't as chunky and they gave you more queso than a tiny little bowl when you order it. My boyfriend does the iPhone rewards program and both of us have gotten free t-shirts out of it so that's cool (and shows you how much we go...)!
