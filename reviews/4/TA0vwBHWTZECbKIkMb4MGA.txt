This place is GREAT! I would have given it 5 stars because I really enjoyed our first visit. The food was fantastic! The service was friendly, prompt, and attentive even though it was a busy night. Unfortunately the female waitresses we had on our next two visits seemed to be annoyed about having to serve us.

If we ever go back, we'll request Walter and leave the kids at home. They charge too much for the kids in my opinion anyway. They seem to be discouraging families from dining there and with food as good as they serve they can probably afford to alienate us.
