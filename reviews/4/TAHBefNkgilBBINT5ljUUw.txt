**Summary**
       - Fusion - The place is a Hawaiian/Tex Mex fusion. It takes traditional Hawaiian meats and combines them with Tex Mex's tacos, burritos, and bowls.
       - Chipotle - I'd describe this place as a Hawaiian Chipotle. The menu and ordering style is the same. The flavor however, is different.
       - Rice - Rather than the normal cilantro/lime rice at Chipotle, they have rice with sprinkles of seaweed. It's quite delicious.
       - Taste - If you're not sure which meat to get, I'd recommend asking for a sample, that way you're knowing what you're getting into.
**Ordered**
       - Huli Huli Chicken - I can't get over how flavorful and perfectly cooked this chicken is. I went with an actual Hawaiian who told that Hawaii Huli Huli Chicken was one of the pinnacles of Hawaiian food and she said this chicken ranks up there as well.
       - Kalua Pig - Kalua Pig usually is pretty salty. This one is no exception. It goes well in a bowl, but I wouldn't recommend it in a burrito.
       - Pulehu Steak - The steak seemed a little under seasoned. It might of been since I had the Kalua Pig first.
       - Grilled Fish - The grilled fish tacos we had were delicious. The fish was flaky and cooked to perfection.
       - Coconut Bark - Unfortunately, I didn't like this as much. It's a lot of chocolate and was a bit too rich for me. A couple bites and I was going into a sugar meltdown.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you like Hawaiian fusion or Chipotle. It's an interesting change and delicious.
