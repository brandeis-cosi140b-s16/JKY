This was another location that was on the list of places to try while in town. I did, and enjoyed the food very much. Being from South Jersey and now living in MD there are cookie cutter Mexican and Southwest places throughout the area. So that being said even an OK Mexican Southwest joint is going to be fantastic for me. There are a few staples that make places stand out for four stars and this place had them. There are a few things in addition to the food that makes this place great.


"The Good"
-  The staff is very attentive and polite. The fresh chips (which were awesome) arrived before I could crack open the menu. The Dr. Pepper stayed filled the entire meal and the food came out fast and was delicious;.
I ordered a combination platter to try some different things that I like taco, tamale, etc... all were very good and delicious, the plate was packed but did not have that ..."Oh here are the sides with a few small bits of the main. It was a good balance and tasted even better.
- The Salsa is also homemade, tastes great and is a great start to the meal.

"The Meh"
- When you are told to lock your doors while inside ... take the advice.
- In a strange out of left field observation ... not a lot of windows.

"The Bad"
- Nothing really bad to comment on.
