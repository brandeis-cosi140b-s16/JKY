Border Grill is one of my favorite spots in Mandalay Bay.  They have a great weekend brunch.  It's only $34.99 for brunch add $10 for unlimited mimosas.  My favorite brunch dishes are the shrimp and grits, breakfast fries and chilaquiles.  It is so nice sitting on the patio and service is always great.  Drinks are kept filled and we never feel rushed.  I've been a few times for dinner and love their nachos and fish tacos.  They make great margaritas but I prefer the prickly pear pina coloda or rum punch.  Locals should join their VIP club for 15% off and special offers emailed throughout the year.
