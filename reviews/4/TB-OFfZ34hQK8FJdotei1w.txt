So far have been here once. The menu looks amazing and I want to try everything! I had the Sonoran dogs and they were awesome. I also had the carne taco. Everything taste great and they had good customer service. It's a small place and most people miss it. They need to work on their sign and maybe put some advertising on side of street to gain business. Place did pack in people while we were there. Plus if you like Thrifty ice cream they serve it!!
