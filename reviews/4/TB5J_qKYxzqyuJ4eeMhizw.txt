While I may be risking my reputation by writing a positive review for a fast food chain, Rubio's has been consistently a safe option whe I don't have a choice but food court.

This particular location is inside Las Vegas South Premium Outlets, but the same thing can be said to any.

Unlike Chipotle, they do have seafood tacos, and in fact they are pretty decent.

If you haven't tried yet, trust me and order their fish taco especial. And let me know what you think here.
