Went here Sunday for lunch with my boyfriend.  As always, I had a good time.   When I think of Flicka's I think cool chill laid back place to grab a corona.  They only have bottled beers and I believe a full bar.  Everything I've eaten here has been quite tasty, nothing too special, but also not a breaded food coma either.  I've been on live music nights as well and always have fun, I admit it is such a mixed crowd, but I don't mind, as long as I'm not paying a cover charge to wonder around aimlessly because I can't find a seat or a spot on the dance floor.  I wish Chuck Powell and the edge 103.9 would be holding the Fantasy Football Texas Hold'em for Monday nights, that was always my favorite!  

Anyway back to my most recent trip.  The bar was pretty much empty.  There was a table of say 20 people celebrating a birthday or something, and I'm sure that they were regulars because it seemed as if they knew the bartender fairly well.  I'm pretty sure she was the only one serving too.  She was pretty good at keeping the beers full and in front of us.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail to start to fill out our appetites.  It was pretty good and we left thinking we had to try and make this on our own.  After letting that settle we decided to split the fajita sandwhich.  I'm so glad we did, it was so good.  As we were sitting at the bar, we noticed a bottle of Seagrams Sweet Tea Vodka.  What in the world???  I didn't know Seagrams had vodka.  We asked the bartender what it was and she stated the obvious but also asked us if we wanted to taste it.  I thought that was pretty cool!
