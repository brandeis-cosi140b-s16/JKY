I first tried out Mi Patio about 2 years ago and thought that it was just okay.  But my sister wanted to go have lunch today, and with both of us having a craving for Mexican, Mi Patio is in the middle of our 2 offices so I decided to give it a try again.  Thank goodness for second chances...because Mi Patio delivered!

I found the restaurant to be much cleaner than on my initial visit, and the service was so attentive and so quick.  We never had our glasses less than half full without getting a refill, and the chips were flowing!  The chips were really good, served warm they were light and crispy!

Our food seriously came out less than 5 minutes after ordering, which is such a bonus when you are on your lunch hour.  My sister had the spinach enchiladas and loved them.  I went with a beef taco and green chile beef burro.  The taco was excellent, the shell was crispy and not greasy and the beef had a ton of flavor.  I usually measure a restaurant based on their green chile and their beans, and these were both excellent.  The green chile had tender beef and the sauce had some nice spicy elements to it.  The beans were creamy and covered in cheese, just the way I like them!

I will definitely be going back to Mi Patio, the food is good and the people that work there are so hospitable, it makes for a wonderful dining experience.
