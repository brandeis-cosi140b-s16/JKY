The service at The Salted Limit is generally stellar.  I've eaten there several times and never waited more than 15 minutes for a seat and always had a great server.    The chips and salsa are great - freshly cooked corn chips, green and red salsa and bean dip.  I had the fajitas for the first meal and they were very good.  The last time I went, however, I got a mixed beef/chicken fajita plate and was dissapointed.  The presentation was nice, but the meat needed more seasoning and the beef was tough and chewy.   However, I'll be back because the location inside Aliante is convenient and I'm convinced it was just an off night.
