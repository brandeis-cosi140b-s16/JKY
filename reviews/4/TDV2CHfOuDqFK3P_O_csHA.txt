We went here for early dinner after movies on a Saturday.
I picked this place because I wanted Menudo (it is a huge bowl for less than $6)
Hubby got the carne asada fries, and he liked them. Huge mountain of fries topped with carne asada, cheese, guacamole and sour cream.
Daughter had shrimp cocktail and cheese cake.
Shrimp cocktail was very good (I didn't taste it but she did like it a lot) and the cheesecake we all shared and it was so so... it was sweet, caramel like flavor, so all and all it was a nice dessert, but not much ofthe cheesecake flavor and consistency that we were expecting.

We will definitely be back, especially since I found this place looking for tripitas (I have not found many places that serve tripitas)

However, the few times we have been there it has been a tad warm... so as the temperatures increase we will probably be ordering to go.

Staff was very friendly.
