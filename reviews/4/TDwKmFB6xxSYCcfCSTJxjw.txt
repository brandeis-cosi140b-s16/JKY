Vegetarians are sometimes hard to please, but Mad Mex really delivers! There are a lot of veggie & vegan options and I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. Herbivores & carnivores will all be pleased with the extensive menu. They also have a great beer selection and make good & spicy bloody mary's. 

I live very close to the Oakland location but cringe when I think about going there, this particular locale is always elbow to elbow with college students and the seating arrangement makes it difficult for the servers to maneuver through the diners. Finding a parking spot is also a panic attack inducing experience. Luckily, there are branches in Monroeville, Robinson, and McKnight Rd. I usually go to the Monroeville location because it's bigger, it seems like they put more love into the dishes, parking is never a problem, and the outdoor seating area is a plus.
