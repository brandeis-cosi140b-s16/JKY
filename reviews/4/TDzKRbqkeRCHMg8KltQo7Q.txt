Chipotle is generally good all the time. There are rare occasions in which the ingredients are just old and aren't made properly, but that never has been the case for me at this location. Most of the time, they are very consistent.

If you have never been to Chipotle, it is somewhat different from other restaurants. The customer goes through an ingredient buffet in which they pick ingredients that they would want in their burrito or bowl. Other additions include drinks, small tortillas, and salsa. This location lets you refill your own drinks.

I always get a chicken or carnitas bowl. You can get two kinds of meat, but that is extra. I do not get the steak because it is not well done. I can't comment on their beans because I am not a bean fan (don't they make you fart?), but my boyfriend seems to like them and gets them every time. They don't charge extra for rice, beans, or lettuce. I've seen people get burritos so big that they have to wrap them with two large tortillas!

I can't finish a bowl in one setting, but I think it is tasty as leftovers. I really like their food here (and all the other Chipotles). It is simple, consistent, and delish!
