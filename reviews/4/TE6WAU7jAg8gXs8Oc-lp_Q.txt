Texan here! Stopped by this joint recently craving some Mexican. I was not disappointed! 
The food was cheap, delicious, and came out quickly. In fact, I think I'm going to stop by today! 

There will always be nay-sayers. To whom I say: Don't expect top quality atmosphere and service for such low prices!
