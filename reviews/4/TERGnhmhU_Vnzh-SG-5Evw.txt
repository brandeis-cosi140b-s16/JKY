This place is about 2 minutes from our house, and we have been coming here for 3 years.  We only found out it was called "Santa Rosa Taco Shop" after we had been at least a dozen times, when we finally used a check card to pay and got a receipt with the name on it.  We call it Mexican Food, because that's what the sign says out front.

This place is excellent, and you get a lot of food for the money.  We get chimichangas and enchiladas frequently.  The carne asada fries are excellent.  But, I recently started getting breakfast burritos and I highly recommend them.  Better than Roberto's.  This place is well worth finding.
