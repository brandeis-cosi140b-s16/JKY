In my opinion, you can never go wrong with Chipotle. It's quick, tasty, and they use all natural ingredients. The steak burrito bowl is my absolute fav, their steak has a nice spiciness to it. Their staff has always been friendly and inviting every time I walk through the door. 

You can also order online before and pick it up at a certain time at your local Chipotle. The tacos are also great if you're a taco fan. If you order a meal with a drink it usually comes out to about $10, and without the drink you're getting a great bang for your buck! 

A great choice when looking for a satisfying, quick, hearty meal.
