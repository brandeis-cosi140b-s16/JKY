I stumbled on this place while driving by. I had an awesome chile relleno burrito. I haven't seen this since I was in Mexico. It was very tasty. The place is set up like a down home Chipotle in that you can see everything and choose your burrito fillings. The restaurant is very authentic and the staff are friendly.
