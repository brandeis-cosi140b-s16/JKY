If you're looking for one of the best holes in the wall, check out Pepe's Taco Villa. It's been in business forever and there's a good reason: the food is consistently top notch.

The chicken mole is worth doing a spin class for. It's easilt the best mole in town. No competition.

If you're looking for something different, try the Mexican pizza. Again, the best I've had in Phoenix.

It's not the fanciest place, but it's one of the best.
