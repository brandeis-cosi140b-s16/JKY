Firstly, we went here because we saw this place on an episode of "Taco Trip"  Las Vegas. Food is kinda pricey, but I'll pay for good food. I got the grilled steak fajitas and they were delicious. The meat was perfectly cooked and flavorful. It was a very generous portion as well, but then again for $24 if should be. On the scale of 1-5, the fajitas were a 5. My mother got the street tacos and although she didn't hate them she wasn't impressed. Her exact words were "I'm not dying to go back".  I on the other hand will be returning. Also, I think the fact that food is non gmo and organic is a hella plus for me.
