Yelp comes thru again.........

The prawn/octopus ceviche was perfect and incredibly fresh. For $5.50 it was such a great deal because there was a large portion. Their chef has a special way with pulpo, it was just so perfectly prepared and tender. Only thing it needed was more aquacate and we ordered that.

We also tried their famous molcajete with chicken and it is obvious they have a unique cooking method as this is breast meat yet so soft and moist even without any of their wonderful red chile sauce which is using similar chili's as used in enchilada chili puree. Overall it is a great dish and stays hot so long cause of the hot molcajete (be careful not to burn yourself).

Our waitress Karen was as good as it gets, friendly and knowledgeable about the food. Overall one of the best Mexican restaurants serving authentic food I have eaten at.......and we eat a ton of great Mexican food in Oakland and the bay area so easy to compare.
