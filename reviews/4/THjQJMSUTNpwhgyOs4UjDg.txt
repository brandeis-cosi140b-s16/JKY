I have always had fresh food here. The service is nice and simple. 

I had the 2 Spicy tacos in soft corn shells, with cheese, sour cream, pico and lettuce. Served with chips and a drink for under 6 bucks. 

The meat was good, not too spicy at all, the chips were a little greasy but I like that and the salsa bar was good. None of the salsa's were over the top good or hot. I suggest getting the "super hot" from the people before you sit down. 

The place was clean and the price was excellent.
