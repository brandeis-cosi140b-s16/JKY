Chipotle gets three stars for the food but earns an extra one for being almost completely GMO free.  There is no soy, not even oil, in anything except for the tofu and even that is organic.  While most other assembly line burrito places have cut back on the nickel and diming, Chipotle still does it and it can get expensive quick.  They charge almost $2 for guacamole on a burrito and you only have the option of cheese or sour cream (you have to pay extra if you want both).  Add a drink onto that and you're looking at $13 dollars for a burrito, chips, and a drink.  The cheese is also mozzarella which just doesn't go well with burritos.  The rest of the add-ons are limited compared to other similar style places  The chicken is grilled fresh; however, the charred taste is too much and leaves it with a burnt flavor.  The place also needs a makeover.  While the sanitation grade is good, the soda fountain are a was a little messy and the floors were dirty and cracked.  The place could use a refresh to make it a little brighter.  

I appreciate the non-GMO component of Chipotle, however I think the flavor of the food and the lack of fillings misses the mark slightly.
