Hola, comida deliciosa! Talk about generous portions, affordable prices, and great flavor...yes, please! 

After reading previous reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect. However, in my experience the place was very clean. In fact, the servers were cleaning off tables when we entered and when we were leaving they were wiping down the menus. They stayed busy cleaning. Extra plus in my book. 

The portions must have changed too. Like I mentioned, they were good sized and I left with a too-full belly. The veggie burrito was huge and around $5...for dinner! The salsas were good, chips fresh, and I really liked the individual salsa cups with a mini jar to pour your own. 

I really liked the bright colors and the art on the booths; it made the ambiance cheerful. The service was very friendly too. Need to catch up on a novela? It's playing in the corner. If you are in need of some chicle, you're in luck, they have that at the cash register. Tip: No rush to pay, just go to the register when you're ready. 

What a difference a year makes! I think this place has turned things around and I plan to return.
