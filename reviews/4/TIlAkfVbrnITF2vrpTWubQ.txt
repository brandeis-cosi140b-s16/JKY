This place is literally a diamond in the rough. Off the beaten path of the Strip and located next door to a gentlemen's club, you would not expect to find such a classy, well maintained restaurant offering so many fresh, GMO-free, vegetarian choices... that is also open 24/7!

For starters, the food is outstanding. I'm a vegetarian, my mom is a strict vegan with nut allergies, and my dad, boyfriend, and brother are big ol' dinosaurs who love meat. There is literally something for everyone, with vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free choices identified on the menu. The signature veggie tacos are the best, with the cheese grilled right on the tortilla and overflowing with saut√©ed veggies like zucchini and squash. The table side guacamole is massive, but we somehow still manage to devour all of it every single time. It's a must-order!

I've been to El Dorado Cantina several times and have always had consistently good service. The restaurant is clean and well-tended to, albeit a little dimly lit/straight up dark. It's perhaps better suited for a date night or dinner with friends than a casual family lunch, but eh, no big deal. When they first opened, they had lots of good deals for locals and those in the industry, but I think those have tapered out as they grew more popular. Still, the prices are reasonable, even without the heavy discounts. 

My only complaint is that I've yet to get a good, solid margarita from them. It's always too weak or too strong. (I'll keep trying! Ha!)

As far as Mexican places in Vegas go, it is second only to my favorite restaurant of all time, Frank & Fina's Cocina. Still, we highly recommend this place and plan to go back again soon.
