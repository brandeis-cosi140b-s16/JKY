I've spent some time in Mexico City and enjoyed tacos there...these definitely rate, although I'm not sure whose idea it was to put the rice right in the tacos. I will ask for my tacos without it next time, as I found it just too weird. The chicken was well spiced and perfectly cooked, and the tortillas had that nice corn flavor I like. The Mexicans I know, both in Mexico and Chicago, top their tacos with chopped raw onion, jalapenos and cilantro, and I've yet to see that here in Pittsburgh, so I found myself missing that trio, but good flavors overall and thoughtful preparation will keep me coming back here. I also had the tortilla soup and it was delicious...the most Mexican thing I've eaten since moving here, authentically flavored with achiote, which also gives it a lovely orangey-red color. Finally, some Mexican food in the 'burgh I can get behind.
