I am generally not a big fan of the cliche restaurant themes, so when I heard about "Rock Taco" I was thinking "here we go, another cheesy spot that will play loud music and push tequila shots to make you forget about the bad food" but I was pleasantly surprised... so much that I didn't care about the bad rock artwork or the motorcycle parts on the walls.

Let me first say that a well crafted taco is one of life's great pleasures, and it is all centered on quality ingredients.  I could tell these guys don't cut corners - the meat and veggies were all super fresh and the corn tortillas were just perfect.  Quality was so good that I didn't need those Patron shots after all.

Only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that second time I went I felt like I got the B team experience... it was a Sunday and I'll give 'em a pass because I think everyone was hung over, but consistency is needed to get a 5 out of 5.
