Classic mexican place, Not too different from the others but i did notice their bar seating was a little weird. the chairs were either too tall for the bar or the bar was too tall for the chairs. 

We sat at a normal table that seated four. The table top was made of complete beer bottle caps which i thought was very unique. I've never seen that in a  restaurant or bar before so i thought it was pretty interesting. The food here was decent, tasted like similar places I've been too but nothing unfamiliar. I did enjoy their burritos more than usual, i thought they were bigger than most places.

I always love the sides in mexican dishes. My favorite is the rice and refried beans. i wish they would have given us larger tortillas when my hubby order the fajita platter but i guess smaller portions help you control more of what you eat. The one good thing about this place was the Margaritas. They make a delicious classic margarita but I wasn't too thrilled about the price. they offer about 3 to 4 different sizes and almost 5 varieties of flavors. I go lemon lime because i was never too thrilled with strawberry or watermelon.

This little place is along the strip in squirrel hill on Murray Ave. If you go up the hill it's on your right and if your going down, it's on the left. If you stop by here try the margarita it's absolutely great!!
