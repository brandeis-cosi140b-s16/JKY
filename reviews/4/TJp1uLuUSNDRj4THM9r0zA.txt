Made a quick lunch trip to this location.  Had the Coastal Trio, which was very good.  The atmosphere has a beach vibe and was very clean and organized.  I probably will try another meal when I go back, not because the Coastal Trio was bad, but I would love to try a more traditional style taco from there in place of the seafood ones.  

Overall: A-  
Will definitely return and try new things at this place!
