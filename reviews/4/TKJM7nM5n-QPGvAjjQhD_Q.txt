I'd walked past this place many, many times before actually going in.  My boyfriend and I referred to it (lovingly) as the "shady Mexican" place.  He grew up in an area with plenty of authentic Mexican food, and apparently they have the right kind of chairs here that mean they serve good, authentic food.  Or something like that.

The point is, the food here is really good.  And it's really cheap, which is a rare but appreciated combination.  I usually get the huaraches since it's something different than what you normally see at "Mexican" restaurants.  Everything seems really fresh, and the guy working there is always really friendly.  The absolute only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is because the place isn't the cleanest I've seen.  But don't let the shadiness scare you away!  If you don't particularly care for the seating area, just get your food to go.

They have some competition now with Maize open just down the street, but if you ask me, El Charro is just as good.  So if you like Maize, definitely give El Charro a chance!
