There are a couple of things that make you realize you are at a LEGIT mexican place.

Menu has lots of things that you have no idea what it means
There is a random guy that plays a guitar in the corner
And the most important : there is a chubby nice mexican lady making tortillas ..fresh ones 

This restaurant was amazing. Service was impecable. Drinks , salsa and chips NEVER went below half before getting refilled.Impressive!

I am not giving 5 stars because of its location. Why so far?? and why behind a truck stop?? 

What would i recommend? The coca cola steak, carne asada and the refried beans. Epic win plates!

We were a group of 12 and the food came outstanding, service was impressive, ambiance was legit and overall experience was great. Check it out !!
