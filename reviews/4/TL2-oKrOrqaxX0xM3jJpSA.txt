The food was really good.  I had the chicken lime salad, the kids had a cheese crisp and beans and my sister-in-law had a big burrito that she loved. 

The atmosphere is really nice as the new location is a vast improvement over the last location. 

We had a new server so you want to give them the benefit of the doubt but she was pretty bad.   Ordering a margarita from her was a bit of a nightmare - not going to lie.  I had to send it back and of course got the excuse that it was the bartender's fault. 

Don't order iced tea though if you are not a fan of sugar or sweet n low - that's all they have.
