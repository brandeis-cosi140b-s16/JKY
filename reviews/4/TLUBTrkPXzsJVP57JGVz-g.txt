I tried this place out after passing by a few times.  It is way better than Roberto's Taco Shop and the prices are reasonable.  I had the shredded beef enchiladas and they were great as were the rice and beans.  They are where the Popeye's used to be and I hope they have a better fate.  I will certainly be back.
