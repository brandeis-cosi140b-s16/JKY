Awesome cheap Mexican fare a short drive from the Vegas strip.  Who knew?  We went a bit out of our way during a day trip (between visiting Red Rock Canyon and Hoover Dam) to check out this place on the recommendation of a friend, and we were not disappointed.  

The food is nothing fancy, but it's real, and it's good.  The guac is a highlight - made tableside, fresh and flavorful (at about half of NYC prices for the same).  The atmosphere is festive and the service attentive.  A ton of locals/regulars is never a bad sign either.
