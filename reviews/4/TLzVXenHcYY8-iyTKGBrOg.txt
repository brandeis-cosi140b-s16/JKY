I have heard for years about Cafe Rio and how delicious it is,  I've never tried it myself until a week ago.  Let me just say, it is as good as everyone said it is!  All of the food is pretty good, but the pork and creamy tomatillo dressing are amazing. I also like the fresh made tortillas that they use for the tacos & burritos and the chips.  The only thing I haven't liked is the queso, I don't care for the extra things they mix in to it.  They give a free little kid quesadilla, which is good for me because my kids don't eat that much anyway.  I hate paying a ton for a kids' meal they don't even touch.  

The only downside is that it is a touch expensive.  I think the burrito pricing is similar to Chipotle or other places ($7.49), but Cafe Rio charges extra for sour cream or dressing.  The chips are also a bit expensive.  They do have daily specials, for example on Tuesdays tacos are $1.95.   If the pricing was a bit better, it would be 5 stars all the way....
