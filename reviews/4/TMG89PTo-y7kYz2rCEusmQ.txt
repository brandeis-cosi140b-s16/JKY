I had the pork tamales and they were pretty good. The meat was nice and moist and flavorful. The aqua fresca's were excellent as well. My wife had the horchata with a splash of amaretto added and it was tasty. I tried both of their margaritas, the blood orange and the house and they were very good. My wife had the enchilata's and she enjoyed them.

My only complaint to this place is the drink prices of their speciality drinks. When it's not happy hour they are $10 each. If you like to have a few drinks, it would be best to visit here during happy hour which offers some great prices for drinks along with food. We will be back and plan on trying their happy hour food/drinks next.

Forgot to mention, we were able to get seated right away, service was excellent and food came out really fast. We were in and out within an hour.
