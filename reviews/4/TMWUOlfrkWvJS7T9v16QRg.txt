I am a big fan of Qdoba. I have been since I was in college in Reno and a Qdoba opened up not too far from my apartment. This place was awash with kids from the University all the time. Mainly because it was the first place of its kind to open up in Reno. No one had really experienced this type of fast-food movement before. Reno had Qdoba before it had Chipotle.

Overall I like both Chipotle and Qdoba. There are a few subtle differences, but for the most part is the same style, same food, same way of doing things.

The one thing I enjoy different about Qdoba is the their Queso Burrito, which Chipotle does not have. Basically you get a burrito (or anything I guess) and you can have queso dumped on it. Thus making your somewhat "healthy" meal completely and utterly unhealthy (add sour cream for extra fatness, yay!).

This particular location is in a very busy shopping center. Parking is quite limited. The restaurant itself is also on the small side. But, I've never waited long for the food and the employees for the most part are quick and cordial. 

I would give 5 stars, but since being introduced to Chipotle I think I like the Chipotle style just slightly better than Qdoba, unless of course I want queso. Well, then the choice is clear.
