Cabo Wabo is a lot of fun. My husband and I came here on Sunday to watch the afternoon football games. The hostess was nice enough to put us at a table in front of the TV with the game we wanted to watch. We ordered a pitcher of pi√±a colada, but instead got a pitcher of the Cocorita, but didn't complain because it tasted good. We shared the tuna ceviche, guacamole, and quest fundido which were all great. We also shared a carne asada burrito, which wasn't bad, but the enchilada sauce was too smokey and the carne asada pieces were a little too grilled bordering on crunchy. We'd definitely go back for another lunch next time we're in Vegas.
