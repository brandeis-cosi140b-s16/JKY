This restaurant is actually pretty good for being in a casino. I loved the loungey type feel of this place with the couches. Yes, some people have said it's kind of funky trying to eat but it's not too bad!! Tons of TV's to watch sports and they make a yummy mojito and they have tons of tequila too (obviously). We had chips and guac and chicken quesadillas and wow they had a kick to them! But it was very good and hit the spot after you have been in the pool all day. Our server was okay. Not the best but not too bad either. Price is a little high but it's to be expected for Vegas.

But, all in all, I think this is a great place to come with your buds (no kids) and watch the game and have some drinks and apps. Glad this is at the Golden Nugget now!
