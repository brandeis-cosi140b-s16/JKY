I had the lunch menu. I do love the size portions of their lunch menu. You don't have to be concerned about whether you get too much or too little food.  They have great soft spoken servers who don't over power you. I feel that the entrance was a little confusing due to having to wander to through to the back of the restaurant to find assistance. All in all I enjoyed the time and price. I would recommend them for a casual lunch. I do however wish their lunch menu had an al' carte option for some things. But I think they do the to simplify their menu. Which is a good thing too IF you're in a hurry. Highly recommended, you won't be disappointed.
