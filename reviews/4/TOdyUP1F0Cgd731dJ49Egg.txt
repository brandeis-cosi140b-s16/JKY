This place is pretty solid. Pretty dang solid.

I've had many a taco, and here the can make some delicious pricey tacos! I've had the pork, carne asada, and fish tacos (estilo baja / mahi mahi) and lemme tell you, I am usually not a fan of any fish! The fish tacos here are so delectable and decadent, you don't even know you're eating fish they come topped with chipotle aioli and Mexican slaw. The carne asada here is actually quite tasty, the steak is tender and juicy and is seasoned to perfection this has a jicama slaw and serrano roasted aioli, the pork is also yummy and has a small sweet hint to it, but still delicious this is topped with pineapple and chile de arbol salsa! They come 4 to an order, but are on the small side so it's best to order a side, or a few and do it family style!

During this trip we also had some mac n cheese, and boy was it killer! Again it is a little small bowl, but man, its worth it! They use a chile poblano, along with  corn, and manchego cheese. DEAD. SOOO GOOD! We also had the guac with tocino, the mango, and the original. Original guac will still always be my favorite. UNLESS THEY BRING BACK THE PINEAPPLE! That one right there is TO DIE FOR!

The Misty Sleeve is one of my favorite drinks, but honestly all of their drinks are excellent. The customer service here is awesome, your glass is continually full and they are constantly checking on you!

I will def be back! Especially for industry day and happy hour!

Yay!
