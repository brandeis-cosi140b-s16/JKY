What a surprise! Found this place on Yelp and it turned out to have a great breakfast menu. Had the chorizo, cheese and roasted green chili omelette served with beans and a tortilla. It was excellent. My husband had the traditional huevos rancheros - also very good. Place was very clean including bathroom and the server was absolutely great - very friendly and gracious. Would definitely recommend to eat here when coming out to see Casa Grande National Monument - it's just down the street from ruins.
