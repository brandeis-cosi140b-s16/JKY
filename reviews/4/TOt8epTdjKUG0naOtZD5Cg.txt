I don't like Mexican food as a general rule. I don't like beans. I don't like sour cream or guac.  It's all gross. But I was pleasantly surprised when  my gf and I went here.  It was close and had a Yelp deal so we tried it out. We've actually been there twice. The food was great. I had a braised pork dish.  The place wasn't packed which I liked. Pretty chill please. You can have a conversation.  Dessert was awesome. The cookie dough taquitos or whatever they were.  I didn't give 5 stars because I wasn't blown away.  But my expectations were exceeded.  I will def go back
