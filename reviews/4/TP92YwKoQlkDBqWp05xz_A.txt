Viva Salsa was an unexpected find. I was going to go to Cabo for lunch only to find out they weren't open. But Viva Salsa was literally a few steps away. I decided to take my chances...and it was worth it. Large portions, reasonable pricing, no attitude, a simple salsa bar that has salsa with a kick (don't let the size fool ya, what they offer is good stuff!), and fountain drinks that are strong. This is on my short list of places for when I need a Mexican food fix. Service with a smile is always appreciated and I get that here.
