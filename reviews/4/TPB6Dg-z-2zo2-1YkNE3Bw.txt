Deeeeee-lish! Good, old fashioned and legit Mexican food. It seriously tastes like you're enjoying a home cooked meal at a friends' home. Simple plates full of flavorful food. I demolished my chile relleno, beef taco and rice and beans. Yep, all by myself. The prices are so affordable too that I can see why customers keep going back. Staff are friendly and service is good too. An all over good go to spot for satisfying your craving for good homstyle Mexican food.
