the whole "Fresh Mex" fad is in full effect.  These franchise types are everywhere.  Long gone are the days of the battle:  Should I just get Taco Bell or Del Taco?  Now we have these Mexifast food joints.  I have always noticed this place while driving around.  I was on a lunch break one day and wanted to check it out.  

I entered the restaurant and was greeted promptly.   I had no idea what I wanted to get.  It seems like this place boast more about its seafood and not just chicken or steak stuff.  I asked the guy behind the counter, "What should I get?"  He was friendly and said I had to try the shrimp burrito.  He said I wouldn't be disappointed.  

The restaurant has the typical salsa bar.  All clearly labeled and lined up in their spicy level.  I usually always get a verde salsa.  The cool thing about this salsa bar is that they recommend what salsa tastes best with what you order.  So I got the salsa that goes well with shrimp.  

When I got my burrito is was a decent size.  I wasn't too worried about a big pile of food because it was lunch and I didn't want to be sleepy the rest of the day.  I took a bite and it was pretty good.  The mixture of shrimp, rice, and spices were great.  

Will I try this place again?  Yes  Will I get it for dinner?  probably not 

Either way it was a tasty burrito, so go ahead and give it a shot!   Cheers!
