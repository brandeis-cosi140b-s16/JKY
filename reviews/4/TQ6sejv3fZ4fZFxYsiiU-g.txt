I really like al pastor and after I saw the pics here for this place I knew I needed to give them a try. I've never been here so it was a little confusing walking in I didn't know how/where to order, so we just down and after a few minutes a lady came and asked us to move to another table saying that one was wobbly. Kind of annoying because I liked where we were but I think I was just hungry and being a bitch. Chips & salsa were given and we had our food within a few minutes. I ordered 2 tacos al pastor & hubby 1  lengua taco. They serve the tacos with a red sauce and I also requested a green. My pastor tacos were really good! The green sauce was spicy & delicious and complimented the taco so well. After tasting my food, I felt like I had just ate a snickers and turned back into the happy go lucky person I usually am! My hubby just kept mumbling "it's good" in regards to his taco & the salsas, I don't eat tongue so I can't speak on his food but he seemed to really enjoy. I Only gave 4 stars for 3 reasons:   1) confusing sitting/ordering process&being asked to move from my table 2) flys, it's annoying and gross 3) the carrots, radish seemed dried/old 
Bottom Line: I'll be coming back..  soon! 3 delicious tacos with chips and salsa for just under $5!! One of the best taco shops I've found in Phoenix.
