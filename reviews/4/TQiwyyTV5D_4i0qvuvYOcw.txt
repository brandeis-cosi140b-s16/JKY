Eating here was a bit of a happy accident. Our group of six was on the hunt for a brunch spot and didn't want to spend upwards of an hour waiting for a table. We also didn't want to admit defeat and eat at Denny's. We started looking for lunch instead of brunch, saw that Canonita was nearly empty on a Saturday a little after 11 am, and decided to look no further. I had no great expectations regarding authenticity (I would have gone to Tacos El Gordo for that) but I was optimistic that our meal would be reasonably tasty. I was right.

As luck would have it, the special that day was a chorizo and egg burrito, so I got to have brunch after all. The massive, fork-and-knife burrito was served with cilantro rice and black beans. The beans were nice--mild and lightly sweet--and the rice had a refreshing quality about it. The burrito itself was very tasty (I mean, chorizo and egg, how can you go wrong?). My cactus margarita (made with puree of the fruit, not the paddle) was kind of dull . . . it could have been any margarita, really. My friends ordered a pitcher of some sort of pineapple infused margarita and that was a great choice. Incredibly sweet, but really good. No free table chips/salsa here, but it's Vegas so everything has a price. We ordered chips, salsa and guacamole and it was all very worthy.

Although everything was tasty I'd probably only award three stars if it weren't for the canal-side seating and the fantastic service. I recognize that we were one of the only parties dining at the time so attentiveness should be a given but the attitude was superb as well, particularly when we managed to spill not one but two beverages (and that was before we started drinking!).
