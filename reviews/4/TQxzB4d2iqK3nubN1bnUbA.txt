Do you like Mexican food?  Give this cute restaurant a try. Chips were not free but they were served warm, light and crispy.  The salsa was fresh and tasty.  I ordered the barbacoa burrito.  It was huge and delicious. Other Mexican restaurants use a lot of rice as a filler, but this burrito was stuffed full of mostly meat, with rice,  beans, guac and sour cream.  This restaurant is waiting on its liquor license- should have it by early June.  I loved the mexican music they played - it made for a happy atmosphere!  Very good service.
