This is traditional mexican food that my family has been eating for years.I have been eating at this place since I was a kid. Fajardo's serves up the same great food as Lily's did. Their green chile is delicious and I love their salsa. However, the location is a bit hidden.

The one thing I have never liked is their chips. For having such great salsa, it's a travesty to serve grocery-store chips. 
We also miss Zip and Zip's service, but the Fajardo's are doing a spectacular job keeping the legacy going.
