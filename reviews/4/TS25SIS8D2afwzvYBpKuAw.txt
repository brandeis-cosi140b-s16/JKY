My husband and I are always on the hunt for a place to eat some street tacos, burritos, or even nachos.  I've been here 4 times now and each time they are consistently friendly and delicious.  We typically go to Taco y Taco as it is on our side of town, but we recently drove up to Frijoles because we know that the product is just as good, we like the small/low-key atmosphere here, and the pricing is a bit lower.  We give it two thumbs up and will be recommending this place to all of our friends and visitors!  Go and get their mini tacos (we prefer al pastor), nachos, and fries!!!
