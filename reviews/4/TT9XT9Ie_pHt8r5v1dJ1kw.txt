Despite my lack of check-ins, I've been to this location at least a dozen times in the last couple years and i really like them. I've never had a problem at this location. Let me say that again, this location! I have had food poisoning from the location on baseline and mcclintock. Anyhow, this location is always really clean and the staff are very friendly. I've never had an issue with bones like others have stated and the food is always fresh. I like the ultimate chicken bowl and the avocado burrito is really good too. The avocado salsa is good too!  Plus they have cherry coke! Win!
