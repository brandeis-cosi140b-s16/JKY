We are regulars.  If you love spicy, you'll love it.  If you love fresh made salsa, you'll love it.  Tonight we asked if they had chipotle and our waiter said they were out.  5 minutes later, a cook brought us a fresh made batch, made just for us ... No way!!!  Yum - dip a chip in that and then in a little guac - yum!
Inside needs a little attention, but bathroom is clean.  We love sitting outside.
Margarita, anyone?  The Brazilian is worth it.  Skip the rest, they are just ok, but this one is killer and worth it!
