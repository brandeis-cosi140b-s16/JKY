My hubby and I have been to this great restaurant now twice. There are a few reasons why we really like it. First, the food is good. Try the shrimp Ceviche-divine! I crave it! The Grande Platter for two was more than enough yummy food for the two of us. And the best part of this place...Sunday, after church, around 11am, they have 2 Mexican singers-one of which is 82 yo!! His voice and his ability to play guitar are fabulous. Not gonna lie, I cry each time I hear him cause he is so sweet to listen to!! Head out to a nice dining experience at Las Fuentes!
