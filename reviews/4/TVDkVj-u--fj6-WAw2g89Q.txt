I don't even remember when was the last time I had El Pollo Loco so on my way back from Cali I decided to stop by and get something. I was starving so I ended up getting the 12 piece meal with a side of Mac n cheese, cole slaw and mashed potatoes, ALL to myself . The drive thru was fast, efficient and super friendly. My only complaint is that they are not very generous on their condiments.
