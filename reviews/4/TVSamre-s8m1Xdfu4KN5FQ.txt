Serrano's has been a constant in our lives since the 90's. We have celebrated many birthdays there over the years. Today, was no different. We had good service by Manuel today. He was prompt in getting our drink orders in and didn't hesitate over filling our chip bowl countless times. We had everything from the margaritas,  to the rellenos, chicken enchiladas, and tostadas. All which were very good. Our party of 5 adults and a baby spent 2 hours in our booth over lunch. Complimentary fried ice cream for our birthday kids was delish! The sombrero photos will be cherished forever.
