Once again, YELP doesn't let you down. We wanted to find an authentic Mariscos place without the Las Vegas strip prices. Found this restaurant not too far from downtown LV. Was a little weary cause it only had 10 reviews.. thinking all the family and friends posted to increase its Rating.. but actually this place is 4 stars and awesome service. 
     Don't let the outside deter you from this place, yeah its hole in wall, but inside was warming and clean. The owner/manager was very friendly and attentive. The food was good to pretty good... depending what you get. I had a shrimp cocktail, and shrimps wrapped bacon on the side, my new wifey had two tostadas de cerviche which were loaded w/ tons of cerviche, Pricing was reasonable, tad bit more expensive than one I go to in Cali.. but cheaper than anything of mariscos u would find on the strip. 
      At conclusion of our meal, Owner/Manager thanked us and even offered deep fried ice cream for us for FREE!  We said no at first.. but decided sure why not.. not a lot of things FREE in life...  and yes it was EXCELLENT!!  Caramel/Chocolate drizzled on top, w/ crispy corn thin strips..   We'll be coming back again.  Wish I would have taken pics but we scarfed out food down pretty fast.
