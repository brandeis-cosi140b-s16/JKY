I remembered to review this because I just read my dad's.
Yes, my tostada was really good. I am a sucker for a good tostada and I don't think I've had one since August (or the last time I went to Rancho Del Zocalo in Disneyland, which is still in the summer). I didn't get to try my dad's burrito, but I don't really care for beans so I guess it's all good.
Cafe Rio is all over Utah (which is pretty full of Mormons and Polygamists [they ARE NOT the same thing, people! Trust me; I have but one mom]). Since a lot of people have moved to Vegas back when the economy didn't suck, some rich dude was like, "Hey, I could go for some Cafe Rio right now but I don't want to drive to Saint George particularly".
The food is really good and the location is really nice (brand new), but if you don't want to hear the employees shout "EXTRA CHEESE!!!!" every five minutes or listen to Elvis Presley, I'd get it to go. Dad, do you think that if we did that, then Peter wouldn't have been so whiny (he wanted In-N-Out)?
