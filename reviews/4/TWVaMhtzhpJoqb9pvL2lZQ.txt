If your looking for real authentic mexican food than you have came to the right place.  Its in the hood but the neighborhood is up n coming.  Be prepared to wait if your going during your lunch break but it is well worth it.  My favorite item on their menu is the Salsa (to-die for)!  I love their tacos and their burritos.  Family owned and gives you that neighborhood feel to it bottom line its real mexican food! #cookiemonsterfiles
