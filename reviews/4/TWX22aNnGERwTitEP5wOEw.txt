Craving an egg and potato breakfast burrito. Had less than $4 cash in the car, didn't know if Rolberto's sold these so I stepped up to the counter and asked. Yes, and for less than $2.50. No reason to go home for more $$.

Waiting outside in the heat seems to take longer than sitting in the car, but it arrived soon enough. I sat outside on the picnic tables watching some teen boys playing some dragon card game and trading collector cards. Tried to figure out what the creatures were - aliens? monsters? dragons? but never could.

Burrito was fabulous. Been waiting four years for this. Maybe my taste buds have faded? This was very satisfying. For a few moments though, I did think about Norman Fiero, a fabulous Phoenix chef who had a few Mexican restaurants (last one near LGO or pre-LGO). Norman made great breakfast burritos. I digress. . . 

Bumping Rolberto's up a star.
