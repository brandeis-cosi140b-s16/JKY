This place is pretty good. The burro I got was huge and the beans tasted fresh and homemade. The rice was pretty good as well. They also conveniently give you free chips if you dine in. The only bad thing was one of the people I was with ordered tacos and asked for one with carne asada in it but didn't get it. Other then that, it was delicious!
