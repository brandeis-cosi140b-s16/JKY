While on a trip to see my grandparents, we went to Asi Es Mi Tierra for a quick bite to eat. The food is typical for a small mexican restaurant, but the quality and taste is top notch for the price. I had a 2 dish plate with a chicken enchilada and a beef tamale. The tamale was delicious, with pretty much a 50:50 ratio of corn exterior to beef filling. The chicken on the enchilada was breast meat, and it came with beans and rice.

My grandma had a taco salad, and the shell was fried just right. I didn't taste the fillings, but it looked like it used the same beef as the tamale. Also, they have tamarindo juice, which not a lot of places seem to offer.

The meal cost about $13, and I will probably suggest the place to my grandparents the next time I am in town.
