this place is the bomb for a late night sesh. i've had tacos, plates and wet burritos. all great. i recommend getting adobada, since it's delicious and also, the only meat i've chosen so far. my friend got a carnitas quesadilla last time and she said it was really good, it looked like a greasy-good-time so i'll be trying that one soon. i usually eat here with two vegetarian friends and despite the bummer that there's only one thing on the menu they can order (vegi burrito) they really like the place. i will say that the beans here (refried only) aren't bad but i don't think they help the overall taste of whatever dish you get them in. i always enjoy eating outdoors and being sketched out by the other late night taco seekers who roll through. the price is right, the location is good and most importantly the food is grubbin'! solid spot.
