The way to go here is the burrito bowl for $6.25. Two scoops of rice and beans and chicken and it is a large portion. Yeah, the tortillas are fresh, but they stick to the paper on to-go orders. I did find out that you can request no ingredient mixing at the end of your burrito process, but I'm going bowling from now on. It's a way better deal and you get more protein for your money. Chips though should be included, but they are good, so it is worth the 75 cents extra.
