This place is delicious food. I am not a big critic of Mexican food but I found the food delicious and well portioned. Staff was nice and all was well. We went a little bit before the lunch rush on a Sunday and it was quiet and relaxing. As we were leaving it was filling up, so maybe go early or late. Chill little place with a old school feel and flavor... Enjoy!
