Very nice place for lunch. The food was tasty and the service was great. The chips and salsa were typical of most mexican restaurants. I ordered the Speedy Gonzalez which is always a safe bet. My boyfriend had a special order--it wasn't on the menu but they were willing to cook what he asked. We will definitely eat here in the future.
