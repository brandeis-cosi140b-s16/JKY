My Tia recommended Los Dos to me; she's the best cook I know so I felt obligated to check it out.  While the location can scare off some, I have never had a problem and it has always been worth it.  I must say, Los Dos is not for the wary as you will experience VERY spicy food, be overwhelmed by ceiling decorations and bright colors, and possibly deal with a wait.

Their motto is "Some like it hot" and its no joke; if you don't mind sweating and sniffling then this is the place to go!  I consider myself quite the critic when it comes to Mexican food, and I have to say, the rice and beans are excellent, great flavors, homemade tortillas, hot salsas, a great chile relleno, and good service.  If I were to nitpick, my complaints would be the sangria and seat comfortability.  All in all, this is authentic Mexican and a great local favorite.
