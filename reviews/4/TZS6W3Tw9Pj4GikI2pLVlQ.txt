Really good food, service, and location, prices per plate is around 9-15. Lobby and restaurant is older and a little run down, but the food makes up for that. Service was good, he wasn't a chatty super nice guy, he brought us what we needed and phoned the rest in.

Salsa could use a little less cilantro, beans were really good.

Parking was good, however at night they could use more lighting for safety
