Neat looking place with a nice patio and good food.   The first time I went, I ordered the potato taco.  Hey, it is the cheapest thing on the menu ($1.89) and was something new to try!  They make the taco and then you choose the toppings.  A tear of joy practically came to my eye at the first bite.  It was topped with a thick layer of guacamole, salsa, and cheese.  Bravo!  I have returned to enjoy the potato taco goodness twice since my original visit.  Unfortunately, the lady behind the counter was working those times (unlike my first visit) and is what I call "the guacamole Nazi".  Go enjoy Chronic Taco and cross your fingers that the middle aged woman isn't plating up your food.  The toppings are what makes the food so amazing....and she isn't very generous with them.
