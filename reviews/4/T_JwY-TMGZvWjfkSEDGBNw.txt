Who knew that Korean food and a tortilla could taste so good? Ok maybe a million people in LA did. Until a little Italian came along with a love for the cuisine and cooking planted roots in a Lee's Discount Liquor parking lot, we were missing out. Before opening shop Ron (the owner) out of respect for the food and the people sought approval from the Korean community before even opening shop and they happily accepted the dishing from his kitchen. Now that's respect baby.

With that said let me tell you that this is some good stuff and when you go you'll be hooked. What I love about it is that you can tell that the meat is properly marinated, there are layers of flavors and everything is properly seasoned. The amount of filling is perfect and the price is so so right. We almost feel guilty paying so little for something so good and so satisfying.  And come back often because Ron gets a little crazy and busts out something special that's seasonal that'll take your taste buds to another level.
