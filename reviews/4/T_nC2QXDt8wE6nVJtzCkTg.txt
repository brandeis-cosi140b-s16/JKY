We had been planning on trying Cinco for awhile, but we were hesitant after reading some of the reviews regarding the less-than-stellar service.  So our second choice was to stop by Cinco on a Friday evening after our first choice had too long of a wait.  And we are glad we did.  Whatever service problems that may existed early on, there's no evidence of those problems now. (Note that most of the "poor service" reviews were shortly after they opened.) Our waiter was pleasant, knowledgeable, and attentive.  Yes, he was busy and had plenty of tables but it didn't affect us: our young children would have made sure to let us know if the service took too long.  Our food was very good.  The fish tacos were as good as any as I've had and even typical sides like rice and refried beans, which I don't typically expect all that much from, tasted remarkably good.  Somebody earlier complained about the chips and salsa but we loved them.  The chips were crispy and the salsa tasted very fresh.  Next time we want to go to a Mexican restaurant in the area, this will be our first choice.
