Fausto's never disappoints!  In this town that seems to be all about Roberto's, I can definitely say that I'm Team Fausto's.  The food just tastes better, seems fresher and their cheese doesn't smell funny.  I also have to say that it sits better in my tummy, since I know you're dying to know that particular detail.
