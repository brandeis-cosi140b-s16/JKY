Adorable - maybe a dozen tables?  Mom and Pop type place, but the service is usually really quick. 

They bring you a basket of fried mini tortillas to break off and have with their salas...and if you empty your basket they ask if you want more... Seriously, they shove food in your face. Its like going to the Mexican Grandmother's house you never knew you had.  

I used to only get the shrimp enchiladas, but now that I have branched out I have to say there isn't an enchilada on their menu I wouldn't eat and I like their tacos too. Husband always gets their burritos and likes them.  For a sit down Mexican restaurant Husband and I won't go anywhere else.
