Total stoner food. For the record I was NOT stoned only drunk. 

I am from Houston and we only have one Del Taco and it isn't close to me, nor do I eat fast food often. When IN VEGAS...drunk + tacos = great idea. 
I can only vouch for their crispy beef tacos, they were pretty good and WAY better than that other Taco with the BELL place. $6 got us 6 tacos. Great deal, bad for your arteries. For those health nuts they do offer ground turkey. 

Fast service, fast food and no stomachache in the morning. What more could you ask for?
