When I think of good Mexican food in Charlotte, this is the first place that pops into my mind. I would've never thought to go to this place since it's randomly attached to the Days Inn but I went here on a whim a couple of years back and have been going ever since. They have fresh salsa along with warm, crisp tortilla chips and have a guac dude rolling around to each table if you so choose to indulge. Their portions are the size of a baby and they offer margaritas in different fruity flavors that are quite strong. I've tried different combos and like I said before, with portions the size of a baby, I often have leftovers. The nachos were amazing as well and were the size of a toddler and cheaper than my margarita (I found this very amusing) I've found service to better in the bar area when I go and you can't beat dining with Telemundo and ESPN in the background! They also give you free little cinnamon crispers topped with whipped cream after your meal. Yay for anything covered in whipped cream! Anytime I've gone there, the service and food are consistent which is a big plus in my world.
