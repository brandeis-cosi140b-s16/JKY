Cute Mexican restaurant with high ceilings and sleek decor. Service is wonderful, everyone is smiling and happy to help. We had FRESH squeezed fruit margaritas with Don Julio (my fav) . Pomegranate and grapefruit was my favorite combo. They even have weekly specialty cocktails.You can order three different types of tacos instead of just 3 of the same kind, which is great because I wanted to try more than one kind (I had chipotle grilled shrimp, carne asada and grilled fish).  My favorite was the carne asada, but the grilled shrimp was a close second.

Comes with black or pinto beans and a lovely, buttery white rice with corn (this was a truly unique rice and I would definitely come back just to try it again). Happy hour from 4pm includes half off drinks. Don Julio drinks for $5? Anytime!
