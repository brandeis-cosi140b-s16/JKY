Overall, a very nice experience.  The food is very reasonable and pretty decent.  The salsas are meh, nothing to write home about.  The service is pretty good and they have a lengthy happy hour during the week.  The music is a little bit loud at times, but seating is not a problem and there is a nice patio area.
