I really enjoy coming to this place.  The patio is really cozy and I would recommend sitting out there.  I have only had the late night menu but I always enjoy my food and the margs are good too.  Try the green chili quesadilla...so delish.  P.S. The patio can be slippery because of the waterfall. I face planted it the other night and my boyfriend is STILL laughing. Be careful!
