I've been to this place a couple of times while living in Arizona. When I first came I was impressed. The salsas are all amazing, especially the green one! The portions are HUGE! Enough to feed a small village. Nice Mexican restaurant decor. They have TVs to watch games. This is good Mexican food in Arizona. I will be coming back here when I visit.
