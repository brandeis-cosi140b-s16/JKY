This is an Arizona standard. They have many locations throughout the valley. Great place for good casual Mexican with your family. Very Catina looking interior decor, somewhat commercialized. Not your hole in the wall place. I eat here with my mom, dad and husband every time I'm back home. Good service, very neighbor friendly...prob. because I always run into someone from high school. 

Great for groups too (I had my rehearsal dinner at the Ahwatukee location.)
