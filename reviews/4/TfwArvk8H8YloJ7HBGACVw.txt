whenever I see a place like this with outdated signs and seating, I am hesitant. I wasnt sure if his restaurant could serve good food. Despite the restaurant reminding me of the Golden Girls trip to Mexico kind of decor, they actually serve decent food. Nothing is dry or tasteless, which is a huge plus. I doubt the salsa, beans and guac they serve free is made fresh, but its still nice to eat. 

I tried their shredded chicken tacos and they are large, juicy, and flavorful. Two people coukd eat one order.  

Overall, its a fun change from the casino level eats.
