This place took some guts to stop at, but it was well worth it. Small location that most people would just pass up for a fancier Taco-Shop! Super elaborate menu with options for everyone. I kept it simple with some beef, chicken, tongue tacos! The tortillas were a bit smaller and more doughy than I am used to, but were great. All the meats had great flavor. Not too salty, not too greasy....
My wife really enjoyed her Shrimp Cocktail! Step outside your comfort zone and give this place a try!
