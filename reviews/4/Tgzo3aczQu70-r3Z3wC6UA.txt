My first time ever eating Baja Fresh and it is the best!! OMG the chips and fresh and the guacamole is sooo good. I really enjoyed eating here. I orders the chicken fajitas with corn tortilla and the chicken was perfect for being fast food. Totally going here more often. 

The reason I rated it 4 instead of 5 is the wait time is a little longer than I would've expected. 

Will return!
