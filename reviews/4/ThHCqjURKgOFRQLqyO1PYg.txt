Wohoo, this was good.

I have no taco background that would validate (or invalidate) if this place is authentic or what style the tacos were...but here is what I'll tell you.

I had a fish taco and it was awesome.  Then I had a carnitas taco, this was even more awesome.  Then I had some of my byobeer, and I loved it all even more.

Chips and Salsa and Guacamole all solid.

They are very nice and great service.

and AND they are open till after the bars close on Saturday nights.  This wasn't when I visited, but I can only imagine that when I eat a taco at 2am there after a night at the Brillobox I will reach a transcendental state of enlightenment.  At least that's my plan.
