Came here for brunch and ordered breakfast tacos, which came on the claim-to-fame pink tacos (prepared in house) with scrambled eggs, black beans, cheese, pico and avocado. I added a side of guac ($1) and lots of salsa and hot sauce. The dish came with a side of something (maybe jicama?) that was crispy and fresh and had a sweet heat to it. No homefries, but I stole some from my friends so can attest that they were crispy and flavourful!

We drank coffee because it was morning(ish) and the costs of the cocktails here were a little extreme. They were big comforting mugs of coffee that kept coming, so that was nice. We sat on the patio by the pool and watched three different kinds of birds go insane stealing all the leftover tortilla chips (complimentary) from tables as soon as people got up. They swooped so low they almost hit us each in the face at least once. It was quite entertaining. The pigeons in Vegas make the ones back home in Toronto look like doves. And I have never seen our sparrows behave in such a scavengeresque manner. Vegas really does bring out the worst in everybody doesn't it? haha. 

Anyway, I love the dirty, dry humour of this place. Staying in Hard Rock, I was greeted to the inappropriate but welcome messaging each day. A fave said, "Where pink tacos are not just a phase in college!" Do it up. Get your pink tacos. You're in Vegas after all!
