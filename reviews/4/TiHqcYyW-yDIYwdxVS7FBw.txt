Visiting during their 1 year anniversary.  $1 tacos, $1 beers, $1 tequila shots.  Three tacos, a beer for me and two tacos and beer for my sister.   $7 and we had dinner!  The place was clean. Service was quick. I do wish for more stools out on the patio as it was a great Saturday afternoon and we had to wait a bit to sit outside.  Good place. I enjoyed it.
