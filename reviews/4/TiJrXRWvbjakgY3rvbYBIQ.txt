Their al pastor is fantastic! If you love corn tortillas go for the al pastor tacos. Say yes to onions and cilantro on top. Then put the red sauce (self serve) over it. (Yes there's a formula). If you are feeling flour tortilla go for the al pastor burrito (it comes with beans and rice, but I took a cue from my friend Vanessa and just get it with meat... onions cilantro red sauce again). I prefer the corn tortilla tacos. Yummy. 
Open 24 hrs-- Sahara and Valley View. Good stuff.
