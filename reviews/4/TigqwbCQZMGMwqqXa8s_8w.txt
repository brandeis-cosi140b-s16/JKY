the lunch buffet is the only value from this restaurant..the service is horrible if you go at night or not during lunch buffet times depending on which server you get. there are two servers that are nice and attentive and wonderful...the rest..eh...... food is good on buffet, always something different....great salad bar and i LOVE their pico di gallo?? i dont think i spelled that right so sorry!!! no judgement!! lol
