Fantastic yelp recommendation! I took my husband here for lunch before we flew out of Phoenix. This place gets packed for lunch and it maybe hard to find a table! No place to just wait and hangout, unless you want to wait outside. But they turnover tables pretty quickly. Best thing about this place was the salsa bar--so many varieties. My favorite tacos were the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Tacos...hands down!
