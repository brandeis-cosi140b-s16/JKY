Finally!  We have lived in the Vegas area over a year and it has been close to impossible to find good Mexican food.  This is the best we have found in the area ( RIchi's Tacos in Beaverton, OR is the absolute best!!!)  This place will do while we are living in the Vegas area.   I do love the tacos here!!  My favorite: al pastor, chorizo, and tripa s.  The asada tacos are a little "meh" but other than that its great! The tacos are $2 a piece a little spendy for a taco but worth it.  The employees are also very friendly!
