I don't go to this OTB often but when I do they never disappoint. This location has always had exemplary service with very attentive servers. The food is always good, and I love their chips and salsa. The regular salsa is pretty hot so you can request mild if you'd prefer.  As several other posters have noted, they will give you a bag of chips and cup of salsa to take home, which is a nice touch.
