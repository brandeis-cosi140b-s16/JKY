I used to date a girl who went to UW.  I always dragged her to this place.  She was only "ok" with it, I loved it.

The margaritas weren't the best you could find, but they were definitely good.  They got you drunk fast, except for when they were the drink special.  Then they weren't as fast.

The food?  Oh god, the food!  It was delicious.  I'll never forget the burrito suizo or the chimichanga from this place.  It was just... delicious.  And filling... I never had left overs from here.  It was just too good to not eat.

The restaurant itself looks very upscale.  By that I mean that it's a very nice looking restaurant, but doesn't have a snooty feel to it.  The decorations are authentic Mexican, yet it still retains the "American Trendy" look.  The waiters and waitresses are always super nice and make great recommendations.

I highly recommend Casa De Lara!
