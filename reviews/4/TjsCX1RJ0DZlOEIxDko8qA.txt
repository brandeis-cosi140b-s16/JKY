I don't care if it's a chain - America's is fantastic.

First off, they have beer, margaritas, and tequila. That's great.
Secondly, they're fast.  Like, bring a group for lunch at 12:00 and get back with time to spare before your 1:00 meeting.
Third, they're friendly and helpful.  Don't get me wrong, if you go in there like a big fat jerk and start complaining about things, I hope they punch you in the throat, but if you place your order with a smile, they take it with a smile, and check in you while you're eating to make sure you don't need salsas or chips, and get your garbage out of your way.
Finally, the food is pretty good.  Incredible?  No.  But tasty and fresh, and they don't charge you an arm and a leg.  I get a burrito, chips, and salsa, and spend about $6.
