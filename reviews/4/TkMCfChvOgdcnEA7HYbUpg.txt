BEST NACHOS EVER! We make a meal out of them in addition to the endless (free) chips and salsa. Everything else is pretty standard Americanized Mexican... same basic ingredients just wrapped, layered, and cooked different ways. Try the margaritas though, fresh fruit, perfectly balanced. Probably one of the best Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh despite the un-authenticity.
