Wonderful ambiance, especially the patio where there are no T.V.s!! :-) 
Food was fresh and yummy!! All of the staff was friendly, caring and inviting. 
I also appreciate being able to wash my hands without waiting for the bathroom! lol
A definite go-to!! Try it! You'll like it!
AND... they are open late for food! 2am!
