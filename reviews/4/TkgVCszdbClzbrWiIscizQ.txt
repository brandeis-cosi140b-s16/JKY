I found the food and service at this Chipotle to be above standard. 

Stopped in for lunch one afternoon with a friend and ordered my usual burrito. My friend also had a burrito and we shared a chips and salsa. The chicken tasted fresh and the service was quick and good. 

Upon sitting down, I noticed how clean the restaurant actually was. The place was spotless. Even while we were there, an employee was walking around with a rag and cleaning tables. The place got busy and there was eventually a line, but the restaurant was well-managed. 

I had never been to this location before, but I have to say, I would definitely recommend it. My only gripe with this place was that once you are in the plaza, this wasn't actually the easiest place to find. You can only see it from T-Bird, not from inside the plaza. 

It is near the Starbucks and the cake place.
