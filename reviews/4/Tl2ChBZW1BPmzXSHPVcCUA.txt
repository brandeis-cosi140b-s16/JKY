I've been here a few times for lunch now. I'm really liking the taces. Every time I try some different meats. So far I've had the fajita tacos, the chicken, beef, the shrimp. I didn't get fish, but my coworker really liked it. I haven't had anything else here, but I am digging the tacos. The feta cheese is a nice touch, and the have regular specials that make a pretty cheap lunch. I'll be back on Tuesdays for Taco Tuesdays and $1 tacos.
