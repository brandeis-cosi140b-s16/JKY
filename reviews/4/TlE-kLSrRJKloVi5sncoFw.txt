Arrived at noon on a Monday and there were about 40 guests eating and 6-7 in line. I was thru the line in 2 minutes. These guys know how to run a fast line!

I ordered a barbacoa bowl. It was good, with all ingredients the proper temp but there just wasn't much protein in the dish. Closer to home, I get about 1&1/2 the amount of meat. Probably better for the Scottsdale socialites?
