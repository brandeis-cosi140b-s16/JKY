I Ordered a Steak burrito Enchilada style . Enchilada style they simply add  red sauce and cheese and put it thru their  oven . Excellent burrito the steak is grilled and its high quality . 

The pinto beans are tasty which they are homemade I also had them add some spicy red sauce to the burrito added a good flavor , but did not seem spicy . 

The tortillas are homemade which I can appreciate very good . All their sauces are homemade the red sauce is very good , I know the sauce is made from a blend of 3 different chills they use .ancho, Guajillo and california .

I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys fresh and tasty Mexican food . Nothing comes from a can out of this place .the place was clean and the staff very friendly .
