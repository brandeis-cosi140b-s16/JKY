This place is really yummy.  The seating layout and open floor plan makes it a bit loud, but the food makes up for that big time.  Huge portions, you will need to come hungry or take a bunch home to eat later.  For the prices you get a lot.  Margaritas are also great!  I'm usually a little picky about Mexican food, so I can say this places is unique and delicious.  Table side Guacamole is an interesting new twist and the wait staff was so polite and attentive (but not overly so which is nice in my opinion).
