Sopes Pastor, yum.

Totally delicious marinated pork with Mexican cheese, lettuce , tomato and avocado. Very filling for $3.50. Mango Jarritos soda, a real treat. Next time I will eat a burrito. Looked large and the one sopes was plenty.

Rustic but comfortable. Mexican TV in the background. Restaurant portion of store hidden in the back.  Tricky strip mall to find. Worth the effort.
5 star food, 4 star ambiance and service.
