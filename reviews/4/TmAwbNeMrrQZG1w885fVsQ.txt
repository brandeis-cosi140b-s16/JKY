I believe in second chances. And I better, since it's literally in my neighborhood. I tried the shrimp salad, the cheese quesadilla. And, I also finally tried an Agua Fresca! The food was great. The shrimp salad was a great value. I needed to update my previous review- this a Mexican restaurant, with a better quality of food. You get what you pay for. And it's a good thing.
