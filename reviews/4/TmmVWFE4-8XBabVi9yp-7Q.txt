Yummy! Love the salsa and homemade tortillas! So far haven't had anything bad! Love the Cozumel burrito! But be warned, it's HUGE and is served with sides of refried beans with cheese on top, and  mexican rice. 

I recommend the chicken soup, served with fresh avacado on top and a lime on the side to squeeze into it just before you eat it. It's to die for!

This place tends to be packed on Friday nites, but go during the week and it's great.

Casual atmosphere, has outside seating when it's not broiling hot outside, and altho they do have a bar, it tends to lean towards a family dining kinda place.
