My girlfriend and I decided to check this place out after getting a coupon in the mail. 

We started with the Cotija Grilled Corn, which I was skeptical about since I don't really like corn on the cob. It was actually so good that I finished mine and had the urge to steal hers right out of her hands. (I was able to restrain myself.) 

I ordered the Black Chile, which was really good, but I think it could have used a little more spice. To be fair, I like really spicy food though. The rice was not traditional, but I really liked it. The beans I loved, which is unusual for me. 

My girlfriend had the Beef Enchiladas, which she loved, and I thought were really good as well. She wasn't a fan of the beans like I was, but loved the rice. 

I have saved the best for last though.. the drinks. Well, really just one drink in particular. The Strawberry Jalapeno Margarita was the best margarita I have ever had in my life. I actually find myself craving it. I will definitely be back for another of those, and to try some of the other drinks and menu offerings.
