This location is not stingy with the portions. The staff is very quick and some what friendly. I can't complain it's fast food and they need you to get your stuff and go. Now if you plan on being snobby. Just dont. Please be nice to your servers and you just might get the same in return. It does seem darker in the seating area inside so if the weather is great enjoy your meal outside. FYI I did not get e coli.
