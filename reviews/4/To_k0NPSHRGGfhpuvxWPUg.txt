Have eaten here many times over 30 years and it's always good. Salsa is quite tasty and fresh. Other reviewers are correct, not the best of neighborhoods, but never a problem.  Have ordered many things on the menu and always good, hot, and fresh. Love the two dollar beer as well! The very authentic atmosphere really adds to the dining experience as well. 
Service is always very friendly, helpful, and there when you need them.

If in doubt, go!
