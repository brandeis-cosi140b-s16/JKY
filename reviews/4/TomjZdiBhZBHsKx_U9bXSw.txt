One of the best Mexican foods I have had.  You could smell the freshness of the salsa.  
The main dish was very well balanced and nothing was overwhelming beside the portion of the food which I am not sure if its a bad thing.
The chips were freshly made and delicately crunchy.
Prices were very affordable to a point that for what we paid we might have gone to a fast food store.
