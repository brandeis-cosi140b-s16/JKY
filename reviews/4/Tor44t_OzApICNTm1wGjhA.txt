First time here, wasn't sure what to order, love Mexican food that tastes like Nana made it.  Tortillas were fresh and large   Prices were fair for the size of the burritos and there are things on the menu starting at .99. I ordered a chile relleno burro. Full of flavor, would definitely order again   I will tell my friends and family to come here and try it out :)
