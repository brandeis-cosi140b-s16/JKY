Four stars and 2 of them are for the price that includes great chips and salsa and free ice cream.
 the place is great for lunch and breakfast, kinda slow service and cheap diner food but worth the price tag.
The breakfast is great but slow and very local yokel crowd. The lunch burger is well worth 4 bux. DO NOT order a soda that is what kills the low prices. Decent Mexican food and decent American food as well.
I am Italian so I may not be the best judge of Mexican as I think Taco Bell is ok. You can not beat the price and amount of food for breakfast, coffee sucks, pancakes rule!
