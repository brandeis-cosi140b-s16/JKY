Fresh and tasty. Your food won't arrive drowning in sauce and oily cheese, so if you're looking for that, keep moving. 

Each meal comes with complimentary chips and three salsas. Most entrees include a soup of the day. The soups, enchiladas, beef tacos, and stuffed poblano chiles earn high marks on taste and presentation. The fish tacos were nothing special and it seemed they tried to make up for the lack of flavor with extra chipotle sauce.

The staff is friendly and the restaurant ambience is decent; personally I think they could ditch the florescent lighting in the dining area for some dimming, but I suppose that might take away from the casual atmosphere. It is pretty quiet in the evenings, but the last time I was here they brought in a small mariachi group, which my niece loved.
