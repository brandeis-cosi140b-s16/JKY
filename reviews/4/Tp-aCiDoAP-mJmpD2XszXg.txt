This Chipotle is down the street from my job. I don't come very often but the day that I did come it was packed as always. Like others have stated arking is very limited so I always park in the first space that I see regardless to how far away it is. I mean I am about to eat Chipotle so I can walk my butt to from wherever I parked to get some food. Also avoid this place between 11:30am and 1:30pm because again it is packed and they run out of things from time to time so you may have to wait a little. The last time this happened to me, I was treated to a free meal because I waited a little longer than I was told for the chicken finish cooking. Quite unexpected but very nice of them. All in all, it is Chipotle. It is quick, fresh, and delicious. Kinda hard not to like it!
