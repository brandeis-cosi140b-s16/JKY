I enjoyed my lunch here very much.
A nice portion for a nice price.
Chips were thin and crisp; warm and just the right saltiness.
Salsa was pretty good, but mix regular and hot sauce for the best roasty flavor.

I really enjoy service from more experienced servers.  They're super friendly and you never see extra facial holes or anything like that.  
I love being called "Hon", too. 8^ )

Everything was clean and comfortable.

Might be my most boring review ever.
