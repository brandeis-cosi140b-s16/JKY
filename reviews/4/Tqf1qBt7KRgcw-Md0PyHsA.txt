The original viva las arepas owners decided to rent the spot so they no longer have the hot dogs that you see on the pics.. They only offer mexican food, however, their tacos are still pretty good! When I was originally looking for this place I was thinking it was a normal restaurant but it's actually a stand.  Either way, i would recommend you to try it!
