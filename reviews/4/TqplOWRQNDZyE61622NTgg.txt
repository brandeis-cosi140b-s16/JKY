We stopped here late after an acupuncture appointment.  First, they have Jarritos.  So, there's that.  I had the cauliflower and sweet potato taco off the vegan menu in a hard corn shell, and the shrimp taco duo in soft corn tortillas.  I had actually ordered all hard shells, but whatever.  The vegan cauliflower sweet potato taco was ah-mazing!  Even the shell was really good!  The shrimp tacos not so much.  The flavors in them just didn't mesh well for me, and I definitely prefer the hard shell.  I would definitely get the hard cauliflower and sweet potato taco again.
