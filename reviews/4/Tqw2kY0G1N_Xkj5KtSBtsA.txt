Si Senor may I have more indeed.  

Came here for the first time a few weeks back and why have j been avoiding you do so long.  This place is delicious.  Nothing fancy, but if you know good Mexican food it should be simple ingredients down right and this place does just that. 

Great lunch menu if you swing in on your break.  And to top it off have a soppapilla with honey for dessert.  (Included with the lunch menu portions).
