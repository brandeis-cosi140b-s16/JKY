This Chipotle is located across Blue Diamond from the Target Shopping Center.  It's brand new, modern, and seems to be somewhat unknown (for now).  While most local Chipotle locations are packed during peak lunch hours, we had the place to ourselves.  I was slightly worried that the freshness of food would would suffer due to low turn over, however it was hot and fresh.  

The service was fast and friendly, the dining room clean, and the seating plentiful.  Can't ask for more when trying to catch a quick bite.  It's nice to have another relatively fast option on this corner.
