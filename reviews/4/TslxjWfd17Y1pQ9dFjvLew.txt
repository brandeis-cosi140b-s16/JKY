This is our first visit to Carlito's. I ordered the Carne Asada burrito.  Very good.  My wife had the red Menudo.  It was good. 
Even though the restaurant is small, it was comfortable and very clean.  Even the restroom.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  They seemed sincerely concerned about our food quality. 
They have indoor and outdoor dining. 
We do plan to return to try other menu items before fully judging them. 
The only concern is that the salsas weren't quite spicy enough for us. But they definitely are worth coming back again.
