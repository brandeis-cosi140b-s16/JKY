Happy Cinco de Mayo...!

El Toro Loco finally has a liquor license- or at least they were selling alcohol last night.  We went when we knew it would be jam packed as the 'other' mexican restaurant, the chain across the street, was packed as well.  The bar was full of people and the restaurant was 3/4 full.  It was clear that the staff wasn't ready for the onslaught that will happen every year for Cinco de Mayo.  There were 4 tables waiting to get bussed so they could turn them over and we witnessed one couple that were seated right by the front door get up and leave with disappointment.  They had even left drinks on the table.  We had eaten here once before so we knew the wait would be worth it.  

After about 10 minutes waiting at the door we were finally showed a table and the meal started.  Chips and salsa were brought over immediately and our drinks- a margarita on the rocks and a Corona soon followed.  

I can't recall the exact name of what we ordered but it was Fajitas for 2.  They had chicken, steak, shrimp and chorizo with onions & peppers.  It came out on a hot-plate kind of thing- heaping with stuff.  We each received 3 wraps and a plate full of refried beans, rice, lettuce, pico de gallo and guac.  The guac was the only disappointing thing here because it wasn't fresh- it is that Sysco type stuff, mixed with sour cream and heavy garlic.  It's not bad... but it's not good either.  It certainly wasn't worth the $6 I paid for the large bowl to dip our chips into.  That was the only 'low-light' of our meal.  We left with a 'to-go' box stuffed with 'stuff', a couple wrap shells and stomachs full of mexican...  

Next time you're in SS- skip the franchise and give this place a try.  

Our first time here we ordered the Big Fiesta Sampler and the Super Nachos.  Both were heaping and very satisfying.  

Hasta la Vista El Toro Loco (Until next time...)  :D
