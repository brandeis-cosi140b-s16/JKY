Got hungry for a taco while driving back from the Covalent surfboard factory by the Mesa Gateway airport.  Yelp suggested Rudy's.  I tried and loved the California Burrito which is terrific carne asada with potatoes, peppers and other stuff.  I had them roll it with the red hot sauce already in to make it easier to eat on the go.  Rudy had a steady flow of customers while I was there mid-afternoon so must be popular with locals.  Fairly nice inside for a taqueria.  Looks like it was a new take-out pizza place that went out of business and then Rudy took it over.  I'm sure this is a huge improvement over the previous tenant :-)
