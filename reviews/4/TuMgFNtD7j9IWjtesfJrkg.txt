Our first time coming here was about 8 years ago when we lived on 19th Ave & Dunlap; we liked it then & still do now. It's a smaller place located in a strip mall, you could drive by and never notice it. The chips and salsa are always fresh, the beans and rice are good. My boyfriend likes the green chicken enchiladas and I have gotten a variety of things all turned out good. I once ordered the taquitos and they were over cooked but besides that no complaints. They also sell bottled Mexican sodas and frescas that he loves to order instead of a fountain drink.
