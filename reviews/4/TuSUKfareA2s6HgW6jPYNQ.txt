Hubby and I really enjoyed Asados.  The decor is pretty, server was attentive, margaritas were delicious and the food was great.  Not sure what all the negativity is about.   It's definitely worth a second try for those who may have had a bad experience. Only downside was the salsa was a bit to hot for me.  Squeezed a half a lemon to cool it down and it was all good.
