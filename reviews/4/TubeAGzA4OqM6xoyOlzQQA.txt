I feel so bad for the workers, they're friendly but they're stuck and trapped in a hot and stuffy place. I'm not sure if that'll continue to drive people in - the electric fans all over the store? So now the sweat and BOs are floating around. Sigh. Anyway, the food is pretty good. I would come back (for the price). I just hope they don't continue to restrict the quantity of their food.
