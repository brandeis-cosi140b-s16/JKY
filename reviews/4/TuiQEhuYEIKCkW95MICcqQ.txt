What to say? Been here more than a few times with the family - mostly with a coupon. The restaurant is located on the top of a hill - personally, the outside is prettier than the inside. And if it's not scorching hot and humid, I'd recommend sitting on the patio.  The atmosphere is just not there for me. Call me a hypocrite - if the food's good, who cares about the atmosphere, right? Scratch that - You need it inside Casa Del Sol. Something is just missing, maybe booths? I just don't feel comfortable eating there. 

But, the food is good. I wouldn't say it's excellent - but it's worth the trip. I've tried the enchiladas, chicken fajitas and the chille relleno. The service is usually great and quick. Margaritas not too bad either. The atmosphere just kills it for me as a night out on the town. More for family gatherings - because this place isn't meant reeling in customers by the dining room setting - it's the food. And it's (sorta) worth it!
