Wow! I had heard of this place on diners, drive ins and dives. We were in the area so we stopped in. I'm so happy we did. The food was so delicious. I had the beef flautas meal with rice and beans. The husband had a carne asado burrito. We split a carne street taco, best I've ever had. They give you your own hot sauce bottle,  which is great cause I can never have enough. I will definitely be back.
