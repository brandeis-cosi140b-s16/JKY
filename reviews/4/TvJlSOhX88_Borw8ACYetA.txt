So we got referred here by a co worker and I'll say this..although Ive only had the fish tacos and barbacoa taco and churros it was really good..their fish taco is on point now I.didn't really enjoy the barbacoa but I'll definitely come back to phat phranks for the fish taco..the owner is also really nice and he recommends to try their breakfast burritos which I love and the huevos rancheros with their chili Verde...I can't wait
