Total hole in the wall. I'm always the only white boy in the place. But you know it's good as many Mexicanos with their whole families arrive here regularly. Huge menu. The Hispanic guys at my place of work will vouch for the excellent consome loco, a fresh homemade chicken and rice soup served with avocado - hits the spot during cooler seasons. Normally they hate all mexican places in town but they like this one, so that's all you need to know.
