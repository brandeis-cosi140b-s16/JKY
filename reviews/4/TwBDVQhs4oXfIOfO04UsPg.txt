I'm a fan of 1900.  The place is clean and pretty swanky for a cheap Mexican restaurant.  They have good drinks and I would hope so since they claim to be a Tequila Bar.  The margaritas I've had were good, albeit expensive.  We were there last Saturday night and they had $10 AYCD sangria.  I was so pumped when she said that.  It was Saturday too, get outta here!!  I walked out with a nice little buzz, so I'm happy to report that the sangria wasn't all mixer.

The chips and salsa are some of the best I've had in Charlotte.  They have quite a kick, so I think they might add jalapenos...a good thing.  I've had better queso, but I still swiped every last bite of cheese out of the bowl.  As for the meal, I split a 3 entree combo with my girlfriend.  It was $9.50 for a burrito, chimichanga, and a tamal.  The chimichangas here are great, crispy and topped with queso.  Burrito and tamal had good consistency, but lacked spice.  It's ok though, I threw on some Cholula and it was perfect.  We were stuffed for spending only $14 on food between 2 people.  I'm sure all those sangria refills helped as well!
