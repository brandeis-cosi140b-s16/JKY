Authentic Mexican dishes, and very reasonable prices. My best friend took me here for the 1st time and I am hooked. The manager even came and introduced himself (Daniel) and a nice demaeanor. We ordered the Steak Fajitas and a few beers. We also ordered a mixed drink and the bill was very reasonable. Full generous portions, and they brought chips and 6 or 7 different salsas to start off with. I was too full. A new fan!
