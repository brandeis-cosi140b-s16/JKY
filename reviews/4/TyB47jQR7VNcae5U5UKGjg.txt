This location has become our go to location for Mexican Food. 

They menu selection is not a typical selection. So if you are look for a combo plate with burrito, taco, etc. you may not quite find the menu you are looking for.

We have been three times, I have tried three different selections and been very happy with the food. 

My only complaint is that there salsa with the chips is less than what I prefer in flavor and spice.

Will return when we are in mood for Mexican Food.
