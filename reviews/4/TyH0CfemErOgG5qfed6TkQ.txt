Would give 5 stars but it was SO loud. Great food & really good sangria. Portion size was perfect (I had the 2 tacos). Flavorful but basic. We were told it would be an hour wait (Fri night), but our party of 4 was seated within 15 minutes. Our server was brand new & very good & friendly. Pretty fun place.
