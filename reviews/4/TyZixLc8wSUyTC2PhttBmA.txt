I can imagine the owner of this location is a bit worried since it has only been open a few months as have all in this center and Mervin's along with Circuit City are going out of business. What a way to start a business. 

I have not tried this place simply because I did eat at one on the other side of town and did not like it. 

Gus was in the mood so we stopped in on our way home. We both got the fiesta salad which I guess is kind of an odd choice but there you go. 

A Very nice young man takes our order, same nice guy brings our food to us. As I look around I notice all the employees are pretty good looking. 

The salads looked small, but as we ate found them to be very filling. Nice crisp ingredients and the chicken had a nice char flavour too. So now I know how stupid I am for judging one restaurant buy a sister store. 

aYUP we will be back.
