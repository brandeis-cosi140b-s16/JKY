So, apparently, they've "temporarily" lost their liquor license. I'm not sure of the details, but when I arrived earlier this week, I discovered the beer coolers were locked-up with chains and padlocks, with a Spanish sign that read "Not serving beer right now." 

I inquired with the waitress and she told me they had their license suspended. Not sure of the details, but I wonder if it had something to do with allowing people to self-serve beer without checking IDs? I never did understand this inconsistent system...

That said, the tacos are consistently *awesome*. 

+ Steak taco - one of (if not the) best in Madison
+ Campechano taco - great, although chorizo is often very greasy
+ Chicken taco - not super seasoned, but still quality and delicious

- Chips leave much to be desired 
- Salsa too watery
+ Hot sauces are great

+ Friendly service
- Totally absent service after initial delivery of food
+ They take credit/debit, but you can't write-in a tip, so bring some cash
