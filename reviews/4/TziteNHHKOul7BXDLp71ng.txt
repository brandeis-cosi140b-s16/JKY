If you have ever had an insatiable craving for fry bread on a Sunday afternoon, you can certainly understand my frustration at not being able to find any decent (or not so decent) fry bread places open on the day of rest. After fervently searching Yelp and making about a dozen phone calls only to get a recorded message on the other end, I finally stumbled upon this place located in the 'Fantastic Swap Meet' building.  After a quick phone call to make sure they were open (until 5pm that day), we jumped in the car and went completely out of our way to satisfy our impromptu craving for some hot, cheesy, beany fry bread.  We pulled up to the swap meet parking lot about twenty minutes later, and looked at each other and wondered out loud if we should even get out of the car.  It was a little rough to say the least, but at this point our craving was such that we would have gladly ventured into a crack den to score some doughy goodness if we had to.  

Angelina's is a no frills type of place with a few chairs and tables outside of the pick up window.  They do have Mexican food available, but I was so focused on the pictures of the fry bread, I really didn't notice much of anything else.  We got our standard bean and cheese; one fry bread would have been enough to feed about four people.  It was everything we had hoped it would be.
