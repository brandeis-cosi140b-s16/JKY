Really like this place. The environment is great, reminds me a lot of Mexico. The food is pretty good and never really had a bad experience here. I watched a show on the Mesa channel on Cox and is displayed the owner, I can't remember his name, but I always love to know who the owner is and the story about the restaurant. I wouldn't say that the food is the best I have ever had, but pretty consistently good. Excellent chips and salsa, the fried ice cream is great, but had the cheesecake, next time I will pass on that, but their key lime pie is pretty good.
