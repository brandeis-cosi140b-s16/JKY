El Cancun was a great choice for lunch.  They serve warm tortilla chips and some pretty good salsa.  Talk about lunch on the cheap, you've gotta check out the prices on their lunch specials, it'll make you want to order more than one entree!  Cheap doesnt mean careless here, the food was excellent and they spiced it perfectly.  The portions are as most Mexican restaurants: huge, and service was friendly.  I will definately be back for some dinner.
