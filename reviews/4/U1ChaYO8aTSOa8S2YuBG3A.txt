Don't judge a book by its cover! This place from the outside may look questionable, but once you get inside everything changes. Some of the best Mexican food I've eaten in a long time! Great ambiance, fast and attentive service. Green salsa is soooo good! You won't be disappointed. Only reason I didn't give 5-stars was because I was charged for an item I did not receive or even ask for. Upon bringing this to their attention they apologized and fixed my ticket. Great little Mexican joint. We'll definitely be back!
