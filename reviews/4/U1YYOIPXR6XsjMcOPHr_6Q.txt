I always drive by Las Gorditas but I had never bothered to stop. I have had penguinos raspados elsewhere (washtington and pecos had a penguinos shop a while ago). Going in i knew they would have gorditas on the menu but i was impressed when i saw Huaraches on the menu. 

My wife ordered every chicken gordita and they were all great. I ordered the Huarache and the only thing that was bad was that the meat was a bit tough on the edges but otherwise the Huarache was delicious.

We also ordered an elote en vaso and a raspado de mango y nuez. The "elote en vaso" Is corn in a cup with mayo butter chilli powder and cheese. If you have ever bought a corn from the man with the shopping cart its basically the same thing except in a cup. The "raspado" is shaved ice with the flavors that i got where mango and nuts. The flavoring is not ike your normal shaved ice flavoring though its a syrup with fresh mango pieces mix in it same thing for the nuts. Then they top it off with condensed milk not alot of people like it but I LOVE IT.

I would highly recommend the Raspados on hot days to cool you off.
