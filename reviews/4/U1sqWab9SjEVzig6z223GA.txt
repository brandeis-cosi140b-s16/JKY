This is how Mexican food should be served:

It should cost about five bucks. 

You start with some form of tortilla, add refried beans, spanish rice, salsa, and lettuce, insert cheesey-messy-possibly-meaty-goodness and throw it all in a styrofoam container. 

Then, you ravage the contents of the container until there are fork scratch marks in the styrofoam. 

Thank you, Carolina's, for being one of the few, the brave, and the proud Mexican places to carry out this process with charm and elegance.
