Los Favoritos has been my GO-TO place for breakfast burritos for years, but this new location has made it a lunch favorite too.

The restaurant itself is simple inside. A dozen tables and an ordering counter make-up the dining area. The staff is super friendly. As for the food, it is consistently good. My group usually gets some combination of the rolled tacos, carne asada fries, California carne burrito, and beef taco w/ enchilada combo. They always come out fast, with your choice of red or green sauce (both are super tasty).

Like I said before, the star of the show has to be the breakfast burrito. Nothing can beat the warm tortilla loaded with bacon, eggs, potatoes, and cheese. For the money, there is not a better value in town.
