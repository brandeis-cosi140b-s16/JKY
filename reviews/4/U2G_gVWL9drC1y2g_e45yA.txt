It was a little risky, to say the least, buying Mexican food attached to a Chevron station right off I-10 (Little Ceasar's on the other side of it!). But we'd seen the name - Nico's - elsewhere in AZ and figured it couldn't be all bad this far south. It turned out to be the biggest food surprise of our vacation! The carnitas burritos were outstanding. If we're ever down this way again, we'll find a Nico's restaurant for a sit-down meal. As the other reviews indicate, Nico's is a winner (even at a Chevron station)!
