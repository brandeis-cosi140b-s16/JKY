So we just got back from a week long vacation from the East Coast and we're jonesing for some Mexican food but we're too lazy to go to a real restaurant so I mention Fausto's, we hadn't been here in forever. After perusing Yelp photos I settle on the Chicken Chimichanga and we were gonna share a Carne Asada Nacho. Doug just got a Carne Asada burrito.
Holy hell the nacho size was enormous, we hardly put a dent in them, but they were good. The star was the Chicken Chimi, so good! Believe the reviews. The chicken was moist, kind of wet with a tomatoey juice, with lots of cheese, peppers, tomatoes and onions inside of a perfectly fried tortilla that was not greasy. I will totally get it again and urged my husband to as well.
The food is super cheap for the amount you get. Service is fast and friendly. 
Why have we been apart so long? I won't let that happen again.
