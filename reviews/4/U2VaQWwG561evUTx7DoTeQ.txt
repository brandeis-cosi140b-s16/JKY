This is my 2nd time in only because first time I came in I was unable to use my restaurant.com certificate. FYI if you have one you have to have it printed. 

Other than that, the portions are a great size. Best be careful some of those pictures are a lot bigger than you think. First time I had the breakfast combo pancakes, ham etc. The picture does not give the size a good umm...estimate i guess. The plate i received was huge and barely finished it. The pancakes were delicious. I think they put cinnamon maybe just a bit of sugar in their batter but it was slightly sweetened and just so good. 

Steak and eggs are what I had this trip. The steak was a lot thinner than I expected. I asked for steak sauce but ended up not using it. The steak was nicely seasoned I didn't need it. That plate was the perfect size that I felt satisfied but not overly stuffed. 

Service compared to the first time was an upgrade. The first time I came in it was a Sunday morning and it was busy. Service was mediocre at best nothing bad nothing good. This time a Friday morning the place was quiet and our server was pleasant and friendly. She kept our drinks full and checked in on us regularly. 

Overall I guess it's just timing which will change the service you receive. The food is worth a stop though. I had to laugh because when my food arrived I stopped to say to my boyfriend these look and taste like my grandma made these eggs.
