Mmmmmm...HOT chips and queso!!!

Salsarita's is becoming one of my favorite quick Mexican lunch and dinner spots! 

This location was super clean, and the staff were all very friendly! I was greeted right when I walked in he door...with a smile! How awesome! 

I ordered the daily special two tacos, I chose chicken with chips, queso and a drink. The tacos were delicious, chicken had great seasoning and tons if toppings to chose from including lettuce, cheese, sour cream, jalape√±os (yes!) tomatoes, onions, guacamole and three different salsas depending on you heat preference! 

The chips were STELLAR....freshly made and piping hot! I fell absolutely in love after the first bite! It so rare you can walk in and see hot fresh chips being made right in front of you! 

And for less than $10 it's a total win in my book! Can't wait to return!
