This review applies only to the breakfast burritos, I have not tried any of the other dishes.  I am a breakfast enthusiast, breakfast burritos being my greatest weakness.  The breakfast burritos are large, filled with the right proportion of potato, meat, and eggs.  Service is always friendly and fast, I can be in and out within 5 minutes with a hot fresh burrito and on time for work. Love the fresh green sauce as well.
