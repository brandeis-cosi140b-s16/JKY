The wings are the best here! A good combination of spicy and sweet. 
Everything is pretty good. Semi overpriced but good really affordable lunch specials, only offered during the week, so I was lucky to eat there on a friday. I would wait to purchase any margaritas outside of this restaurant. You can go upstairs in NYNY and get a cheaper Margarita at the bar outside of Coyote Ugly.
