The ambiance is fun, family style. The bold colors of the paint and the "loteria" (latin American bingo) themed tables contrast nicely with the classic "golden age of Mexican cinema" black and white photos.

I've been here a couple times and had the fried tilapia. It was over done. Looked like it was deep fried. However the rice and beans were as if my mom, RIP, worked through the cook to remind me she loves me.  

My wife had the huarache. A thick oblong corn tortilla covered in beans and carne asada garnished with avocado, lettuce, tomato, cream and fresh cheese. That was superb!!

Not the kind to not tive a place a second chance, especially since the beans were divinely inspired.  So we went back. This time I had Nopales with Carne Asada. Excellent choice! The corn tortillas are hand made! I bought a second order of tortillas since I couldn't get enough. Karla had the chiles rellenos. Man, were they great!!

We drove by this place hundreds of time, oh if we'd known what we were missing. What fools!

Anyway, hope you take advantage of this hidden gem of Mexican cuisine.
