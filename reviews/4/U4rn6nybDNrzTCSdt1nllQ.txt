Have been coming here for lunch many years. Always busy but they squeeze you in and get you out quickly.

The chips and salsa are top notch and they keep filling both.

Love the Machaca Chimichanga with the guacamole which has a great crispy outer tortilla and tasty but not spicy inside of generous shredded beef.

The tacos and tamales are also very authentic and good.

I believe this is the original location and family owned.

The service is always top notch and friendly.

Parking has been expanded and easier to find a space.

Will be back m an y more times.
