Finally we found a great Mexican place to eat. Thanks to the many great yelp reviews, we made this hot spot one of our top places to eat. When we first arrived they hardly had any customers at about 5pm, so we were a little concern. Nevertheless we got right into the menu and ordered our food.

The menu was simple but very tempting. As we sat down to wait for our food, we were offered chips and salsa. The chips were great, but the salsa was borderline. For our main dish, we ordered the carne asada taco with beans and rice. It was loaded with good stuff, like avocado, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and much more. The flavors were amazing and the beans and rice complimented the plate. We also ordered a shrimp cocktail which was loaded with shrimp and mixed very well. Then to top it off, we ordered the grilled corn on a cob. It tasted just like back home if not better. The strawberry horchata was so sweet, it tasted like a strawberry shortcake in a cup. 

Overall, our visit was good, great place and great food. Now one of our favorites!
