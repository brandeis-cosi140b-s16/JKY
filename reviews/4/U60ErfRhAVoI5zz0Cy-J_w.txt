One of the best fast food places around.
Aside from the good food they offer, I was very nicely surprised that they offer beer at this location. Thumbs up for that. Being from overseas I appreciate things like that, grabbing a beer with your lunch.
The food was very good I had a steak salad with pretty much all the stuff you can get in it, corn, beans, salsa etc. I was very hungry so the portion felt small but the Corona made it up for that.
I like the place and the food too.
The staff were kind of annoyed by all the customers and the routine of the job so they get 2 stars out of 5, other than that good experience :)
