Since my first visit, I have been back at least 8 times.  Drive thru is usually a little slow.  I usually order asada burrito.  Like  said in my first review, meat is far more flavorful (and spicy) than Roberto's and does not have any grizzle in it.  I didn't care for their breakfast burritos.  Bland and too much potatoes.  Overall delicious.
