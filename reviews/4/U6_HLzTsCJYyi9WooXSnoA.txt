Finally able to check out Sloppi Jo's at STreats Festival. I tried the green chile potatoes and the Sloppi Jo. The Sloppi Jo consisted of very tender pork in spicy red sauce with a poached egg on top. Flavor explosion! I ignored the flimsy tortilla served with it and opted to just use a fork. 

Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, I tried the green chile potatoes. Because they were so yummy, I was nice enough to split them with my friend. But it wasn't easy because I wanted to lick the little paper boat they're served in! I would seriously hunt down Sloppi's just for these potatoes.
