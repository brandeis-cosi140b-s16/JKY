I was seriously craving some cheese dip. The amazing concierge at the Mirage directed me to Treasure Island's Isla for a great appetizer. 

Like most casino restaurants, the decor is pretty awesome. We were seated right away, and I scanned the menu for my cheese dip, while my friend scoured the menu for something he would like that was also under $15, preferably $10.

He finally settled on some soup. I have no idea what kind of soup is was, but I do believe there was some corn influence. I'm 99% positive it was not tortilla soup, but it was the most amazing soup I've ever tried.

My cheese dip was very good, though it wasn't very dip-like. Plus, I ate it without chips because I would have had to pay extra. It did come with three small tortilla shells, and I made do with those.

The only weirdness (other than having to pay extra for chips) was the waitress. She seemed very uncomfortable approaching our table, and she seemed very apprehensive whenever I opened my mouth to ask her something. I don't think I'm very intimidating, but she only did it with our table, so I must be a lot scarier than I think.
