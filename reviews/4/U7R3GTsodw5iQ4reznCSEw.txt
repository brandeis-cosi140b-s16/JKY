I always seem to have a great time at this place.  Always crowded and has plenty of space to move around on most nights - but it can get packed.  You don't have to come here dressed to kill - even with it being in Scottsdale, jeans and t shirt are just fine.
  The alcohol prices are fair and I have had their wings on few occasions during college football - I believed that they were great - but I had a lot to drink - so what isn't good then?
   Was here for New Years Eve and the music and atmosphere was good.  
  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was that their bathrooms are the worst smelling bathrooms- I don't know what they could do to make it better - being that so  many people use them and they would almost need a full time janitor.  But the smell of ass sometimes linger out to the open aired bar.......But don't let that deter you.  Awesome place, awesome staff, awesome drinks..... go the bathroom before you come here and hold it as long as you can!!!!!
