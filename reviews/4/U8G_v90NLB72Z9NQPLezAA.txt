If you want greasy Mexican food, you have come to the right place!  It's so evil in here, yet SO GOOD.  We made it part of our midweek lunch place - almost every week!  And what did we order every damn week!?!

SUPER CARNE ASADA NACHOS! (no beans)

They definitely do not hold back on the carne asada, which is always good!  The melted cheese (so greasy), sour cream, and pico de gallo create such a perfect harmony with the meat and the crunchy chips.

I just used "perfect harmony" while describing nachos.  I need help.

Just try to ignore the massive amounts of grease towards the bottom of the plate.  It'll make you feel really bad about what you just ate.
