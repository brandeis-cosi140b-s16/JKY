I have been there twice now.  Once with work associates for a meeting and the next with my wife and another couple.  Both times the service has been very friendly and knowledgeable.  They have made mistakes at both visits, but they were quickly corrected and I am quite forgiving as long as the end result is receiving what we ordered.  A very attractive build out with a lounge area in front with a separate bar that leads out to the patio.  The dining room has probably the sharpest looking fan that I have seen from a design side.  It has some edgy artwork that compliments the look they are going for.  Appetizers had some great flavor profiles, though the fajita special I had for dinner could have had a little more pop.  Attractive staff was a big plus for the friends I had with.  They enjoyed the view.  Prices were a little on the high side, but they also had some aggressive happy hour specials to offset them.
