Good food for many years! Been going there since i was a kid when my grandmother used to work there making tortillas. My grandparents still have a lot in that neighborhood. I remember chips and salsa being a couple bucks compared to now chips a few bucks and five buck hot sauce. If in need, i stop at a local frys and pick up My nanas Chips and My nanas Hot Sauce same good taste and a couple bucks cheaper. Red chile has been my fav forever the workmans special to be exact. Prices are up but to keep this place alive its well worth it!
