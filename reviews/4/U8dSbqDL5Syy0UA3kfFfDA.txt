Here's a useful tip.
Don't ever come here on a weekday around the noon hour. If you do, expect the following:

* No place to park. The place is besieged by Suburbans and Escalades....Notre Dame Prep seniors on their lunch period.....arrghh.

* One of those serpentine lines like at the airport, where you uncomfortably find yourself standing beside the same person each time the line moves up. Typically a high school senior looking at you, thinking...Jeez, I hope I never end up like that. {likely my ball cap, reading...This face seats five.....the sweats don't help much either)

* Indifferent servers, probably instructed to skinny-up the meat portions to anyone winking at them or making that hand gesture...the one with the thumb and forefinger signaling,...just a teensy bit more, please?

* And no place to sit. The seniors now in control, launching a full-scale assault on the table seating area.

Like a loser with a cute (to me, ewww to them) ball cap, you take your seat at one of the stools facing the parking lot...your backside to the seniors. This as you gaze out the window at the expensive cars piloted by teenagers, who, while walking by, not a fucking care in the world, look at you like you're a lone zoo exhibit or something.

I hope reincarnation exists. 
I want to come back as one of these guys.

I wander. Sorry.
The burrito bowl is my favorite. Here's a little secret. Refuse the rice and beans. When your bowl passes to the meat section. upon their seeing an empty bowl, the server will fill it to its gunwales with meat.
Once the meat's safely on board, conveniently go "OOPS, I changed my mind...maybe I will have some rice and beans after all."

Works every time. 
And no, I'm not homeless, thank you very much.
