Good chips & salsa.  Fast good service.  I had fish chalupa which was like ceviche w/o jalape√±os and side order of beans.  Beans were plentiful and not too smooth but a little bland.  Big drinks.  Very reasonable.  Husband liked chicken taco and cheese enchilada.  Would certainly return.  Real plates and silverware.. No paper or plastic.
