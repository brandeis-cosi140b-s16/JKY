We ate here last night and really enjoyed it. We had the tradition guacamole and cheese dip and both were excellent. I had a taco plate with el pastor tacos and the cherry beef tacos and both were excellent! I did not care for the shrimp taco. I did not like the slaw on top. My husband had a steak burrito and he thought is was excellent. We love the atmosphere and they had live music and the group was fantastic!! We will be back!!
