Crazy taco is awesome. 

The service has been very good, especially considering the language barrier. With a few gestures to clear up any misunderstanding, we were both good to go. Every time I've been there my drink has stay full and my table was kept clear. The salsa they served up front was perfectly spicy, if a little thin. 

I love the burrito California style--that means they serve it with a salad of lettuce, tomato, guacamole and sour cream on the side. The ingredients seem fresh, perfectly seasoned, and well cooked. 

It's not a fancy place, it looks like barely a step above fast food, but between the great prices and fantastic food, I barely notice the super casual setup. Also, the Spanish-language television they show on a couple of big screen TVs is pretty cool.
