A large group of friends and I ended up at Vida Vida after unsuccessfully finding a sports bar in the area to watch the big Panthers playoff game. The place had a large number of tv's and seemed to have a laid bad atmosphere. 

We were greeted promptly and the staff helped us put together a few tables to accommodate our party. We all ended up getting some drinks and food and were surprised when they handed out free mini footballs during the game!

The food was decent for fast casual tacos, though the taco salad was lacking in lettuce and the chip plates were way more chip pieces than full chips. The drinks were decent though there were no beers on tap, only in cans. Selection was ok though. 

The best part of the trip here was the service. Our waitress, Katherine, was probably the best server I've seen in a couple years. She was incredibly friendly and made sure our table was never low on food or beverages.

Would definitely go back here, especially if the service remains A+.
