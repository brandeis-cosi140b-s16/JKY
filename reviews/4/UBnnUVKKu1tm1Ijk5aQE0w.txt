Great hole in the wall mexican food.  mexican coke in a bottle and decent food.  Ive heard if youre a gringo you may not want to head here on dollar beer night, but the staff has always been nice and its got huge portions on the cheap.  Its your typical shredded meats, beans and veggies but its way better than Filibertos but about the same price.
