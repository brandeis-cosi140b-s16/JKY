This is my favorite mexifastfood place in Vegas. The staff are super-nice, the food is almost always excellent, the price is right, giant portions, it is super-clean, etc. I have three faves: 1. Pollo asado nachos. It's not even on the menu, but it's amazing. Rather than nachos with carne asada, the grilled/griddled marinated chicken is fantastic. 2. Pollo asado burrito with lettuce, chz, and sour cream. Fantastic. and 3. Bacon/chz burrito. Make sure to ask if you want the bacon crispy. Really good stuff.
