Being from New Mexico and only about 20 minutes away from Hatch, I find that I am very picky about my Mexican food!  

I'm not saying that this is the end all be all of Mexican cuisine in the valley, but for some reason...it just helps me not miss home so much. 

I am usually very critical of a restaurants red chile.  I could tell before tasting it that their red chile sauce is made from a powder, which I am typically not a fan of.   However, R & T's red chile sauce has a very delicious taste! Their rice is perfect and not at all sticky and pasty like you find in many restaurants.  Their beans are very good and you always get a decent amount on your plate.  

I usually get the combo with 2 red enchiladas and 1 beef taco.  The tacos are delicious and you can tell that the corn tortilla is freshly fried to order.  

On one occasion, I did try the green chile and I will not be trying it again.  It is nothing like home or like anything that I've ever had.  I'll stick to the red sauce!

What makes this a 4-star review for me is the staff.  We always sit in the back bar area and are always served by one of two women who are so friendly and helpful and remind of the places back home! 


Buen Provecho! 

P.S.  I have never ordered this, but friends have...on Wednesdays (at the original location), they have all-you-can-eat tacos and enchiladas for $9.99!!!
