Every time I come to Vegas I'm sure to come here to eat. Is the food 5 star? No, however if you're out and about looking for a place with a great atmosphere for a gathering of friends and reasonable prices on drinks, this is your place. There are plenty of TV's to watch the games and music to get or keep the party going. Be sure to check out the rooftop party thurs-Saturdays. No cover before 10pm and $25 bucks for all you can drink draft beer with live dj's.
