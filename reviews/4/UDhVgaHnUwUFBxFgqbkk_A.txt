Food here has never been a problem. I can get a to go order, and it takes at most 10 minutes to get my food. Only thing I can say that prevents the 5 would be the lack of a smile. Maybe the workers just don't like me in particular :/

All in all, food is great. Particular fan of all the burrito choices. Always hot and fresh with a nice grilled taste.
