I came here not expecting much, had a groupon that I got for $5 for 6 tacos and 2 drinks, so I thought we'd give it a try. We had the carne asada, pastor, and green chile tacos. I chose mine on soft taco shells, my companion the hard. The server was friendly and did not give an attitude for groupon, unlike some places. The food was fresh, the pico de gallo was tasty, and the hot sauce packed a nice punch. Looking at the prices and tasting the food, it was very reasonable even without a groupon, so yes, I will go there again.
