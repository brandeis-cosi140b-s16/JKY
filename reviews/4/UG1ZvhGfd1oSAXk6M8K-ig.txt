Great food and service! Went there for the first time for dinner last week.  Once we ordered we started to notice that the place got kinda busy.  I remember thinking that this place must be pretty good. Sure enough it was!  I ordered the Flauntas combo and my mom ordered chicken fajitas.  I tried her fajitas too of course.  Everything tasted fresh and flavor was amazing.  They brought us free chips and salsa too while we waited.
