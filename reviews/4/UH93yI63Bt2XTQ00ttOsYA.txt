Cute place.  Clean and fresh looking. Went there for lunch with a colleague. Ordered the table guacamole. It was good but I prefer my own home made. Also had the shrimp tacos with vegetables. Both were very flavorful. Service was prompt and friendly. My one criticism was that although we ordered an order of the guacamole to take home to my colleagues husband,  the order want 1 placed and we didn't have time to wait longer. I will definitely be back
