This is my go-to place for Mexican food. The wait time is not too bad even when there are only 2-3 employees present.

The food is always up to par; burritos taste like burritos, quesadillas taste like quesadillas, etc. Although the food is not absolutely amazing, it all still tastes great. There is also a complimentary salsa bar. There is a huge menu with daily specials, breakfast items, and desserts as well.

On my last visit here, I had a chicken burrito plate, which consisted of a chicken burrito, a side of rice, and a side of refried beans. Everything tasted like it was supposed to. Everything came nice and hot. The amount of food for the value of the meal makes it a great buy.

There is not a lot of parking here, but there is always some place to sit. There is a 50 cent charge for any credit/debit cards as well. This place is worth a visit for some good-quality, Mexican food.
