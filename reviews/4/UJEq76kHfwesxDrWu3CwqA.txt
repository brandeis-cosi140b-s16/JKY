this is a five star rating as you'll read by my review... but I'm afraid of the dreaded yelp bot hiding my review.
So, first off, listing the address as Paradise road really doesn't do THIS taco joint justice.   It's located smake dab in the middle of The Hard Rock Hotel's Rehab Pool!!!    Are you kidding me?    You could go over to Chipotle on the strip and enjoy a taste of mexico amidst car fumes.... OR, sit like I am, looking out at a year around bikini season.   I don't even care if the food is good at all.   Oh and by the way, there isn't a friendlier staff in the business.   thanks folks.
