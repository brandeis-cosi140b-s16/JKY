For those that like Spicy Hot food this place is great! Being from NM i am a bit biased but this place lives up to the NM restaurants and style.

They had a couple diff salsas which were tasty and spicy.

The Adovada ribs are really good, actually best i ever had, very large and tasty, Braised well with a nice chile sauce. Tortillas seem to be made there kinda Grandma style (thick)

Rest of food seem decent with a theme of spicy throughout, didn't try the drinks but will next time.
