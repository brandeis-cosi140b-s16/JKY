Had heard about this place for years.  I believe recently they expanded their restaurant into the shop beside them in the plaza.

Have to say the food was excellent but the ambiance left a little to be desired.  Although I never visited before my understanding was it was very cozy.  The new space while probably welcomed by regulars needs some work.  The massively high strip mall tin ceiling was just a huge echo chamber which made everything loud.  Lighting was harsh too.  Not exactly sure why it felt that way, but very bright for a restaurant.

The food was the star here.  Some of the freshest true Tex-Mex you could ever ask for so much better than the typical fast casual chain Tex-Mex.

Fix the ambiance and I could see this easily moving up to a 5 star place.
