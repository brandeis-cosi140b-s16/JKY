I really enjoy Fuzzy's for lunch. The shredded pork tacos are delicious. I far prefer this place over Qdoba or Chipotle. The dining experience is far better. They have tons of TV's to watch all the sports your heart desires! They also Serve Mexican Coke which is awesome because they use real sugar. If you feel the need to indulge in an Alcoholic beverage they have those too!  They offer a lot more variety than the typical chain. So give it a try.
