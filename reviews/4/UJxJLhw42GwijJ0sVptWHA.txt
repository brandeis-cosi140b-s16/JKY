I've been going to Someburros with my family since it first opened in Tempe on Baseline & Mill way back in 1986 or so. I live in Chandler now so we go to this one most of the time. It's good food. I like the tacos, the pollo fundido, the green chili, the rod burro, the refried beans, and the rice. It's not 5 star food but it's 4-star and that beats a lot of the others. We like casual dining so this place works for us.
