As previous reviews have stated, the portions here are HUGE! I ordered a Deluxe Chicken Burrito and certainly was not disappointed. We started off with their chips, salsa, and table side guacamole. The chips are a bit thicker than I like, but tasty nonetheless. The salsa is quite thin and the guacamole isn't overwhelming with lime and salt like some other restaurants. 

The staff hasn't been very warm and welcoming, but I wasn't expecting southern hospitality from a traditional Mexican joint. They are attentive and refill beverage/chips/salsa. 

My boyfriend ordered the steak fajitas and I'm a little jealous of the flavorful sauce in which they've marinated the meat. The "fixings" they serve along the fajitas are just the same as what is served on top of my burrito; guacamole, lettuce, sour cream, tomato with rice and beans alongside. He was a little disappointed with that, but it worked perfectly with my meal. 

All in all, Don Pedro is definitely a location I will try again to see if there are even better GIANTS meals to enjoy.
