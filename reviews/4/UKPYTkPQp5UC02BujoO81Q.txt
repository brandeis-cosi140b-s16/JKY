It's good. 
Had this for the first time. And it's good. Could be better. Not "street" tacos like I have in Mexico but it's an American attempt at it. Much fancier than street tacos with the grilled veggies and flour tortillas instead of corn. The rice was nasty. The empanadas are not authentic, I wouldn't recommend them. The horchata was ok, nothing special the pico salsa was lacking flavor.  But the inferno salsa was devine! I put that on everything and it kicked it up a notch. It had me on fire  
Overall it's good. Nothing special, I wanna try the burritos next time with a groupon. My husband didn't like that they pack their tacos individually, we got 10 tacos in 10 separate styrofoam containers. Kinda not green in that way.
