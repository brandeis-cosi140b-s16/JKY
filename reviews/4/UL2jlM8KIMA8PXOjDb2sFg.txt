This was a very good lunch place, definitely somewhere I'll be back to.  The service was friendly, and the food was great.

I ordered two tacos - one carne asada and one barbacoa. Both came with plenty of flavorful meat, and the two salsas provided on the side really added an interesting side to the tacos. The rice was not what I expected - not Spanish rice or white cilantro lime rice, but rather some kind of yellow seasoned rice - however they cook it, it came out very good.

There's an ice cream and fruit smoothie freezer right out in the front - I didn't try any this time around, but I'll have to give it a shot sometime.
