First I went to this place with my husband and he had menudo. . . wasn't the best, but hey it was still as traditional as menudo can get on a sunday morning rite?
I had to chimichanga. . .you can never go wrong with a chimichanga.

One year later, some girlfriends of mine bought me takeout from here and they introduced me to CARNE ASADA FRIES and NACHOS!!  Whoolly guacamole! that was some good stuff.  Needless to say, when I want some of this good stuff this is where I will go.

I only gave them four stars because of my frist experience, but I really do like this place.
