why hello there, hole in the wall; that's not really a hole in the wall, except for the food.....delicious! i love the tacos durados (fried tacos-chicken) and their rice is just like mama makes it. the photos below do not do the food justice. don't go during lunch unitl after 1pm or you'll have slow service, everything is cooked up fresh....the salsas are hot hot hot. love it!
