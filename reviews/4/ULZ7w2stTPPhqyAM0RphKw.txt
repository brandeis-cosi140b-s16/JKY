It's a shame that I kept driving past this place all these months.  Now maybe it was the traffic fairy that came along and caused quite the back up which made me a bit hangry.  

I stopped in parking lot and remembered that I heard this place was very good.  I was able to narrow it down to the taco trio or carne asada burrito.  The burrito made the cut and it was very yummy.  I am very picky about my burrito fixins and they do them just right.  Not too much, not too little, and lots of flavor.

Don't be like me and keep passing this place up because it worth the stop.
