Basically, a good lil' Mexican restaurant in my neighborhood.   Both times I have been there, I ordered the three tacos.  The corn tortillas are small, homemade, and tasty.  They have 7 different types of meat to fill your menu item with and my favorite is Don Rafa Style which is carne asada and melted cheese with green chile.  The chips and salsa are hard to stay out of before you dig into your meal.  Their burritos are big and also very good.  I was a little disappointed with the sopapillas because they weren't doughy and were basically a fried wonton with cinnamon and sugar on it.  The service is really good and all of the waitstaff are very nice.  On the outside of the restaurant they promote a pretty good deal on a bucket of Corona, but I can't remember the exact amount.  There are always people dining there, but not so many that you have to wait for a table.  Check out Don Rafa - trust me, it's good.
