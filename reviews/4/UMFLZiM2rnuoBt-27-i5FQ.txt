This was a nice quiet place to come in and have a late lunch.  Portions were excellent and prices very reasonable.  They really rate 4.5 stars but I won't round down from 5 star ratings.  They served my chicken quesadilla with no guacamole, sour cream, or pico de gallo.  What gives?  Otherwise this was a good place that I'd definitely come back to.
