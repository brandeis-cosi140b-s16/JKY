First visit, we ate here specifically because I wanted a raspado (Mexican fresh fruit "snow cone" ) from the shop a couple doors down. The menu is simple yet covers all the basics. We went with a couple of tortas and split them ~ carnitas & carne asada, and I was pleased with both. The carnitas had some meaty chunks and a low grease factor and the carne asada was well seasoned with a slight kick. The sandwiches are put together well, with just the right amount of shredded lettuce, a slice of tomato, slices of avocado... and, of course, a grilled bun. Well done! Bring cash as they don't accept plastic.
