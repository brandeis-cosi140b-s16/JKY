My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to eat. Since it was near her work, she had seen it and thought I would like it based on my obsession with Mexican food. 

The atmosphere is great, and would be a great place to have a happy hour on a Friday night. It was modern and fun. 

The chips and salsa were great. Our waitress even had to refill them. Then came the food. My girlfriend ordered steak tacos, which she said were great, and the meat was tender and cooked to perfection. My enchiladas were even better, based on my own bias toward anything wrapped in a tortilla and doused with sauce. Great overall flavor and the rice and beans were great, too. 

I was blessed to finish off my amazing meal with a great CUATRO leches dessert. Make note if you know Spanish or are familiar with tres leches... this was amazing!!!!! The cake was soft, moist, sweet and bathed in a generous helping of condensed milk, one of the cuatro leches used. 

Overall, go there over any other Mexican place in the area. The atmosphere is fun, lively, and the food is amazing.
