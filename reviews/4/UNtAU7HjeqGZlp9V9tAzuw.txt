While living in California I gained a newfound appreciation for Mexican food.  With many excellent taquerias and authentic establishments to choose from, I overcame my prejudice of Mexican food as bland combinations of rice, beans and tomatoes.  When done correctly, it's pretty damned delicious.

Now that we've moved to Charlotte, I figured that finding a decent carnitas taco or pollo con chorizo would be a challenge.  Would you believe that we lucked out on the first try?  Monterrey was just that good.

As the other reviews have mentioned, like any good Mexican restaurant you are first served with a heaping pile of tortilla chips, salsa and the infamous white cheese dip.  Order a beer (Bohemia is always the best) and a main dish, and you'll be off and eating within 5 minutes.  Service was excellent, and the food was totally on point.  My carne asada was grilled to perfection, topped with a grilled jalepe√±o and served with great rice and refried beans.  The guacamole salad had a little bit of spicy kick to it, yet the sour cream helped tone down the spice of the dish.

Is this place authentic?  I have no idea, probably not.  Is it a hike from uptown?  Yeah.  The best ethnic food is almost never downtown.

Long story short, we will be going back to Monterrey Mexican.  Often, I hope.
