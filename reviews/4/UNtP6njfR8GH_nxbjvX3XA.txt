I've always loved this place. You have to try the shredded beef salad. It's the best thing on the menu by far! And the house dressing is delicious. Kids get a free cheese quesadilla when you order an adult entree which is great. This specific location has never had super friendly employees... I just remember the Gilbert location being so nice and this one is lacking in that department.
