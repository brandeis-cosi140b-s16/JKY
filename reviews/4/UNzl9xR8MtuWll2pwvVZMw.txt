Some items are fantastic others just good. It's about 8 or 9 years that I have been getting take out from them (they do have some tables and a TV), and if you order certain items, they will blow you away! Nobody make the flavorful green chili burritos as well as they do, tastes home made and unique. They have a variety of burritos like steak, potato and cheese that is loaded with tender meat and outstanding. Shredded beef in their tacos is home cooked roast, no fat, no gristle. Service is fast, I found friendly and accurate. The place is small but clean and well lighted. Home cooked recipes from the Globe, AZ. family that started this small chain of local restaurants. They deliver and cater. There a 2 locations in Gilbert, 1 in Chandler and 1 in Mesa.
