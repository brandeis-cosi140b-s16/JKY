Had a great dinner with a 8 friends last night. It was a busy Saturday night. I was glad we'd made a reservation. 

Service was a little bit spacey. Waitress got confused a couple times. Nothing to freak out about. She was gracious and apologetic about it. 

Sangria is amazing. A-mazing. 

I had the Enchiladas Mestizas. Holy goodness. I'm craving them again already!
