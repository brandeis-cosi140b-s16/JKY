Review from the other end of the table, opposite Michele H. from Costa Mesa:  Here's the thing about El Patron - it's definitely one of the better Mexican restaurants you'll find in Las Vegas in a town where Mexican food is fairly watered down.

Yeah, that band playing a full on concert-length set got pretty annoying after awhile, especially when we started shouting "WHAT?" at each other across the table.  But in the times I've been to El Patron, the food's always been good, they serve bean dip with the tortilla chips, and the place has a nice family-run, local feel that makes me go back.  I'm still a fan.
