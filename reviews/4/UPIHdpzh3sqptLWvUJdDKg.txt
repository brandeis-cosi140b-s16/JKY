Pretty tasty food, i recommend Chipotle often for people on the go or when we have limited time. Sometimes there is a rush of people and it gets insanely crazy with limited seating and long lines, however, the food is still fresh and full of flavor. You can't beat the healthy options, and yes the menu is limited, but it's still very delicious. 
At first i didnt like the lime salt on the chips, but it's grown on me and i can't eat a burrito bowl without them.

Highly recommend if you have to have fast food.
