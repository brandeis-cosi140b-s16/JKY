This place pretty much makes over-sized sushi rolls. Likin' it a lot. 
Service here is quick and efficient, but everyone there is still nice behind the counter. They'll answer your questions about the menu options/ingredients without any hesitation. 
Setting is still new like they're still up to add more, plus the plaza is renovating the outside of the building. Don't let that deter you. Honestly wish they had more seats available though.
I had the Rockport, and when the guys behind the counter asked how I wanted it, I pretty much left it up to them on how to load the thing. Was not disappointed whatsoever. It was spicy, but the other cool toppings balanced everything in the burrito. Considering this place is a sister-establishment to SoHo, I liked how the Seaweed Salad was the same, and I didn't even have to drive there for it. The Taro Chips weren't salted, but they were peppered, which went well with the hot cheese. 
On a side note, liked the way my boyfriend didn't even want to dig into the meal at first, but then he just habitually picked away at the chips like it was all his.
