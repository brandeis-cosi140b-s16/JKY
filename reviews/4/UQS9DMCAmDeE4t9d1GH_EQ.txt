This taco restaurant was great, not amazing as people say though. My all time favorite tacos, especially for cabeza is still El Chato in Los Angeles. 

I ordered:

1 Chorizo Taco - good, but not memorable. It lacked a punch.
1 Cabeza Taco - delicious taco and the green sauce was spicy.
3 Adobado Tacos - the texture was crunchy and the meat was flavorful. It wasn't spicy at all though unfortunately. I felt the meat could have been a bit more tender. When they serve you this meat, they cut it off the spinning rotisserie and crisp it up on a pan. I think the crisping on the pan part of it is unnecessary. 

All in all, I'd definitely come again.
