First few times we came here it was amazing!!!! Last few lately....not so much. You can't beat $1 tacos on Tuesdays, except when the chicken is as dry as a bone. If you get it 'to go' the tacos fall apart when you try to eat them, so dine in and you'll be fine. Overall, still really good food and service. Try it out!!!
