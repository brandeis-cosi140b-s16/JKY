Excellent food at an affordable price.  If Mexican fast food is your scene, there are few rivals to Filiberto's.  In my former life as a fast food aficionado, I found myself daily at the drive-thru window of Fliberto's ordering breakfast burritos.  All varieties excellent!  Huge burritos overflowing with yummity goodness.  Nothing hits the spot like breakfast at Filiberto's.  Now that I have reformed my ways of eating to embrace a healthier lifestyle, I still find that there are yummity healthy options like the pollo asado burrito minus the tortilla.  The salsa verde is excellent.  You can switch your flour tortillas for corn tortillas and ask for grilled options.  I have shopped around and still think Filiberto's is one of a kind.  Eat well. Be well.
