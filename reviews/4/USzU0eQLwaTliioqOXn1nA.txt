I thoroughly enjoy a fish taco from time to time and where else can you get one in landlocked AZ? Look no further. Mind you, I don't classify it as Mexican food, rather baja style. 

At this particular location, they have deals prominently on the whiteboard in the front, which I've enjoyed on several occasions. One time they featured a three taco plate for less than seven bucks. Not bad when you're dining out in this area. If you join their email club, you can get cool things like free chips and guacamole.

Definitely recommend stopping by here if you're looking for quick and cheap in the northern Scottsdale/Carefree area. And, looking for great fish tacos of course.
