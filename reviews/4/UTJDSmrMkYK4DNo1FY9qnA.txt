I liked this place a lot! Very good restaurant for lunch with some darn good service. The inside decor is very "Miami." 

The chips and salsa are a nice alternative to bread to start the meal. We ate on a nice outside patio eating area which overlooked the Borgata shopping area. The service was right on on the money and they were very knowledgeable of the menu. 

I ordered the burrito and was very happy with it. It was something that definitely filled me for the rest of the day. It was stuffed with beans, rice, lettuce and TONS of carnita's. My brother ordered the chicken quesadillas and really enjoyed them. 

I'm a fan. Next time I am in town I would definitely come back to Blanco. Although it may not be typical "Mexican" food its darn good.
