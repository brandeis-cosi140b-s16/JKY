I am a big fan of sonoran dogs!  I like the ones from here because they put cabbage on the dogs.  The feel of the restaurant is cute...nothing special...you order, you sit down, eat, and get out!  It's pretty small but I'm sure it's a hot lunch spot for downtown.  I will definitely have to go back for the tacos and tequila next time I stop by.
