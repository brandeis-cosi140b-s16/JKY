Essentially I compare every Mexican place to Tacos El Gordo....

Pros:
1. Mexican street corn with cotija/mayo/chili powder is amazing here (not offered at Gordo)  
2. Vampiros, which is essentially a tostada sandwich and delicious and packed with meat. (2 of these will make you full)
3. Good selection at the salsa bar and extra veggies available.

Cons: 
1.  Tacos al pastor was way too salty
2.  Seemed pricier than tacos el gordo...either that or the cashier overcharged us

Overall, I still prefer Tacos El Gordo for the flavor of the al pastor.  But if you go here you must try the elote (mexican corn), I could eat this all day!
