Went to Sol Diablo tonight to check it out and I enjoyed it
I like that there is free parking underneath the building
There is/was a hostess stand near the entrance of the building but no one was standing there, so we just waltzed up the cool entryway
The decor is pretty cool, especially at night
We got inside and the bartender/server told us to sit wherever we wanted
There wasn't many people there but over time, the place kinda filled up
It was nice to see this small space, full...
Also, two more workers came in which really helped the bartender/server
They have a cool drink menu and prices are very reasonable
Especially during Happy Hour
I ordered just two tacos because I wasn't very hungry
I got the Chicken Taco and the Veggie Taco
Taco's are $2 and they are pretty small
I think that for the price and the quality, they are fair
I really enjoyed both tacos and I am eager to try more of them during my next visit...
There is a check-in offer for free chips & salsa too
I think that this would be a cool summer hang out, it might be a little slow because ASU wont be in session, but the outdoor ambience is very cool...
Check it out!
