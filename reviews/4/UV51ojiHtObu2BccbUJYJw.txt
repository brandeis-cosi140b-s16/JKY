Dude how could I not be a fan when my first experience with this place is that they hand me a gigantic, free chicken burrito??  I hope that they get some spillover traffic from the Subway next door, because I can tell the locals that own the franchise are workin' hard and I don't want them to get eaten by economy like so many other local businesses (i.e., papa george, sweet indulgence, pages for all ages)
