Best margarita I've had, ok maybe being generous here but it was definitely in the top 5 and the best part was it was free with my Yelp check in! There is nothing that makes me happier than fresh chips & salsa and a good margarita. The chips were warm and crispy, lightly salted and the salsa was perfect. Started out with the calamari, cilantro serrano + sweet chipotle dipping sauces, delicious and a must if you're a calamari lover like I am, then moved on to the sarape de pollo, black beans, manchego, mint chimichurri, guacamole + pico de gallo. This was so unique and my friend and I ended up splitting it and it was definitely large enough to split especially when you fill yourself up on chips & salsa prior to your entree. 

Valet parking is also a plus (yes, I'm a valet parker) service here was good, and I loved the decor here, very stylish and eclectic. This is a wonderful find.
