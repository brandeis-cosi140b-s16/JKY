I have been going here since 1989, very little has changed.   Food always very good, for me the wait staff has been the best.   If you ask they will spice up or down as to the way you like it.  I usely go early and miss the crowds.   Family owned sence 1947 or 48, when Glendale was a farming town.  If anything the food is dated, that is not a bad thing.
