Fresh fast food, but a tad on the expensive side for what it is. I much prefer this place to Baja Fresh or Chipotle- Home of the ten dollar burrito! They have a great little salsa bar where you load your own plastic containers of a variety of salsas. If you've never had a fish taco and you think it sounds yucky, try one here and you'll change your mind!
