This is one of my favorite places for burritos. I love the chicken, pork, and steak but for some reason I usually order the chicken. It has a very unique taste. Of course the food is fresh. Plus at this place i have never had any problems wrapping my burrito. I've been to others that double wrap or they have to start over. Not too cool. 

Service is always fast and friendly. Only problem with this place is sometimes finding parking can be a little hard.
