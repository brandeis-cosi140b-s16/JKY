I had lunch with a friend and we weren't in a hurry, so we really enjoyed this restaurant. The chips were fine, the pico was fresh and delicious, salsa was watery. Service was slow but very friendly. I had a chili relleno, delicious, my friend had arroz con pollo, which she really liked. I finished with flan which was great, but over decorated. It was better than many other Mexican places I've been in Matthews. I will definitely return, knowing it is not a quick place.
