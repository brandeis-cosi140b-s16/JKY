I ate here yesterday after a friend recommended it. The staff was very friendly and the service was great. Prices were very fair in my opinion. 

I had the lunch special which consisted of a beef taco, rice and received beans. The rice was amazing! Lots of flavor and a bit of spice. The taco was good although the beef could have been better-seasoned. 

Overall, I recommend this place. The owner was very friendly and helpful too!
