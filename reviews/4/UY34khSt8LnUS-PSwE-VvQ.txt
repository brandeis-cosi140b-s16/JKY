In all honesty, the more  I go here, the more I do actually find the prices a bit steep. I mean my chicken burrito is 6.95 not too bad, but my bill was 8.05 because of the sour cream I got. I never knew that you had to pay extra for the sour cream. Thanks for telling me...
I will still give it a four because the food is fantastic, but I just wanted to make it clear to others that if you want sour scream or something enchilada style, then it is extra. Those things tend it add up at .95 cents and .50 cents an item. Just beware.
