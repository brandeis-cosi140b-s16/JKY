So first off, a disclaimer: I still love this place.  A lot.  They do utility (Sonoran-Style) Mexican food like no other in the immediate vicinity.  
BUT ("There's always a big butt." - PeeWee Herman) the fish tacos taste EXACTLY like a Big Mac.  It's the combo of mayo/pickle relish and shredded lettuce.  I'll never be able to disassociate.  The fish was kind of weird too, now that I think about it.  Sad, overcooked nuggets of farm-raised failure.  

Salsa? Still runny, but better flavor than I remember. 
Service? Great. 
Prices? Wonderful.
Margaritas? Cheap, at least during happy hour. 
Beef/Chicken Tacos?  Stellar. 

Okay, so just don't order the fish tacos.  ;)
