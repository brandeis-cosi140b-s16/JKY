Look, let's not lie to ourselves...a good, hefty quesadilla is a hearty meal that'll put you into a food coma. Queso Good allows you to eat this on the go, but be forewarned...it gets messy! There are about 10 varieties to choose from, but know they all have one thing in common. They're HUGE. This could be two separate meals, but anything is single-serving if you're hungry enough! ;-)

I opted for the "pork-a-dilla", stuffed with guacamole, roasted pork, a touch of sour cream, and chorizo. While the tortilla was much too buttery for me, I immediately gorged on the gigantic meal, with the messy contents spilling out into my little basket. Fortunately, they give you a side of tortilla chips to scoop up every bit of goodness. Be sure to pour some of their tasty green salsa over that.

Some say "you are what you eat", and I definitely felt like a pig after this meal. I'm not proud of myself--it was probably like a million calories. But I DID feel satisfied for the low, low price of about $8.50, and that's why I'm a fan.
