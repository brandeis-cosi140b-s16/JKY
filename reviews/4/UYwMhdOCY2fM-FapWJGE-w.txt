We were floored when we saw America's at Arizona Mills.  There's never been anything in the food court that I *wanted* to eat...yes, out of hunger, I've braved a few of the other places in there, but America's blows all of them away!  I love their veggie quesadilla and the beans are great.  It's nice to know they are lard free...which means you can eat vegetarian or vegan here easily!
