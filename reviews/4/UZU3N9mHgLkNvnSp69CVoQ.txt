I stopped in for lunch on Saturday and had a great experience.  The couple that owns the place is very friendly, the food was fantastic and I LOVE the "luncharitas" (fresh juice) served in a jar.  The citrus berry was absolutely delicious...I am seriously going to crave this stuff every day!  The chicken dilla was quite tasty - the salsa was legit too!
