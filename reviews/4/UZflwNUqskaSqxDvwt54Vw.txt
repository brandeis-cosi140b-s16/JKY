Sure.. Tourist trap! But excellent service, good coffee, and the Eggs Benedict was soooo good! It was so windy and cold when we were here so we couldn't sit outside on the cool deck overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Oh well

Decor looks like Margaritaville a block away, but I think the food was better here!
