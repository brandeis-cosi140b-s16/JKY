We went here only because my mother wanted us to try it, and it is her 80th B'day. I would have avoided it like the Plague because of the Yelp reviews. So we sat down for brunch.

The setting is quite nice, with seating available both inside and out. Our server was very good, attentive to details but not intrusive. He was able to give useful advice on what to order.  The menu is eclectic ranging from Ahi, to burritos and crepes. It is always a concern that it would be difficult to do this many things well. We didn't really explore the limits of the menu much, and stuck to eggs benedict, Southwest benedict, and Heuvos rancheros. All of which were very good. The Heuvos had a pork verde, and the Southwest had house made chorizo and grilled masa cake. The hollandaise was actually pretty good. This was particularly important to my wife after an experience years ago at a french bistro in Sarasota FL where I nearly got into a fist fight with the chef when I sent the food back because the hollandaise was thin, curdled, and tasteless. The "chef"/owner claimed that  I lacked an appreciation for the more sophisticated, and traditional,  sauce he had created. I attempted to politely address his claim by telling him, "A pimply faced high school chef at Denny's could make a better sauce." Things went downhill from there. I digress. So the sauce was reasonable and my wife's blood pressure decreased after my announcement.

The prices are not cheap, each dish was about $15, but this is a tourist area and my primary concern was to get reasonably good food. This place exceeded my expectations and I would go back.
