So, I think I have been to most of the Chipotles in the state.  The one thing they all have is consistency.  It is always great to pop in real quick and grab a bite.  At high noon at most locations you can wait a little longer, but it still isn't bad.  Their chicken is good, with next to no chewy bits.  I have been on a Carnitas kick of late.  Always juicy and never dry.  It is a little more expensive then most fast food joints, but the quality is way better.  Love Chipotle!
