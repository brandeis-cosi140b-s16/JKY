A friend of mine raved about the salads at this place and took me to a Vegas location for my fist dining experience. I quickly joined the fan club, and was very excited to find a Cafe Rio near my Avondale hotel. 

You order at the counter from a menu offering salads, burritos, tostadas, enchiladas, quesadillas, nachos, and soup. The best part is that they hand make their own soft flour and multi grain tortillas! I was able to watch a woman make them while I ordered. I always opt for the salad with a large soft flour tortilla draped in the bottom of the bowl. Toppings include a choice of meats, beans and rice, fresh pico, cheese, cilantro, strips of tortilla chips, sour cream, guacamole, and limes. I love the creamy tomatilla dressing, it's almost ranch like! So good! 

The salads are served as a very large portion for just under $9. For a smaller, slightly less expensive option, I have ordered the tostada, which comes in the smaller bowl with a smaller tortilla in the bottom. They run the tortilla, and rice and beans through the oven really quick, but the tortilla remains soft and fresh, and you're able to add all the same toppings the salads have. 

Cafe Rio does not have any locations where I live, but I now find myself going out of my way to eat there when I find one in the city I'm visiting. I have only tried the salads, but the fresh tortillas, toppings, and dressing is enough to keep me coming back and leaving happy!
