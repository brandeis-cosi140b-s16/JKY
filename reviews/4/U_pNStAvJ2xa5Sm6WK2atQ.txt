Such a great little place. The food is yummy and fresh, I was a little worried walking in an hour before closing time. Carne asada fries are a must! Huge serving, more than enough to share. The staff at the counter were pleasant and very helpful. I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu. Not much of an atmosphere/decor, not really important when you bring good company and have great food to share.
