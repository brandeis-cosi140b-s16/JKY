When I used to work in Phoenix this was my favorite mexican food place to eat.  They have delicious food for good prices.  I always got the grilled chicken platter.  Soooo delicious!
Their salsa is addicting as well.  I want the recipe!  If you are in downtown Phoenix I would definitely recommend you trying it out.  
Makes me wanna work closer so I can go there every day.
