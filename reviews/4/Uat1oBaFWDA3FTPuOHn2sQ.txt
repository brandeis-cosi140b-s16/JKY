Great fajitas, the service was really nice and the portions were large. It is now my new favorite neighborhood Mexican place. I think if you stick to either fajitas or combinations, you would do well. The food was really high quality and if you order well, should be enough for a couple more meals at home.

There were mostly older folks there, which I think explains the weird vibe of the place, but it is definitely worth a shot.
