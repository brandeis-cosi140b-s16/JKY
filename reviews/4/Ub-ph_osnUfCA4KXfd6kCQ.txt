I call chipotle , the subway of Mexican food, because even though it
has some Mexican words like "carnitas" or "tacos" its nothing close to
a real mexican dish, just like subway is not close to an Italian
sub.It doesn't mean its bad, it just simply means that if you are
going for the full" Vato loco mexicano sabor arriba arriba ayayayay"
flavor  ; you might want to go to another spot.

Chipotle is clean, fresh ,inexpensive and serve good sized portions.
The pinto beans are very good , so is the chicken and guacamole.The
steak sometimes comes too cooked but you cant ask that much as at the
end of the day it is still a fast food joint.

Calories count on the big menu  is a super plus for me, as a natural
"gordito" that I am , and trying to lose weight, this is a very good
tool. (I.E I would never eat the chips again because of its calorie
count)
