It was cool. Got the Thai chicken nachos while the wife got the Florentine Chicken nachos. Good stuff! The kids menu portions were generous too. 

On the negative side, it was too damn dark in there. Turn the lights up a little, will ya? And the little corn muffins they brought out for appetizer, couldn't decide if they wanted to be actual corn bread or that soft corn cake you get at El Torito. I think everyone at the table tried them and spit them out. 

That lovely image aside, I like the place and will be back.
