I do like the margaritas here. They are very strong so be careful! The food is good, but the menu is on the expensive side for Mexican (strip prices, around $12 for margaritas). The staff is very friendly. The patio is nice and there is also a bar outside on the patio which is fun as long as it's not too hot outside.
