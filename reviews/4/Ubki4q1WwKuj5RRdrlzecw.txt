I was meadow's mall and my family was hungry and we decided to grab something really quick. FYI - Meadows mall is across the street from spring preserves. I was really shocked how well these little tacos tasted.
I ordered 12 Tacos, Carnitas (pulled pork) with cheese and guacamole.
The tacos had diced onions and cilantro, just squeeze the lime and ... WOW dam good for mall food. I am not sure i would drive all the way from Henderson to get a Taco, I would think about it though :) ... I think the gas in Chevy Tahoe would cost more the meal. If your at this mall for some reason give it a try. I think i should have ordered 4 more. The 12 tacos was shared by 4. The tacos it self is only $1.25 and to add cheese .25 cents and guacamole another .25 cents. Man just writing this review wants me to sneak off from work and grab a bite.
