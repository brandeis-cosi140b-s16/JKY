I've been to Fuzzy's Tacos quite a few times and I've consistently had a good experience.

My go-to favorite for this place is the Taco Plate. You get two tacos and two sides for $6.49 - enough for a decent meal. I've had the veggie tacos and the tempura shrimp tacos, both very good. The chips and salsa are a sizable quantity with no skimping on the salsa.

The burritos are alright, but I suggest to stick towards the tacos. The hot sauce is sufficiently hot. I've been stuck waiting a while for my meal a few times... maybe a suggestion, if anyone at Fuzzy's is watching this: If someone orders chips, maybe they can grab those first while waiting for the other meals to come out?

All in all, a good place to get a few tacos and chips. Lots of TVs so it's good for watching sports. I'd suggest giving it a shot with a couple of your buddies when you get a chance.
