Great date spot with a killer Chimichanga; the only downfall to the meal would have been the less than stellar meatloaf, but meatloaf is hit or miss anyway. Either way this is the best true Tex-Mex in Az, and the best "Near Mexican" food that you can find in the area that doesn't get served to you from over a counter. 
I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a mexican food fix or to impress a date.
