A Torta Ahogada has to be one of the last culinary gems that has not become exposed yet. Perhaps good reason for it; the provenance makes Guadalaraja, Mexico the place of origin (having done business there for enough years we genuinely believe the history), and even in other parts of Mexico it is not easy to find. But we are starting to see the sandwich show up on some Las Vegas menus, and we have to give a shout-out to El Birotazo for making the best that we have found so far.

Torta Ahogada literally means "drowned sandwich". Roast pork in a salty bollilo (the latter preferrably just a bit stale), dipped into a spicy chile arbol-based sauce. Add some pickled onions and a squeeze of lime. A fantastic combination if the meat is roasted properly and the bread sturdy enough to have a little staying power (especially if eaten from a cart in Guadalaraja).

El Birotazo does it right. The owners are from Guadalajara and take a lot of pride in their product. Generous with the meat, and the bread is crusty and has just enough oomph to get about two-thirds of the way through before it collapses. But no problem - they serve it in a shallow plate with a spoon, so that you can enjoy to the last drop. As for the rest of the small menu, we do not have a clue - all trips have been for this sandwich, and it is difficult to think about taking any other direction.
