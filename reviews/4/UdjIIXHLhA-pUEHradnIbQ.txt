Searched Yelp for a Taco Tuesday and found Christina's.  $1.25 for a taco and very tasty.  Ordered 4 shredded beef tacos and a soda for $6.50.  Absolutely great red salsa, the green was heavy garlic but the red hit all the right buttons.  Chips brought out as a first made this place a step above a hole in the wall at great value.  I'll be back
