First off, I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before I tried this place. I tried this place by accident since my regular hole wasn't ready for lunch and it was early still. I had the green burrito and bought 3 more for my guys at work as a thanks. We all loved them. One of the first things I always try is a green burrito, so I have had a lot of different ones. This place ranks with the best of them. We ended up eating here three days this week. I went with my other favorite Pastor and it was awesome as well. Neither burrito wasn't spicy, but I can handle really hot food, so I'm not the best guy to ask is it spicy or not. One of my guys , who I joke with telling him he had to turn in his Mexican card because he sweats just looking at black pepper, really enjoyed it because he could eat it all, although he still had a sheen of sweat on his brow. The staff was really friendly as well. Their prices are great for the portions you get.
