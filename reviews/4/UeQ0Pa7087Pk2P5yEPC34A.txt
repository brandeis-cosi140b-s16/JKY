This is another huge bar/restaurant with a giant patio that includes cabanas and a pool element Vegas style. Last night the pool and patio were devoid of most people and I was in a special room off to the side called the Mango room. This area has a separate bar and is less crowded than the main area. Kitchen closed at 10:30pm, so I didn't get to try the overpriced tacos and burrito's ($11 for the cheapest). It is easy to park since the place has it's own lot and if you get bored look for the blonde bartender with long platinum hair - very easily the best looking bartender I can recall in years slinging drinks.
