This place is great!
Food is cooked to order most of the time, condiment bar is good and fun and eventhough a single person works at the register or at the cooking area, food is SUPER!
VERY accomodating order taker and patient, ALL of them!
This Poliberto's for MEX food for me, thanks... 
( THIS, AN OLDER REVIEW BUT SEEMS THIS LOCATION STILL 100% GREAT)
