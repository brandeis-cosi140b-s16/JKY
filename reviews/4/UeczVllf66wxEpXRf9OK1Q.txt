I love this place.  We walk here.  Hubby likes it okay, but is right, the servers are kind of characters.  I love the food though.  I had a shredded beef plater that was amazing.  This is traditional mexican food so it's a bit heavy, can be greasy depending on what you order.  I got sick on one of the cheaper margaritas, but the one that has orange juice, a bit pricier, is AMAZING.  Relaxed atmosphere.  Food is good and exactly what you would expect from a traditional mexican restaurant.  Good, yet not phenomenal, but great when you are in the mood for traditional mexican food.
