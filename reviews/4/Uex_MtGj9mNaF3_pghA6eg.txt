The taco flight of 5 smaller tacos for $12 is a great deal. I immensely enjoyed the fried avocado (Monday's taco). The tinga pollo was very good. Pastor was good. Bacon was very salty. Camaron was a little disappointing. They tend to be pretty salty which I found a little distracting. Good vibes, reasonable prices. The cheesy burrito looked so good. I had dinner envy the entire night.
