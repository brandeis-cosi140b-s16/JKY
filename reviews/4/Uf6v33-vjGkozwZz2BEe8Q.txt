Fourteen-seat hole in the wall specializing in Michoacan-style birria de res and other beef-centric soups and stews. Decent assortment of taco, torta, burro, and quesdadilla options, as well as breakfast items. Phone-in orders and credit cards accepted.

The birria is rich with chile flavor, but not with chile heat--it benefits from doctoring with hot sauce (a bottle is supplied with every dine-in order), salt, and dried Mexican oregano (available on each table, along with dried chiltepines).
