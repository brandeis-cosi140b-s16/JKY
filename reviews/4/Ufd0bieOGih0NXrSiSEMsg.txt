I went to Chayo knowing that their target crowd is the partying drinker/pub crawler just like a majority of the other bars in the LINQ. Hence "+ tequila bar" in the name, the mechanical bull, the louder music, and a menu that is half food and half drinks. So I wasn't expecting a calm, peaceful meal that was a bargain. But I was very pleased with the service and the food. The food is traditional Mexican fare with some extra twists.

My buddy and I decided on Chayo after a Rebels game to eat and have some drinks. We were standing outside by the hostess stand and because the hostess was gone, our server was attentive and saw us. He came outside to greet us and took us inside to be seated immediately. He suggested the Golden Margarita and White Peach Margarita. We obliged and I had the Golden. A $14 margarita is jab to the wallet, but the Patron reposado packed an overhand right to the jaw. The tequila was definitely not hidden. After two margaritas each, we were feeling it.

As far as food, we started with chips & salsa and guacamole & pork rinds. The guacamole is great, creamy with the pomegranate and not too heavy with tomatoes or onions. The portion we received was at least double compared to the photos on Yelp. I would recommend the chips instead of the pork rinds with the guacamole as the pork rinds' saltiness overpowers the guacamole.

For entrees, I had the pork enchiladas and my buddy had the slow roasted beef short rib. My enchiladas were delicious. The cascabel chile sauce added great flavor and kick. I had a taste of the short rib and it was tender. The accompanying oaxaca cheese mashed potato was delicious.

Another trip will happen to drink some of the over 50 varieties of tequila and to try more of the food.
