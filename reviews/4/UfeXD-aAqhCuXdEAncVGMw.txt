My family and I were visiting AZ for the first time from the east coast.We  found this wonderful restaurant on a Thursday afternoon after a long flight. We were greeted by the owner/chef who helped us with the menu and we had the best red salsa and chips. Our family of four enjoyed the enchiladas and the chimichangas. It was a great way to begin our trip to AZ and hope some day to go back.
