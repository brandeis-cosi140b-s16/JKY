This place is a little gem down the street from my work.  Ordered their ceviche de camaron which was good except they don't put avocado we had to ask.

Their mangoneadas are decent and their shrimp empanadas are good as well.

We also ordered the platter which was a huge portion that could easily serve 4 people & it was only $20!  It consisted of fried calamari, fried tilapia, a whole loaf of garlic bread with potatoes shrimp and green peppers.

Price and portion is on point!
