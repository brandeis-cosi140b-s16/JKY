My family and I have eaten here multiple times and we've never had bad service. The chips are great and taste close to home made. They come with a red and green salsa as well as bean dip. My margaritas are always filled to the rim. The food is americanized and isn't what you would expect at home but it is worth it. Our waitress Nikki was very quick and polite and very sociable. The price are great, and the mariachi band that plays make it an enjoyable cultural meal.
