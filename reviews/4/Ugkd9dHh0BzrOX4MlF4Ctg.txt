I've been here twice (during happy hour) and have been impressed both times, the pork belly tacos were great and I indulged in several of their haus margaritas. I was tempted to try the ceviche during my last visit which looks amazing but is a bit more expensive than just getting a few tacos. Wish this place wasn't so far north as I currently live in Chandler!
