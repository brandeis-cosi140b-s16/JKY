I love Chipotle in general. I hate their anti-GMO stance and their inability to prevent horrible outbreaks of terrible diseases, but that risk is MINIMAL. Go ahead and take that as a given in all of my Chipotle reviews. I'm reviewing each of these Chipotles independently.
Since the Old Town location screwed up our faxed lunch orders so much, I was very happy when this location opened up. I RARELY had them screw up a fax order (although maybe 20% of the time, it would happen, which was not nearly as significant as the other location). They are a very friendly staff over here. They don't have as many fax issues as the Old Town location, but there were a few times when I didn't confirm my fax order immediately, and this ran into me sitting around while they finished the order. Decent portions, though I wouldn't say generous as PV mall or some in Seattle. Parking lot is a bit of a deathtrap, but hey, it's Scottsdale. Overall though, good experience.
