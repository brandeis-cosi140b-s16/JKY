Was out in Tempe for a conference and wanted to find some Mexican close to our hotel. We found this place. We got the guacamole which was awesome, they put some jalapeno sauce around the edge which was might tasty. 

Portions weren't that big, but prices were reasonable. Service was great, and would definitely come back next time I was in Tempe.
