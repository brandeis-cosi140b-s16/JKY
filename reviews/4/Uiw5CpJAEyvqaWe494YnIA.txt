So I was expecting the food to taste like any other fish shack in the valley. Boy was I wrong. We started out with the crab cakes. They had good flavor & a nice crunchy exterior. The cocktail sauce was the best part. I order the tamale del mar for my entr√©e. Folks, that dish is awesome. The seafood in it was cooked right. It was a perfect dish. My wife had the cod tacos. #amazing. Plenty of fish. It wasn't overwhelmed with batter or coleslaw. We also ordered the three street taco plate. Good, but not my favorite. Cole loved them. We sat outside and it was a beautiful night to have fish tacos, a cold beer & the love of my life. I'll definitely be back. This might be our new favorite hang out.
