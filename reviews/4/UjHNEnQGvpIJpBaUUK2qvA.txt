Decent food, the tortilla for the burrito is the size of a pizza crust. They ended up getting pretty busy and only had 3 people working and the order of service was getting confused. I watched my food starting to get cold as they had it staged to be wrapped. It was still ok and a good value but could of been a lot better.
