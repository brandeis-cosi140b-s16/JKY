This is my first review. I have used yelp for a couple of years to find good food but never have taken the time to leave a review. The tacos are so yummy! Beans and rice were good but those are just filler!  My friend, who travels to Mexico on a regular basis, said the tacos tasted very authentic. I got the 3 taco plate (Bistec, Al Pastor, and Barbacoa). My favorite was the Al Pastor but all 3 were tender and delicious. I was sad to see that it wasn't busy at lunch. This place is worth trying! I give 4 stars instead of 5 because the sign says that the chips are made fresh to order but when they arrived, they were not hot or even warm. I could tell they were homemade but not "fresh to order". My only other critique is location. Tucked back in a strip mall, it is difficult to find.
