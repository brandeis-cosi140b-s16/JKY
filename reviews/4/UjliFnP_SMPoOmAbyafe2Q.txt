If you're familiar with brat haus in old town you can expect the same... Same owners, cool decor, great menu. Definitely not your average taco joint!! Only issue - service was a little lacking - lots of servers, but they seemed kind of oblivious to what was goin on. Will try it again though - figure they are just working out the kinks!
