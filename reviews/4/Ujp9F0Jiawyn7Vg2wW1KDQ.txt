This review like the others is only for this particular chipolte. 

I live down the street so i sometimes stop in grab a fajita burrito. It's simply AMAZING!

Only down side is the foot traffic. Its really busy because it's in the arrowhead area. So many eff'ing people especially around lunch and dinner. So many that i stopped coming for a long time. 
UNTIL i found the chipotle app for my iPhone and iPad. I guess you can order online via their website too. But now i can just order AND pay on my phone. Walk straight in, bypass the line. (which i really enjoy because people in that long line look at u like ur crazy for cutting in line ha ha) then grab my food and leave. It's awesome. 

So anyway i recommend this place. 
Plus it's healthy compared to the crappy fast-food industry.
