I thought I would write a review update for this location. 

After going through about us three managers, they had finally found a manager who can run the store correctly. The service overall is generally pretty good. 

In most cases the store is clean except, when they are slammed unable to get to the lobby for cleaning. 

Overall, I would recommend this Del Taco location
