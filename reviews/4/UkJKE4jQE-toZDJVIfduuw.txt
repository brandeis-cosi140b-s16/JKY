Started going here when it first opened up.  There are not many places we can go out here in Grand ole Buckeye.  We've had some good and some not so good experiances.  But if you want a lot of food at a good price..Why not.  We usually always get the Chimichunga for my husband and toquito's which my husband scarfs down. Although I was disappointed to see about a year ago that they don't use home made guac anymore. Looks and tastes like store bought :( 
I have had a variety of foods and they have all been good. Love the chips..but not the salsa as they only have PicoDeGallo or a really runny what looks like sauce not Salsa.  
But in all..We will continue to eat here when were hungry.
