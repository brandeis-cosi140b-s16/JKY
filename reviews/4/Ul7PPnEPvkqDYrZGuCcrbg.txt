We went here for the $2 tacos and were pleasantly surprised at how delicious they were! We ended up going back the next day for more!

Food was good and who can beat $2?!?! Definitely get the shredded beef and not the chicken (the chicken was just kind of bland).

The first day the service was terrible, disorganized and we seemed to be at an invisible table. Also, the ice tea was like $4. For iced tea? Ridiculous. The next day the service was MUCH better.

Great place for a cheap snack!
