I've driven past this place several times and thought it was an abandoned building.  I work in this area and know it's a real dicey neighborhood, so you can imagine my surprise when the V.P. of the company I work for invited me to eat here with him.  I was surprised to find the inside had a nice ambiance.  It felt like everyone was having a business lunch, very career trendy.  The food wasn't bad either and the service was excellent.
