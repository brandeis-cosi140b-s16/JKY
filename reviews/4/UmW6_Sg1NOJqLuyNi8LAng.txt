Good Times! We were staying at the Monte Carlo and would pass Diablo's whenever we headed out to the strip. We dropped in for an afternoon drink and to catch the game. For happy hour they spin a wheel every 30 minutes and whatever the needle lands on is the happy hour special - mostly $3 or $5 dollar shots. As my bf said: there is something very exciting and dangerous about drinking at a place called Diablo's.
