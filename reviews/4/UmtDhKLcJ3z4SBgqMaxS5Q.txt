I had a salad. Not really a way to rate a Mexican Food restaurant. So why the 4 stars? 
This is the second time I have been here the last time was several years ago when we were in the area. I live in Peoria and do not get in this part of town often. 
If I lived in the area I would come here more often. 
This is one of the places that is small and cozy and comfortable. You feel at home. The servers and manager made sure we were well taken care of. 
I will make it a priority if I am in the area to stop by.
