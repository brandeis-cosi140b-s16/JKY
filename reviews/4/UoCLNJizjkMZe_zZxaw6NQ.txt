My girlfriends and I stumbled upon this place with a groupon deal. Even though the walk was far from the MGM hotel, it was so worth it!! I ordered an enchilada, and it tasted like heaven! The bartender was extremely friendly. We sat at the bar because we didn't want to wait for a table. I ordered a blended margarita which was the best I ever had. I just remembered I had an awesome experience at this place. I have two more trips to Vegas this year, and will make sure to stop by again.
