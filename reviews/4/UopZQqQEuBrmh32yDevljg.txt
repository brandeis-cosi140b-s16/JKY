Took the wife and kids out for dinner and stumbled upon this place. There was limited seating in the dining room because of remodeling. Our waiter was friendly as was the General Manager, Bernie. The kids had a cheese crisp and a quesadilla, and based on how quickly the food disappeared it must have been good. My wife had the Carne Asada quesadilla and loved it. I had the Mexican pizza with grilled chicken and the green sauce. I have no complaints and the portions were comparable to the prices. I would like to commend the young boy in charge of the chips, salsa and drinks. He stopped by our table on a consistent basis to see if we needed any refills or more chips and salsa. Can't wait to go back after the remodel is done and see what the full menu looks like.
