I get the same thing every time I eat here, Carne Asada chimi, they make it just how I like it. They have churro's but I wish they had the fruit filled ones that would make a nice finish to my meal. I usually eat here for lunch from time to time they are quick and my food is always made correctly. My husband orders a variety of things and has always been happy with his choices from California burrito or the carne asada plate. The restaurant is always clean and so are the bathroom which for a lot of semi fast food places with a lot of traffic is not. There is a language barrier because most of the ladies that work in there know not a lot of English so the customer service is not bad but it's minimal communication with them. They are reasonably priced and huge portions. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a change from del taco and taco bell.
