Manuel's has always been a safe, solid choice for Mexican food. It has always done the job. I haven't been in for a couple years so when I went last night, I was pleased that not much has changed.

We started out with the Texas margaritas. They are HUGE. Delicious and worth every cent. But POTENT. I have a high alcohol tolerance, especially when it comes to tequila, but my husband couldn't even finish his because he has a low tolerance for tequila and he was the DD. So I finished his. :)

Salsa and chips were good. Salsa was very fresh tasting. I wish the chips were hotter and crispier. They tasted like the generic chips you buy at the store.

My husband ordered the 3 amigos enchilada plate. He said it was really good. I tasted the spinach enchilada that came with the plate, and I concur that it was really tasty.

I had the chili relleno plate which I'm still scratching my head over. I must have had over a million chili rellenos in my life but never one like this. The chili wasn't dipped in a batter, it was just wrapped in egg. I was disappointed by this dish. I know the that the batter for chili rellenos contains mostly egg, but it's not pure egg. It has a little flour, milk, and sometimes baking powder to make it fluffy. The sauce that covered it wasn't very saucy. It was green chilis and onion basically. The whole thing wasn't terrible, just disappointing. Beans and rice were still delish though.

I am still rounding up to 4 stars because everything else I have had at Manuels has been great. Cheese enchiladas, their gigantic cheese crisps... all delicious and satisfying. And their service is always excellent. I will just avoid the chili relleno from now on.
