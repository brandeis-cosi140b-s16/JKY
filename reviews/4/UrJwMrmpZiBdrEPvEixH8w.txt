We stopped by after the Giants spring training opener and it was dead, but they had penny drinks if you had a Giants ticket and the sun was shining. We played some bean-bag toss and kinda had the whole place to ourselves which was alright for a drink. Then we moved on. Looks like a nice place to go when the weather heats up.
