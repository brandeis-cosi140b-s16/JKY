My woman and I came to this Cabo Wabo one afternoon and I had been wanting to check it out being a Sammy Hagar Fan and Mostly VH fan so I was pretty stoked.  We were able to sit on the patio rail which is the best dining seat aside from Bubba Gumps Patio seat so far in Vegas.... ( on the Strip I haven't had the pleasure of too many balcony Seat's thus far,  Still to come)  The patio is right across the street from the Belagio hence you get to check out the Water show (which is awesome) every 1/2 hour.  Also it's kinda the heart of the strip so People watching is pretty cool as well.  We were sat and waited on in plenty good time.  Everyone was very nice but quick.  I ordered Queso Fondido Con Chorizo and no alcohol since we don't drink although that part of the place looked like it did exceptionally well.  The Queso was super donkey good.... I loved that more than anything.  I would go back for that alone... even above the Patio Rail seating.  We ordered the Combo 2 (Gulf Shrimp & Grilled Top Sirloin) Fajita's.  They were good not the best but the accoutrements (grilled onions, peppers, cheese, Sour Cream & Such)  were awesome that were with them... The steak was just a tad tough and since the Shrimp while large were Jumbo Gulf Shrimp they were not plentiful however, all the same it was an above average Fajita dish.  All in All after touring the rest of the restaurant (A.K.A visit to the local johns and the Big Red Wall of hanging Photo's of Sammy and Friends) I thought it was an awesome place to eat and hang... I will return and not soon enough most likely.  I will however most likely get Taco's next time since those are my favorite Mex food. Oh, and as to why I gave it 4 Stars instead of 5 the music was very loud and I play and sing rock music (so, that is to say I love loud music) and the music here was super loud almost too much to even hear the sever.   ~Vegas Rob!
