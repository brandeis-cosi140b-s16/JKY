They changed the recipes for some of the items at this chain. I usually just get the Healthmex burrito here if I visit. The chicken is always white and lean and it comes out to $7.03, so bring a few pennies with you. It just has chicken, black beans, rice and some kind of sauce on the burrito. Always free chips. This location has a decent patio out front, but the tables are too close together in some instances. Salsa bar could use a new recipe as these same four salsa's have been gracing the bar since ten years ago. Only the green and the chipotle are worth eating and the onions have way too much parsley or cilantro - they should separate the items. Still, it's always a good guaranteed, know what your getting kind of place.
