Vaqueros is ostensibly part of a chain, since I have seen them around other places. But make no mistake -- the people cooking here have a brand of their own that Casa Grande locals may recognize.

Vaqueros is fairly new. When I pass it in the morning, there are always people in the drive-through. I finally got curious enough to stop by for dinner take-out. They are indeed open from 5 am to midnight most days, serving up breakfast burritos in the morning hours.

It didn't take long looking at the menu to recognize that it is almost identical to the menu of a long-time hidden secret in Casa Grande that closed last year, Ruperto's. I had heard that the Ruperto's staff had opened or was opening a new restaurant, and this appears to be it. Many of the same dishes Ruperto's was known for appear on the menu at Vaqueros. The most distinct is the 3 rolled tacos with guacamole. The guacamole is unique and extremely good -- it is a favorite of my daughter's and she recognized it at once as being the same as Ruperto's. We also ordered carne asada tacos, and a burrito and enchilada combo -- all were great. The rice is awesome, but the refried beans could use a little work.

All in all, a great and quick stop on Pinal, which has a dearth of good restaurants. Feed your family of 4 for under $20.
