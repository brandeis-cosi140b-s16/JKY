After a morning of volunteering with one of my girlfriends, we decided to come here because its her favorite place and I wanted to see what this place was all about.

I really liked the interior.  It was decorated nicely and had a nice tropical feel to it.  They have colorful lights on the patios, and the walls are painted in a variety of different colors.  Its very festive in here!

We were seated immediately and our service was wonderful.  Drink refills were a bit on the slow side, BUT the service was personable and good overall.

I went with an appitizer becuase even though I was hungry, they seem to have larger portioned dishes here, and didnt want to be overwhelmed with an enormous about of food.  The main entrees tend to run about $10 on average, and they have appitizers with smaller portions for a little bit less.  Being that I was starving, but not wanting a humungous portion I couldnt finish, I stuck with the appitizer.

Food was tasty, and we also were given chips and 2 types of salsa dips to go with them.  Chips were warm and tasty as well.  You can also sit out and eat on the patio, but we opted to sit inside and enjoy the AC.

I would gladly return here for happy hour, dinner with friends or dates for that matter.
