A year later, I'm back at Ajo Al's and still like it just as much as last time.  It's a little heavy on the salt, but whatever.   The steak Chuy's Chimi was awesome, not overcooked.  The waitress made sure to let me know it's covered in green sauce, and substituting red wasn't a problem.  

The service was great - never had to ask for a refill, the chip bowl never went empty.

Delicious, reliable, what more do you want?
