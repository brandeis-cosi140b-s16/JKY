This is NOT gourmet Mexican food.  This is a good, down-home greasy cheap joint with yummy Mexican cheap eats.  Decor is as basic as it gets, but service is awesome and they aren't skimpy with the cheese!!  Best of all-it's open 24 hours..  Great after a night out, and it won't drain your wallet.  These are all over the place in Las Vegas.  You either love Roberto's or hate it, but it's worth a try.
