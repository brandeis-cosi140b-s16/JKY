I ordered the Land of Enchantment plate deciding that the pecan grill might satisfy my cravings for a properly grilled steak.  I was very happy with the proteins, the prawns and steak were both cooked very well, and were both seasoned expertly.  My only real issue with the meal was that the potatoes were ice cold and that the vegetables seemed very out of place, almost tossed haphazardly on the plate to complete the dish.  My plate also felt very cold, so I imagine the timings just weren't right in the kitchen.  The service was excellent though, and the atmosphere of the place was great.
