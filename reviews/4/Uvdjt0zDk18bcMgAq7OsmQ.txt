Deep within the labyrinth of a casino, amongst the lewd smells of cigarettes and desperation lays a surprisingly tasty Mexican food restaurant! Yes, Cabo is so out of place amongst the fast food restaurants, the buffets and the other gaudy dining options in this casino, but it's still worth a look-see.  

Went here on a Sunday, wasn't that packed compared to the obscene lines at the buffet in Boulder Station. The service was remarkably slow. A bartender after a good 5 mins of us waiting for a hostess decided to seat us out of pity. It took another 10 or so mins for the waitress to come over to give us menus and tell us about the salsa bar. 
Now the salsa bar is a true pearl. I really enjoyed the black bean dip! My lawd it was tasty especially when you add in raw onions....!! The salsa bar contained different cheese, bean and other salsa dips all waiting for you to enjoy while your food is being prepared. Of course I would recommend the black bean dip as it was delightful on the buds and even more charming as it traveled down my gullet...

For my entr√©e I choose the Shrimp Tacos (grilled shrimp, avocado, cabbage, salsa blanca with corn tortillas) and it was paired with rice and black beans. The tacos were marvelous. Nice plump shrimp that was well seasoned, very flavorful. I event liked the cabbage over lettuce shreds as it really added to the texture of the entire dish. It was pretty darn tasty for its price point and for it to be our second choice dining option. 
We were able to pay with our hotel credits so we didn't have to worry about the bill but for 3 entrees it was less than $50 so that's reasonable. 

Besides the lackluster service, this place was pleasant! Would recommend esp if you are staying in the hotel.
