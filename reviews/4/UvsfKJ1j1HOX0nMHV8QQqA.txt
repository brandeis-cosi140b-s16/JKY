Not the greatest Mexican food in the valley but DEFINITELY not the worst!

This is what I can compare to comfort food.  The service is great and the chips and salsa are pretty damn tasty!

There is a lot of cheese, of which I ask them to go light on and pretty Sonoran inspired.  

Wednesdays is all you can eat tacos and enchiladas.  Grab a beer and enjoy the laughs!
