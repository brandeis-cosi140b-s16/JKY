where to begin with this place?  located in the heart of downtown Gilbert, this place has retro written all over it.  everything from the sign to the decor has a mid century modern meets a surf side grub joint style to it.  walking in i was really amused with the place so i knew i would be in for a good time.  

on this visit i only came for some beers and sadly did not get to try any of the food other than the chips and salsa which were quite tasty.  The beer selection was pretty decent with a large collection of Mexican beers.  i was happy they had my favorite which is Victoria.  Although I did not taste, the fish tacos looked pretty scrumptious as well.  

downtown Gilbert is really booming and if you're looking for a fun festive atmosphere this place is it.
