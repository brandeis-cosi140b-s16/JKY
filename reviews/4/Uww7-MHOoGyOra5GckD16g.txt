Food is amazing!!!!! If you like fresh mexican food this is the place for you.  They believe in sustainably-raised products, where all of their beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, and fish originate from carefully-selected farms in the U.S. and are free from antibiotics, pesticides, and steroids. Or so said their website, and i believe it.  I always get their tostada salad and it is so fresh and full of goodness that i always ask them not to add the dressing.  The service is JUST okay... I do takeaway but have sat down twice and felt like I was inconveniencing them.  As far as service goes they aren't the worst but they are the best.  Like i said i loved the fresh food.  My friend said the tacos were greasy but she is a bit of a debbie downer so I take it with a grain of salt. 
Do note they are in the Sapphire Gentlemen's Club parking lot.  there entrance is in the same building just a couple feet away :)
