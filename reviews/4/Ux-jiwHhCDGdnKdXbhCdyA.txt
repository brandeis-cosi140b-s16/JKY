Thankful that this location is open and close by.  The burritos and the chicken salad is what we usually get and it's just perfect for satisfying that hunger.  Watching them cook the food is always fun for me to watch, but on top of it..the food is very good..the chicken is seasoned perfect and very juicy..must try
