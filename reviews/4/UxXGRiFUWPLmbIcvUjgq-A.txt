We go to El Pastor a lot.  We like the chips, we like the salsa, we like the 2 dollar dos equis pints, and we like the atmosphere, which is not too clean and not too dirty, but just right.  (The only thing that we miss is a tv playing spanish language soaps).  

I almost invariable get tacos, with el pastor as the meat.  $1.75 each.  Typical taco.  Corn torilla.  Three will fill you up. Comes with onion and cilantro and lime wedges.  

My favorite item on the menu is the shrimp soup.  For $8.00 you get a piping hot bowl of shrimp (probably like 10-12) in a spicy shrimp flavored broth.  Make sure to order the shrimp whole, heads, shells, and legs and all.  Sure, it's messy eating them, but the shrimp remains tender and juicy, and you can also "suck the head," which sounds bad, but really, it's delicious.
