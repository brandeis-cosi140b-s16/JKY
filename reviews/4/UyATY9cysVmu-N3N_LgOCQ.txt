Caramba  is our favorite Mexican restaurant in Surprise. The food is fast, fresh and delicious. We enjoy their burritos, tacos, enchiladas, rice, beans, salsas, tamales, and chorizo dishes as well as their friendly service.

The only down side to Caramba is they don't open early enough. Their breakfast menu is robust, but who wants to wait until 10am for one of their mouthwatering burritos or egg dishes?
