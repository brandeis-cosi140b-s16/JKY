A panaderia?  I don't really think so.  Oh, they've got some Tres Leche cake by the counter, but I hardly think this qualifies as a bakery (go to La Concha further down on Fish Hatchery).  But this is a great place for a real Mexican meal.  Not fancy, but the kind you'd find on the street anywhere in Mexico City.  Tacos, other stuff, its good, its fresh and its pretty cheap.
