You take a long beautiful stroll to enter the restaurant and pass by the singing dancing Christmas Tree to get you in the spirit ( if you come during the Christmas Season ) . The tree was a light show with Christmas tunes .

We started with house margaritas they were good and large and we shared a plain queso fundido . The fundido was a lot of melted cheese with butter and came with three warmed flour tortillas . Fundido is very filling and might be best for a group of people .

My waiter said the very best dish that La Hacienda does with out a doubt is the Braised Beef Short Rib so I ordered it and he was right ! The rib was flavorful and nicely crusted , the vegetable escabeche on top cut the richness of the beef and the chile guava sauce was delicious . Creama potato puree completes the meal with all the flavors in harmony . The portion is also large the rib is a double rib and my leftovers made two lunches . (this dish alone was five stars)

My husband had the slow roasted pork shoulder it came with roasted corn puree and pumpkin seed sauce and said it was very good .

We had no problems using our preferred restaurant card and received one dinner for free . Service was professional and way above average making our visit a 4.5 stars .
