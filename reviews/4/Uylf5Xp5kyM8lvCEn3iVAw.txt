As a gm of a restaurant in Tempe, the restroom was clean and the overall restaurant was as well. Friendly and quick service. It was pretty busy with their lunch rush but they were working as a team and had a smile. Keep it up ladies and gentlemen.
My only reason for 4 stars is there was no paper towels in restroom and the beverage counter was a little messy. Other than that, probably the best Taco Bell in Phoenix.
