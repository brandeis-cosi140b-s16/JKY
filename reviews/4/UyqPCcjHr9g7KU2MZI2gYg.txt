It's a standard taco bell. But, I have to say that the employees here are super friendly. They put up with a lot of noise and multiple orders from us - all with a smile. Our orders were done correctly. The food was standard taco bell fare - nothing to write home about, but it will do. I think this is as good as it gets for a taco bell.
