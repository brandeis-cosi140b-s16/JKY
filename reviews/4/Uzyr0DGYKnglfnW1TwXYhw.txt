Had a great lunch there yesterday. It's in the Luxor. The red salsa was way too salty, but everything else was really tasty. We had the combo enchiladas. One Cheese, One Chicken and One Beef. All 3 were great. Also, had the tortilla soup. I give it a 6.5. Not bad, but not great. Service was excellent. Food came quickly. The green salsa was great too.
