After hearing about it on Yelp, my curiosity got me and I made a run down to Lake Mead. Sure enough, there it was sitting pretty right by Lee's Liquors. Ron, the owner, was just setting up. We chatted for a little while he was setting up. Very nice guy. I gave him my order: 2 beef tacos, 2 chicken tacos, 1 beef burrito, 1 chicken burrito, 2 orders of fries and 2 orders of crazy dough. By the way, this was for me and my husband.   

As Ron was working on my order, Kenny Lee walked up into the truck, placed him order and chatted for a little bit as well. He was having a burrito. He was telling me how addicting they were. Ron finished up my order and my husband and I rushed home to try our bounty. Wow! Great mix of flavors! And the crazy dough! I will definitely be making a return trip. In fact, I have an appt just down the road from there on Wesnesday. Guess what I'll be having for lunch!
