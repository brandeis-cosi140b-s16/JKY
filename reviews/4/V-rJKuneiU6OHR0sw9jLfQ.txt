Very well managed.  On the better end of the chain.  9 times out of 10 GREAT, efficient, friendly, service.

Can't beat fish taco Tuesday's $1.25 per taco.  

Excellent fresh salsa options.  I rotate between the hot salsa and chipotle, add some fresh onions and chives.  Food always well prepared.  Great for take out they always hook it up fast and fresh.

Dining in they have bottles of beer on ice.  Decent indoor/outdoor seating.  Kept clean enough.
