Excellent green chili burro, but not the most customer friendly place. The girl taking my order wasn't particularly friendly but that's OK. I asked how long the wait would be and she said not long. I asked again in minutes, and she repeated, not long. I recommend take out as the dining area reminded me of a prison cafeteria. Twenty minutes later I got my burro and it was worth it. A tiny bit spicy but that's how I like it.
