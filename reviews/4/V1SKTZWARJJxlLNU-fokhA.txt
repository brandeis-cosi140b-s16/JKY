The place is small with a diner feel to it. The waitress Mayra was very friendly and recommended the enchiladas. I am not usually a fan of the enchilada - but she was so enthusiastic I ordered them. I was not disappointed!  The shredded beef was very favorable, tasted like pot roast. The cheese enchilada was delicious!  The sauce was good, salsa is homemade and very good with a little bit of a kick. We are glad we stopped here!
