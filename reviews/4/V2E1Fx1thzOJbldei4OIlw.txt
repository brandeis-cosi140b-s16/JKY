Ate here today and about a month ago. Both times yummy. Customer service is a 2-3 stars. But, whatever. I lovvvvvvvvvvvvve their fresh toppings here. They have just the right mixture of lettuce, tomato, and cheese. Last time I got a bean tostada and chicken taco plate. Delish. Today, I had the chicken salad in a bowl (normally comes in a tortilla shell). It was so good! It was lots of lettuce with grilled cubed chicken, topped with refried beans, cheese, olives, tomatoes, and green onions. It was really refreshing and fresh. Again, the customer service could be A LOT better, but so far the food has made me want to come back anyway.
