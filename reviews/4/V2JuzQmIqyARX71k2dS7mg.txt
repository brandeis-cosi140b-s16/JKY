I'm giving 4 stars for my carne asada nachos they were huge & the carne asada was so good. My husband loved his tacos AL pastor. I'm giving 2 stars for my kids quesadilla & rolled tacos had a lot better other places. The quesadilla was a single tortilla folded over not the 2 on top of each other that were used to and the cheese was different.. Also 2 stars for "this place looks dirty" my 9 year Olds exact words. It needs so updating. It just looks old and dirty. Not what you want to be looking at when your eating.  All in all I was satisfied with my food. I've been craving carne asada nachos & it hit the spot.
