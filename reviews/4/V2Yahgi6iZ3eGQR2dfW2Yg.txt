This is the better of the two locations,  the west side started skimping on the meat so we switched to this one.  Their chicken adobado is amazing, the salsa bar is possibly the greatest thing you'll ever put in your mouth, they have a decent beer selection, and all you can eat homemade chips.  Everything is fresh and you get a lot of food for the money. I eat there almost weekly and have never had a bad experience.

Also, if you live near them they deliver now, so you don't even have to make that hellacious drive down Country Club :)
