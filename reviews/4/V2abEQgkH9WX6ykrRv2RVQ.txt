If you are a carb person, come here to try their flour tortillas. The tortillas are extremely QQ (what Taiwanese people call soft and chewy). To really take full advantage of their amazing tortillas I'd either order a burrito or their special combos which comes with a warm tortilla. 

Go for the meat in the burritos. We ordered a fish, which was delicious, but it was a bit more breading than I wanted. Unfortunately, they were out of the adobada, so we ordered the carnitas taco instead. This was a good choice on our part. Very fresh and meaty. Much better than the fish. I wish we ordered this as a burrito instead of the taco.

For the combination plate, I tried the #8 chorizo plate. The mixture of eggs and potatoes was delicious, but there wasn't much chorizo. The tortilla that comes with the combo is even more delicious than the one they use to wrap the burrito, probably because they warm it up for you. I can't get over how QQ that tortilla was.

If I lived here, would definitely frequent this place often for lunch. And everything is so cheap and in large quantities!
