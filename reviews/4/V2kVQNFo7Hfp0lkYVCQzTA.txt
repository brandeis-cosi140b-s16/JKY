I've had a burrito and super nachos.  Everything very good and tasty.  The breakfast burrito is really good-the #5 Burrito Special eggs, ham, bacon, hash browns and cheese.  The food is great but I have to deduct a star b/c the food takes forever to be ready. Our neighbor recommended this place to us.
