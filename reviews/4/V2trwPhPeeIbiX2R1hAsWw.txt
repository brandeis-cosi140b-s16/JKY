This was the second time my husband and I have ate here.  They gave us a coupon allowing us to get 2 for 1 drinks.  There food is good and I would go back again.  They have happy hour and they spin a wheel so the drinks are always changing on the half hour and hour.  

If you like spicy food this is the place for you, everything is more spicy than other places.  It is a nice place to sit down for a rest and eat good food.  

We will go there again when we visit, we had fast and friendly service.  Hope this helps.
