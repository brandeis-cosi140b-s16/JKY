Good place for a quick taco or two and nothing is too expensive. The kids menu is great and it's also nice to sit, it's not exactly a sit down restaurant but it's also not fast food. However The Sandbar at desert ridge is more or a sit down type of place and they have a great bar! Highly recommend if you like "Mexican grill" type of food.
