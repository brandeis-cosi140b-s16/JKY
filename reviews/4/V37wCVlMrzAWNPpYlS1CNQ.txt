Yum-E!!! I very much enjoyed my carne asada burrito... FULL of carne asada!  Usually when I order a carne asada burrito it's falling apart and I can't put it down without risking having to re-wrap whatever's left of the devastating carne avalanche.  

The grilled asada tastes really fresh & there are no beans in this particular burrito which is A-OK with me.  I don't mind the beans, but faustos does an excellent job puttin the right amount  of ingredients to compliment and not overwhelm the burrito.  

I've also had the carne asada fries which is plenty for maybe 2-3 ppl. 

I had takeout-  so I didn't actually eat here, but when I went to pick up my food it was still fresh and warm.  It's a small place that has about maybe 6-8 booths good for 4 ppl.  


I've yet to try more from this place.. but per my bffs Michelle E's review... I think i'll be trying the chimichangas someday.  

I'll be back Fausto's!
