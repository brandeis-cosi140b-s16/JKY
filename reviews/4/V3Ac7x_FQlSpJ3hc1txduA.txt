The food here is very good and I really like the environment. I went with my dad for lunch and we ordered a couple of margaritas. I am not necessarily a margarita fan but I was in the mood and these were tasty. Simple and good. We ordered some of the bean dip as an appetizer which was excellent. It is such a SIMPLE appetizer but it was perfect. It had melted cheese and pico on top. I mixed a little salsa in it and man, it was good.

For entrees we ordered a couple of tacos, taquitos, and a chile relleno. Everything was delicious. Well seasoned. One of the best rellenos we have ever had. 

The only possible complaint I have is on the service. It was a little slow and we had two different servers. I don't know if they were trying to help one another out or what, but they would cross over on service. For example: both of them asked us at different times if we were finished and ready for our bill. But other than this one small issue, I was happy. I am definitely going back.
