Went here during our trip to Vegas to meet "@Mr.ArturoTrejo" and he was there serving, making drinks, and taking orders! It was our first time and we were pleasantly surprised. Food was nice and hot, tasty, and filling. We got a little of everything and we all enjoyed it. The drinks were delicious too, even the spinach drink. Arturo brought us our drinks and gladly chatted with us when we mentioned we watched his youtube videos. He was super nice! Glad we came!
