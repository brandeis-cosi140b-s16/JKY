Similar to a chipotle, but with additional options. 
I tried the Mango Salsa Taco Salad (chicken). Very delicious. The flavor was balanced very well. 

I would return here again. Only place outside of a sit down restaurant I am aware of where you can get a taco salad with the shell. And mango salsa...love it!
