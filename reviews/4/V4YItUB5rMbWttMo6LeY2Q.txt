I found this place on yelp and since it received good reviews decided to try it out. 

Right when you walk in you see the cash register and the bright yellow menu to your right. About 20 seats and 6 tables, a salad bar like Roberto's. 

The menu is a lot like Roberto's but a few items that are different. They serve breakfast, so hey all you breakfast people here's a place to try. Now down to the food...I ordered the chimichanga which is a deep fried burrito. It was delicious! It wasn't watery like some other places because of the grease or meat. When I cut it in half no grease or water was filling my plate so that's a plus. 

I would totally come back to this place since I want to try the churros and some other things on the menu.
