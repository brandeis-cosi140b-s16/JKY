This would be five stars if I wasn't gnawed by no-seeums while seated inside near a window. But I love the wood fire smell from the parilla.  This re-purposed brick house is charming, despite the reluctance of the desert to really vacate the premises.

I had a delicious, dark green, tender poblano in white sauce.  It was filled with mixed white and dark meat chicken and queso.  Quak was chunked and distinctly spiced with lime on a too-tall bed of shredded lettuce. 

Service is a little spacey, but definitely accommodating. Parking is really easy.
