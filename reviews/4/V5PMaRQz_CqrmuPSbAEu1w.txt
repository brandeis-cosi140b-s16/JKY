Was recommended this place by a friend and finally decided to try it out...was so happy I did! The salsa served with chips was great and I ordered the chicken enchilada and beef taco that also came with rice and beans. The taco was perfect as was the enchilada. The rice and beans were average and pretty much the standard fare at a mexican joint. The restaurant was clean and the waitress was really nice and accommodating. Will totally be coming back, totally.
