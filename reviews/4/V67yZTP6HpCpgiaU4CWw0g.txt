We are in Phoenix for New Year's and visited at 2 in the afternoon on New Year's Day. Place was mostly empty and we waited a bit for a server to take drink orders. They brought out salsa and a small bowl of shrimp ceviche which was very good so we ordered a large fish ceviche. Also had cheese and chicken enchiladas which were good but nothing special, fish fillet stuffed with seafood was fantastic, beef burrito mostly full of beef and very good as previous reviewer noted and shrimp empanadas. 

Overall the ceviche was outstanding along with the fish fillet while the empanadas had just chopped shrimp with no other seasoning or flavor inside and what appears to be a jalapeño purée with some tang to it. Despite slow service on this visit would highly recommend based on the stellar quality of seafood alone and other items were up to par in my opinion.  

Additionally, the building and patio area take the ambiance to a whole different level. On this cool sunny afternoon it felt like we were enjoying a nice meal in a small town in Mexico.
