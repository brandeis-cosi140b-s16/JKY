I've been wanting to try this place... but it's hard when postino's is best door! It was just me and my kiddo (2) and we enjoyed lunch on the patio. Service was great, they seemed to work as a team, it did take my burrito a little longer than expected (carne asada & other deliciousness). I just got the kiddo a said of beans (they were different, topped with some sort of oil??), had I realized they were $4 I would have gone with the $5 kids meal but I didn't think he would eat it all (entree, side & drink - smoking kids meal deal!). I'll bring the husband and six year old next time and give a margarita a try!
