There is really an insane amount of Roberto's Taco Shops in the Vegas area but for how good this one was, despite being adjoined to a gas station I can see why. Robertos managaes to capture the taste of a local taqueria and propagate it for mass convenience. It's the sort of delicious, greasy, and abundant meal that makes taquerias the ultimate comfort food to me.

FYI the tacos are a little ridiculous. But in a good way. They're huge and have a ton of guac on them. My recc: Al pastor all day baby
