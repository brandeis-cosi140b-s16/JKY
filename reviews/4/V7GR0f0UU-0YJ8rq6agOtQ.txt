Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! Dining at Carefree Station was an unexpected excellent surprise. We came here with family this past weekend and from the service to the food to the ambiance, everything exceeded our expectations. The staff was extremely nice and very helpful. When asked, they offered their suggestions on what was a must have, etc. The owner greeted our table and told us we "must" get the cheesecake for dessert- boy was she right. Even the chef came out to say hello and see how our meal was! This was such a nice touch to an already wonderful meal. 

All seven of us loved our meals. The boys got the steak and couldn't stop raving- saying that even after eating half of it, they still craved more. I had the halibut special with "forbidden rice." OMG, this is a dish I won't soon forget. The asparagus "chop sticks" were a nice and extremely tasty touch. The cheesecake for dessert was unbelievable, however we didn't care for the lava dessert- too much alcohol and not enough cake, but alas, everything else rocked. 

I've lived in Phoenix for sometime, and live close to Carefree... I can't believe I had no idea about this gem. Now that I know, I can't wait to go back again and again and try more things on their extensive and interesting menu!
