So sorry to hear this Las Vegas Classic has closed. A piece of local history is gone, and with it a connection to the family that kept this eatery a place with heart for more than half a century.
To the owners, best wishes to a well-earned rest. My sympathy to all the loyal locals who will no longer be able to enjoy this special place.
