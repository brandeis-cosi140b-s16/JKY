Thanks Yelp.  I found this great little place because of the Yelp reviews.  
Could the guy working behind the counter be any friendlier?  I love going into a place where they are so proud of their food.  He was just beaming. :)
I went in just after the lunch rush and the seating area and bathroom was super clean.  
That's the time of day when you would expect it to be a bit messy.  
Flavors were fresh and homemade tasting.  
I got the punch card and I will be using it.
