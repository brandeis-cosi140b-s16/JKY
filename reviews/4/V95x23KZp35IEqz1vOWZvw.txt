Really good food at a decent price. The quality of their carne asada, their salsa bar and their ingredients are definitely a few notches above Roberto's or anything similar that I've tried in the area.

Really, my only complaint would be the size of my California burrito, it was kinda small, and the fact that it didn't have sour cream or guacamole.

I definitely think it's worth giving a try and especially if you're a fan of the usual fast food Mexican joints.
