This place is on my regular lunch rotation when meeting friends.  I usually get the Aunt Chilada's Special which is a green chili chimichanga, or the tacos pescado (fish tacos).  It is the only place I have ever had fedeo which is a Mexican spaghetti.    I like the food, and more importantly, my Chicana wife likes the food and she is picky about Mexican food.  This is not the cheapest place for good Mexican food, but it is a fun place to meet with friends.
