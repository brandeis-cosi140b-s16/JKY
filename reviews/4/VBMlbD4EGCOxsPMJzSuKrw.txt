The chips/salsa awesome. LOVE the seasoning on the chips. The margarita's AMAZING. 5 stars on that. I checked in on YELP with my smarty tarty phone and received a free queso. Delicious. I ordered a standard Burrito. Super yummy and cheesy.  There was an accident later that night with my left overs and I thought I might cry, I was really looking forward to eating those. Guess Ill just have to return! 

I would recommend this place to anyone that loves or even just likes Mexican food. 

The reason for 4 stars instead of 5... My friends were slightly put off by the location (aka they brought they're valuables inside with them) but I thought it was fine. The communication was slightly difficult because it seemed our waitress's English was borderline and my Spanish is muy malo. Also had a groupon which caused to be slightly problematic..
