So I Went plain jane today.. Got 2 braised beef enchiladas with green sauce and of course cheese : ) 
Tried the mashed potatoes this time. They most definitely should be on everyone's To-Eat List. Very creamy till the last drop.. Nom Nom
Portions are generous.. My 8 year old and I shared this... and were stuffed.
