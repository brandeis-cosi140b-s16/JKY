Hot salsa was a nice touch to start off our meal. It was fresh with great flavor and heat, complimented by fresh chips. A draft Modelo with wedge of lime paired nicely with the chicken fajita quesadilla we ordered. Quesadilla was cooked nicely but enchilada sauce gave the dish a gravy flavor we weren't crazy about. Waitress was great and very polite and helpful. Overall, a great little place in a town with not many options.
