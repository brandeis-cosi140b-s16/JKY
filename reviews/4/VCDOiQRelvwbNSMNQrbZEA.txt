Ok, so to all of those yelpers who give Chevy's a low rating because it's not "authentic"...? That's like giving Spam a bad review for not being "real meat".... Duh! We all know it's not authentic, but we're not going to Chevy's to eat authentic food, we're going there because it tastes good.

With that out of the way, I absolutely adore Chevy's. Their homemade tortillas are amazing, and everything I've ever had at Chevy's is delicious. 

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars, is just because the service can sometimes be a little "off". Other than that, I LOVE it.
