I saw a sign for Ellie's while driving down the road and my interest was peaked!  I LOVE fry bread and was happy to give Ellie's a chance.  My Husband, 2 children, and I went for dinner.  Both my Husband and I ordered the green chili and steak Fry Bread.  We ordered sides of rice and beans and a quesadilla for my son.  The portions were very large and very tasty!  I thought that the beans were great and the rice was pretty good.  The chip and salsa cart were great!  I loved the creamy jalapeno sauce that they had.  Everything was very flavorful.  For desert we had the Frybites which were lovely little nuggets of frybread.  The meals are definitely a diet buster but worth the calories!  We had a great meal and will definitely be back.
