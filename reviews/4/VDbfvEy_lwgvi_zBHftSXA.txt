Came here around noon on a Saturday...

4 stars for food n friendliness. Rib eye tacos are great! Food seems reasonably priced but the beers are 6 dollars. The Micheladas are 8.50.  Oof. That's super expensive, in my opinion. We'll come back to eat, then drink where the prices are much more reasonable.

Staff were extremely friendly and cannot emphasize that enough. The owner (i think) was super friendly and brought the chef out for us to answer our food questions. Place needs a lot more ambiente (ambience) though in order for people to feel like they want to hang out n drink, n eat, n drink more. The back of house had music n you.could hear them singing....Just.wish they'd bring that up front.
