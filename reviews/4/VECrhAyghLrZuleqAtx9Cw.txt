I love Taco Bell to death but today was not my lucky day.
I was planning to order on the Breakfast menu but I came just as they flipped the menu.  Breakfast is only served before 11 am and I would have been ok if only they didn't forget my order.
Stood in front of the cashier for 10 min. and proceeded to order:

----Fiesta Potatoes:  It was amazing and so worth $1.29.  I should have ordered more.

----Beefy 5 layer burrito:   Burrito was ok, not the best but satisfying.

----Deal A- Shredded Chicken Burrito with a medium drink and doritos:  My sister Ella(10) said she liked it but was disappointing that I didn't get her breakfast.

----Deal B- Double Decker Taco with a medium drink and dritos:  My other sister Johndra(13) loved it and wondered why she's never had it befor.

Cinnamon Twists and Cinnabon(4)-  where missing.

I only realized they forgot my order on the Twists and Cinnabon once I was at home but other than that, I love Taco Bell.
