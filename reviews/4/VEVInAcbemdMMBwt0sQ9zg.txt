Ok, I see Rubios, Baja Fresh, Caf√© De Rio, Robertos, and Chipotle all as competitors.  Rubios is tops of all of them and I'm not even a fish taco fan (which is their claim to fame).  The grilled gourmet tacos are fantastic.  I enjoy the grilled chicken and the shrimp tacos personally, but they have a broad menu with many choices and tasty salsas at the salsa bar.  For about the same price range of all of those listed, I think Rubios is the value for your money.
