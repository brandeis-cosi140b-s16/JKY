From what I saw, tables were clean and everyone was being tended to. The staff seemed pretty disorganized buy nice none the less.
Pretty disappointing that they wouldn't change the channel so that I could watch Arsenal playing Dortmund.
As for the food, I can't give much detail there. I only got some tortilla soup, which at least that was really good. Even had avocado's to top it off.

Only suggestion - get more organized and change the channels to big games
