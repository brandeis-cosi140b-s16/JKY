Great food and great for brunch ! you get  a complimentary mimosa with this which is awesome! Ryan is a great server we always ask to be seated in his section .. The only draw back is the inconsistency with their Bloody Mary drinks and micheladas... If Ryan is not making our drinks we are hesitant to order any because of this ...
