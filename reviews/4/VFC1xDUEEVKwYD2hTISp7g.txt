Lindo Michoacan is an intimate Mexican restaurant. They sport the description "gourmet Mexican cuisine," but it's not fusion, like Agave. They have mostly traditional dishes. 

The restaurant doesn't seat many parties, but the floor plan separated sections of the restaurant, making for in intimate setting, as do the booths with high backings and shallow seating. There's a bunch of Mexican decor on the walls, not tacky at all. 

Our waiter was warm and available. Between he and the buser, my water was always full. They started us off with chips y salsa y bean dip. 

I ordered the Filet Relleno ($20), a white fish stuffed with octopus and shrimp, deep fried, and smothered with Sarandeado sauce. The sauce was pretty much a spicy mayo. But mayo and white fish always wins. Wins! 

My mf got the Birria de Chivo ($16), goat cooked in a beer broth with chiles and spices, served with chopped raw onions, cilantro, and tortillas. It was really good. The broth is an intimidating magma-red, but it really wasn't that spicy. The goat meat was tender and tasty and very fatty ... but that's where the flava is. 

The prices were reasonable. 

I'll be back to try more.
