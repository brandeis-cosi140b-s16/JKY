We got there just in time to get a table, because within 30 minutes the place was packed!  The wait staff is made up of lots of young friendly girls & guys, the decor is fun and modern. I was there when it was colder but apparently they can roll up their garage doors for outdoor seating and air.  I had a mango margarita which was very tasty and a bit too strong for me. I then ordered the taquitos de pollo which were deliciously crunchy and topped with wonderful guacamole, craime fraiche and shredded lettuce. My friend had the pescado veracruz which she raved about, ie it was pretty spicy, so beware.

When all is said and done, I'd definitely go back to try other items on the menu as they all sounded delicious and it was very reasonable!
