Everyone has been raving about this place, and we couldn't wait to try it. Located off off the strip on Fremont Street across the street from the El Cortez Hotel, (We parked there!) we were surprised to find it relatively empty at 9pm. (It was a FREEZING night!) 

For this one, I'm going to go with listing the Pluses and Minuses: 

(+)
+ Easy Parking, across the street at the El Cortez
+ Roomy, good for groups
+ Cheeeep eats! Huge portions! 

(-) 
- What was the *DEAL* with them BLASTING the Eagles DVD and then after that the BRITNEY DVD on HIGH VOLUME at 9:30PM on a Monday night? I was running low on energy at that point in the evening and the volume was reaaaaaaly too high for me, cranky ol' lady. I hear they usually play salsa music, which is would have much preferred (not hatin' on the Eagles, actually.) 
- It was Freeeeezing in there- we sat near the window, perhaps that was why? Bring a sweater if you're coming here for dinner in winter-time. 
- The meals arrived ~20 minutes after we sat down, which is fine, but the plates were SUPER COLD to the touch... for those of you who know how much I love my food PIPING DANGEROUSLY HOT, this was a minus for me. 

Overall: a solid 3.75 stars, as the food was tasty tasty and it's a great deal on some Quality food. Service was friendly, and they let us sit around a few minutes after they closed, as we were just engaged in catching up.
