This place is GREAT! I live close enough to walk and it does make going anywhere else challenging.

It is very loud in the restaurant, so if you want to talk to the group you are going with, not the best option. The service lately has been very sporadic, but used to be great. 

Food is unbelievable, I"m a big fan of the blue corn enchiladas with shrimp (very spicy). Beer on tap is not the best, dos equis is only available in the bar not in the restaurant and the drinks are a bit pricey. 

Overall, if you havent been here you should! Make a reservation.
