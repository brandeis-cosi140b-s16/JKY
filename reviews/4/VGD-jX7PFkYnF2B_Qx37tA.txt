This was my first Korean-Chinese-Mexican fusion experience! and I loved it :D

I'll get right to the point- CHEAP, DELICIOUS, SIMPLE

I had the BUL-GOGI (BEEF) FRIED RICE BOWL ($6.99)- okay so the flavor was "eh" in fact, it didn't have much flavor, but for the price, they give you enough for lunch, dinner, and lunch again. I mean the portions were huge. I would get this plate again ONLY because if you pour a little Korean sauce on it it tastes delicious!

My BF had a taste of the Pork, Beef, Chicken, and Fish tacos- loaded with tasty toppings and only ($1.29 each) not bad. The final verdict was PORK tacos, YUM. The fish taco was tasty but they put sour cream when it might have tasted better with a creative fish sauce or "KoMex fusion" sauce of some sort- just sayin... 

MUST TRY the BULGogi Nacho Fries- OMG soooo goood! 

While you're waiting they give you a side of chips, salsa, and guacamole and no tap water for these peeps- it's bottled water all the way baby!

The restaurant itself is small and it seemed super busy during the lunch hour. The service was mediocre but the waitress was friendly and helpful for us first time customers :)
