This place is practically an institution in Mesa. It's been here for several decades... and it shows. The booth cushions are toast, the lighting is shabby and bare, it needs new un-green paint. However, this is fantastic Mexican food at a very reasonable price. Perfect for lunch or a casual dinner.

Don't let the neighborhood scare you off... it's perfectly safe.
