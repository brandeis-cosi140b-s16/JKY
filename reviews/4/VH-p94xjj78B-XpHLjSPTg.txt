Chinese + Mexican Fusion. Try the Jade Red Chicken and Emerald Chicken. Assemble a combo where you can choose any 2 meats and choose to eat them plain, in a burrito or quesadilla. Large space, free wi-fi, combos get a free cookie. If it's your first time, ask for an introduction, they will happily provide free samples of everything. Complex ordering and menu system is the only complaint...but the learning curve is worth it.
