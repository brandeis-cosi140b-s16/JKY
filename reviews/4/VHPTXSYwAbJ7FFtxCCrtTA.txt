Before coming to Verde I read many reviews and they all liked the food and atmosphere as did I but all said the service was lacking.
The BEST part of our dining experience was our server Matt.
He was just delightful and helpful and always there with water, etc but never in the
way.
He knew the menu as if he created each recipe.
My one star deduction was my white sangria.
I asked for NO ICE.
In the past when I get a glass of Sangria it is so ice filled the drink is literally water logged.
This was the exact opposite, so strong and nectar overloaded it was awful 
AND I suppose I got the amount that one gets prior to the ice which was about 1/5th of a small fishbowl sized goblet.
I thought it was embarrassing to serve it like that,  it should have put it in a smaller glass so I did not see the ridicuoulsy small amount of sangria I was actually getting.
That having been said, we had the booth in the back which was lovely, and private.
The restaurant was bustling with a great vibe.
The host sat us immediately and brought water and chips and dip which was delicious by the way.
The chips were warm, and the salsa verde was so fresh and good.
My meal as were all of our meals served like mini masterpieces.
It was spicey good, and plentiful.
I think the place would be fabulous in he daytime when the sun would be streaming
in.
The outside also looked inviting, but our evening was chilly so we did not experience it first hand.
Will DEF go again.
Will DEF ask for Matt as our server.
Will DEF not get the white sangria.
