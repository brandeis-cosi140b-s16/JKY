We probably wouldn't have stopped into this place for lunch if we didn't have a coupon from the entertainment book. It's in a virtually empty shopping center, which isn't exactly a prime location. And the outside of the building looks a little crazy with all the bright colors and flags. But they're trying really hard--they really want you to notice there's a restaurant there. 

You can smell the smoky mesquite from the parking lot. This place is a lot like a fast food restaurant. It was previously an El Pollo Loco, so there's a lot of that influence left over, but it's also very "mom and pop" inside. We started perusing the menu board, and the owner--a very friendly and helpful guy--asked if it was our first visit and offered us samples of the different meats. The flavors are FANTASTIC. You order your Mexican entrees assembly-line style like you would if you were at Chipotle or Subway, and the burgers come with combo options. The prices are great, and they have specials going every day. They have a huge salsa bar--it was fun to try all the different options on there. Everything was clean. We ordered Mexican and we were very pleased. We think we'll stop by again another time to try out the burgers. They've got to be great cooked on that mesquite grill. 

The friendliness of the staff made all the difference here. They great service by the employees made us want to come back and give more business to the local guy. All in all, it was a terrific fast lunchtime experience.
