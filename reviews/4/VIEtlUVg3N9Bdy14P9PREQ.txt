Haven't been to Taco Bell in a while and boy have I been missing out.  Check out the new sauces; besides Mild, Hot, and Fire, there are Verde and Fire-Roasted Peppers.  The Verde green sauce is a delicious touch to taco bell food, and the Fire-Roasted Peppers sauce was rockin'!  I covered my XXL Chalupa and enjoyed a Grilled Stuft Burrito like always.  Mmm...Mmm...Mmm...

Taco Bell + Delicious sauces = Heavenly food coma, and maybe some gas!
