Atmosphere was great, service was great, margaritas were great. I had the carne de fuego which was really good. The menu is a limited for vegatarian wife, but she was still happy with experience.

It's interesting to see all of 3 stars and below. There are a lot of really good restaurants in area and foodies in scottsdale, so I wonder if the bar is set ridicously high for some folks...
