I lived in South End for an embarrassingly long time before I ate at Phat Burrito, but now, I can't stay away. It's far too easy to hop off the light rail and swing by for dinner on my way home. 

I've probably had a quesadilla here once or twice, but mostly, I go for the burritos. They are giant, and filling without being overwhelming. If you're in the mood for dessert, I can personally attest to those brownies being well worth the $1.25 or whatever they cost. I'm not sure if they make them in-house but I've debated going to PB for the brownies alone.

Unfortunately, in the Noms At Night category, I'm going to have to give them a solid C. Closing at 9 does not match up with my dinnertime. I understand that small businesses can't always run the hours that larger chains do, and I won't take off a star for it, but they would get so much more of my money if they were open even just an hour later. 

Here's a tip, folks: if you're going to use their parking lot, be careful, especially at night. During my burrito stop a few nights ago, I walked out to view the aftermath of a pickup truck VS Volvo backing-up accident. I'll let you guess which car won. Maybe park across the street?
