I gave their old location a 1 star due to customer service.

The new location is like night and day compared to the old. Much better layout and customer service was great.

The food is fantastic!

My favorite is the crispy beef and chicken tacos,

Ariba used to be our favorite now it's the new Gecko Grill!!!

We usually call our order in so as to avoid the wait many others have complained about.
