Had to stop at this Food City one time and i saw this whole in the wall mexican taco shop. I saw a few mexicans inside and i always figured if you see people from mexico eating at a mexican place that it must be good. I was totally right, ive had their tacos (carne asada, head and tongue) and had gorditas, which are hand made and really delicious, the sauce selection rocks! the girl taking your order is very friendly, you can order in english or spanish if you prefer. Ive gone there three times already....cannot get enough of their delicious tacos!
