I eat a lot of cheap tacos so after reading some reviews of Los Gemelos, I naturally knew I needed to stop by.

I can only speak to the tacos, but they were definitely what I wanted. For $2.25 a pop, you really can't go wrong. I got one chorizo, one pastor, and one chicken. I was underwhelmed by the chorizo, which is a bummer but I think that's what would get a 5 star review--its such a ht or miss thing for me. The pastor was THE BEST. Ugh, if I could do it again, I wouldnt have messed around with anything else, except then I wouldn't have discovered how awesome the chicken was. It wasn't dry, as can sometimes be the case.

Maybe it was my extreme hunger accompanied by the oops-I-mixed-beer-and-liquor-last-night hangover but I definitely want to return.

Bonus points for the Spanish music videos!
