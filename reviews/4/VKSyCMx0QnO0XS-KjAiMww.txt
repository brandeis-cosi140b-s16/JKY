Love the Breakfast Burrito!   The best I've ever had.  I've also had the veggie burrito.  Love the black beans.  I go the one in Las Vegas and SLC.  I travel a lot.  Las Vegas has fantanic shrimp burritos and tacos in the sit-down part. Vegas is at C gates and SLC is in the B gates.  No alcohol at the one in SLC! No surpise.
