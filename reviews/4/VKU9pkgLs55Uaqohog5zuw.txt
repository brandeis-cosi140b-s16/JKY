I checked out Texicali during restaurant week. Honestly, it was a last resort option - a friend wanted to go somewhere for Queen's Feast and Texicali had availability. It did not seem like a great deal, in terms of Queen's Feast, but they offered a good bit of food, and also had their regular menu available, so we decided to check it out. The food was okay - nothing mind blowing but it was tasty. We had items that (supposedly) were being offered only during restaurant week, with the exception of the guacamole (pretty bland) and the queso fundido (really good). Satisfying is the word I would use to describe the food experience - I got my fill, and it wasn't horrible, but I could have taken or left it. The drinks were good - both in terms of quality and price. But what really sold me, and the reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 3,  was the service. Our waiter, and the guys who ran our food to us, were very friend, and funny; they really made it a great experience. Overall, I think this would be a great place to go if you are with a large group, and you want to have a good time with decent food and good drinks. The atmosphere, and food seemed perfectly suited for that sort of thing.
