There have been several other taco shops in this location over the past few years. None have fared well, obviously. We were happy to see that a Senor Taco was now in place and decided to give it a shot. We ordered a couple Diablo shrimp burritos, a quesadilla and a bean burrito. All were very good but the shrimp burritos are very obviously Senor Taco's claim to fame. Worth the trip.
