The food is really good here, and depending on the plate you get, you can get a lot of it. My boyfriend usually gets a ton of meat and stuff on his plates; the cheese enchiladas though, not so much. My friend gets a burrito with just beans and cheese, and it's a LOT, so I guess I will have to do that since the price is lower, and there is more food. Every meal comes with a drink, and it costs something like 50c to get a refill. 
The beans and rice are my favorite part though! So good! And the enchilada sauce is just right for me.
They also have Churros! Yay! Those are really great and crispy, with a soft center and oh so yummy!
