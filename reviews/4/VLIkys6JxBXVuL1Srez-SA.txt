Visited this place today after a couple of months. My first experience back in July was not that good and had not tried again. Heard they have a new manager and chef; wanted to give a try again. They surprised me by making awesome Veggie Tacos even though it was not on their menu! I would come back every Tuesday to this place for dollar Taco and $2 Mexican drafts. Bar tender Stephanie was awesome and didn't mind serving food and drinks in their spacious outdoor patio, where we enjoyed the beautiful valley fall weather while munching the tacos. Glad I gave them a second chance!
