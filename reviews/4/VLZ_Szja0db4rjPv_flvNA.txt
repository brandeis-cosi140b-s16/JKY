I went here Friday (9/20/13) with my father and we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. Hands down the best Mexican Seafood in Phoenix (granted there isn't much competition in the Mexican Seafood section).  I started off with a Shrimp Ceviche Tostada and I really could've just eaten three of those and called it a day. The shrimp was perfectly blanched and had just the perfect amount of acidity. The table chips aren't the best but beware the table salsa it has a nice kick to them.  For the entr√©e I had the Shrimp Diablo and with rice and beans. It was a shame how fast I gobbled down that shrimp. The sauce on the shrimp had a perfect balance of heat and cream. My dad had the Shrimp Veracruz and at first he started to pack left overs but ended up eating the leftovers it was so good! I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu! Another quick note: it is a little pricey especially considering the area, but what fresh seafood in ARIZONA isn't?
