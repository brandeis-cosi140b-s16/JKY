If you are looking for a good ol fashioned cheesey cheese burger.  You are in luck. Was happy to have stumbled upon this little gem of the east valley. 

Their chips and guacamole are off the chain and I have had a couple bites of their tacos and what a taste bud pleaser.  also take advantage of their delicious juices YUM. The staff is always been nice and when I am near that side of town I always look forward to stopping by. They have amazing hours.
