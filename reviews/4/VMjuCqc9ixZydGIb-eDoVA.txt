2 visits in 1 week and we had 2 very different experiences. 
1st visit was a Saturday afternoon. Very quiet not busy at all. But for some reason it literally took 15 minutes for our waitress to acknowledge us. No drinks. No chips. No hello. Once we did order our drinks and they were delivered we didn't see her again for 10 minutes. We ordered a cheese crisp appetizer and asked for hotter salsa. We wait and wait and wait. Can't even find her to ask for our appetizer. Our food comes. Delivered by the manager. We complain and he says he will make sure to remove the charge for the mix up. Well since the appetizer was never brought out we'd hope so. He brings our hot salsa and we get refills. So we eat our food and after the waiting and the lack of service, our food was surprisingly DELICIOUS! I ordered the shredded beef chimichanga with green sauce over it. OMG it was worth it. I did order the guacamole for $1 and it was literally a teaspoon serving. Seriously macayos? we ate and left. That was a 3 star visit due to the horrible service. 

2nd visit was a Friday afternoon. Great service. Ordered the same dish. NOT the same flavor. Not sure why or what happened but I didn't even finish it. It was way off on flavor. I will say we did order the appetizer of "green tamale bites" holy mother of God those were DELICIOUS! I told my sis next time that's all I'm getting. I was amazed at how scrumptious those little suckers were. Worth any wait, screw up, or service. 4 stars for the tamale bites and service. We will be back. It's worth it just speak up when we get a bad server.
