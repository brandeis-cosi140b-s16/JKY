If you've ever been to Globe, you've at least driven past some of the best Mexican food this side of the border.  I don't think Casa Reynoso is *quite* to that level, but it is as close as I have found here in the valley.  

The ambiance is old-school Mexican and the service is either great or average... but the food is consistently great.  Even a simple bean burro is fantastic.  I either get the bean burro enchilada style (topped with red sauce and cheese) or a combo with an enchilada, a chili relleno, beef taco, or some combination thereof.  Add an ice cold coke and their addicting chips and salsa and you have a recipe for a delicious meal!

All of that and your check is not going to break the bank- prices are super reasonable.  Speaking of the check, note that you'll take it up front to pay your bill!
