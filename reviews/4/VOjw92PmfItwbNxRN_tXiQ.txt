I have been riding by this place when visiting Safeway and finally decided to try it for breakfast after boycotting America's.  I was not disappointed.  The ham breakfast burrito I had was very filling.  My wife had the Chorizo breakfast burrito and it did not disappoint.  Most importantly we were greeted with a smile and warm welcome.

My second time here was the same.  I decided to try the Wednesday special, Arroz con Pollo and my wife had the chicken chimi.  We again were satisfied.  I hate to compare Chico's to a Filiberto's but it is similar in style but provides a better product and friendlier staff.

I am looking forward to spending happy hour here one day as it runs from 3 - 7pm and offers $2 imports and margarita specials.  If you have not checked Chico's out, just do it!  When there don't forget the salsa bar.

Thank you Chico's we will be back.
