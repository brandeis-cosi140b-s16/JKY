I didn't come here for authentic mexican food, so I was pretty satisfied with my meal. I like hitting up Macayo's everyone once in a while because they have a decent lunch special. It's nice to be able to spend under $10 and have a sit down lunch with friends or coworkers.

I really liked the lunch burro and cisco wrap - I had them at two different times, not all in one sitting...but it's enough to keep me coming back. Ugh, this review is making hungry. I'm done.
