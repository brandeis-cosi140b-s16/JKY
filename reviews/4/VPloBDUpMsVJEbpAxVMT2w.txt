I was on Blue Diamond and saw Cafe Rio so I decided to turn in for some food before work. I've been to the Cafe Rio by UNLV before and had a great experience. 

Cafe Rio is a fast casual Mexican restaurant...so these reviews about their customer service needs to stop...they are not meant to run like a dining restaurant...

I tried ordering 10 chicken tacos but they didn't have enough chicken for 10 so I settled for what they had + some steak tacos. It was late so I understand and appreciate that they don't just have an abundance of ingredients out, ready for the next day the night before. I had the tacos with lettuce cheese guacamole and their house sauce. The guacamole was alright...I can do without next time.

They have a ton of hot sauces to choose from which is just amazing because who doesn't like to have options?

The food is decent and the portions are pretty big for the price you pay. I would go back whenever I'm craving a quick bite...there are definitely a lot of options to choose from.
 
Try them out:)
