This is a wonderful little family run Mexican restaurant. I got a fish taco and shrimp quesadilla (Learn from my mistake and don't order this much food. The quesadilla was enormous and plenty of food).

The food arrived quickly and the woman at the counter was helpful and very nice. The restaurant is very clean and has plenty of seating and a TV. They also have a great salsa bar with plenty of salsa to choose from. 

The food here is fantastic. The fish taco had plenty of fish, the tortilla was fresh, and there were an assortment of grilled vegetables inside. I gave it 4 stars because it's not your run of the mill fish taco/mexican restaurant. The shrimp quesadilla also had an amazing filling that consisted of more of the normal cheese and shrimp.

The flavors were outstanding and the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because my quesadilla was pretty salty. But besides that, I will definitely be back to try a lot of their other dishes.
