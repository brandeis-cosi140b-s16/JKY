I stepped in here and I felt like I was back in San Diego.
This is what a real taco shop should be.
If you want the same stuff on a fancy plate and want to pay more, go to Leticia's which sucks.
Salsa is good, hot carrots are good, service is friendly.
Only complaint is the hours.
I showed up at 8am on Saturday wanting a breakfast burrito and it was closed!
Pretty upset about that. Business hours not posted on the door either.
