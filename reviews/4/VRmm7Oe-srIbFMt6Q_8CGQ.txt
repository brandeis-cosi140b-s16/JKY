This is one of my fave spots close to home. If you haven't been here before, their staff has samples of items on their menu for first timers. I always order a 2 item combo: Jen Red Pork & Chinese BBQ Pork with Pork Fried Rice. It's like heaven in my mouth. My girlfriend and I come here at least once a week. Also if you come here don't forget to make room for the cookie!
