Sunday morning I was in the mood for Mexican food.  Not being from the area I turned to my trusty YELP.  The reviews looked promising and I have rarely been steered wrong by the fellow yelpers.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole and they were really good.  The other items on the menu also look good and I will definitely be back.
