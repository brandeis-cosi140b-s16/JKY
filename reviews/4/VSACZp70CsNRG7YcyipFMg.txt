This place is inside the elbow of the corner on the intersection. You can enter through either street but the parking is tight. High foot traffic keeps the parking spots available but lots of pedestrians criss-crossing while cars are zooming. Watch out!

Food is decent. Employees are nice. The donut area is kept pretty clean.
