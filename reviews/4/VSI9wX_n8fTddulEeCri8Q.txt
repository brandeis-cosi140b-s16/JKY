this is a consistently good mexican restaurant, but definitely not my favorite. my husband loves it so being the good wife that i am i give in once in awhile and let him have his yummy. i think the prices are a bit steep for standard mexican fare - especially when i consider top shelf compared to my new obsession, el encanto dos. the portions aren't too small or too outrageously large. i'm not a huge fan of either fundido option - the $11ish one or the $14-is one ... althought the $14 one has higher quality beef or chicken. there are far better fundidos in the valley. his tacos with a side of rice are always good, and he eats every bite. i recently enjoyed sour cream enchiladas (1 beef, 1 chicken) and they, along with the rice and beans were a solid dish. service is always good but our most recent experience (monday night) featured top notch service. our server was attentive without being annoying, funny without being fake, efficient without making us feel rushed. we loved him! this 3 star restaurant gets an additional star for service.
