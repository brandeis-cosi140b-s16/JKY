Look out. McFarland may be developing a culinary scene. Do I actually live in a real village after all?

I liked this place. I had a seafood burrito which was good. Normally I would have gone for some meat but a lenten vow stayed my hand. Still, the burrito was solid-covered with juicy, melted cheese and stuffed with filling Mexican rice. My companion had the quesadilla, which she enjoyed. 

The salsa beforehand was tasty, and accompanied with freshly fried chips. The prices were very affordable. And in my opinion the best aspect of this restaurant were the owners, a spanish-speaking husband-and-wife who smile when you walk in the door and bend over backwards to be nice to you throughout your entire meal. 

How can I not go back?
