I walked in to check this place out after seeing the sign driving by. The chef was the sweetest person and very kind. It was lunchtime on a saturday and we were the only ones there which was confusing because it looks like a great place. 

The chef asked my daughter what she wanted and made something just for her. I ordered tortilla soup and he made it fresh on the spot (my order was to go) and gave me a free cup since he made too much. 

We got home and my daughters enchilada was delicious. I envied her lunch. The empanadas were good. My favorite was the BBQ pork. You have to cook them for 4 minutes or so in the oven. So good! 

The chef told me they make everything fresh. A very nice change from fast and greasy Mexican places. 

The tortilla soup had a really excellent flavor. But it was very brothy. Maybe some beans or something? And a takeout menu would be nice. 

I try to find local businesses to eat at and really hope this place sticks around. With a few minor tweaks (judging from other reviews) it could be a popular place to eat. I will for sure be back!
