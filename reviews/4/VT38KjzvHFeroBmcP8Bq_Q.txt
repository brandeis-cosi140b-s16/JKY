Not a big fan of Mexican food- BUT my co-workers suggested that we eat at Tonys. Ordered the Carne asada plate! FANTASTIC! Service was great! Staff was pleasant. Restaurant was clean- service fast!  My friends had the taquitos and wet burrito.. also very tasty! Definitely recommend! Prices very reasonable too!!
