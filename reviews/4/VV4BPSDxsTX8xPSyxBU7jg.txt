The burritos are great, and very filling!  I manage to make it there once a week or so, the food is great, even if I become partially immobile for a short time after eating there.  I swear the rice expands once it hits the stomach!

Make sure you come hungry.  If I am going for lunch I've been known to take the "Chipotle fast" and eat little to no breakfast so I can just finish my meal!
