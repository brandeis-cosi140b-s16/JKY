Probably the most under-rated Mexican restaurant in Vegas - at least for the sort of thing I want to eat.

Two people can easily dine for under $25 and the complimentary salsa bar is amazing.

I order a grilled chicken nachos which is ENORMOUS (I can barely finish 1/3 of it if I am lucky  - the rest comes home to be grazed upon for a day or two) for $6.99.

Pleasant Decor, tasty food, MASSIVE servings and rock bottom prices. I can't ask for much more.
