As always their strong 4 star rating stands!

My family took me here for my late b-day celebration as I was out of town during my birthday visiting Medford, Oregon.

Mmmm watch out for that basket of hot complimentary chips and salsa, mmm yummy so addictive!

Mmmm started off with my favorite appetizer, hand prepared fresh guacamole and chips! Mmmm a generous heaping bowl of guacamole so fresh and good! Mmmmmm yum yes!

I ordered my combination plate and chose three shredded beef tacos rice and beans as they have the best tacos in town...PERIOD!

The ex-hubsters ordered one of their famous burritos, so full of flavor and delicious marinated meat. HUGE! For the first time in his life he could not clean his plate! Amazing all in itself!

Mom ordered one of their new specials enchilada, rice and beans.

My precious nephew had the children's menu selection, chicken strips/fries.  Nothing special just frozen and fried up, I sure hope he acquires his flavor for Mexican soon! Then he can really enjoy this restaurant! Children's menu items include drink and dessert.

As always the food was hot and delicious as well as reasonable!

The service is hit and miss, this visit our waitress was MIA and our check was dropped off by another server. Refills on drinks were hard to come by and my nephew did not get the dessert that comes with his child's meal. 

Check out my photos from this filling and yummy visit!
