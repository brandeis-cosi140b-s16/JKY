Treated my mom to lunch here on Mother's Day. It was her first time having Chipotle. I got a bowl with white rice, black beans, barbacoa, cheese, and sour cream on the side (so I could put on the amount I wanted). It was very tasty. My mom really enjoyed her bowl with chicken. Very nice, simple lunch.
