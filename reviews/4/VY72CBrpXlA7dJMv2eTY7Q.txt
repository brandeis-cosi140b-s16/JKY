I used to live in Utah and this was THE restaurant... "who wants to get some rio???" oh yea!  so excited to learn there is one in sunny AZ :)

I Love their salad and the tortilla soup, people complain about the blandness or too much rice/beans but I think these people are rather picky.  Your at cafe rio, way better than taco bell but still not your hispanic friend's mom's kitchen...get over yourselves people the food is good, and the pricing is spot on.  Everyone raves about Chipotle but I think they are so off on this, rio is way better and you shouldn't be such a debby downer on the stuffy seating and having to order in line-it's an experience so go with it.  

sorry I think this is the first review I've written where I've shot down other yelpers...sorry guys but everyone just sounded so whiney.  it's good food, go try it and move on with your day :)
