I am so glad this business sells Tamales at the Downtown Public Market because there's no way I am driving to Cave Creek just to buy them. 
Don't get me wrong. They are good and delicious, but it's too far of a drive. I'm so pleased that you can call and order ahead and pick them up at the Downtown Public Market. The vegetarian and vegan options are awesome.
I've had their Mushroom, Corn and Spinach Tamales and the Polano Chile and Cheese which are both equally scrumptious.
But buyer beware, one tamale may not be enough and you will be severely tempted to buy a few more.
