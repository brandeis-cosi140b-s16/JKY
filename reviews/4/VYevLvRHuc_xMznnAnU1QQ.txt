I ate Chipotle today, and then watched this documentary called "Inside Chipotle" on Netflix. I've gotta say I like this chain, I like their appeal to values like ethical farming, free range  and organic foods, and paying employees a better wage than comparable competitors.  So I know what I'm eating actually lived a decent life before being put on my plate and wasn't housed in some disgusting horror of a factory like MOST of the meat industry. The reality of where a lot of our food comes from feels like a sci-fi thriller too disgusting to be believed as reality. Chipotle's CEO gets that and is doing it the way ethical individuals would, instead of the money pinching, get the most for the least, greedy slobs uninterested in anything but mass production for the cheapest possible price - even if it means serving us dog food quality meats like McDonalds is known for (pink slime anyone? Bueller?).

Aside from my obvious political bent is the great fast casual food Chipotle offers.
My mainstay is the chicken burrito bowl with rice, black beans, corn salsa, tomato salsa, and cheese. If you ask for extra of everything they don't charge you extra, either - so if the rice looks skimpy by all means say something.
