Ive been wanting to try this place for a while after seeing reviews. Finally went today.I was pretty happy to see they have a drive-thru but its hard to see the enter sign. Its just behind the building. The voice intercom didnt work so I drove up the window. Employees are all very nice and helpful. Ordered and waited at the window for food. Did take a little while but I didnt mind. Ordered asada tacos for me. They were pretty good. Lots of meat,tortillas were soft and still really warm by the time I got home. Ordered chicken taco and al pastor taco for my little ones (didnt wanna order too much in case they didn't like it) Thats was a big mistake. They loved the tacos!! Which is awesome since thats a big factor in where we go eat. Salsas were very good but container are really small so if you like salsa ask for extra. Overall great place!! Will be back soon. Will dine in next time.
