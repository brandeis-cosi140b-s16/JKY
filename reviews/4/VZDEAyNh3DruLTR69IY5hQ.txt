This place is great.

Reminds me of all the mexican places I went to while I was living in Vegas.  The chile relleno was amazing.  Great flavor and good balance.  Wasn't as impressed with the super nachos.  Don't know if it was a one time thing or not but the chips seemed to be on the stale side.  

We will definitely be going back.
