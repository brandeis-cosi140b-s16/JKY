The ability to get mediocre Chinese AND Mexican food at the same time amounts to a whole experience much greater than the sum of its parts. Never has foreign cuisine been bastardized so effectively...but it works.

Think of it as a Panda Express and Taco Bell sharing the same building, only they're totally down to mix up items. You want machaca over fried rice? Sure. Terriyaki chicken quesadilla? Not even a problem. The goal is to satisfy both cravings for $10, and I don't think that can be done anywhere else. 

I prefer to uh...keep my food separated, with a rice bowl and a small quesadilla. "You could have saved money by making it a combo!" they said as my food was brought. Too bad no one pointed that out as I handed in the multiple choice test that was my order. I came here to eat, not to fill out paperwork!

Diners rave about the Jade Chicken, and I don't think it's half bad. It's taste is vaguely orange and is a tad on the oily side, and looks and tastes like sweet and sour cut with buffalo sauce...which is weird, but works. Top it off with a bite-sized cheese crisp, a cookie, and perhaps even a reasonably-priced craft beer! 

On your way out, feel free to grab one of the mock Chinese T-Shirts...it's politically correct, but when the rest of the decor looks decades old, I at least appreciate the antiquity of the establishment as a whole. It excels in nothing. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Each item alone is just a-ok. It's the sheer variety and speed of service that forces me to rate it so highly with an extra star.
