I love Chipotle. The menu is very basic, consisting of burritos, bowls, and tacos with various very fresh rice, beans, meats, salsas, and cheese. Basic, but very very tasty.   

This location is closest to home so it gets our business regularly.  I'm dropping one star in my review for the relative slowness of this location. In some Chipotles, a line out the door still moves quickly. This location just isn't as fast. When they're busy and you're hungry, it can get a little frustrating. Also, the line wraps awkwardly in front of the door. 

Once you get your food, the line slowness becomes a worry of the past. The barbacoa burritos are especially good and I like the chips with medium salsa.
