I was sooo happy when I found out they were opening right around the corner from me.  We order at work from Caf√© Rio all the time.  The tortillas and the creamy Cilantro Vinaigrette my oh my are the two best things along with that sweet savory pork.  
Great location, although sometimes a little too crowded but they move fairly fast.
Will go back over and over and over again!
