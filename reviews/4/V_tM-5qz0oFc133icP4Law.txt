First time eating here. I just ordered the adobada fries (yes, you can do that). Most places allow you to sub out the often dry, unseasoned carne asada for the more flavorful adobada (pork). It makes a world of difference. Anyways, back to the review. I just ordered the fries and an horchata. The fries were very good and the meat cooked perfectly. Only complaint is that I wish they threw in a lime or 2. Most places put a lime wedge in with the fries. Not a big deal. I just assumed they did and didnt ask when they asked if I wanted salsa. I went drive-thru so I didnt find out til later, otherwise it wouldve been a non-issue. 

The horchata was also very good, not watered down like another review claims. Maybe they changed their recipe? Maybe that person just went on a day when a new guy was making it? Or maybe I just got lucky. Who knows, but it was good, and I consider myself a bit of an horchata connoisseur. *nose up*

But to make an unnecessarily long story short, I am very satisfied with the food and will be returning soon.
