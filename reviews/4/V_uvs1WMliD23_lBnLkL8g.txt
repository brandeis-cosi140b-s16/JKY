Dear La Condesisima or whoever you are now...I don't need to add to the already glowing reviews of your food, I love it and hope you stay around forever (especially your chile oil...I could drink that stuff).

In fact, I love it so much that I frequently crave it on my way home from work....but I am almost always thwarted by the fact that no one ever answers the phone to take my order. I'm not going to stop and wait for you to take and make my order when I'm trying to bring dinner home to my kids, I just want to order over the phone so I can walk in and pick it up. 

Please answer your phone so I can spend my money at your place.

(unless you're trying to discourage take-out orders, in which case please tell me so I can stop getting my hopes up when the craving strikes!) 

Thanks!
