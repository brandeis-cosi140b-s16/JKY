The workers were patient, even when all three of the kids we had with us could not make up their minds about what they wanted... lol  

Quick service, but there was a bit of a mix up... My boyfriend got a regular Doritos taco instead of the Cool Ranch one he ordered... They let him keep the incorrect one and then gave him the right one as well... That was pretty cool, in my opinion...  

High sanitation grade, so you know I was loving that! :)
