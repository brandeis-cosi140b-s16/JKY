Tried this place after reading the yelp reviews. First of all, great service. The salsa was outstanding. We tried two different kinds of the salsa. There was the standard salsa and spicy. I had the tamales and they were the best I've ever had! Can't wait to try more. The bottled beer wasn't as cold as we like it. And the lights in the restaurant were a little bright.
