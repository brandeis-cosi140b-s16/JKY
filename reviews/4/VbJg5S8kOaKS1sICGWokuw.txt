This place offers decent food at a great price. Every Tuesday is "Taco Tuesday" - $2.00 tacos. The portions are good and the staff is friendly. I usually order their tacos with corn tortillas. Their salsa bar is fresh and clean. The atmosphere is funky and the restaurant was clean. The manager told me they do offer catering and they have a separate menu for that.
