The tacos are good.  Pay attention if you use the drive through.  The person at the window might short change you.  Our $7.88 order had  a $20 offered as payment.  The person at the window quickly gave me $10.12 not $12.12 and they turned away from me.  When I brought it to their attention, they did not seem surprised and I got the other $2.  I think the manager should know about this.
