A small local chain with cheesy commercials that makes fairly decent New Mexican style food. You may not know what new Mexican style food is, simply its Mexican food with Green (hatch) chillies on it or in it. If you have never been to NM and just think a green chillies are like any old jalapeno or plabano you are mistaken. They have a delightfully unique pepper taste and at Arriba are quite spicy too. 

If you can not tell by now I go for the green chillies. I often order a very simple dish smothered in green chillies, I enjoy their cheese crisp which is just cheese melted on a flat tortilla and covered in hatch chillies. For lunch I sometimes get the fish taco which does not come with green chilies but they can be added to just about anything. I do like the fact that when they say something is spicy, it truly is. 

In addition to any meal comes chips, salsa and bean dip. You receive two types of salsa a large cup of standard and a small cup of spicy hatch chili salsa. This small cup of hot salsa is great and be sure to ask for more. The bean dip is also quite good. Often we fill up before our meal comes. 

I usually don't drink alcohol with my meals, however the fact they have a in house micro brew some time persuades me. It is ok as beers go. They also have .99 margaritas during happy hour and at that price how could one say no. 

One of the great deals during Happy hour is the .99 margrita which was surprisingly good and in funny glass. 

Also in late Aug early Sept they have a Hatch chili roast and sell it by the pound. Great stuff.
