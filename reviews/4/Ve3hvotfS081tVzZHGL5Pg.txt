Went for an early dinner on a Sunday and we were very pleased! The salsa is great, but I do prefer a thinner chip. Started with a dozen oysters on the half shell. My boyfriend and I are big oyster fans, these were fresh, plump and delicious! Then we had the shrimp and avocado salad, very fresh. The Molcajete was amazing, great flavors, hard to describe, a must try. I ordered the Whole Red Snapper Fried, served with rice, beans, and salad. The rice could use some work, the only negative really of the whole meal. I enjoyed the beans. Overall, I would go back again, I tend to like places that are "hidden gems", this being one. Also alcohol is very reasonable.
