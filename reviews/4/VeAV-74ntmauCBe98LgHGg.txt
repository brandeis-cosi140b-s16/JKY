I stopped in here with some friends before seeing a show at the Golden Nugget.  It was during the week so we noticed they have a happy hour menu Monday - Friday 4-7pm and 11pm-2am. The dining area is very clean with a great view of the Nugget pool area.  There are also tv's galore around the restaurant.  

They have some great happy hour specials with $4 margaritas and deals on some appetizers.  We decided to share the chips with queso.  Delicious!  The queso was so creamy and tasty.  I'd definitely go back for more.   We also split the chicken quesadilla.  This was smaller but it was pack full of chicken.   Again, it had great flavor with their spicy salsa on the side.  

Service here was ok.  Our waitress could have come over to check on us a few more times.  I realize it was a bit busy for happy hour but when you are eating something spicy, your drink tends to run out quickly!  

I do wish they had regular tables to dine at.   We were seated on lounge benches with a coffee table height dining table.  It's just a bit awkward at times to eat like that.  

Otherwise, not too shabby with a great location.
