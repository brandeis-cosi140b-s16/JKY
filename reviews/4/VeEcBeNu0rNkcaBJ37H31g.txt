Delicious food and friendly service.

Free chips and salsa, fresh and warm.

The strawberry and mango fruit margaritas had real fruit - perfect for Mexican food.

The Shredded Beef Taquitos had just the right amount of crispness, and just the right amount of sauce so they didn't get soggy.

The Tres Enchiladas Del Mar came with three seafoods: crab, lobster, and shrimp, under a tasty sauce.

Quesadilla with Grilled Chicken was stuffed and quite filling.

The waiter was attentive and friendly, changing out our silverware as the appetizer plate was switched out for our main courses.

The only downside is that this place is popular and quite crowded, so there was an hour-long wait for a table for two. We'll probably make reservations the next time we visit.

Recommended.
