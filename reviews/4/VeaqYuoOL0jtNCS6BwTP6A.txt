Super friendly place with very attractive servers. A big dance floor, VERY tasty mojitos. My husband had the chile verde margarita and found it delicious-- not overwhelming with the spiciness, and just the right amount of sweet. We would definitely go again with a group of friends-- it seems like this place will pick up in the "after 10 PM" hours.
