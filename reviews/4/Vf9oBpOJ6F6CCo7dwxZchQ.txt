Not the absolute best Mexican food in the valley (I reserve that for Padre's), BUT it is THE BEST "hole-in-the-wall" Mexican restaurant in town. Good service (crazy fast with the chips and salsa...and they don't short-change you on those!), and some of the best crispy chicken tacos I have ever had: good shredded white meat chicken stuffed inside a soft shell, and lightly fried for that tasty crispiness...all with more shredded cheddar cheese you could ever wish for.  Make sure you get guac, tomatoes, and green onions on top, too!
