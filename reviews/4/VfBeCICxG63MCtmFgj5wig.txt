We were served a basket of bread and salsa almost immediately, but we had to ask for drinks.... seems the drink order should be taken first.  Other than this, the service was excellent. This is the reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars. The food was fabulous.  My partner had the pork pabil (spelling?) and it was rich and flavorful.  I had the hatch chile seasonal special.... I could have licked my plate!  We did order the tableside guacamole... it was fresh and tastey but needed a little more heat.  I love the cozy atmosphere too....
