This has to be the best El Pollo Loco in the city.  Okay, it's not Joel Robuchon but, for what they do, and for fast food, they're great.  And, despite my love for Popeyes, this is healthy and (almost) just as tasty.

What distinguishes them from the pack is that their chicken always seems to be either fresh off the grill or at least moist.  Off topic, I hate the word "moist," but will use it because it fits.   Spices, size, whatever, does not matter if the chicken is overcooked.  So, this El Pollo Loco already won the battle.  

Their service, however, can be spotty.  I did once witness a cashier having a meltdown but, generally, they are okay and tantrum-free.  Just yesterday I received a discount without asking.  That kind of generosity can't help but make me a fan.

Cleanliness...ehh.... Just walk in and then walk out.

Did I mention their food is generally good?  I always order the generic meal: mixed chicken (breasts, leg, etc), mashed potatoes, coleslaw, corn, tortillas, etc.  However, skip the potatoes unless you really love that instant mashed potato taste (which I oddly find comforting).  The corn can also be kind of shriveled, so, I'd shoot for the other sides (my family always wants the corn for some reason!).  Choose El Pollo Loco over KFC, this stuff destroys that gross KFC grilled crap.
