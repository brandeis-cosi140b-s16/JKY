Lots (tons) of tequilas to chose from, many TVs in bar dining area. Has a main dining area also, as well as an outdoor patio with  mist system & umbrella shades, and I do believe a smoking area.  In winter they have the huge gas heating lamps.  The chips and salsa are complementary and refills are gladly given.  The food is traditional gringo-mexicano, (I like mild spiciness, so I can't say if their hotter items are for the true Mexican food lover). It is very similar to Macayo's, but less expensive. Always served hot and fresh, so food coming to your table is a little slow at times.  I always get the chimichanga with beef.  I tried the lime shrimp which was tasty but 6 medium sized crustacians with a huge bed of boring rice for $14 was not a great meal. They have a green horney enchilada which is very good.  The fried ice cream is about $5 and  a decent sized scoop.
