Eep I ate WAY too much.. ordered a sope, a quesadilla, and a tostada. I will agree with everyone here that the food here is quite authentic, tasty, and affordable. 

What I loved:
- Super fresh toppings- loved the cheese, tomatoes were juicy and not soggy, avocado was wonderful!
- Extremely affordable and a ton of food!
- Lots of space to hang out if eating in
- AMAZING packaging for take-out. I was worried my experience would be compromised because I was ordering for take out.. the package it so nicely that it is still able to stay fresh!

What I ordered:
- Tostada al pastor: was a little on the salty/heavier side, but I can see this dish being very enjoyable for someone who likes flavor. Also, Pastor may potentially taste better in a taco or another dish with more wheat to meat ratio
- Sope (for those who don't know, some explain it as a "Mexican pizza") campechano was also delish- very fresh avocado and really nicely prepped
- Quesadilla with potatoes and chorizo - Yummy! Flavorful! :) .. A little less "interesting" in terms of the mixture of flavors compared to the other dishes, but I really liked the crispiness of the quesadilla. Will be trying this with other fillings next time!

This is my personal preference, but I felt that the sope and tostada were a little on the dryer/tougher side for me- It was crispy but a little too hard and just wasn't my cup of tea, so I plan to be ordering tacos next time.

Overall, great staff, yummy food. Had my dishes complemented with some yummy green sauce :) .. I guarantee you will be full! I was pushing it with three entrees.. probably will go with two tacos or one larger dish next time...
