Okay food with 5 star service - it's not what you would expect from a fast casual restaurant but they have possibly the best service I have ever receive in any restaurant in Charlotte. 

Waitress greeted  us at the door and while it's self seating and order at the register, she took the time to walk us through the menus and tell us their special - $5.49 for two tacos, a side if chips and a drink! (Every Tues) I also noticed they have a burrito special on Thurs $5.99 for a burrito, chips and a drink. Both great deals. The employees continued to check on us refilling our drink and getting us anything we needed. When trying to find a place to throw out my trash when we finished, an employee assured me they would take care of everything . That statements sums up my experience at Tijuana Flats.

As for the food, it was generally okay. However, the guacamole was so good that at $3.99 for a large container with chips, I don't think I will ever buy it from the grocery store again!  The salsa while not traditional Mexican style, which I typically prefer, I thought was great too. At $2.99 for a large container with chips, again I think it would be crazy not to pick this up over the grocery store kinds that can cost more than that for salsa alone. The tacos were as good as any other fast casual restaurant but nothing that would draw me back there on their own. Not bad just nothing special.
