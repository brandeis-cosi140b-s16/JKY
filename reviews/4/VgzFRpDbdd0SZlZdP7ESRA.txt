Had my first experience with cafe Rio today.  It's basically a chipotle with more options and in my opinion tastes better.  It's kind of expensive. I had the tostada with chicken and a coke and it was over $9. There was a pretty big portion though,  I ate about 75% of it and I didn't even have all the available toppings.  Don't tell them it's your first time unless you enjoy being embarrassed as they sing a very long,  loud and obnoxious song while banging on the stainless steel counters.     

Overall I would eat there again but I wouldn't seek it out.
