Roberto's in Roberto's this one just happens to have a drive thru. I'm lazy so the drive thru at this 'berto's is great when I'm having lunch in the area, which I have been more often so this location is convenient. A carne asada burrito and a cheese quesadilla top off my tank just most of the time. The tortillas they use here are bomb.com and the cheese is shredded fresh. The red and green sauce are good too and they don't skimp on the amount put into your bag. Cheap and satisfying lunch. Drive thru can back up and the only negative would be the way you have to pull in and enter the drive thru because it's a tight squeeze and rather confusing the first time trying to get in. If paying with credit or debit card they charge .50 cents for that.
