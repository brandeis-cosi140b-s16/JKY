Tried this place cause close to home and good yelp reviews... Hard to find good Mexican food in Phoenix , but this place was pretty good .. Good addicting salsa , I got the 3 enchiladas platter , which were all good , good sauces, good rice and beans ... No funny flavors. Good happy hour, friendly service  :) good all around :)  I would def come back here when I'm craving Mexican close to home.
