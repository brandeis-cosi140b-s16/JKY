This bar is really entertaining. It's managed to stay pretty consistently fun throughout the past couple of years; most other bars in Old Town get old quick. They have a solid selection of beers, good music, and are frequented by a fairly young crowd.

If you're going to go here, head over kinda early. It gets super packed around midnight and it's almost impossible to fight through the crowd to get a drink at the bar.
