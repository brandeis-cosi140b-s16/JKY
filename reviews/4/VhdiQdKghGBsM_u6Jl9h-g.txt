Ricardo's still hits the spot for me.  I hadn't been in a couple of years so I was worried based on some reviews. My Chile Colorado was exactly what i remember; tender and flavorful.  Don't forget about this institution just because it left the strip. Want another reason to go,  its now open 24 hours.
