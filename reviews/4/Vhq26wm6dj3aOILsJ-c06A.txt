Top faves: 7- Layer burrito (vegetarian fave), soft taco, meximelt & bean burrito. 

I've always had a thing for Taco Bell since I was a kid. It's cheap and with recent studies-- it's HEALTHY. I don't care if it's only 30% actual meat, it all comes out the same, right? ;) 

Restaurant is nearby. Dining area is clean, restroom is clean and staff is friendly, most the time. 

Return visits? All the time!
