Looking for a decent price dinner on the Strip? Look no further!  

Started with the Caipirinha (Brazil's national rum drink)--was good, they were not light handed with the rum.  For $13, they better not be light handed!

Had the fish tacos entree.  Came with fresh sliced avocado and rice and beans.  The beans were a little weird, not quite black beans, not quite re-fried?  I didn't eat them, but I'm not a bean fan.  Had a delicious sauce on the fish tacos, can't remember what it was exactly, but definitely had some Ranch in it.  The fish was also seasoned beautifully.
Husband had a green chile burrito dish and really enjoyed that as well.  

We went early for dinner (5:30ish) and so it was dead which was nice because we got good attention from the server.  However, we also watched two other servers eat their dinners in front of us.  Thought maybe there should be a staff area where they can eat out of view of guests.
Wish we had been able to go for breakfast- sounded amazing!  
No happy hour special, which was a bummer.

Not 5 stars because I think with the atmosphere of the place, they could lower their prices a bit.  They were not a fancy cantina or even semi-fancy.
