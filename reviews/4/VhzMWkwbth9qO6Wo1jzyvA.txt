I really like ketzel, for what it is. It's not super authentic but they have good food. They serve a variety of different salsas, which is unique, and their burro ketzel (with steak) is fantastic. I get it everytime. I refuse to go to all the lame chains in my area and think ketzel is a cute Mexican restaurant that offers something different, which is nice. My only complaint would be that I think they are a little overpriced and when they do send out coupons, they are pretty lame. Other then that, I like ketzel and would recommend it.
