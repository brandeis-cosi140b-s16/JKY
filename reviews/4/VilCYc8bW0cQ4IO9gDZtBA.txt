Obviously, this place is very similar to Chipotle but in regards to flavor this place slightly edges out Chipotle for me. For one, you can order nachos with an actual 3 cheese queso as opposed to just grated cheese at Chipotle. Also, when you get a salad here it comes in a tortilla bowl score! The service at this location can be spotty at times but bear with them because the food is worth the wait. Also, this location gives out $6 meal coupons on the back of Safeway receipts ( the meal coupon  includes any entr√©e and a drink for only $6 buck, can't beat that with a stick!). The actual dining area is okay, but again their service needs work so sometimes you will see dirty tables. Overall, I'd say find the coupons, use them and get your food to-go, BOOM!
