The carne asada tacos are wonderful here, same with the tacos al pastor. Plus, at $1.35 a taco, you can't go wrong. Food is not overly greasy, which my heart can thank me later for. During my stop here, I've had the chance to try:

-Carne Asada Tacos: Carne asada is seasoned well, making it rich and flavorful. Probably some of the best I've had in town.
-Tacos al Pastor:  While not as memorable as the carne asada, it's still a very solid taco. Good, but not awesome.
-Carne Asada burrito: I managed to get a bite of this from whom I was eating with. It's basically what you get in a taco, in burrito form (with rice, beans, etc.). Much too heavy for me, so I'd rather stick with the tacos.

All in all, a solid trip. I would eat here again, but wouldn't go out of my way for this place.  I'd call this place radius eating: If I'm in the area, then definitely I'll make an effort to stop on by for a bite.
