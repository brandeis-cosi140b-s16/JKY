Went on Monday for lunch, wasn't impressed with the food itself especially for its cost. I was expecting a phenomenal dish but was left disappointed due to its lack of flavor and texture. The only reason I give this place four stars is because of the service, my server David was awesome, he followed up with me and I could really see he cared about my experience. Although the service was great, I may not come back until I hear they have an improved menu or are under management that cares about the food they are trying to sell.
