Ordered the chips and salsa with Chile de arbol salsa -- supposedly the spicest of the three (also had molcajete and green Chile salsa to choose from).  ($4.99)

Verdict: if jalape√±o was a 5, their spiciest salsa is a 7 and their green Chile would be a 3. Choose your salsa carefully.  The spiciness of their arbol is just enough for you to break a sweat and is a pretty good level for a relaxing side of chips and salsa.  

I am Korean and LOVE spice so take this review with a grain if salt.

Decor is pretty lively and would consider the ambiance "loud" with music playing, customers chattering, and tvs barely audible during times of silence. 

Full bar with tvs playing sports.  Not bad of a spot if you are looking for a place to kill time before your boarding time. Plenty of seating available and staff is very friendly and attentive.  

I was not "blown away" hence the 4 but based on just good service, clean decor, lively atmosphere, and good chips and salsa, this spot is great.
