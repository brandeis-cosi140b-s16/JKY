What? A hole in the wall Mexican spot in the middle of a strip mall next to a competitive board game shop? Yes and thank you. I think you can really judge a mexican spot by the quality of their chips, and this place nails it. Chicken tacos are amazing as well. Reasonably priced, and pretty much impossible to beat in terms of Mexican dining in Madison. Loses one star for ambiance, which sort of feels like a Mexican themed diner.
