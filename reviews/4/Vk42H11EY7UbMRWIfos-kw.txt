Mad Mex gets super crowded all the time for a reason.

Their "Big Azz" margaritas are nothing particularly special, but will knock you on your ass. Factor in their two-a-day happy hours featuring $7 margaritas and you're in for some economical, pleasant drinking.

Food is half-off after 11, so if you're getting drunk munchies after imbibing on one (or three) margaritas at night you're in luck. It's pretty good too, they offer some creative dishes that, while blatantly inauthentic, satisfy. Portions are so big that even with drunk munchies I can only finish 3/4 of my meal.

The service is super patient and quick as well. Even when the place is packed with a bunch of drunk people servers never get snappy. Every time I've been hammered there a waiter has always politely asked me to move, and has put up with my significantly delayed reaction time.

The major con of Mad Mex is how loud and tiny it is. If you're there to drink at the bar there's very little standing room. If you're there to eat at a table expect to be bumping elbows with the person next to you. Even when it's not too crowded the restaurant is inexplicably loud, so don't bring a date here (unless you don't really want to hear what she's talking about, in which case do so as I have in the past).

In summary: go here during off hours for good food to avoid the crowds or during happy hours when you'll be too drunk to care about the crowds. Also, for anyone trying to get in using a fake, they're one of the stricter bars in Oakland so be careful.
