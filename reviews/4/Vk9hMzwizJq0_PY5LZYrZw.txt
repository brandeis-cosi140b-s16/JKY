Place was very nice and food is decent. My Abuelito is Cubano so sadly this was not as delicious as the homemade food I grew up on but it was pretty good. The mamey shake was very good and presentation of the food was good. The water was very good too (not tap). We had pan con bistec and pan con pollo both good. I was missing the Cubano au jus but overall pleased with the experience and the staff was great.
