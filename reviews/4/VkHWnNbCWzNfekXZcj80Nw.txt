A neighborhood mexican restaurant that I enjoy. Staff is very friendly and attentive. I can order my fish grilled instead of fried for my fish tacos. Not on the menu but the waitress offered. I always order double beans instead of rice, no problem. Street tacos are yummy. Beer is cold and they have Modelo Negra, my favorite. Their breakfast burritos are large enough for my breakfast and lunch! Again, they will customize. I don't like potatoes in my chorizo egg  burrito so they make it without for me. Still a huge, spicy cheesy indulgence. Be sure to have the green salsa. Tomatillo? They won't give me the recipe, lol! Good, not gourmet, food at reasonable prices and with friendly staff.
