my co-workers rave and rave and rave about this place and how "cool and divey" it is, so i took my visiting brother there for a mid-week lunch. 

it does seem a little divey, but that's only because it's as much as sports bar in the front, and the celings are low and the lighting is low. the service was down-home and friendly, and it was filled with regulars. 

our server was nice and friendly and kept our water glasses filled. my brother opted for one of their lunch specials and his plate was massive. he ate so much i thought he would pop. i got the cheese and bean enchilada plate with beans and rice.
it was good but honestly, and this isn't meant to be a negative, but it was just similar to a hundred other mexican restaurants i've eaten in here in phoenix. 

i would go back except it falls outside my "radius of convenience" and i'm trying to bike more and drive less and it's just harder to get to Tee Pee on my bike than the mexican place only a block away from my house. 

good food, good service. very popular with locals.
