I had been meaning to try this place to add some variety to my Chipotle-Qdoba-rinse-repeat routine, but I didn't get around to it until I moved in across the street from the Eastern location.

My first burrito was a disappointment. I had shredded beef in a flour tortilla with a mixture of white and brown rice, their red (hot) salsa, and cheese. There was a very sweet taste to the burrito. At first I thought it could be the brown rice, but then I remembered that their site describes the red salsa as "slightly sweet". Slight understatement.

I decided to give them a second chance tonight and ordered the same burrito with their green (medium) salsa, minus the white rice. It was a much better experience. There was still a slight sweet taste (the brown rice must be partly to blame), but the quality of the meat and the huge portion size made this a legitimate rival to the two big burrito chains. Bonus points for the employee who genuinely did not seem annoyed when I walked in at 8:59, not realizing they close at 9:00. As they bagged my tin-foil cylinder of goodness, I briefly considered saying, "I wanted that for here", but thought better of it.
