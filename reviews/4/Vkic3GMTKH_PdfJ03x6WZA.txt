I am not a fan of chains so it's rare for me to go to one let alone actually review it.  Chipotle though is actually pretty impressive.  The ingredients are all fresh and I love that you can "custom" make it and tell them exactly what you do and don't want.  I always get the chicken bowl with all three salsas mixed, guacamole, and extra rice.  They even have brown rice now - big plus!  For what you get and the price - esp. since most of it's organic, I think it's worth it.
