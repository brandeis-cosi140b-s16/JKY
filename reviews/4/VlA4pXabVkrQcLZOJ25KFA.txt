This place is great for people who like spicy food. Usually I'm skeptical when I see a chili pepper indicating that an item on the menu is "hot", but Los Dos Molinos does not lie! The adovada ribs and spicy shrimp are BLAZING HOT. I must give the cooks credit though, because they are very flavorful dishes and the heat does not overwhelm the actual flavor of the food and spices.
