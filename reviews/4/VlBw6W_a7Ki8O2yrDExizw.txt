I met some girlfriends here for lunch today and had a great experience!  I had been in Revo Burrito before and really like how they expanded the space, modernized it and truly made it relaxing and comfortable.  The service was attentive and helpful, the atmosphere was great and the food was really good and reasonably priced for the amount of food you receive.  I enjoyed the chicken fajita rice bowl with brown rice...super tasty and a big portion.
