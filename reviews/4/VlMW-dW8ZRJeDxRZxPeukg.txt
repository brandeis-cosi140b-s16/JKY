I really like Cafe Rio. If you look at my previous reviews, I've been looking for a fantastic Mexican place in Vegas. Care Rio does fill a void in my heart, but this is not authentic Mexican food. It's this kind of Mexican but kind of something else. Nevertheless, it's really yummy. I highly recommend the Barbacoa burrito. Did you not hear me? I highly recommend the Barbacoa burrito. Don't order anything else. I'm sure their other food is good, but order the Barbacoa. It's f*ing fantastic. I order it whenever I'm on that side of town. You need to try it. Say it with me now: I'll have the Barbacoa burrito please!
