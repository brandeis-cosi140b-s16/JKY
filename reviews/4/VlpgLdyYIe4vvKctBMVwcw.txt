I wrote this whole big review of Frank & Lupe's, but then my internet connection died.  Let's just say that this place reminds me of the taquerias you find on just about every block in Chicago -- great food, cheap prices and lousy service. I had the chicken enchiladas mole and they were yummy.  The rice and beans were also a cut above average, and the chips were fresh, light and flaky. The sopapillas that finished the meals were not too sweet, so you can add honey to your taste.  Liked this place a lot and would definitely go back.
