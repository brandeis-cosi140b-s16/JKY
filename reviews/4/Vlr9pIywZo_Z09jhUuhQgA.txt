Really, really good. I've been a an of another chain Mexican restaurant in the area, but I think this place has it beat. 

Service is excellent. They do unobtrusive, yet efficient really well. 

Got our chips. They were just okay, salsa was just okay. It was sort of disappointing, but the food really made up for it. 

I order the taco/tostado/cheese enchilada plate and that first taste hooked me for life. How delicious! The cheese was really melt-y, but not super gooey, it wasn't overly cheesy weirdly. The only thing I can complain about is that the taco doesn't have vegetarian options, just meat. I should have asked for beans, but the tostado already had that covered. I saved that for last and the beans just melted the shell so I had to eat with my fork. I'll save that for first next time. 

My friend had the taco plate with the deep fried chicken taco and it looked really good. I didn't get beans and rice with mine, but he did so I tried them. Best I've ever tasted. Whew. 

This place is obviously awesome, you just need to get there and try it for yourself!
