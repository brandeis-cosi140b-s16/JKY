Picture a more taco shack Chipotle if you've never been. This place is pretty fantastic when you want a fairly inexpensive, fairly healthy and pretty dang yummy meal. The boyfriend gets the beer battered fish burrito and I get the Baja chicken burrito, they're pretty sizable and cut in half. We trade one of them for the other persons and it's pretty great combo. Large (free) salsa bar, but I think the sauces in the "ketchup bottle" containers are the best. Staff has always been friendly to me, I think you just need to be friendly to them (pretty much the same anywhere you go and anyone you meet). Overall, a good spot-- come here about every other weekend since I live nearby!
