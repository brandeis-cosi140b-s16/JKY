I wouldn't usually give a Tace Bell four stars, but they had something that I really liked and that was their Verde sauce packets. It's similar to the green sauce I get at one of my favorite Mexican restaurant. I like trying things that don't exist where you live.

The food was as I've had in California. Good and filling. The dining area was clean, the bathroom was clean. 

That's it. It's Taco Bell.
