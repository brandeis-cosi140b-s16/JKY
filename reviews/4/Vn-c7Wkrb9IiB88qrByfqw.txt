After reading the reviews, my husband and I decided to try it out. I ordered the rolled taquitos plate and hubby ordered the beef chimichanga. The salsa is too chunky for my taste, but it had great flavor. Our order came out and my food was delicious! Hubby loved his too, but they gave him chicken instead. Both dishes were fantastic! The reasons I'm not giving 5 stars is because their restroom is in need of a good cleaning, there were kids running in and out of the kitchen and all over the restaurant, and even though he liked the chicken it wasn't what hubby ordered. We'll definatly come back, and we'll make sure it's not on a UFC night (not a fan of the idiot drunk guy and his commentary).
