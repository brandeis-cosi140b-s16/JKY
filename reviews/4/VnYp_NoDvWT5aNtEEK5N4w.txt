Really great food and drinks. Loved the asada tacos (order of 3), the fish ceviche, and the queso dip. The ceviche was very fresh. Didn't love the pastor tacos cuz they come with pineapple and I'm not one for sweet, but if you like that combination of sweet and savory, you'll close them. The mangonada drink is a must!!
