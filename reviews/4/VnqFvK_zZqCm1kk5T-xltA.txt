This review would have been a 3 star rating....but that bean dip....ohhh...that bean dip...was delicious!!!! And I'm not even a fan beans to begin with!!

The restaurant is located next to Marilyn's Cafe, right by the entrance from the guest parking lot if you enter through Flamingo Rd. I know this hotel have more than one parking lot so it can get a bit confusing.

They got a pretty good sized lunch special menu here. My Combo #6 had a tamale and an enchilada. (with your choice of meat.) Cost only about $6.95. The usual sides include your choice of rice and beans OR a salad. I opted for the salad. Was trying to feel healthy that day lol!!!

Food was decent. It's really nothing to rave about. This restaurant is only good if you're a guest staying at the Tuscany Suites and Casino or if  you're here to meet a couple friends that's staying here...which was in MY case. Definitely would not come all the way over here JUST for Mexican food.
