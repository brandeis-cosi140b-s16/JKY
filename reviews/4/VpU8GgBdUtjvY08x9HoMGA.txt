Last time I went they had a new item that was just written on some paper by the register- Potatoe Tacos!!

Fried squares of potatoes (think breakfast) placed in a tortilla shell and then deep fried.  Topped with queso and lettuce.  Yum!  Yum!  Yum!  It was so delicious.  Nothing what so ever healthy about it but it tasted like salty, greasy heaven.
