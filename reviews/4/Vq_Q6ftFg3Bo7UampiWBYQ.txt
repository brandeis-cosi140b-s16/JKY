After 20 years of  living as close to the border you can get (south San Diego-- 10 mins from the border).. this was as best/close to SD Mexican food I can get in Vegas (aside from Tacos Al Gordo).

They're pretty close to spot on with their Carne Asada fries and street tacos. Definitely a good spot!

Although, I'm not sure if they're still open? Tried to call in an order the other day and number was disconnected. Drove by and no more signs??? 

I'd be sad to see a small business like this gone.. especially in the Aliante area where the only other option is Robertos...
