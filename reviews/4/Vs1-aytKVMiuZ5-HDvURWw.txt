YUM YUM YUM. I picked up a couple of breakfast burritos here last week and was very impressed. The man at the counter was very nice and the place is quaint. The decor is new age Mexican and very cozy. The food is DELICIOUS and the prices are right. 

Overall, I'm happy I finally made it to PHX Burrito House. I'll most definitely be back!
