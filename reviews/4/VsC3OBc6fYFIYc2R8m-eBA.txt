Solid 4 Star Restaurant! Very cool and hip venue with clientele to match. A few so so drinks with Patron On--Tap followed by an awesome selection of sushi and various Latin themed entrees. Overall a great experience that would have been 5 Star if the waiter didn't oversell Wagu Nigiri that ended up costing $33 for 3 small pieces.
