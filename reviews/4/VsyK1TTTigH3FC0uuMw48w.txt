My family and I go here once a month or so. If this review was solely based on the food and cocktails......5 stars hands down!!!!

 Sometimes the service is a bit choppy depending on who the server is. However, with that being said, being a server is an extremely hard job and by no means has anyone ever been rude to us. Just a little slow with the service or asking for certain things a few times and them forgetting. 

The salsa is the BOMB!!!!! The pork tamales are sweet and moist, the shredded beef tacos are AMAZING! Not to mention.......the dessert.....pffft, of course fried ice cream, DELICIOUS!!!!!

Usually, my husband and I won't order cocktails when out at dinner unless it's a beer or wine because places typically can't make a good, authentic Margarita. I highly suggest you enjoy one of their many Margarita's they have on the menu! They are incredible! 

Again, let me clarify that the servers have NEVER been rude or mean to us. I would give 5 stars if some of the servers had better time management, that's all.
