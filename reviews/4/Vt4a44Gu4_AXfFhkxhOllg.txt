I love a place w/ both Omni & Vegan options!  The Vegan Taco Menu (this is on a separate menu that you need to ask for) is affordable ($10.95 for two tacos, rice, & beans) and has a slew of options.  I enjoyed both the fried avocado taco & fishless filet tacoo.  They even have a kids menu for those picky omni children.

My sister-in-law had the ceviche and thoroughly enjoyed it! 

Restaurant is in a great location, w/ nice outdoor heated seating area, and service was attentive.
