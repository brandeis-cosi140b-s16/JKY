Just came back from El Pollo Loco ...  Love it !

Pros:
 * Juicy chicken
 * Cilantro Cream Sauce is bomb!!
 * huge tostadas
 * quick service

Cons:
 * dirty bathrooms w/ no mirrors
 * their natural ice tea has a weird taste to it
 * they don't carry Choco Tacos anymore (okay that's super old school, but it must have been outrageously good because I remember ha).

Overall:
  I go to El Pollo Loco when I feel like eating out, but attempt to be healthy at the same time.  During this visit I ordered the Chicken Tostada with no sour cream plus a side of the creamy cilantro sauce.  The cilantro sauce is pretty thick in consistency and really doesn't seem to healthy, but I couldn't resist.  It's so hard to resist (that alongside the avocado salsa).  What's up with the tea?  I can't describe the taste, but there was definitely some type of funk to it ?  Egh, nonetheless I'll be back for more.

Tips:
 * if you are actually looking to count your calorie intake, the menu lists the caloric value of every item next to it (you might have to squint a bit).
*  Opt for the cilantro dressing... trust me on this one!
* Odelay, El Pollo Loco has a dollar menu!
