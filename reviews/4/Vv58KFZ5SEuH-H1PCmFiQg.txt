This was a surprisingly great find in the Charlotte airport. The margaritas really surprised me in how good (and strong!) they were. They're not cheap at $12 - $13 but they definitely satisfied my craving for a fruity margarita. And the cheese quesadilla I had was pretty good as well. Not a life changer but made my layover significantly better.
