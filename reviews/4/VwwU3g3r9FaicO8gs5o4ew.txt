Atmosphere was really cool and nicely decorated.  Chips and salsa were great. A few items on the menu are a tad pricey for a restaurant not being located on the Las Vegas strip. Guac is 14.95 and a side of beans is 5.95. I work on the strip over looking the strip itself and our guac is 8.95 and a side of beans is 1.50. So I was a bit blown away by some of the prices here. Our server Brian was great and very friendly.
