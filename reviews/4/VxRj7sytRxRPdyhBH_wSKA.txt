Excellent margaritas that use Real Live Limes.  Decent appetizers, and friendly bartenders.  And I'm all about any Vegas place with outdoors potential and not having a view of the inside of a casino.

Disclaimer:  Four stars are based on experiences in the downstairs cantina, a few appetizers, and more than a few kick-ass margaritas, on a Sunday night.  Rating may change with attitude of reviewer on next visit (and yes, there will be a next visit), especially if it's on a busier night and I venture upstairs.
