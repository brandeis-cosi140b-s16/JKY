Found this place b/c of Yelp and glad I did.

Great Sonoran hot dogs.  I got two and was uber full.  The first time I went I recall less than optimal communication.  I asked how many types of dogs they had, and the answer was "how many?".  

Today was the 2nd time and things went much better.  Very helpful and once again a great meal.  I also feel like it was a bit cleaner this time, maybe they straightened up or repainted.

It is in a below average neighborhood but worth the adventure.  Go for the food, not the ambiance.
