Having a tire blowout left me way bummed, and the price of replacing a pair of them total left me even more down in the dumps!  Good thing the tire store is next to Hanshiktaco,  which had a really nice owner and a good "Nate" dog!  

 His crazy Korean/Taco truck looks really nice and clean inside and out,  and he and I had a fine conversation while I got a great meal for $5!   The "not so" French Fries were pretty rad too, but the star was the kimchee-laden Nathan's hot dog!   With a little Siracha, it rocks!  

I'm glad I finally stopped in here, although I wish I'd have not had to buy new tires to do it...  it's cash only, which is the only other problem.  But at these prices, you can afford it with change in your car!
