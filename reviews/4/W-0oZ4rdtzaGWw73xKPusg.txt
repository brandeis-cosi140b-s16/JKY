Was in AZ visiting a friend and we had lunch here.  It was pretty good and the fundido sauce/cheese dip is amazing!  The waiter was excellent at following up with my questions regarding vegetarian options, and they have plenty of options to choose from if you are vegetarian, such as black beans rather than refried, spinach enchiladas, cheese quesadillas, cheese enchiladas, and maybe even veggie fajitas if you ask.  I'll eat here again when I go back to visit.
