We really appreciate successful family run restaurants and this is one of them. They were very friendly, accommodated special orders and you could tell they were making the food to order and not just re-heating pre-made food in the back.y husbAnd thought the carne asada was flavorful. Chicken in Mexican restaurants sometimes seems like it's made with whatever meat is leftover but this appeared to be all white meat chicken, not dry or flavorless. This was our first visit. We will be back and I'll be willing to try something more unique now that I trust their kitchen.
