I've been here twice. I don't eat meat, only seafood. The first time I ordered the green chili tamale and a shrimp enchilada.  The tamale was  bland and dissapointing. However, the shrimp enchilada was awesome! My friend was not pleased with his entree but I cant remember what it was.  He said he believed it was prepared the way they intended , he just didnt like the flavor.  Our server was intrusive.  We were there for lunch so im sure a lot of people want to eat in a hurry. He non verbally made it clear that once we were done eating, it was time to go.  There were plenty of open tables in the restaurant I think he was just ready to get his shift over with.
