technically, 4.5 stars. here's why:

my friends and i decided to check the place out before going out. it's located in luxor, which....well, isnt very happening. whatever, we were here for the food anyway. first plus: free chips and salsa. who doesn't like free food (esp in vegas!). we also order a pitcher of red sangria. that's where the place loses points-the drink was awful. tasted like cheap red wine and the fruit was just gross and inedible. though i have to admit, i'm no sangria expert. my expertise lies with food. and in the food dept, this place was great! everything we ordered turned out surprisingly delicious! the food tasted authentic. all in all, i'd DEFINITELY come back here. the price range was also decent. if you aren't too hungry, you could probably split a dish, otherwise expect to pay about $15-25 per person.
