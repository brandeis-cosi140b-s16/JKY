Everyone else seems to have eaten here a lot, but earlier today was my first time eating at a Chipotle.  One of my co-workers recommended it, saying it was her favorite mexican food.

While it's not too bad, I would definitely not call it my favorite.  One thing that is much better than all of the "drive-thru" mexican restaurants around Phoenix is that the chicken was completely white meat, grilled and fresh, which is much better than most fast food mexican.  The hot sauce was mildly warm, although they put a little too much rice in the burrito.

Overall, pretty good,  I'll be back, but not tomorrow.
