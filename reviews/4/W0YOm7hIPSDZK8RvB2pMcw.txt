This was the only place in Vegas we came across with cheap shot.  We must have done 20+ $3.00 tequila and Fireball shots! Also had some churro's, burrito's, and Tacos - all of it great!  The ladies behind the counter were awesome.  We spent probably about 3 hours here drinking and eating.  If we ever come to Vegas again we will stop by.
