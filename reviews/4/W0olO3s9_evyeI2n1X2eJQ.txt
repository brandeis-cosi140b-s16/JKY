This place was absolutely AMAZING.

The area looks a little sketchy, tucked in a little plaza that you could drive right past and not even know it was there. My office happens to be just a few blocks away from this place, one day I was craving some mexican food for lunch but I was looking for something a little more authentic than Filibertos(blehhh). Being hispanic, Im pretty critical and picky when it comes to eating at a hispanic establishment, this place was spot on with the flavors. I walked in right way and was greeted by 2 latin women at the counter, the set up was kind of like a burrito bar, like chipotle in way(only way better) you start by choosing your burrito, then your veggies and other toppings, the burrito was as big as a baby! amazing burrito... and that jalapeno cream cheese!!! heaven.
