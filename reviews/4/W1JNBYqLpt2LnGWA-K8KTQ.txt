I had the chance to eat at plaza Bonita on Friday night. They expertly handled our large part of 10 by pushing tables together so we could all be together. The tables and chairs are great. I sat in a hand-carved toucan chair. The colors are bright and friendly.

I had the enchilda suiza. Very large portions. The food was good but it sat under the heat lamp so long the plate was hot and could not be handled to move the plate around.  The server was pretty good but he had too many tables and struggled to keep up. Overall it was a good experience and I would return another day. I want to try the tamales!
