When we come to Arizona, we always expect good Mexican food - and this place did not disappoint. The chips and salsa are delicious - the salsa is very fresh. We ordered the guacamole to start, and it was tasty but massive. Sadly we could not even finish the whole thing it was so big! I had the fajitas and they were decent quality and very tasty. I also tried the chicken enchilada and that was good. Someone else ordered the machaca and seemed to enjoy it. The service wasn't the most prompt though, but there was a live band which made for a festive atmosphere, and the margaritas were excellent.
