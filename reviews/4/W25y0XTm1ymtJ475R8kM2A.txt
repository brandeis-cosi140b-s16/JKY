Never had food from their taco stand (but it looks super delish), but I have been to the grocery store a few times now, and I dig it.

One of the major bummers about moving from Chicago to Pittsburgh was the total lack of a significant Latino population.  From Wikipedia: Latinos make up about 25% of the Chi-town population....about 2% of the Pittsburgh population.  Wah wah waaaaaah (sad trombone.  sad mariachi band?)

So the lack of authentic Latino ingredients has been a huge bummer.  Where's a girl supposed to get a taco around here?  This is why I was so happy to find Reyna.  In my home kitchen, we tend to cook lots of Asian and Indian food, but when we DO go the Latin America route, we want to do it right.  Homemade style.  So a place with fresh tortillas, Mexican cheeses, bulk dried peppers, Jumex (boyfriend is obsessed with these canned juices/nectars), and other tasty things is a much-needed addition to the Strip, with its diverse culinary offerings.

I will always return here for Latin American ingredients - partially because Reyna is great, but also because - where else could you get that around here?  I do wish Reyna was bigger, but I shouldn't complain.
