My lunchtime staple, I eat at this location once a week at least.  Service is fast, and this place gets crowded.  Between the nearby employees having lunch or the tourists visiting the outletmalls, it is always busy.

Food is consistent and always good.  I tried online ordering the other day, they had my food ready to go and I walked out in less than 5 minutes.
