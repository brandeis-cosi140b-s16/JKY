Macayo's is an Arizona institution. My parents started bringing me when I was a kid. Over the years I've tried just about everything on the menu. Chicken Poblano is my favorite but the Baja sauce on anything is a treat. This branch lands 4 stars because lately the service has been a little subpar. If they can be more attentive to the customers, it will get back to 5 stars, but the food keeps me coming back.
