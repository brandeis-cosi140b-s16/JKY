A real taco in the 'Burgh.  Four stars would easily be five if their portions were just a tad bigger, but wow is the food here good.  Reyna has been satisfying true taco lovers with amazing tacos for awhile now and it finally seems that the rest of Pittsburgh has caught on.  There always seems to be a line of people salivating for the fresh ingredients and unique flavors that only Reyna offers in the Golden Triangle.  I absolutely love their beef tongue taco and their pulled pork version.  The salsas are fantastic and people are always mucho friendly.
Do yourself a favor and eat your way through Pittsburgh's Strip and get one or eight tacos from the friendly folks at Reyna.
