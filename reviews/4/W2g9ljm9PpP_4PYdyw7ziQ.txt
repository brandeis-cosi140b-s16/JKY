Great service! 
If you are a fan of VERY low-key Mexican food, this should hit the spot. Greasy spoon Mexican restaurant at the intersection of South Blvd and Tyvola Rd, it is a bit difficult to get in and out of the parking lot. I have never been there when it is crowded for lunch. I can usually get in, eat and pay within 20 minutes. Seriously, they are that fast, which is good if you are on a time crunch. 
I've tried mostly vegetarian dishes and they are all tasty and just what you want from a small Mexican lunch place. Cheesy, no skimping on the beans and fresh cut avocado for a very small charge by request.
