I'm literally waiting for my meal right now, I hope it's good!
---------------------------
MMMMmmmmmmmmm Mmmmmmmmmmmmm B*****!!!! Wow this is pretty damn good! I can't believe Ive literally worked across the street for almost two years and never checked this place out... Well, maybe I can... Carolina's is like 75 feet away lol 

I'm not sure what that other reviewer was looking for/talking about but this place is definitely not as he described it. It's a little family owned place and it's a little warm inside but other than that, it's fantastic. 

I ordered the 2 floutas dinner plate and was surprised by the portion size. These floutas are jumbo sized and taste great! Warm and crispy with some nice shredded beef. Beans are great! Rice is good, soft and moist. Salsa is chunkier than any other mexican place I've been to so I have no idea why the other reviewer said it's "watery" 

Overall, if you're looking for a 5-Star Iron Chef Mexican Food Restaurant then you've came to the wrong place but if you want some quality Mexican food that doesnt end in "'tos" and has a "homey"
