Love this place! Carne Asada burros are fabulous. My wife likes the taco salad. 
I read on another review that there was a language barrier. I couldn't disagree more they are always  very friendly and remember that my wife and I love the hot carrots so they always include more at no charge without us asking.
We've never had a problem communicating and its always clean when we come in and dine.
