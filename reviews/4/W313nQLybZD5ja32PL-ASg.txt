It is good to see Surprise get a good taco shop.  Not to say Riva's is bad because it is not.  I am just happy to see one closer to our house.

Let me start this to say that this location is VERY clean.  Even the bathrooms!  For a Berto's style taco sop that is saying a lot!  

Very friendly service and helpful staff.

I have been ordering this style food my entire life, so I have my favorites.

Rolled Tacos- Crispy and fresh with a good amount of guacamole and cheese.  The tacos have a good amount of meat inside.

Carne Asada Burrito- Not salty meat!  Not fatty skirty steak!  Two biggest things i look for in a carne asada burrito!  Nice amount of Pico and guacamole.

Machaca Burrito- Yum!  I like my machaca without the tomatoes and they are always wiling to oblige.  Nice egg to shredded beef ratio!

Bean Burrito- Not too runny!  a good standy by.  I usually ask for a bean and rice burrito so it does not all fall apart.

Beef Burrito (Ground Beef)- Very good ground beef.  Full of flavor and nice touch of onions and peppers.

Cheese Quesadilla- My two boys are fans!

I am also a fan of their salsa bar.  They keep it clean, cool and covered!

Thank you Federico's!  You are a welcome addition to Surprise!
