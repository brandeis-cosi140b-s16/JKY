I am originally from San Diego where there are good Mexican food places all over, but have moved away.  So when I visit a large city I always look for some good Mexican food.  I found it here at Don Tortaco.

The carne asada was good, cut into small pieces for easy eating in a burrito or quesadilla.  I had a California burrito that was great and reminded me of my favorite place in San Diego. Portions were good sized also.

I think the salsa/hot sauce makes or breaks a small Mexican restaurant like this one and the salsa here was very good.  There was a salsa bar with veggies and multiple sauces. 

An added bonus was the free wifi that is faster than Starbucks.  This place is a definite must visit each time I am in Vegas
