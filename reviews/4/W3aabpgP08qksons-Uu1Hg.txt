One of my favorite taco shops in town. I have been here multiple times and have yet to be disappointed. Here is a rundown of what I have had.

Al pastor tacos and burrito- I like the tacos, the meat can be a little dry but the salsas take care of that. The burrito had too much rice for me.

Sopes- I have had al pastor, carne asada, and chicken. They are all tasty and piled high with meat, cheese, and lettuce. 

Carne asada tacos and burritos- Another of my favorites. The meat is thin cut and usually very tender.

Flautas- Very good, they are crispy and liberally stuffed. Good with the guac.
