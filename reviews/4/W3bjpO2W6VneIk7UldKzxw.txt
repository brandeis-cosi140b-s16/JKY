I'm giving this place a solid 4 stars.
Grilled chicken, and ribs, over mesquite. Tasty, moist, and unique. I say
Unique because food cooked outside over charcoal IS distinct. A great
bargain too. A whole cut up chicken/w beans and rice for $12. A full rack
O ' ribs for $20. The ribs go fast - so be quick.
This review is for Pollo Mobile 2. Across the street from U -Haul, on Rainbow &
Smoke Ranch. Just to be clear.
