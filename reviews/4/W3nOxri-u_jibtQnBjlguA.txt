I went here for Lunch on Football Sunday 2 weeks ago. It was great! The environment was great! Plenty of TVs showing all major games and I liked they have a DJ playing music while eating. 

The selection of the food was very good, great price value and the quality and taste was great! 

The service was great! The waitress was friendly and did a great job in explaining my food options!
I'll definitely will return next time I'm back in town.
