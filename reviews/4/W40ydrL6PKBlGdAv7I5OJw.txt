I've been here a few times. Not too bad. I like it better than some other...slightly sketchier...places. Their chili rellano burrito is definitely better than the competition, and the carne quesadilla supreme is really good. 

Just don't order the carne quesadilla without making it supreme. It's rather bland!

Service is quick and friendly, and it's a great place to go ruin your workout. :)
