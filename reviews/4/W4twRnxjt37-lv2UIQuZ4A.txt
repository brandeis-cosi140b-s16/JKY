I give this place 4 stars because it all depends on who serves you. I really like the food, it's good. I lived in California and grew up on authentic Mexican food. The only big issue, and it's the issue I have with most Mexican food restaurants is the rice. The rice is dry, instead of moist. It's a little bland as well. The pinto beans are fantastic though. The sweet pork is really good too. It's worth checking this place out, the service is usually fast enough, but watch out for Tuesday evenings, taco Tuesday's are always packed.
