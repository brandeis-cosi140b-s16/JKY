I too ended up here because New Mexican Grill was closed on Sunday. I was looking for something a step up from the chains.  The place is nice inside. Plenty of tables. Mostly clean. My daughter got the chicken nachos. Portion and price - I'd give a 5. But I give the dish a 3. The guacamole was boring. It had a nice big heaping scoop on it too. Maybe next batch! My other daughter got the carne asada burrito. huge. She cut it in half. She rated it OK. Her favorite is a burrito from a chain. I will say that she ate her entire half which was the equivalent size of a full size at the chain. So, leftovers! I got the loaded burrito with green sauce. It's true as the other reviews said. The sauces have kick--I love it! The green sauce is creamy. I am not sure if it was the sight or size of my burrito but I was only able to eat a quarter. It felt like woman vs food. But I give my dish a 5. Their hot salsa is awesome too. It was way too hot for the kids. And I'll have to order the nachos without pico de gallo for my daughter next time....at least until she acquires the taste for heat. My leftovers were incredible for lunch, I think a 5+ on the second day. I still have half a burrito to go for my dinner now....I'm eager to try Tacos N More for breakfast next!
