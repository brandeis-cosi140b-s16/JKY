EPL is my back up low carb fast food meal when nothing else sounds good. 3 chicken legs and a loco salad sets me back less than $5 and is healthy and low carb. This is the EPL closest to my house and I have yet to have an issues in my 20 or so visits to this place. The drive through can be slow, but inside is always very quick!
