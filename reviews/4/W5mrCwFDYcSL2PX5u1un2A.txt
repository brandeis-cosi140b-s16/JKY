I think Habanero's has another location off Stoughton. This location is the same setup as the other one. First, you decide if you want tacos, a burrito, a burrito bowl, or a salad. Then, you choose your meat. There's barbacoa, carnitas (slow-cooked pulled pork, not the fried pork), adobo steak, adobo chicken, al pastor, or veggie. Then, there are a bunch of things you can add, like pico de gallo, sour cream, 3 different salsas, beans, cheese, etc. 

I would recommend you get the 3 taco deal with the carnitas or the chile pork Mexico city style (cilantro, onions, and lime). It is a little piece of heaven and reminds me of home (Texas). It's all pretty cheap (about $6); does not come with sides like beans and rice. They also have horchata and Jarritos (Mexican soda).
