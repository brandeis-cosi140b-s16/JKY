I heard about this place from multiple family and friends who have raved about it so I finally decided to see what all the fuss was about.  Well let's just say I was not real impressed with the food but the service was really good!  The street tacos weren't terrible but nothing great.  I think Sandbar has better tacos, especially the carnitas.  Good prices, good service, good chips and salsa with a cool atmosphere gives it 4 stars
