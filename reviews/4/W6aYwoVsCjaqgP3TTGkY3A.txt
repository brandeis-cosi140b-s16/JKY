Seafood in the desert - Actually pretty good!
Before my spring break drive back I stopped at Mariscos Sinaloa.

Some reviewers aren't fans of the fluorescent lights and the jukebox but they didn't detract from my experience. Originally I was in a rush to get going and thought eating here would be a quick in and out. When I saw the free chips arrive though I settled in for sit-down restaurant mode. 

I got the:
Shrimp Ceviche Tostada
Shrimp Taco
Fish Taco

The tostada part was pretty soggy after a mound of ceviche was on top of it but it didn't matter due to those *Free* chips. One portion of ceviche was literally like a half lb of seafood.

The shrimp and fish tacos were pretty good as well though I was eating them while driving in the Phx traffic jam. The creamy chipotle and hot salsa that come with the tacos are winners as well. 

Now if you crave fish tacos you don't have to drive the 350+ miles to San Diego.
