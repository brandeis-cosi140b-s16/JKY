It wasn't quite cheat day but I decided I needed a splurge! To test the waters I had a "Speedy Gonzales" with Carne Asada tacos (I ordered an extra taco) , chicken enchilada, rice and beans. LOVED the enchilada! Not a fan of the tacos. I prefer street style/ taqueria tacos with less frills and more flavor. So while not terrible, WHEN I go back (because I WILL be back) I will request only onions and cilantro on my tacos. The line was to the door as mentioned by other reviewers so prepare but I'll take that as a good sign!
