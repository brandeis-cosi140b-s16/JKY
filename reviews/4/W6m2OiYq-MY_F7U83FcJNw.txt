I have to admit that I went in to this restaurant and was a little worried after reading the reviews that other Yelpers had given.  I did decide to go in and have my own experience and make my mind up about the place.  

My best friend and I walked in and were immediately greeted by the cute hostess.  We asked to sit outside.  She sat us @ a middle table.  On the advice of my hair dresser we ordered the sangria.  Preston our waiter immediately brought out the chips and salsa.  Asked us if we had ever been there before and explained a few things.  Sangria was terrific.  Good choice on our parts.  Thanks Chris!  Not a TON of choices but different things to look over - different variations on classic mexican plates.  

I ordered the Chicken Chivichangas
Crispy flour tortillas filled with pulled chicken, pinto beans and cotija cheese topped with shaved romaine, red cabbage, chopped cilantro, chopped onions, salsa verde and crema.  This was spicy.  I like spicy.  The kind of spicy that lingers in the back of your throat for several minutes.  The pulled chicken was nicely flavored.  There was a LOT going on on my plate but everything I scooped up tasted just GOOD.  

My best friend ordered 
Pork "Carnitas"
Slow baked adobo marinated pork shoulder, topped with cured red onions and cucumber, served with smoky black bean sauce and fresh tomatillo salsa verde.  She wasn't a fan of the corn tortillas but that was her only dislike.  Everything else was good.  We took the majority of our food home because we were busy gossiping and talking.  

Preston took great care of us.  He was attentive without being smothered.  When we were ordering I "quizzed" him on what he liked and he was very familiar with the menu.  Even offering his two cents when I did order.  Thanks Preston.  

Can't wait to take the hubby back.
