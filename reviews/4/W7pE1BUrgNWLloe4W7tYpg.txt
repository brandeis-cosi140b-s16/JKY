Well, it's no Pedro"s, thankfully.   Went here to check out what the yelpers are talking about.  Got a burrito and a quesadilla.  Right off the bat you can tell that their meat is good just by looking at it.  I started with chicken just to be safe and now I wish I had tried the beef because it looked so darn good.
The quesadilla was good but pretty simple.  The burrito was very good with great portions.  Everything was fresh.
The outside looks like it's a pretty small place but inside it is pretty big and plenty of space for people to sit down and eat in.  Crummy location though.
Will be back for some tacos and the tortas look fantastic.  
Open kitchen so you can watch them cook your meal.  I like that.
