It is hard not to like this Caramba: the staff is very polite and they prepare your food quickly, even when the restaraunt is a little more crowded.  The dining room is set up well to be open and comfortable, with two large TVs that are usually tuned into sports.  There is also a small dining area outside that is smartly tucked away from the very large parking lot of this shopping center, so things don't get to noisy. 

Caramba has a fairly good menu for "fast food" Mexican with fresh ingrediants that at least seem authentic.   It leaps and bounds better than other similar fast food places like Del Taco and Taco Bell and even better than some of the local sit-down Mexican restaraunts.   The prices are noticably more expensive however.   Still, the meals are quite filling and even if it seems like you aren't getting much food for your money, you will walk away full.   

On more than one occassion, I've made the mistake of ordering extra tacos on the side because I was super hungry and ended up eating way to much.
