I have only ever been here for Taco Tuesday, however, I have been to many:) The carne asada is ridiculously delicious and the street tacos are just the right size to be able to try a little of each. The guac is pretty awesome also...they put citrus in it which gives it a different texture and flavor. Very refreshing. Tuesday are all day happy hour, which means select drinks and food items are $1-2 off normal price. The service has been spotty, but for the most part the servers are really great. I have only really noticed a difference with new servers or large parties. Though it's not something that would ever keep me from going back.
