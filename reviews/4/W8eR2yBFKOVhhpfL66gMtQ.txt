I absolutely LOVE Chipotle!! And at this location, they do a great job at moving customers through the line quickly and efficiently -- while keeping everyone happy. They are awesome at keeping the venue clean. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. My best friend and I used to go every Friday afternoon. This place never gets old and the people working really are a joy. The bathroom is very clean. Free refills on your drinks. All around a winner!
