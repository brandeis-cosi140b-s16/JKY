I'll be the first to admit, I haven't really had the best of luck with Mexican food in this town. For some strange reason, a lot of the restaurants that I've visited around here have really fallen short of my expectations, much less, they continued to prove to me that you CAN actually F something as simple as chicken up if you try hard enough (Manuel's, I'm looking at you!). 
Needless to say, with my track record as of late I was a little hesitant when a friend of mine recommended that we do lunch at Casa Reynoso. Despite my initial hesitation, I'm glad I took his word for it because this place exceeded my expectations in almost every way. The location was low-key and unassuming, clean, and had your typical Mexican restaurant atmosphere (including the music accented with accordion...something I'll never really get). The hostess, who was exceptionally cute by the way, not only helped us to our table, but also did double duty as a cashier, and then rounded out the triple play as our server. The chips and salsa were good, although as other reviews have stated, they do charge you beyond the first bowl. Apparently I was feeling adventurous, since I ordered not one, but TWO chicken dishes...I had a combo plate with a chicken enchilada, a chicken taco, and double rice as I don't mess with beans. The meal was solid, my favorite part was the enchilada with big chunks of tender, white meat chicken on top. The enchilada sauce had a hint of brown sugar, as my friend pointed out, and was different but good. The taco was decent too, with a crunchy shell that wasn't soggy from grease like most other places. Our server kept our glasses full, but sadly, disappeared by the end of the meal. Perhaps they decided to have her try her hand in the kitchen as well... Nonetheless, a solid four star experience and I intend to return in the future.
