I've driven by this restaurant every day for the last 2 months and never noticed it. Then I was craving Mexican food and looked up places in the area. It got great reviews - and rightfully so!  Very authentic, and all delicious, freshly prepared food. The waitress (who did speak English) brought me chips and 2 salsas along with the menu. I asked which was hotter and she replied "depends on who's cooking" -- both red and green salsas were on the hot side so I'd wait until you get your drink before trying. Oh, and they have real Mexican Coke in the glass bottles!
Food was inexpensive, and enough for dinner tomorrow night.
Don't worry about the location -- I am a young, single female and felt totally safe.  It's open 7 days a week.
