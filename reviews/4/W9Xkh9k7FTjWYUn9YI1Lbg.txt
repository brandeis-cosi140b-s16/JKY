Better than any of the robertos in town for sure.  The machaca burrito is a must try, the meat is always tender also.  All the menu items are tasty and never dissapoint.  Best option for taco shop food in the southwest.  I did eat the amigo grande burrito also, the cool thing about it is the fact you can put whatever you want in it.  Makes the perfect late night chow, and then will have some left overs to heat up for breakfast to cure your hangover
