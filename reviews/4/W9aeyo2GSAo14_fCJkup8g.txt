It was my first time going to experience Fremont downtown. Upon exiting the parking lot into Freemont led us right to the entrance of SLOTZILLA. Right next to Slotzilla is the international Eatery. My family and I were hungry so we decided to eat there because of their worldly choices. I decided to try to Mexican food because they offered San Diego Style Carne Asada Fries. Let me tell you, I was not let down at all. This is by far the best carne asada style fries ive had outside of San Diego. 
I would recommend this place to all my friends that visit downtown Las Vegas.
