Not sure about all the lesser reviews but this place is a favorite of mine. It's close by so I frequent it whenever I get the chance. The service is great because over the years,  with all the big orders, they have never gotten a single thing wrong! Always exactly what I want and cooked how we like it. The hours are incredible just like all the "Berto's" in the city and they have two drive-thru lanes. They have an awesome staff that never changes, outdoor seating (with a TV) and come on...THEY NEVER CLOSE! All the people I bring here from out of town love it. Definitely worth a shot. Plus you can't beat the prices.

Try the breakfast burritos.
