Not fancy but very tasty!  My husband and I took our 2 kids here for lunch.  It's a small place that's pretty clean and basic inside.  It seemed popular, too.  It was half full when we arrived at 11:30 and by the time we left, there was a line.  There is an order/pick up window where we ordered the green chile burro, chicken enchiladas, a cheese and a chicken quesadilla and a beef tamale.  Our food came up in about 10 minutes.  The burro was amazing, as good as Rosita's Place.  The enchiladas were very good, as was the tamale.  The quesadillas were pretty standard.  Salsa was awesome!  Overall, the food was flavorful with just the right amount of heat.  We all ate until stuffed and still had leftovers.  We are psyched about having this place around the corner from our house!
