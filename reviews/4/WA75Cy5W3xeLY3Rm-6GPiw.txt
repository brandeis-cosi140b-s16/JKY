I would highly recommend this restaurant for lunch or dinner.  Great food with a New Mexican flavor.  Great green chile, nice atmosphere, good patio and well stocked bar. The chicken wrap for lunch has great flavor, wish they offered this dish for dinner. 

They don't advertise much and learning about the restaurant is sort of by word of mouth, but once I found it I keep coming back when visiting Scottsdale.  Good value and pleasant experience.
