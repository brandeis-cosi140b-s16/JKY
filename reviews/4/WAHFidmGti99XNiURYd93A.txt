The food here was yummy. I found this thanks to the YELP app and my inlaws and I went here to grab a quick bite after some shopping. The menu had some very different looking items than the typical mexican eatery I have dined before. My husband had something called a PAMBAZO. It was wonderful goodness. My phone died so I was unable to take a picture after checking in but Pambazo is a type of bread. It was sliced into two and it was filled with papas con chorizo (potatoes with chorizo), shredded lettuce, salsa, crema and queso fresco. I wish my phone did not die because a picture would just make the description pop. I recommend this place to anyone wanted to try some different dishes.
