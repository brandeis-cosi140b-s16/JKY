Checked this spot out due to me having some time to kill,  being in the area and of course yelp reviews.  I had the ribeye taco combo and they were great, cooked to perfection and included avocado and gac,  most places charge extra for this so this was an added pleasure to my experience. 

I definitely have this place on my spot to revisit after my visit today.
