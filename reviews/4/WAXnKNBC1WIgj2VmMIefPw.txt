I tried Sloppi Jo at this month's StrEATS. My husband and I have a divide and conquer approach to sampling all the foods trucks. While he was in line Fukuburger, I went in search of my own eats to share. I came to Sloppi Jo and I was overwhelmed by the menu, it ALL sounded heavenly, I couldn't choose. I wanted everything. I knew I had to return with the man.

Well, he was just as torn as I. So, we ordered the sloppy jo, the BBQ pork sandwich and the mac n cheese. We went overboard considering this was our last truck of the night. The star was that pork sandwich, tender a little sloppy and oh, so good. The sloppy jo was fine and the mac n cheese was real tasty when it was piping hot. As soon as it cooled it became a congealed mess.

Next time, I must try the tacos.
