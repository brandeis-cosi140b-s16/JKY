Family owned and super friendly service. The cashier is always smiling and is open to small chit chat as long as she's not busy. Her husband mans the charcoal grill in the kitchen. They keep the menu short and to the point: Tacos, caramelos (quesadilla with carne Asada on flour tortilla), and vampiros (tostada layered with refried beans and carne Asada). The meat can use a little more flavor but it's cooked well and tender. I think they also have flan and a few other items but I've never ordered anything else other than the authentic Mexican bottled sodas. The salsa bar includes various items aside from just salsa. All in all, this is a great spot for a quick bite to eat. Parking can be a bit of a hassle but they have an agreement with the adult store next door to use their lot for customer parking. 

Please tip them well. They're really close to my job and I'd love to see them stay in business.
