I don't eat that much Mexican food, honestly, so I might not have the best-founded opinion, but I liked it. The salsa and chips were better than any other I'd had-- spicy and flavourful, not at all water-downed-- and the carne asada, as many had written below, is absolutely wonderful. Basically a bunch of meat, cheese, sour cream, etc. piled atop either fries or chips, your choice. The churros were also great, with a really tasty... unsure if strawberry or cherry, but it was delicious either way... sauce that I've never seen them paired with before. Nothing I had was at all greasy/tasted like it was heated up in the microwave/whatever else might warrant a complaint. A pretty solid 4 IMO.
