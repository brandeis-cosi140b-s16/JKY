Highlights/lowlights

1) great/authentic food
2) friendly service
3) more of a lunch place than a dinner place

El Poblano is a great place for a quick lunch! The food is very authentic, Mexican food. Friendly service, great salsa, and a Mexican bakery make this place great! 

The atmosphere is very casual, definitely more of a lunch stop than a dinner place. Free chips and salsa are provided and the servers are quick to refill chips when you run out! You can get a "Mexican Coke" in a glass bottle - delicious. The service is nice. Although it took awhile for someone to come over to us initially with the menus, once the servers knew we were there they were very friendly. Menu items include enchiladas, tacos, chile relleno etc. The food is great, really reasonably priced and the portions are generous.

Definitely consider EL Poblano if you are looking for a quick, authentic Mexican lunch!
