Went looking for Carolina's on 16th st and buckeye got there and they were no longer at that location, went in search of a different mexican place and found Los Compadres.  

The food here or at least what I ordered was very good. Combo #1 (Beef Taco, Cheese Enchilada, Tostada and an Extra Taco)  I was a bit disappointed as I was lead to believe that the combo came with beans and rice, however my plate was devoid of such fare...which is a large part why i'm only offering 4 stars.

I will eat here again MANY times in the future, so if anyone is in the area or out to try something new this place has pretty amazing food for a decent price.

Oh and one more thing...at first I was a little put off by the salsa, but once I ate it I liked it a lot. The more I ate the more I liked it.  It had a really good flavor and I pretty much wanted to drink it.
