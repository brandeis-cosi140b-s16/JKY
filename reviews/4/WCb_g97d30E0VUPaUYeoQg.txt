I've eaten at the Indian School location before, and it was average at best. Went here last week for their Monday/Tuesday $6.99 taco/cheese enchilada plate. Not crowded. A bit disconcerting to have the hostess pouring salsa into takeaway cups on the front counter. 

Got seated quickly, ordered the special, got free chips and salsa. I prefer a mix of the hot and normal salsa, do make sure to get both. The server was above average. 

The food came about three minutes after ordering, and was nice and hot. Nice beef taco. The sauce on the enchilada was average. 

I don't think I'd pay normal prices here, but the special was fine.
