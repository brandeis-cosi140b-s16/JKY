I love chipotle, especially for us Gluten Free and Vegan Folks. Their bowls are amazing,  although I avoid eating corn, their corn tortillas are delightful. I usually just get a bowl with Brown Rice, lettuce, black beans, and guacamole... So yum! I like that they try and provide their customers with organic and or all natural produce at all times possible. That alone shows me they care about their customers.  The staff at this location have always been very friendly. The food is great, the staff is wonderful but the down side is the parking lot. Very small and tight. It usually isn't too big of a hassle to handle, but sometimes I've had to wait a few minutes to be able to park. In the mood for some simple, but very tasty food? Chipotle is the answer.
