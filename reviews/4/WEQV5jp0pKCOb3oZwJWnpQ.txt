I loved it!  but maybe it was because the salsa bar was such a huge hit with me.  Though, when I did ask a question about a specific salsa, the waitress couldnt help me answer....confusion/language barrier, whichever.  

I went in Dec. 2011. Service was okay...food- I have no complaints.  Id definitely go again.
