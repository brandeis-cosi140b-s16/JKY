My husband and I ate here on a Thursday evening and were impressed with the food, the service, and the ambiance.  We were seated in a large booth that was located near the coolest wood-carved wall that looked like it was a "Day of the Dead" theme.  It was fantastic!

Our waiter was attentive, but not overly attentive, and allowed for us to look over the menu and make our decisions without rushing our meal.  He recommended excellent margaritas for both me and my husband, and was cheerful and polite every time he visited the table.

My husband had the Taco Dinner and said that the tacos and accompanients were all delicious.  The meat was not too greasy that the shell softened, and the rice and beans were expertly seasoned.  I had the whitefish ceviche as a meal, and it was amazing.  The portion was large enough that it was filling on its own, accompanied by a few chips and a dash of salsa to give it a little extra kick.

My husband enjoyed his specialty margarita that was made with a splash of pineapple juice, and I was pleased with my margarita choice that was recommended by the waiter that was made with specialty tequila, lime juice, and agave nectar.

Overall this was a wonderful dining experience, and we will certainly be back!  Cheers!
