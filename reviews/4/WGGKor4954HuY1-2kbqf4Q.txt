Atmosphere is Very pleasant, the service is very good. Menudo homemade and is very tasty, enchiladas are all very good, the bean dip is tasty with the salsa which is brought to every table. The avocado dip know as guacamole is very tasty but very high in calories. The cactus appetizer is very yummy served with either homemade flour or corn tortillas.  We first learn of this location on Cico De Mayo and have been back several times. One thing I must insist that you do not order are the tacos unless you want to become very disappointed like I did after ordering myself and my date at lunch a la carte two tacos and tostada de ceviche. Only the tacos were very small and fried with maybe a tablespoon and half of chicken and cheese combined and served over shredded lettuce.  These taco's looked like something you would generally avoid at Jack In-Box.
