Saw a write up on a Vegas website with great review so I put it on my to do list.
Apparently this place has been here for 9 years, that's a certainly a good sign.

Great service.

I had the 4 taco plate; 2 barbacoas y 2 asadas.  Asada was very good, barbacoa was also good but a little fatty, it's goat meat BTW.  They have Mexican Coke which I much prefer.

Wife had Pastor and chicken tacos.  She liked this place better than Tacos El Gordo and she's Mexican.
