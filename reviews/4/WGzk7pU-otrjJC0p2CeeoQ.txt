Probably the best chain I've eaten at.

I had the street-style carnitas tacos, because I'm always all over stuff with carnitas. The soft corn tortillas were on the tiny side (even for street tacos, which generally annoy people because they're so small.) but they heaped the pork on, which made he tacos not so skimpy even though the tortillas were small. The pico de gallo and avocado slices were a good touch too.

Probably the only thing they should do to the dish is add more cilantro, actual taqueria tacos usually have copious amounts of it, and the places I go are definitely heavy handed.

The service was good, although for some strange reason my dad's food was brought out beforehand, and no indication was given that the server couldn't carry it all, etc. Just "oh here's your enchiladas". He did show up two minutes later with the other three dishes, but those two minutes were kind of awkward. Might have been that the kid was new?

Over all, definitely a solid choice.
