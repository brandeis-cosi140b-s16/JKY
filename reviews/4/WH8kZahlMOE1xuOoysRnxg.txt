I saw the mixed reviews, but I am on a quest  for good Mexican food, so I tried it anyway and was pleasantly surprised. The chips were warm, the salsa was fresh tasting, and there was a chunky vs smooth option. I turned down the offered queso or guacamole and was glad I did, as the menu had them listed at $4-5. My husband got the specialty margarita and it tasted good, though he asked for it frozen and it was a bit chunky (from the sound of the blender, it may be on its way out).  I got the chicken quesadilla and it was no normal saggy tortilla with a wad of cheese - it was over an inch thick, packed with sizzling, well-spiced chicken, roasted veggies, and Mexican cheese. It was warm and comforting. I love refried beans and these were no exception, though they were more of a sauce/liquid consistency than I am used to. I used them to add another flavor to my quesadilla. Husband got one of the more authentic specialties and cleaned his plate before I could try it. It seemed obvious that not many people order dessert - the waitress brought our check before offering dessert. We got the tres leches cake and that was the one part of the meal that did not live up to the rest, as it seemed pretty store-bought and assembled (though still tasty). Overall, it's not our #1 for Mexican, but it was a solid choice and I would go back.
