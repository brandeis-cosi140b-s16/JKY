Great San Diego-style casual Mexican food/Americanized Mexican food on Rt. 51 .
The prices have crept up a bit since they opened a year ago.  A carne asada burrito is $7.50 which is only a dollar less than a bigger fancier sit-down Mexican restaurant like Rey Azteca / Patron / etc.  
Their fish burritos and tacos are the best you'll find in PGH.  Very delicious  !j
