Didn't actually succeed in my first attempt to eat here, I tried to come in near close on a Thursday and was turned away at 9:55 which would have been fine if my buddy had not called in to say we were arriving and the person who answered the phone said that they were staying open till 10.  To make matters worse, the hostess was not present at her station and even when she finally came, she proceeded to chat away for a couple minutes before noticing that we were just standing there.  Off the strip, I wouldn't be surprised, on the strip, completely unacceptable, -1 star.

Second attempt, I had the grilled fillet and shrimp enchilada.  Excellent dish, a little salty, but otherwise a powerful combo with the cayenne sauce supporting the milder flavors of the enchilada and the lobster sauce an excellent contrast to the fillet.  Peach lemonade, love the added carbonation, might I suggest an iced tea version? We started with the Top chef appetizer, a nice trio with shrimp in some sort of dark sauce (political statement on Gulf?), assorted greens, and a breaded something (can't exactly remember what the filler was).  The portions were skimpy, I'm a big eater.  Pineapple upside down cake, OK, nothing spectacular, standard cake with pineapple mixed in with pineapple ice cream.
