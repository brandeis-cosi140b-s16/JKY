My review is for their carne asada fries. This is the only reason why I come here. They serve it in large portions with heaping amount of carne asada and it's so GOOD. 

The staff is usually nice. I think they probably look confused because their english is limited. 

I've also tried their fish tacos, carne asada burrito and tacos. The fish taco was not good at all. No flavor. The carne asada burrito was a 6/10. I've had better and same goes for the tacos.
