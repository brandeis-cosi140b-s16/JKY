One of the most unique items I've ever had the Sonoran hot dog. I ordered the Carne Asada tacos as well and they were very plain and only with salsa flavorful. If you stick to the Sonoran hot dog you will not be disappointed. The bun is soft and the hot is stuffed with all the kinds of additional ingredients. I felt like I was eating a hot dog burrito with a soft bun instead of a tortilla. Overall very good food and service was efficient.
