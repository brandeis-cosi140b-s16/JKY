Awesome service, tasty food, strong margaritas, what more could you ask for?  We had the chicken quesadilla to start, and I had the chicken tortilla soup.  I did have to add salt to the soup and also threw in some salsa to kick it up a notch on the spice factor, but overall 2 thumbs up.  We'll likely be back.
