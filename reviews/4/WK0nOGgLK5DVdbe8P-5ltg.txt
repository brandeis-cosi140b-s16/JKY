This place is nice for an "American" flavored Mexican food. Kinda pricey but the service was great. We ordered a couple of appetizers, the Mexican corn(delicious and $5 at HH) and a cheese crisp. Good sizes. I ordered a tamale and cheese enchilada, man friend ordered fajitas. When they dropped off the food it was the wrong plate, I was fine with it but the server was very apologetic, but like I said, I would've eaten it nbd. She came back and told me that she had mistaken the order and came back with the correct order and even comped the meal, which I totally wasn't looking for. They were very apologetic and attentive and because of our first experience I will definitely be back
