Great Mexican comfort food... Love it!

I always try the staple for my Cheese Enchilada and a Chili Rellano.  The sauces are made very well with a complex spice mix.  They made it right.  Have had a California Burrito that was great (carne asada) and Machaca and Chicken burritos.  

The chicken burrito was pretty bland and the meat was old and hard (way overcooked) could have been from the night before. I was there on a Sunday and the cooks looked bored so I think they were slow and getting rid of old ingredients.  Anyway.  I have had 3  - 5 star meals here and  1 - 2 star meal,  so there you go..... 

I still will go there, overall it is pretty good, maybe Ill dine in and say something to the manager if it sux.....
