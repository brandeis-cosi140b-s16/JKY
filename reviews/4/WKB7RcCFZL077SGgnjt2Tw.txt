Mmmmm Chipotle.

The location is clean and organized. The employees are friendly. The food is yummy. The only way they can improve is if the employees had a little more experience. The woman who assisted me and my husband was extremely distracted. She would ask us if we wanted something and then direct her attention elsewhere during our answer, then ask us the same thing again. I'm not sure what the deal was but it was annoying. Besides that our visit was great and the employees were nice.
