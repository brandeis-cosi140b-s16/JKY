My owners went there last night and they were smiling when they got home.  This is the fourth time they have been there and have been in a good mood after.  They also brought some leftovers but did not give me any so they must have liked it.  Don't know why they call it a doggy bag?

They said the queso dip is just ok since it is basically just bland cheese that is kind of watery.  The chips are good and you can ask for other sauces other than the one they bring you.

The two fusion dishes they tried were good.  The Flautas are big and have great flavor provided by the honey citrus cilantro slaw, citrus chili red sauce and Cotija cheese.  It does not come with anything else but that is plenty.  The Ancho Crusted Pork Chop was also nice.  A large thick chop with great flavor and nicely presented.

They have also tried some of the more common dishes like the Chimichangas and Carne Asada.  Both were good but not that remarkable and similar to what you can find in the dozens of other "Mexican" restaurants in Charlotte with the standard sides of rice and re fried beans.

The inside of the restaurant is nice although the entrance is a bit strange, apparently due to the layout of the kitchen from the prior establishment.  The bar is very small and will likely not become a hang out for locals.  It is, however, a nice addition to the local dining establishments and has a more neighborly feel than the Concord Mills restaurants.

Service has always been good
