Now don't let my profile picture fool you, I am not, in the traditional sense, a Mexican. Shocking, I know. But, I do know my Mexican food, and Los Favoritos is awesome! Wonderful in fact. Delicious, cheap, clean and delicious.

  This morning I got a bacon breakfast burrito with beans inside, and if you don't know, their breakfast burritos are their bread and butter, the money maker, and they never disappoint. The only problem you may ever have is the bacon being a little salty, and even then the always incredible hot sauce (or salsa, whatever) is there to save the day. The carne asada is very good, seasoned well and almost always very tender, the beans, which are cooked with wonderful, wonderful lard, are always just firm enough, never just a pile of mush, never watery, the chicken is juicy and tender, I just can't say enough about it. The only negative I have is that one of the counter girls is a bit rude, and there is a military service recruitment center right next door, so at times you may be bothered a little by them, but come on, they're serving our country, so it can be forgiven. 

  Los Favoritos is the best fast Mexican restaurant that I have discovered so far. Do yourself a favor and give them a visit, at either location (Tempe, Chandler) and tell them Kevin sent you, they'll probably just look at you funny, but why not?
