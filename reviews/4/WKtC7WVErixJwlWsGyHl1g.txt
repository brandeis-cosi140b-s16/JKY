Filly B's and Revo B are not even in the same ball park.

Fillaburto's=Greasy Jalisco that only deserves late night, drunken cravings

Revo B's=Fresh, flavorful (my carne asada was mouthwatering), reasonably priced, and good for any meal!

I usually judge a good Mexican inspired restaurant by the salsa.  Revo's salsas definitely passed my test.  

I only had the burrito, so I cannot speak for any other side dishes. I liked the way my burrito was crisp on the outside and simple goodness on the inside.  

Sure the portions aren't the biggest, but I think we should all cut back on eating the full 1lb burrito at Filly B's and Chipotle***and people wonder why they are fat!

I will definitely be back to try the Lemonada, and the chicken.  The only thing that keeps me from giving the full 5 stars is the decor.  I think it is a bit overdone and tacky.  They should tone it down a notch with the mirrors and colors.
