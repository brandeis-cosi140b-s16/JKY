This place is a lot better than I thought it would be.  Came here two weeks in a row on a Friday night... $2 Bud Select's, so already we're doing OK.  They have a Guitar Hero competition, and if you play you get a free beer.  Ate some food tonight and it was pretty solid.  No real complaints about this place.  If I'm in the area or am at Hard Rock trying to kill time, I'll definitely stop in here again.
