My favorite taco place. Open pretty late, cheap, great food. My last of many visits was for a pork barbacoa taco, lengua taco and a soda for my buddy all came to a whopping total of $5.

Order inside, chefs outside cooking, not many tables but worth it even if you cant get a table (there are only 4 or 5).
