This place is great!  The food is kind of an upscale Mexican compared to what I'm used to but the prices are affordable.  

I had the chicken enchiladas and my girlfriend had the fish taco's both of which were delicious and good portions.

If you have a drink you have to try the margarita.  It's a decent drink (I'm not a huge fan of them anyway) but it's huge.  Probably the size of 2 or 3 regular drinks.  And a fair price at $9.
