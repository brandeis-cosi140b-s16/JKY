I have only been to this establishment once and it was a very decorative environment to be in. Everyone is dressed to impress. The food was a bit small in proportion and a bit over priced but it's a good destination to bring a small party of friends or family. The food was a mixture between Asian and Mexican which I have never seen nor tasted. Fresh ingredients and a great staff has really made this restaurant pop! I'll be back.
