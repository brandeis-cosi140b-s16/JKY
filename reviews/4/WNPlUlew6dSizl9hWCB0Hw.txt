I've heard a lot of people talk about the sweet potato enchiladas at Frank and Fina's. I finally got around to trying them and yeah, they were good. They weren't the transcendent culinary experience I expected, but they were tasty. It's basically just mashed sweet potatoes in a tortilla and topped with red sauce, cheese and sour cream. They weren't too sweet and the sauce added a delicious blend of spices to it. The dish came with rice and black beans. It wasn't a cheap lunch ($11), but it was good.

The service was ridiculously quick. I probably waited around 5 minutes after ordering before the food came out. So, if you're looking for a quick spot for a sit-down lunch head over here.
