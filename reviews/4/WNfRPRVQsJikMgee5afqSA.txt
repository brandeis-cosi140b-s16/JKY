My girlfriend and I were seated right away on a Friday night around 6:30pm. We opted to sit outside on the patio. One section was reserved for a large party so I was surprised that we were able to get a table so quick. Inside was pretty packed and there was some live music going on near the entrance.

Our server was very attentive and gave a lot of great suggestions. We ordered a carafe of sangria (red) which was $18. Excellent deal. We probably got about 4 glasses out of it as the ice melted, but it never tasted watered down. Fruity but not too sweet.

I ordered the cheese enchiladas and she ordered the pork burrito. We both had black beans and rice. The enchiladas come flat, in a cast iron skillet. My dish was perfect - saucy, just enough spice, consistent cheese all of the way through. The rice was a little more wet than I prefer but my dinner date enjoyed it. She ordered her burrito enchilada style with green sauce. The only downside was that the pork was a little too salty but she enjoyed it anyway.

Drinks, two entrees, complimentary chips and salsa (awesome salsa, btw) - $45. There is a window near the courtyard for tacos and possibly some other easy options which I want to check out. We'll definitely be back.
