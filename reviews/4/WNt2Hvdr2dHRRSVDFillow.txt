This is probably the closest place I have near me if I am craving some mexican food. I usually get the adobada burrito. Its really good and the staff is good too. I never had a complaint there at all. They are open most of the time too, sometimes even 24 hours. So, if you looking for something decent or craving a late night mexican meal you can't go wrong with this place.
