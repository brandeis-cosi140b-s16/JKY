This was recommended to me by a co-worker, which unless you know this place is here chances are you will not find it. The food was as expected, good Mexican fare. The chips were warm, salsa was homemade and the overall entr√©e selection was the basic combination of tortilla-meat-cheese. I would not say it is a 5 star place because the food did not blow me away, but the 4 star rating is because within a certain distance of sun city, this is the best Mexican you may fine. The atmosphere is a little odd, so don't bring a date, but the food is nice and you can taste the passion for the culture in the food.
