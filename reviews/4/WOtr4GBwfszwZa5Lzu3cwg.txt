I have been eating here forever!  Since I was a kid!  The food is always good an the salsa is good but not the best I've ever had. The beans are eh.  I would give it 5 stars but last time I went our waitress ignored us and we had to get up and find her when we needed something.  Every other time the service was great. I have noticed the the staff gets a little older each year.
