Went yesterday cuz I was craving chipotle but didn't want to drive all the way to one. 
Minus one star cuz they charge extra for queso. I got a queso chicken burrito(5 of 5), chips (3of5), guac (4of5), and some pico (2of5) and the total was 10 bucks. 
There were two half naked sluts in line in front of me and i swear they took 15 minutes to order. They asked for a sample of EVERYTHING on the line and had specific instructions about the placement of each individual shrimp on their salad. One of them asked for her corn to be "evenly sprinkled" instead of just tossed on her salad. The other one pointed at each food item and asked one at a time if they were organic. 
Kudos to the very patient Zabas staff for not hopping over the counter and bludgeoning one of those bimbos with a burrito.
