Alright, another chain restaurant. Chipotle is Chipotle no matter where you go. They win on consistency.

What makes this one in particular stand out is the only thing that's different here: The people. Fast and friendly very aptly describes them. As far as speed, when business is slow, I'm pretty sure I've managed to be in and out of this place in less than a minute. It was kinda crazy. That was even including smiles and a couple jokes. Seriously, who can manage that?

I'm definitely glad this is right by my work. It makes for a great quick lunch grab!
