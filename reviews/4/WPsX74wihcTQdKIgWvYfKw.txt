Great variety of very fun tacos (broader selection than Paco's, and at least as tasty).  Street corn was great.  Mahi mahi was plainer tasting than I expected, though everything else on the plate picked up the slack for it.  

Went early on a Monday so not fair to judge its atmosphere.  Server was very upbeat and friendly ... was heading for a very strong tip until she inexplicably disappeared for a verrrry long time when we had obviously finished up.  Bizarre.  

We will give it another try, to be sure.  Very yummy!  Holds up its end of the family name very well.
