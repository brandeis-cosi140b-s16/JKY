Fantastic food!  The brûlée burger is absolutely amazing.  Explosion of flavors as you bite into this burger.  I love this place and consider myself somewhat of a burger connoisseur.  My only complaint is the prices, very very pricey.  It was $9 for just the burger no drink or sides.  Great food though.
