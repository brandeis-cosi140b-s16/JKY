I don't crave Mexican food very often at all, but I think Chipotle is a great fast to-go place when you're just wanting a good taco, salad, or burrito.

I was impressed that despite the growing lunch line forming, the employees at the counter assisted the customers very quickly! I was ordering and had my food in hand within minutes. 

We had the steak salad and taco. Can't complain, it was tasty, custom-made with all your choice of fixings, and wrapped up ready to go. 

A good choice for lunch, I'd say...
