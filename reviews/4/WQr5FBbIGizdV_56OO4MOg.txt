My husband drives by this place on his weekly route so we thought we'd try it for lunch. I was surprised that at 2 pm on a Sunday afternoon about 1/2 of the tables were still full. There isn't a lot of seating in this little place but the service was fantastic. The chips, salsa and hot sauces were a great  start to the meal! Flaky chips with great crunch, yum!

 My hubs got chicken fajitas. Great seasoning on the fixings. His sides were rice and grilled veggies. The grilled veg were nicely cooked without being mushy. 

I got pollo los amigos ( I think). It was chicken with onions, green pepper, and mushrooms, covered in cheese. My sides were refried beans and rice. I enjoyed that the beans were not completely pulverized and still had actual pieces of beans in them. Flavor on the beans was just okay though. The main dish was cooked perfectly and presented pleasantly. I was a bit unsure about the corn tortillas, as I don't usually enjoy dark colored ones, but the chicken and that lovely green sauce completely made up for them. We will certainly be going back again!
