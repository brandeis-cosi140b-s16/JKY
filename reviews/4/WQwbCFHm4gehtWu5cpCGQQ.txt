We are from out-of-state and my husband and I saw this reviewed on yelp. The service was excellent and the little place was very clean. As soon as we sat down they brought over fresh warm chips and salsa. Both excellent. We both got the chicken hard taco combo. This was the best rice we have ever eaten!  The beans were very good also. We liked the way they marinated the chicken used in the tacos. The reason I did not give it a five is because the shells are pre-fab and the portions are a little on the small side.
