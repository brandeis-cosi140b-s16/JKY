I suppose I hold warm fuzzy memories of Cantina Laredo because it's the first real dinner date I had with the boyfran, but I think I'd love this place regardless. It's more fancy than your average, run of the mill, drench everything in queso dip, Americanized Mexican place. (Not that there's anything wrong with places like that. Heck no.) It IS a chain, albeit a small and tasteful one, rather than an On The Border-esque clusterfuck.

I ordered the enchiladas de avocado and booooy howdy were they delicious! Served over saut√©ed spinach and bursting with avocado and artichokes, they were an awesome veggie entree. The tomatillo sauce covering them was divine, but unfortunately there was a sour cream drizzle (not described on the menu) that I had to scrape off (sour cream = barf) thus removing lots of the sauce. Wah!

Our server was kind of crazy town and spastic, but overall it was an awesome experience. We'll be back!
