First time eating here on 9.27.08 (Saturday) about 7:30pm with reservations made earlier in the day.  Guac was good, nice salsa and bean dip with chips;  impressed with the quality of meat in both the beef enchilada and chicken taco (only shredded is offered, which works for me!).  Others had carnitas; I tasted the dish, but it was too salty for me.

Cadillac margaritas were very good. 

A lot of dishes under $10 bucks, but majority of us had $11 - $15 dishes.  For eleven of us with tax and tip was about $275.00 (not a bad deal considering 6 beers, 5 Cadillacs and desserts).
