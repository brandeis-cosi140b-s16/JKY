The menu here is strangely similar to Roberto's taco shop. Do the same people own it?  
 
I ordered the special of the day - 3 chicken enchiladas with green sauce. The chicken on its own was tender but not memorable. The green sauce was a little watery but just spicy enough. The meal came with rice, beans, and a medium drink-all for $ 5.50. In other words, an average meal at a good price.

I am giving this place 4 stars for the one menu item that stood out. The carne asada fries were amazing!  Crispy shoestring fries topped with steak, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, beans, onions, tomatoes, and cilantro -YES!

The place is located in a dumpy area of Henderson -but a solid option if you want good fast Mexican food.
