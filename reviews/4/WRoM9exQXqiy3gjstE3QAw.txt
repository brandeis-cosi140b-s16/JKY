If you're looking for more authentic Mexican in Pittsburgh, this is your spot. Satisfying and flavorful portions at a low price point. I had a chicken quesadilla (love that it comes with free guac!) and a carnitas taco. Each were around $3, such a steal. The homemade tortilla chips were a win too.

Also, love that it's a BYOB and if you bring your own tequila, they will provide margarita mix!
