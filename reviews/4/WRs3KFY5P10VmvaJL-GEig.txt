This was a great find. I had a yummy carne asada burrito for only $4.95. I am stuffed. Good food, clean and friendly staff. I talked to them in Spanish, which was fun for me. 

I was here for a conference at the M Resort and so I just found this place on Yelp and came here because it had good reviews.
