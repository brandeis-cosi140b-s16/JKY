I hate going to a restaurant I haven't been to in a long time and discovering the food just isn't as good as I remember it being...luckily, that is far from the case with Tacos Jalisco. 
I don't know what people are ordering that is so bland and diarrhea-inducing, but I got two steak tacos and a cheese quesadilla today and they were even better than I remember. The steak is perfectly done and very flavorful. Add a light amount of sauce and onions and it's perfect. And the quesadilla...oh man...that cheese and sour cream is so damn good! Best sour cream I've ever had. 
Another thing I like about it is that the food is simple- The steak tacos don't come with a pile of bland rice or a pound of shaved lettuce to make the plate look full like they do it at most Mexican restaurants. Just the tacos, the quesadillas, and some sauce. All for less than $8 with a bottle of water. Plus, I felt great afterwards...no bowel-related issues to speak of. 
But I'm writing way too much about this place...I just wanted to share my excitement in rediscovering it today.
