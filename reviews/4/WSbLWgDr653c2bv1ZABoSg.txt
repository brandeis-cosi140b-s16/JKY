I I was recently in Arizona and had the pleasure of eating at this establishment.  From the moment you walk in you are surrounded by a pleasant atmosphere and great service.  The menu has a wide variety of food and the chips and salsa appetizer is fresh and tasty.  I recommend the Steak Diablo but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  For those who brave the cold Arizona winters, they have a great patio with a fireplace close by.  Overall, a great restaurant with excellent food and atmosphere.
