This Mexican-food lover is adding Roberto's to my top ten favorite Mexican food restaurants of all time. Yes, it is just counter-service, and the service is neither here nor there, but the food is muy bueno! Get chips and cheese (simply tortilla chips with a dusting of grated melted cheddar) and anything carnitas. The salsa bar is fresh and clean, and they have horchata and (a bit too sweet) aqua frescas.
