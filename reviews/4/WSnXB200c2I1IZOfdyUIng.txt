One of Lake Wylie's better choices. 

I've only ever been here for lunch with coworkers, but we always enjoy our food and the accommodating staff. They are accustomed to splitting checks and don't make a big deal about it like some places. 

I always get the juevos rancheros (lunch menu) but everything always looks and smells great. 

Service is usually pretty quick and their chips and salsa are very nice. Salsa is just slightly on the spicy side, but there is hot sauce on the table if you need to kick it up a notch. 

They have lots of booths for more intimate dining, and a few sets of tables that can be pushed together for larger groups. 

Order from the lunch menu for lower prices, smaller (but still plenty) portions, and quick service.
