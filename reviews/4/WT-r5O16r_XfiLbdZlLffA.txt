To be frank, I love Chipotle.  I can probably eat it every day....  shh.... don't tell my wife.

So when it comes to the food, it's the same no matter where you go.  I will say that it's a little less spicy than some.  But it's interesting.  Now as far as location, this place has absolutely sucky parking but you can see it from Eastern like a lighthouse in the rough seas.   I love the look from the outside, and the outdoor seating.

The inside is also pretty small, non-typical setup and the line area is completely different from most Chipotle's.  Most of the time, the seating is right up against the ordering area, whereas this one is off to the side.  The line area is pretty short too so I'm guessing they either 1) get customers through quickly or 2) don't get many customers.

I'm going to go with the former since there's always people there it seems.   Nothing you can do about the parking, and the people who prepare the food and take your money seem pretty cheerful which is always a good sign.  Believe me.... nothing like a disgruntled food prep worker that will make you wonder what went into your burrito.

All in all, it's a good chain but they get a push in their ratings for picking a good outward facing location that really shines while driving towards Anthem.
