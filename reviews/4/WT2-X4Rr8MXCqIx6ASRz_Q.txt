Love the red chicken enchiladas, they're spicy and fresh and amazing. Beans and rice are fine, nothing bad or spectacular. They are not open late, I think they close at 6 and are not open Sundays. The neighborhood is rundown and crappy but this place attracts all kinds of people from business to casual because the food is just that good. Oh and it's really cheap.
