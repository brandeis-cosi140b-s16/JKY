I came here for breakfast a couple times and I like it :). The salsa that comes with their chips is spicy :). Finally a place with a salsa that is spicy enough !!!  There is another good Mexican place nearby called Caroline but that's mostly a take out place that u want to order and pick up.  This place is more of a sit down restaurant with great service and good food.  It's only drawback is it's pretty obscure and in a bad part of town, otherwise definitely worth a visit :)
