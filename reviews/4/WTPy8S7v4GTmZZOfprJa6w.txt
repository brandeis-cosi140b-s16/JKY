Thanks YELP! (again)!  I really like this place and would have never found it if it wasn't for YELP!

I've eaten there several times now, both for lunch and dinner, excellent Mexican seafood - very authentic.  Great flavor, great salsa in a (very) casual environment that gives a lot of the local hispanic flavor of Guadalupe!  The music on the jukebox is often traditional Mexican Mariachis and everyone speaks Spanish - a great meal and great bargain!
