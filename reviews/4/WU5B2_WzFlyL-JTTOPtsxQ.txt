We are from out of town and stopped in because the happy hour menu was enticing. The food was okay, the drinks were great... We had the house margarita and a couple specialties. You could tell the tequila used was high quality. It was smooth and flavorful. 

If ever we are in Scottsdale again we'll definitely stop in for a drink and a laid back atmosphere.
