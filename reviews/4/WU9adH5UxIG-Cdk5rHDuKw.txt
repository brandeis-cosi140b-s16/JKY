Service is fantastic, always friendly.  I love the grilled veggie burro, and also the portabello and poblano taco!  My son loves the cheese quasadilla kids meal, it's sort of rolled like a cheesy burro which makes it easy for him to manage.  On our most recent trip my mom tried the grilled grande bowl and really enjoyed it, she said it was perfect for summer, not as heavy as a burro but very yummy.
