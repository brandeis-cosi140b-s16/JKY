I agree with some other reviewers that the inside of this restaurant could use some work. However, imo the food more than makes up for the lack of ambience! The cheesesteak I was served was gigantic and absolutely delicious! I went back another day to try the mexican fare, I had a (giant) shredded beef chimichanga with rice and beans, a side of guacamole, two different tacos, and just in case that wasn't enough food...an order of beer battered onion rings (I did share with my wife)! Everything was excellent and plentiful! Please make a stop here if you like good food, you won't regret it! Next time I'll try a burger...
