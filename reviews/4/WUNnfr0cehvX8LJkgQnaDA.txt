Great fast food Mexican food. I had the number one combination plate which was a crispy taco cheese enchilada rice and beans. The taco is nice and crispy and very flavorful. The cheese enchilada was great, especially when I combined it with my chips. Love love love the hot sauce which is served in a bottle so you can squirt it directly on your food.
