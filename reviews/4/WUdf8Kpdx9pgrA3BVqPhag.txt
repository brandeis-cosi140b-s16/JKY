Komex is one of those places where a little goes a long way.  $10 gets you a lot of food, and the food is good.  The food is also consistent, with this location serving the same dishes with the same flavors as the original spot.

I've stuck with their fusion offerings, since fusion is in the restaurant name.  The tacos, tostadas, and flautas are my go to dishes.  Taking this style of food and using Korean style meats works out quite well, with the pork being my favorite meat.  Service is friendly and food has always been fresh.  With the larger restaurant space, this location is a great place to stop by for a quick lunch or small dinner at a good price.
