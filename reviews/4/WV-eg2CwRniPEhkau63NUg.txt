My boyfriend and I stopped in since we stay around the corner, and we used their Yelp deal -- $10 for $20. The menu is well-priced. We ordered the chicken and cheese enchiladas, chicken and cheese quesadilla, some fish tacos, and one of each tostada (shrimp & ceviche). We enjoyed everything but the enchiladas; my boyfriend says it might be the sauce, but we also came in around closing so this may play a part. They're very friendly; if i'm in the mood for some quick Mexican food I'll probably head here since it's in walking distance.
