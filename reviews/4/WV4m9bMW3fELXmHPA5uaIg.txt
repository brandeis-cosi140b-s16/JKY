Definitely a favorite of mine on the Westcyde. Just off the 215 on Decatur. Phrank the owner and the crew are very welcoming. 

So far, I've had the carne asada burrito, asada breakfast burrito, churizo breakfast burrito, and the fish taco. 

Everyone of these items were good. The ones that stood out were the breakfast burritos. They put fried tater chips in with all the breakfast goodies (egg, cheese, whatever is your poison). The TATER CHIPS SETS IT OFF SUN! 

It's difficult for me to get here sometimes cause they're only open on the weekdays. I found out the hard way. 

Phat Phrank's... EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!
