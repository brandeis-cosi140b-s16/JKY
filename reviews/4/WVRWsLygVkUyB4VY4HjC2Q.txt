Chipotle is one of my favorite eateries for a quick lunch or dinner. Whether you want to eat there or get it to go, it is very accommodating. If you eat there, the music is nice, the condiments are well-kept, and the tables are plenty. The line generally moves quickly as well. The food is as good as it gets for Chipotle, although eating before 9PM is a good idea since the ingredients are much fresher.
