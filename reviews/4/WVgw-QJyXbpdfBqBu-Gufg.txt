This is a bitter sweet restaurant to me.  I always go here when I am feeling health conscious.  The fish is grilled instead of fried, the food is not very oily.  I love that.  On that same note, the food lacks a punch.  I think because it is prepared on the healthier side, the food lacks flavor.  I wish the fish had more spices, I hate having to compensate for it with their homemade hot sauce, it's so spicy!!  I end up mainly tasting the hot sauce instead of my food, I have made this mistake several times!

But I still give it four.  The portions are big, and the food can be prepared clean and healthy, everyone is really nice, the restaurant is fun and high energy.

Random thought:  I secretly wish the veggies could be added to the burrito without teriyaki sauce.  Never been a fan of the teriyaki.  Since we're going healthy here, we might as well go all the way and go no sauce!!
