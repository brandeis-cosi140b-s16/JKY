Went here because it was close to the Project convention at the time.  The decor and service were good.  The place overlooks the Mandalay Bay pool which is gorgeous.

The chips and three salsas were tasty.

The skirt steak was good but pricey @ $24 (for lunch).  My girlfriend had the fish tacos which were about $15 and they were good too.  

This place is better than Tacos & Tequila @ Luxor which happens to be ranked higher than this place on Yelp.  

I'd go here again for lunch if I was in the area.
