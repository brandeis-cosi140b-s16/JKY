I love coming here for lunch! It's close to where I work and normally I've gotten speedy service. I don't eat meat, so I always order a bean and cheese burrito. Lately I've been getting it America's Way (with jalape√±os). So yummy. Sometimes I'll get a cochata (the bitter coffee mixed with sweet horchata makes for a delightful drink). The employees are always nice and the chips and salsa is cheap and you get free refills! Plus they're cool on Twitter and I've even won a gift card for them. Stop by for lunch today!
