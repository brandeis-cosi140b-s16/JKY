Bakersfield is one of those unique restaurants that you want to show off to all your friends and family. Such a great concept with small and healthier mexican dishes! 

Pros: queso (add chorizo and beans); guacamole, salsa, CHICKEN CHORIZO TOSTADA; premium margarita

Cons: parking can be an issue, but if you figure out the valet guys across the street it's actually very simple; no reservations so be patient and enjoy the atmosphere; house margaritas could be better as could their wine list.

Overall their food and atmosphere gives this place an easy 4-star! You'll find yourself craving everything on the menu!!
