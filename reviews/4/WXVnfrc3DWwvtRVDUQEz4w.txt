This location was previously a Robertos.  It is a similar in style to Robertos - quick serve mexican restaurant.  I go here not expecting culinary greatness - more for a quick flavorful lunch.  It's cheap and they almost always have a lunch special.  The Chile Relleno burrito is my favorite.  Ask for 2 rellenos and less of the other stuff.  

Some times they have chicken tacos for .99... Bueno!

Basically - nothing fancy, but it's fast, tasty and cheap.
