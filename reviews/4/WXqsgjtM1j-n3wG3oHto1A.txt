Here for the first time with co workers. Everyone loved what they ordered including taco and burrito lunch specials at 6.99.  The beans and rice were surprisingly good.  There were clear plates all around. Service was a little slow to start but after drinks came out, orders were taken quickly and brought out quickly.  The server was very polite. It was busy around lunch time like 12ish.  We're definitely going back.  Small note: $.50 service charge for card transactions under $10.
