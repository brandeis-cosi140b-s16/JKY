A visit to La Comida is definitely a situation of synergy -- the whole shebang is greater than the sum of the parts. In this case, those parts are: 
-Casual and sunny patio
-Friendly service
-Strong margaritas
-Fresh chips, salsa, and guac
-Simple tacos and sides

Sure, individually those things are good, but when you have them all together -- it creates such a fun, delicious experience in DTLV. You won't walk away saying, "those were the best tacos ever," or "man, I could eat three more servings of beans and rice," but you WILL have great time at La Comida.
