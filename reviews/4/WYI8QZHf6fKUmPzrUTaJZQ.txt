I got the quesadilla with shrimp and mango. Unique combination, but nonetheless good. Try it.

I'd recommend this place. I was only in Glendale for one day because I was interviewing at Midwestern University. I just decided to stop somewhere for dinner the night before the interview. I saw this place and hoped it was good--and it was.

I kinda wanted to try a regular burrito but someone else on Yelp said to try the Shrimp+Mango Quesadilla, so that's what I did.

The place was kinda empty during dinner time... I don't really know what that means, but it doesn't seem good.
