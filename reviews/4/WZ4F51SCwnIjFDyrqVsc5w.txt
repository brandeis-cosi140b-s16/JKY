Went to Yo Rita last night to meet friends for dinner.  Parking is always a disaster on the south side on the weekends, but I managed to find a pay spot about a block away off Carson street.  

The menu is pretty small, with about a dozen tacos and usually a special.  There is a good selection for vegetarians as well as meat lovers.  I am the latter, so I had a chorizo taco and a veal taco.  The chorizo taco had some sweet slaw and a dipping egg on it.  The flavor contrast was fantastic - spicy, sweet and savory all at once.  The veal taco was a breaded and fried piece of veal with bacon.  The flavor on this taco was good as well, but the chorizo was definitely my favorite.  Tacos are $7-9 a piece, so it's not cheap, but 2-3 tacos will fill you up.  It's worth a visit, though it may not be something that I crave every weekend.
