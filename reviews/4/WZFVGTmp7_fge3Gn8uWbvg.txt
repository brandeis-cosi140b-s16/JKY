One of the best back patios in Pittsburgh! I have been here on two occasions, once in the summer and last night and I definitely recommend coming here when the weather is a warm so you can sit outside. Their patio is tucked away from the street, a perfect little escape in Lawrenceville. Not to say I don't like the interior, it's artsy vibe and dim lighting are perfect for a date. The downside is there just isn't enough space, so the wait can be long if you have a larger group.

I ordered the house margarita, which are strong in the best way, but nothing amazing. I'm not a huge fan of OJ in my marge so next time I would probably try one of their micheladas. My friend had the Mexicana michelada with Dos Equis, cilantro, jalapeño, and lime. The cilantro and jalapeño combination is refreshing with a nice kick.

Their homemade tortilla chips and guac are amazing. I had the shrimp tacos - very cheesy with good cilantro and lime flavors. Their taco list is pretty extensive and I like how they focus on their specialty rather than trying to do it all. I love the overall vibe and drink selection and will definitely be back for summer nights on the back patio.
