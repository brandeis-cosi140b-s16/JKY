Missed this place for about seven years while I worked elsewhere. It is every bit as awesome as it was when I worked downtown many years ago. Superb variety of menu items. i go for the diet-friendly chicken tacos and the amazing salsa bar. The staff recognizes regulars like me and they're super friendly.
