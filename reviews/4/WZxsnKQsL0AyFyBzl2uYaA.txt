This little place is really creepy looking, but really good. I come here often with my dad, as it is close to his work. I always get, i believe, the number 8 -chili relleno, taco, and enchilada with rice. It is always really good.... Also their chips, salsa, and guac are great. The place is never too busy *see the store front for why* but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Also, it is relatively inexpensive, especially for the size of the entrees. I would definitely go to this place all the time if I lived a little closer.
