Best Mexican food I've had in Pittsburgh so far. I realize that doesn't necessarily say much, but this is the closest I've had to West coast style Mexican food since moving here in November. It's no wonder,  the owner is from California. 

Great burritos. Especially the chorizo con huevos, which I've yet to find anywhere else in the Steel City.
