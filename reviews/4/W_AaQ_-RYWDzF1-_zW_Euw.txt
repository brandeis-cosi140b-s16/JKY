I'm obsessed with cafe rio. I've eaten cafe rio probably over a hundred times in my life. Their food is always consistently great. This location, however,  is usually packed and I've just had back luck with staff on ordering pick up over the phone. My order was wrong a few times, but they corrected it just fine.
