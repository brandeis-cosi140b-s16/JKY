Yum! Easy, semi-casual, DECENTLY PRICED (for Las Vegas? In a casino? A rarity!) and great service -- special birthday shoutout to our amazing waiter, Austin!

Pretty standard Mexican fare, and the margaritas are MEGA! The tableside-prepared guacamole is delicious and larger than expected, and the warm homemade tortilla chips are a pleasant diversion before the meal. 

One tip of advice for the ladies: the floor here is practically made of ice. Meaning, if you wear heels, prepare to tiptoe across the super-slippery surface at the pace of a snail, or else you WILL fall, and it WILL be embarassing!
