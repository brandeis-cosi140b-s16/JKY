I came here to get take-out. It was broad daylight, so I wasn't too bothered by the sketch neighborhood. And I parked next to a Lexus in the hopes that my car would look so crappy in comparison no one would want to take it. I ordered the machaca plate with rice, beans, and a flour tortilla. After wrapping up only about a quarter of the machaca into my tortilla, I instantly regretted not getting another tortilla. I was in tortilla heaven. Soooo tasty! The machaca was awesome as well and I ate the entire meal without hesitation.
