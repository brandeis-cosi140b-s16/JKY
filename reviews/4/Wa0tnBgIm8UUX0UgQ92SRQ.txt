Yup, I am a fan. It was one of their first nights on the road and the wait was around an hour long. Ugh. At one point I looked over and their lights were out and the guys were cooking in the dark to bang out our food! 

Here's the scoop on the grub. The Stew was INSANE! I loved it so much I contemplating ordering more. It's spicy, green chile-chicken stew served with a warm tortilla. This was awesome. Secondly I tried the Sloppi Jo. It was spicy, smokey pulled pork with an egg on it and it was also delicious. Lastly was the sopapillas which I was most excited for. Truth be told, not all that good. They were small, chewy and topped with a square of cinnamon butter (not melted) and dusted with powdered sugar. I would rather have one regular sized one that's puffy and light. They surely need to work on making these at least taste fresh. 

The prices were pretty reasonable for my wallet and the food was well above average. I am going to give them a month to work out the kinks and I will definitely be back for more stew and to try the tacos.
