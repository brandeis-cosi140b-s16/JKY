Delicious, inexpensive Mexican food. I especially enjoyed the tamal (filled with pork) and the refried beans, which were some of the best I've ever eaten. The rice and enchilada were standard, but still tasty. The three salsas that were served at the beginning were extremely delicious, and we got a second basket of chips after we finished our meal just to enjoy the trio further.
