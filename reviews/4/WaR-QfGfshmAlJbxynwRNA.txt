Giant burritos,  Uncomfortable chairs, limited hot sauce selection and  growing prices.

This review shouldn't be useful to most as if you have had chipotle one place you have had it everywhere. This is the latest location in down town phoenix, it is a popular lunch spot and not a bad option when you need a quick bite.

Their guise of healthy is tempted by the realty that a burrito can quickly soar past 1000 calories. It is nice that they have added brown rice as a option at no added cost.

I had the vegetarian fajita burrito 6.85 Brown rice, fajita veggies, black beans (the pinto are not veg) salsa cheese and don't forget the included guacamole at no extra charge.

Here is a great tip, before opening your burrito, give it a massage, mix up the inside so you don't end up with a bite of pure guacamole or rice.  

Fir seats you get to choose from small hard wood seats with a back or small padded backless fixed bar stools, both say eat and leave ASAP. 

Over all its something to eat that is not bad or to pricey and the location and addition of brown rice makes it a 4 star from what would be a 3 star chain.
