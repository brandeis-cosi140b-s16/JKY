I came to Tapacubo with a friend awhile back for happy hour and was pleased with their offerings. The service was very good, with our waitress giving good honest opinions to help us order. I ended up getting 3 tacos - a cochinita, a fried fish, and a short rib. All were tasty, but I liked the two meat options better than the fish. I liked that there were several different salsas, but none of them were terribly special. Overall, the food was good, the portions were large, and the prices were pretty standard. I also had the ginger based marg, which was very tasty, while my friend had the cheapest standard marg, which was horrific... I wouldn't recommend it at all. Anyway, I could see myself visiting Tapacubo again in the future.
