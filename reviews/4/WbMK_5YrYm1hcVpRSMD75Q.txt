Great little hole in the wall.  I just moved here from southern california so I had yet to find a good mariscos locations.  But this spot is definitely the best Ive tried in vegas. I had the shrimp coctele, ceviche tostada, and shared some oysters.  All the food was on point, the only thing I didnt like was that their micheladas were basically just beer and clamato mix; nothing special. Other than that a great eat!
