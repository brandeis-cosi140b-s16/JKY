This restaurant has been a Chandler favorite for many years.  I really like their fresh salsa - it has just the right amount of "bite" to it.  Their bean dip is very good, and I like the sorta greasy and salty chips.  I prefer oily chips to the dry, flavorless chips that seem to be so common now that people are watching their fat intake.  Service has always been very good, and there is plenty of seating.  Prices are reasonable (about 7 bucks for the lunch special).  I would like to see lunch specials with coffee or tea included in the price - that would be over the top!
