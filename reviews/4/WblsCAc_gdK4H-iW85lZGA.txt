We got loose meat plates - smoked pork very good,  smoked chicken a little heavy on the smoke,  beef carne asada was excellent!  Beans, rice, and tortilla rounded out each platter, plus complimentary chips and salsa - all fairly standard.  The service was extremely cheerful and friendly, definitely a plus!   And though the building is totally early '70s retro, it's very clean.   Plenty of signs to remind you that they only take cash, but hey - it's pretty inexpensive so go ahead and have another beer.  We'll be back!
