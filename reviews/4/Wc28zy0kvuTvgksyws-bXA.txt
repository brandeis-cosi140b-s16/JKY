Mariachis, fun atmosphere, and good food! Would have been 5 stars but as a new restaurant they are still having some growing pains. The place was packed and they ran out of glasses, had to be served in styrofoam cups initially. The server upgraded us to beautiful Mexican handblown glasses about 10 minutes later and apologized profusely. The staff was great, everyone was attentive and nice, just busy!

The chips and salsa were very good. The corn tortillas were delicious. The flour tortillas were ok. Beans and rice were very authentic and tasted great! We split the fajita duo. Again, tasted very authentic and was delicious. 

Definitely going back, can't wait to try their breakfast.
