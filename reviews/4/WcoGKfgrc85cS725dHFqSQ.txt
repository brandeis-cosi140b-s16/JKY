I love Filiberto's rolled tacos.  I always have to get an order with my food.  It's great that they are 24 hours and most locations have a drive-thru.  My go-to's are the Spanish Omelet with rice & beans and a tortilla or one of their fat burritos.  Any of their breakfast burritos rock and they are made to order and under $5.  How can you go wrong?  Their nachos and Carne Asada Fries are very tasty and filling.  The prices are cheap and for Mexican fast food, I really can't think of a better place.  Plus to wash all of that food down with a large Horchata?  Game on!
