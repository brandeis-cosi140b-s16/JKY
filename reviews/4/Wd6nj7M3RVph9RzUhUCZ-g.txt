Great food and selection. Highly recommend for those looking for a nice family type establishment. This is a great place to take out of town guests who are interested in trying some good Mexican food.

The restaurant gets crowded and there is often a wait but it's worth it for the experience and the food. Be sure to go in the right door or it's a bit confusing.
