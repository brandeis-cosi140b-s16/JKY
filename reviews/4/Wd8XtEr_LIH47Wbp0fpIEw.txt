Not a very big fan of mexican food but this place has some very good menu items that are authentic and tasty. Their rice is amazing, I always have a hard time finding a restaurant with good spanish rice.  The salsa is so good and I always oreder some to go. The service is always spot on, and the deep fried ice cream is to die for!!!
