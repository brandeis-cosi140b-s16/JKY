Wisconsin Ave in DC was the first place/ time I ate at a Chipotle.  Primarily because it was a perfect place for lunch, located near a project I was working on and served healthy food, if you order correctly.  I ate there 3 times a week, so I must like it.  

Anyway, I am happy to see that Charlotte finally has one in the area.  The place is fast food, which I normally avoid.  McDonald's formerly owned Chipotle with a majority investment in the chain, but do not let that discourage you as based on the quality at every other fast food Mexican place (e.g. Taco-Hell, Salsa-really-not, and even Moe's--which is not that bad) -- Chipotle is the Champ (Flaming Amy's in Raleigh bests it as that place is just cool).

They grill everything fresh and have an option for you health nuts called the Burrito Bowl, basically burrito ingredients sans the flour tortilla.  

The location on South Blvd fit what I excepted, as do most chains.  You order what you want on your burrito/ burrito bowl from beans, to meat (chicken, steak - lean steak, pork), to fresh vegetable toppings.  This is done ala Subway order line.  So, by the time you reach the end your food is ready to go.  I recommend getting a side of salsa and chips.  The chips can feed two and they are seasoned with Sea salt (I think) and Lime.

It is a great fast food place.
