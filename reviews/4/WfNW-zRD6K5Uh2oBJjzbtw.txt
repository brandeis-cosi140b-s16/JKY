Was looking for another breakfast burrito option that was close to the house and stumbled on this place via Yelp.
Ordered the Chorizo Special and Green Chili Burrito.
Chorizo Special was OK. Would have been better if I liked my papas cooked like the culinary world says they should be cooked. I don't. I like soft papas. I couldn't really tell if the chorizo was spicy or not. Will get a regular chorizo burrito next time. 
The Green Chili Burrito was excellent! Lots of filling and it was good.
