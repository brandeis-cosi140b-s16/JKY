This place is basically Roberto's but slightly better IMO. They always hook me up with large portions and tons of stuff on 1 plate for the price -- So far, I've had the carne asada nachos (the star there) and the beef (machaca) plate -- both were good. I have late night cravings for this when I get the munchies -- Stoner Joint
