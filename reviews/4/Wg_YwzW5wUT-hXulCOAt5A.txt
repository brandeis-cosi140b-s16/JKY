As much as I love our dear family friend, this Fox concept restaurant doesn't stand up to the rest. As far as the decor and atmosphere go, they hit the nail on the head. However the food is bland, and seems as if it was over thought. A more simple approach would have been better. His restaurants always earn 5/5 in my book, sadly this one probably deserves a 3, but with minor changes to the menu there is no doubt in my mind this could be the best Mexican kitchen in the area. Great concept, average execution.
