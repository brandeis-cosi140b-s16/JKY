My wife and i were in the mood for Mexican and decided to try Zapata's. What an awesome choice. We got there right around 1 and were a little scared that there wasn't much of a crowd inside, but decided to push on. We were quickly greeted and seated.  The inside is nice and cozy with a outdoor/indoor southwest/Mexican theme. As soon as we were seated a server brought us a huge bowl of salsa chips and two glasses of water. 

We figured out that the water was to help with the spice in the salsa, unfortunately that's the only thing good about the salsa it was tomato paste based so it tasted a little like spicy pizza sauce to me.  We also ordered a thing of cheese dip. Smokey, spicy, large (it felt like that bowl was bottomless)  and delicious. For lunch my wife ordered the nachos, large portion of chips  topped with chicken, beans, peppers, sour cream, and guacamole.  She liked them but f.y.i. they use shredded chicken,& shredded cheese vs fajita chicken & cheese dip.  I ordered the fish tacos.  (3 flour tortillas with thin sliced fried fish with a chipotle cream sauce served with rice and beans) These puppies were awesome. They were pretty spicy but soooooo very good.  All in all it was GREAT food GREAT service  only thing i could find any fault on was the salsa. I'm looking forward to going back.
