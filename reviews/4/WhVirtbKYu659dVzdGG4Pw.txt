Tee Pee has been a family favorite of ours for 20+ years. It tends to be our meet-up spot on the weekends to sit at the bar, watch sports, and enjoy some authentic Mexican food! My dad and I love meeting up here for some quality father/daughter time! It has a dive-bar, cozy feel (which I love)! The service is always great and the food is always satisfying. I AM a creature of habit and always order the Albondigas soup (Mexican meatball soup) + rice inside and a small cheese crisp with green chilis and guacamole! Their house-made chips, hot sauce, and salsa are the bomb.com. I have been known to eat a whole bowl of chips and salsa to myself. Shh, don't tell. ;) If you're looking for a neighborhood favorite, authentic Mexican food joint, this is your place.
