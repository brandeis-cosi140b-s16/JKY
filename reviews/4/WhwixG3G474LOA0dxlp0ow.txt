Great service and food. Chips are crisp and salsa is good. I had the mahi mahi tacos. Loved the crispy taco shell. My son had the baja chicken burro. Outstanding! It's big and he ate the whole thing. Server has been there many years and was great. I'm from Tucson and we have some great Mexican restaurants. Mi Patio is up there with our best!
