Really good! I transplanted into Vegas from Orange County, have had Mexican food from some of the greatest taco joints and carnicerias out there. Santa Ana! I have not had good experiences anywhere in town yet, since we moved. This place finally hits the spot!!! Perfect balance of ingredients. Great spices. Our second experience is even better. The area is a little sketchy, next to a budget motel, I recommend calling in your order and you're in and out in 3 minutes. Worth giving a try. Please! I don't want them to close lol
