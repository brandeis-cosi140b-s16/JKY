I have been here many times for lunch and have gotten the chicken fajitas every time. I normally like variety, but these are just too good. That said, avoid during busy hours. This is by far the best Mexican in the area and gets slammed at lunch. At this time, while the server is very hard working, they are understaffed and customer service suffers. It seems the cook is also short handed  as the food quality deteriorates. Still good, just not as good.
