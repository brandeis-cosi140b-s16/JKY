Definitely my go-to fast food Mexican restaurant! I especially love this location because the service is always great and the food is always delicious. I've tried other locations before but found they aren't quite as good. I love the burritos here! Very filling and fresh! I usually order the Chicken Avocado burrito, the Pollo Bowl or one of their Chicken Meals. Their grilled chicken is soooo flavorful! The only thing I dislike about this restaurant is the Salsa. I feel it's kind of bland and I usually don't even use them with my burrito or chicken. Luckily they are already tasty without the salsa. The large selection of sides are awesome, and I usually treat myself to a yummy melt-in-your-mouth caramel flan dessert- which I sometime end up enjoying before my meal. Once they were in the middle of cooking a side I ordered so they apologetically asked me to wait in the parking lot and gave me a drink of choice while I waited. When I got my food soon after, they gave me a free side for the inconvenience! That's great customer service that keeps me going back!
