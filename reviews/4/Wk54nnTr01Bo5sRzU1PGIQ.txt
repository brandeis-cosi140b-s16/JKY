Wow! Blown away. 

Dined here with a dear friend from Argentina, who deemed this place one of the most authentic in the 'burgh, and I concur. With mad high fives.

This place is Mexican, versus the Tex Mex that you find more frequently. I ordered the tortilla soup with extra avocado and OH my! The broth was the perfect balance of spice, thick with flavor. The tortilla strips where homemade and slightly crunchy. The portion size was just right, although I could have licked the bowl clean if I'd been in the privacy of my home. The decor is nothing fancy, but modest with authentic Mexican flags, paintings and photographs (there is a super rad painting of Zapata right as you walk in that I wanted to make off with!)

Four stars for the lack of fish that day- they were all out, per the waitress. Parking is kinda rough as well, but do yourself a favor and pay the $10 to park in the Macy's lot. It's worth it!!!
