I am a gringo from Detroit but like my carne asada.... I cannot speak or read Spanish but they are always more then willing to help me out. The meat is always good and the tortillas fresh. I have never seen bugs but hell I had on in my office today. It happens. 

The shelves are packed but I never looked around.
