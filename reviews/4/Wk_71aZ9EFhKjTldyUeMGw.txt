Good food, GREAT prices! My usual place is Robertos (like the most of us), but I thought I would give this place a try. It's cheaper than Robertos and they give a ton of food! Foot long burritos? I mean, c'mon! I got the char-chicken tacos and they were delicious. Also, the food here is less greasy and very fresh tasting. 

I would say the only downside would be how long the drive-thru wait is. So be prepared for a good 15 minute wait; and that's only if there's one car in front of you.
