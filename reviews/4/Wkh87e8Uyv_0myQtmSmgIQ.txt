First time at this location. Service and employees were great, friendly and attentive.  The bartender, Shannon, was totally awesome. Her attitude was amazing and made it a great experience. Had a good time except for trying to watch the football game, haf to endure watching a couple at the bar make out,  wasn't the greatest thing. Was involved in a drawing, but didn't win and got some free chocolates because I was a lady ;-)  Would definitely come back here. Btw, had taco combo, shrimp and grilled fish with rice and beans. Very good!  B.F. had a wet burrito with half red sauce and half cilantro sauce. Tasty. Had tea and two margaritas and price was around $36.00. Not bad :-)
