We stopped going to Garcia's for a long time after a few bad experiences. We had raw chicken once, wrong orders once, etc. So after close to a year, my daughter talked me into giving them a try again since they were once a favorite. Well....They are BACK! It was really good again. I love that they bring out bean dip and salsa. I don't like beans but it is a nice touch. The pollo fundido was amazing like it used to be. Great rice, great salsa, great service. They have coupons regularly in the paper as well. The manager was going around asking everyone how their service and food was which I always appreciate. We will be back and soon! Glad they have hopefully fixed the problems they were having!
