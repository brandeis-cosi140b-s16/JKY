Yum! I'd come back here again. It's a tad pricey, but the food is delicious. I ordered a beef bulgogi taco, pork belly and fried egg musubi, and beef bulgolgi fries. The beef bulgolgi taco wasn't anything extraordinary. For those who have had Kogi Truck, Kogi surpasses by far. But the musubi and fries were much better than I had anticipated. Everything in the musubi was perfectly marinated. The order comes with 2 musubis for $6, plus an extra $1.50 if you add egg. Totally worth adding the egg. The musubis were huge and wanted to fall apart when I picked them up from the plate. But they were sooo good. I can imagine grabbing them on the go if I'm running low on time. The fries were also really good. It'd be nice if we could get them with add-ons (namely avocado). But the flavors were really good. A whole order is enough to feed 6 people if they're ordering other food, 2-3 if they're only eating the fries. 

My friends also ordered bulgogi burritos, shrimp ceviche, and flautas. The burritos were like little babies, big and fat. Looked tasty and monstrous. The ceviche was shrimp and avocado sitting on a chip the size of a tea plate. And the flautas looked crispy and come in a set of 3. Of all those, I'd probably only see myself getting the burrito in the future. 

The service was also good. Seems family owned. One of the waiters doesn't speak English, but he's really nice. The woman who seats everyone and takes their orders is also really friendly. 

I'd come back!
