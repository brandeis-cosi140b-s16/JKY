Ok, i know I am Hispanic but I had never had a parillada before. WHAT?

Ordered this tasty little dish for my husband and i to share (the 2-person parillada) Steak, Chicken, Chorizo, Shrimp, Potatoes, Onions, Jalapenos, Tomatoes all grilled up and served on a chafing/ grill dish. Served with a side of  beans, rice, tortillas, guacamole for each person. All this and a happy hour Modelo beer for $2. Had some sopapillas (deep fried flour puffs with sugar and honey) for dessert and thought they were ok.

Thank you for a fantastic meal, Habaneros! We are now loyal fans!
