"Like".  In fact "Like Very Much." Substantial portions of full flavored foods at reasonable prices made ridiculously so by frequent online coupons.  Remember the name is "Fuego".  As befits the name, there's at least a bit of flame in almost every dish.  Not unpleasantly hot but those of me with post-middle-aged gringo stomach might be well advised to bring their own pink bismuth shooter before partaking of the (really good) Fuego chipotle meat loaf.  Lactose impaired, bring your tablets for the Fuego pasta, my favorite, a nicely mildly spicy cheesy-but-not-nauseatingly-rich helping sufficient for a decent meal for two or leftovers for tomorrow's lunch - if you can stop yourself from eating the whole thing!  

Staff is consistently friendly and amazingly fast on their feet.  Informal, urban feel. Outdoor dining out front, right on 1st Street, is great on comfortable nights other than the free side order of guilt drizzled with irritation laced with extra guilt at being irritated, as I sit with my big generous plate in front of me, stuffing face and am approached by first, second, and then third panhandler, all slightly ragged and hungry, or at least claiming to be so. Felt like the moustachio'd glutton Julie Andrews was watching through the window before she passed out from hunger in . . .  well, whatever that movie was.
