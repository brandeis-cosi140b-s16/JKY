What I love about PAZ:
1.   The food is fabulous (I'll get into more below, but if you are there for brunch, try the Tres Leches French Toast).
2.  Convenient location and plenty of FREE off-street parking in the lot behind (off 3rd St).
3.   Great service.  Friendly staff.  Good music (although a little loud)
4.   Great community vibe.  The space is open, friendly, with a patio area that includes ping-pong tables, chalk for kids to make side-walk art, and a bean-bag toss.


We have been there on two occasions.  The first was for Sunday Brunch (11:45am) and we had kids with us.   Between us all, we tried the Tortas, the Chilaquiles, and the Tres Leches French Toast - which, by the way, won the prize as the table's favorite.   We also ordered $4 Bloody Mary's and and $11 bottomless Mimosa.  The drink prices left us with the feeling that we time-warped back to 1990's drink prices.

The next time I went was for the $5 Taco and Beer special.   The taco's are street-size (read: not large).  But they are so unique and the combination of flavors are wonderful.    Definitely do the build your own taco platter (that's not what it's called, I just gave it that name) from choices like Chicken Tinga (a slow-cooked chipotle chicken), Carnitas, Carne Asada, Pork Belly (which seems to get rave reviews),  fish and a Nopales 

I mentioned earlier that we went with the kids in tow for Brunch.  But the space and owners are dog-friendly as well.  Dogs are welcome on the patio (although we did not see any on either occasion), and they have dog-treats on the ready for your fury friends.

I love how they are building a sense of community with the space and how they are so welcoming.  We look forward to our next visit!
