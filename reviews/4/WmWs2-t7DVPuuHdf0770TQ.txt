Another solid meal from Baja Fresh. I usually order some form of a burrito, this time it was the Mexicano which is pretty standard ingredients (beans, rice, meat). I like the chicken here because I can always hear them chopping up my chicken before they place it inside the burrito. The mango salsa is also top notch at the salsa bar. On this visit I decided to smother the burrito and it was a good decision. In the new green enchilado style, they smother it with verde sauce and put Cojita cheese on top and add a small serving of nachos as well on the platter. Sour cream is also included and additional chips as well. A very good value at just under 8 bucks if you complete the survey for $2 off on your next visit. Always a friendly girl at the counter also.
