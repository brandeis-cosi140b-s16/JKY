Excellent service, great prices and their food is awesome.  My wife and I ordered some onion rings, they showed up hot, plentiful and delicious (and cheap - $5).

I ordered a pulled pork sandwich that came with chipotle mayo and cole slaw (but I'm allergic to carrots). The waitress told me the cook would make up a batch just for me that had no carrot and the whole thing was AWESOME. It showed up with fries and a pickle and I was very happy. It wasn't terribly busy and it's right on the strip in front of Monte Carlo. I can't wait to go back.
