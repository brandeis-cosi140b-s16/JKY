Cozymel's makes me happy.  I used to go here all the time when I worked at UNLV and I discovered 2 things: 1) The sauce they serve with the flautas is seriously, seriously addicting and 2) the margarita 'sampler' is not something you should partake of while on a lunch break from work.  That thing is MUCH more than a sampler.

Their salsa is great, and there're few things I love more than a good salsa.  Again, their flautas come with a cheese sauce that I could eat by the spoonful.  Their shrimp bisque also serves as a delicious chip accompaniment.  The Queso Flameado (on the appetizer menu) with chicken, shrimp, or both rules my life.  (Creamy cheese sauces, mushrooms, peppers, onions, cilantro pecan pesto all mixed together and flambeed table side.  Served with warm tortillas.  Good enough for a meal.)  The raspberry margarita is delicious.  The whole thing is just yum.

The flavors are different insofar as Americanified Mexican food, but it's not authentic Mexican by a long shot.  However, few things are as nice as getting yourself some table side flambe while sippin' on a margarita on their patio on a spring afternoon.  Man, that sounds nice.
