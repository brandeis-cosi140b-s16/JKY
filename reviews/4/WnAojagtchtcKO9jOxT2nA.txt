Second visit and the food was terrific.  A lunch menu of specials gave lots of choices for $5.55 and the appetizers are all half price between 3 p.m. & 6 p.m.  We split the tacos (3), I had a super burrito and Matt had the taco salad.  Two big Wows,  really delicious and a take-home bag of left-overs. Be warned though,  if you sit in the bar you may encounter smokers. The dinning room is closed @ lunch but there's a dining area off the bar if 2nd hand smoke impacts your taste buds too. I hope you're fortunate enough to get Gretchen as your waitress. She's great. Upgraded rating since our last visit.  Recommend
