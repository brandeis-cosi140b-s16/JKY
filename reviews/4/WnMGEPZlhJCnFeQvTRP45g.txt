I grew up in the Midwest. I thought that Taco Bell was bee's knees and Chi Chi's really was a celebration of food. Moving to Arizona more than a decade ago, my journey through the realm of burritos, tacos and horchata has taught me so much. SO MUCH. 
This is my neighborhood joint, I end up here pretty regularly. I find them reliably tasty and fast, with a side of affordability. Their breakfast burritos are hearty, but not too greasy or heavy. My personal favorite burrito is the shrimp burrito. Don't expect oceanside-fresh shrimp, we are definitely landlocked, but the sauce is lovely. My mom approves of the fish tacos as well.
I am a big fan of the horchata, it is sweet and light and refreshing. And they stay true to the horchata roots and stick with rice milk. Which my lactose intolerant body appreciates.
This place is far from fancy, but it is comfortable and satisfying.
