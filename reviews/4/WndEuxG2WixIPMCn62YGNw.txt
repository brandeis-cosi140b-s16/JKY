Walking into an empty restaurant is always disconcerting.  But I figured it was a weekday evening and the area was a bit dead beyond people at the nearby laundry mat.

Immediately upon seating, our friendly waiter got our beverage orders.  He returned also with chips and salsa.  We soon devoured it all and he asked if we wanted more, which we gladly accepted.  

For dinner, I chose the Shrimp Fajitas ($12.50), which is served with rice, beans, and tortillas (corn or flour).  I was quite surprised with how generous they were with the shrimp.  There was plenty and I definitely had leftovers.

The Husband ordered the Steak & Enchilada (your choice of what kind), and it also came with rice, beans, and tortillas.  He was also surprised with how tasty the steak was, they used a good marination.  The real surprise winner was the refried beans.  The Husband was loving their version.  It was good too, but I guess I'm a fan of refried beans in general (especially with a little cheese swirled in there).

We also caught up on music videos while we had dinner.  (You don't get to see music videos anymore!)

Overall, pretty good Mexican food without breaking the budget.  And of course, it helps when there's a coupon in the Entertainment Book.  (They also have other coupons available since they mention that there will be a 20%(?) tip added to the bill before any coupon is applied.  We didn't mind actually because the waiter was very attentive.)

3.5 stars

Sidenote: They also have a menu for their cakes by the sheet, so maybe they get a lot of business that way too.
