I LIKE IT!!! 
If you order your food there, they even give you a little number and they bring your food out to you. Not bad for a fast food joint! 
They have healthy options too without outrageous calories. Always a plus. Nom nom! I particularily LOVE the little salsa bar they have inside with several different salsa's and spicy peppers! Nom nom!!!
