FIRST! K so sometimes, you just gotta have something familiar, simple, cheap! This is that place for the hubby and I. When we don't know what else to eat, we automatically drive to Taco Bell. If we had a programmable location on our car, this would be at the top of the list. Yes, I know TB is not exactly healthy, gourmet, or even real meat, but you know its delicious! Everyone deep down loves some TB but doesn't wanna admit it. This particular location is our favorite mainly because we have watched them go from struggling and retarded to getting our order nailed down to a fine art. Everyone here is always friendly especially the night manager who has been there since the memorable day 3 years ago that we moved to this wonderful town I call The Copa. I am assuming she is a manager because this girl does whatever it takes to make the customers happy and really seems to love her job. I can't see your average TB clerk being that way and sticking around for 3 years! Anyways, when you are sitting around trying to decide what to eat, I recommend going here and getting a few tacos, chalupas, and cheesy bean and rice burritos. Trust me, you wont be sorry... while eating them that is, might be sorry later though!

PS: Try their new verde salsa and the fire roasted salsa (on cheesy items). They are terrific!
