I highly recommend getting the bean and cheese burrito with sour cream on the inside. (yes, that's exactly how I order it) its like 3 dollars and it fills you up. If you're on a greasy cheesy unhealthy kick then do it up! This location isn't as "cozy" as other locations I guess and the workers are real stoic but it's real quiet and relaxing.
