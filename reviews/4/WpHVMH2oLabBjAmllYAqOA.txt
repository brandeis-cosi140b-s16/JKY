Excellent customer service. Our first visit as out of town guests, when we walked in we were created, offered samples and walked through each dish. It was obvious that they take pride in their food. Ordered the jerk chicken and carnitas. Food was on point and black beans were to die for!!! My only suggestion would be to "spiffy up the place". Dining area was a dive but the food itself is enough to return for!! Great taste all around.
