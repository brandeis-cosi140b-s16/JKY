Last minute decision to go to an old favorite for lunch on a Saturday we roll up to Stonecrest and visit Cantina.  We haven't been in quite some time but after today's experience we will put them back on the list and will definitely be back.

To start off with, the chips and salsa are addictive.  The chips are served warm with a touch of salt and the salsa just seems fresher and homemade vs. the typical foodservice restaurant salsa you get down the road.  It has a more vibrant tomato flavor and is heavy on the cilantro with a touch of heat.  YUM!

I had the barbacoa which was nicely cooked and seasoned.  It was tender yet stringy as pulled pork ought to be.  It was served with fresh pico, guac, rice and beans and a nice mix of mexican cheeses.  Warm corn tortillas helped me me make my own burritos.  

Everyone on staff that day was friendly and inviting.  The Manager stopped by 2 times to check on us and when we got our bill I left feeling like we had a great meal for a good value.
