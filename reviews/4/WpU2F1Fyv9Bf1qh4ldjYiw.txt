Simple Southern California style Mexican food. The ladies working the counter are super friendly and they have a good array of vegetarian options - much appreciated!

This place usually has a pretty long line going as its located on the CSN Charleston campus and is undoubtedly the most delicious thing to eat on campus. Because of this, the food can take a little longer, but they do make everything to order!

They have a 99c menu but the items I've seen from that menu are very small. They also offer fresh fruit frescos and horchata. The salsas are obviously homemade. Overall, good cheap greasy food. I approve!
