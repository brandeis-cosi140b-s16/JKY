Went here for lunch and I wasn't expecting much.  It looked like it was going to be a total "white boy" type Mexican restaurant.  And it sort of was, but the food had enough flavor that I enjoyed it.
Prior to the meal, they brought out chips and salsa.  The salsa was pretty weak.  In about 2 minutes, my gf and I finished all of the salsa.  Our waiter walked by and noticed this and immediately asked if we wanted something a little bit spicier.  Of course we did.  He brought out a different type of salsa that was much better, much spicier.
I ordered the fish tacos and there were very good.  Nothing much to say about that.
Overall, I enjoyed the place.  Service was good.  Prices were fair.  When in the area again, I will go back.
