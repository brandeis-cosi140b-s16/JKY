Guerrero's is a fantastic mom 'n' pop place.  I drove past this place many times before I finally stopped in.  Glad I did.  

The restaurant has a small dining area but most people seem to pick their orders up.  If you're looking to dine in you shouldn't have any problems.

When a small operation like this has been open for nearly 30 years you know it must be good.

Typically I order the enchiladas but as of late I've been going earlier in the morning and ordering from the breakfast menu.  Everything I have tried here has been great.  All items are reasonably priced too and the service is friendly.

Great little place.
