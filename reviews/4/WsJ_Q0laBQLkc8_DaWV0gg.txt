I read all the bad reviews, but our experience was pretty good.  Nice wait staff, prompt service.

I had the Big Daddy burrito with steak -- loved it.  Steak was nice and tender and the beans were perfect.  My husband had the fajita salad and practically licked his plate clean. Chips were fresh and crispy - not too thin.

I will definitely go back.
