Muy bueno! For a regular place to eat, where those that know Mexican Food will go, this is the place for sure!!!!  All the workers and all those that eat Mexican Food as their main ethnic food eat at this place and I would say it is pretty darn good!

1.  Location - There are many, this one is in the Albertson Strip mall next to Panda Express with tons of parking and easy access!

2.  Ambiance - No Frills, This is a clean and basic place to eat!

3.  Food - this is the key. There is a huge picture menu or written menu above the cashier.  We ordered several things for the family:

Nachos - Great stuff and you can get a bunch of toppings on it.

Carne Asada Burrito, Chicken Burrito, Carnitas Burrito - All these we ordered and it was very, very tender meat. The size, while not the largest, was just right.  Everything is cooked to order, not sitting in a try waiting to be "made".  We added the sour cream, pico de Gallo, and beans. My kids and family enjoyed it a lot!!!

Cheese Quesadilla - OK, so I have one family member who wants the Big Mac of Mexican Food, a cheese quesadilla. Very nice, thick with cheese and only slightly oiled i the cooking process. 

Stuff - They have a help yourself area to spicy sauces and pickled vegetables. Very nice and authentic. I like a lot of sauce on my food, so helping yourself is great.

If you are used to ordering huge burritos with everything on it and all, then you may be a bit unhappy here. As while large and with many ingredients, it is not overpowering in size or in taste. This is what makes it so tasty.

GK Says, check it out.  Plain, simple, good.
