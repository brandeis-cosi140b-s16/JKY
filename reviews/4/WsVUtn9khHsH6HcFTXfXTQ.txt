Same Roberto's menu, but at a convenient location at the corner of Fort Apache and Charleston (across the street from Claim Jumper and P.F.Chang's). Perfect for grabbing some filling Mexican food while you get gas or waiting for your car's tune-up.

There are some tables and chairs out front, but if you intend to get your grub on right there, be sure to tell them that it is not a to-go order. The food is prepared very quickly, and there is hardly any wait time after your order has been placed. 

This is the perfect place to go if you are hungry and in a rush,regardless of the time of day or night
