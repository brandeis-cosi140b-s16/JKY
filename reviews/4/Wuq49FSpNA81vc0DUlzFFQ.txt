Soo I was unsure about coming here, but I mentioned to someone I would come. I found out about this place on Man V. Food I think or the internet. Anyway, I came all the way from Chandler to N. Phx to try this place. 

I was expecting a more quieter atmosphere at the time but they were blasting the soccer game. Also chips and salsa are not provided. 

The menu has a lot to choose from, I was soo undecided. However, I came here for the Torta del Rey, so thus that is what I ordered. I want to try to carne asada next time. Anyway, I knew it was going to be a huge sandwich. Lo and behold it was presented to me and all I did was gasp. WOW! It was a sandwich plus potato chips as a side (weird).

Let me remind you I am a nutrition student, this is far from healthy....ham, cheese, egg, chorizo, pork strips, etc. 
Great tasting sandwich, but I much preferred it with the green sauce they provided. I downed that first half in no time, but I could no conquer the whole sandwich. 

Great big sandwich for $9, not bad. Considering I could enjoy the other half later on. I would definitely go back to try the other menu items.
