Really wasn't to sure about this place when I first heard of it, however I gave it a try. This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant. Very big space for large groups, big screen on the wall with sports playing. Now lets get to the food, it's a mixture of Asian an Mexican. I always end up getting the same thing jade chicken black beans an jerk chicken rice. Maybe one day I will venture out an try other things, then again maybe not.
