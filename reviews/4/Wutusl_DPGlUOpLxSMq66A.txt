A few friends and I made reservations for 7 pm on a Saturday night. When we walked in at 7 pm, our table was waiting for us and every other table was taken. The atmosphere was nice, everyone talking and enjoying themselves. We brought two fifths of tequila with us and they will supply the pitcher of mix for you. It costs $12 per pitcher, and I believe they charge $3 per person to byob. Still a good deal. The waiter was fast to welcome us and very friendly.

He brought out salt and limes as well as ice. We ordered the guac and chips, the queso, a chile rellano, and I asked if they had a bean dip which they did not. The guac was delish! The chips were def homemade and a little greasy, but still crispy and tasty. The queso was watery, the flavor was good, but the cheese just dripped off of the chip. I prob wouldn't order the queso again. They tried to accommodate us with a "bean dip," but it was more like they poured some beans on a plate and served them. They weren't good. I appreciate them trying, but for $5, I'll pass next time. The chile rellano was FABULOUS.

I ordered the enchiladas with the mole sauce. The mole sauce was the best I've ever had. Flat out delicious. I ordered two mushroom and one cheese enchiladas. The mushroom enchilada was on point, very very good. My meal came with a side of veggies and rice. Both tasty. Our waiter did bring our chicken fajitas when the one girl ordered steak, and my other friend had her order a little messed up also. That is the only reason this place doesn't get a perfect 5 stars. I would definitely try this place again.
