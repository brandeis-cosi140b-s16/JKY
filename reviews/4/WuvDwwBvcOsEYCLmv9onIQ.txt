My hunny and I traveled to Arizona for some Dodger Baseball and noticed this joint had good reviews. We beat the rush, right about 4:30, then there was a cried off people. I had been craving some tasty Mexican food. 

I ordered the Torta and my hunny ordered the flautas and choose and guac as a side. My torta was noting like I had before, it was wet! I wasn't sure how to expect how it would taste, but it was delicious! The meat was cut pretty think, but wasn't difficult to chew. The flavors worked great together: with lettuce, tomatoes, avocados, cheese, and sour cream drizzled on top. Needless to say, it was gone almost as quickly as it was served. My hunny's flautas were more like taquitos covered with sauce, sour cream, lettuce and sliced avocados. The sauce was great, but I could have found these at Costco. 

I'd go again, probably get the torta, it was delightful.
