I was just looking at the pictures I took when I was here last year and realized I had never gotten my review written.  I was just driving by and spotted this place and decided to try it out.  I was impressed there were mostly Latinos in there, in fact everyone but me, so I figured the food must be good.

I mainly went in for seafood and the Ceviche tostada I got was excellent.  But it was a cold day so I got a bowl of Caldo de Res, which I had never had before, and it was sooo good.  Perfect!  I left satisfied and with a warm tummy. I hope it's still there when I come back so I can eat there again!

I'm back in town and returned here late this evening.  I stand by my original review and opinions.  The girl behind the counter was extremely nice, the place smelled wonderful and the food was delicious.  There was not a thing wrong with the entire experience.  I had no gastronomic problems after.  I recommend this place with no hesitation.  

I got a Ceviche Tostada because I remembered how good it was last time and it didn't disappoint.  I made a last minute decision to get the huge Chile Relleno on display and it may have been the best one I've ever had in 30 years of enjoying them.  I mean, what more do we want?  Great food, clean, Mexican band blaring.  It was so good I didn't even have any leftovers.
