Food is good. Drinks are good. Expanded restaurant means that the waits are much shorter than they used to be. Seems cliche but the fish tacos are the way to go here. House margaritas are delicious and inexpensive (they also have an El Cheapo Marg that I think is only $3), but the house is way better and still a bargain at $5. Enjoy!
