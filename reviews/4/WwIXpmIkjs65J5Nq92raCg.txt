Watermelon Agua Fresca was absolutely delicious and the three tortas we shared at the table did not disappoint! Especially when smothered with the salsa they serve. The food was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious. 

Only reason for the 4 stars is location (way the hell out there in phoenix, wish it was closer!) and atmosphere. The main room is nice with the kitchen visible but the added on room is apparently where the place all the babies and three 20-somethings? 

But I definitely recommend this place to anyone!
