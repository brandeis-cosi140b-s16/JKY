Definitely a hidden gem of Mexican restaurants! My wife and I are picky when it comes to Mexican restaurants, and this city has enough bad ones to overwhelm anyone. We used to live pretty close to Sunset Station, and decided to try this place after a movie. We had pretty low expectations and we were quickly blown away. First, its easy to fill yourself up on the complimentary chips and salsa bar. There are at least 10 different salsas plus bean dip and mole for you to enjoy. All the salsas are freshly made and each has a distinct flavor. Second, the prices on the entrees are really unbeatable for nicer casual Mexican places. Third, the food portions are huge! Considering the free chips and salsa, its really easy to get two meals out of one entree. Fourth, the  food quality is great! Everything tastes fresh and is very flavorful, which is definitely contrary to the many bland dishes you can find at other restaurants. Finally, we've been several times (at least a dozen) over the past 2 years, and we have always had great service. 
We aren't fans of many of the restaurants in Station Casinos, but this one is definitely worth it. 
We are vegetarians, and the staff at Guadalajara is very willing to accommodate our requests.
