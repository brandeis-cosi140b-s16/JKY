I had the shrimp this time, I the fish was pretty good on my previous visit.  The shrimp was terrific!  One great feature of this restaurant is that you can put what you want on the tacos at the condiment bar. If you love lots of cabbage and onions (which I do), you can load up your tacos till your heart's content. The horchata was okay, I would have preferred less sugar and more cinnamon and nutmeg. They have coke made in Mexico (they still use real sugar there) which is the best! The menu is somewhat limited, but worth a visit.  BTW - the 3 for 2 Taco Tuesday is a GREAT bargain!!!
