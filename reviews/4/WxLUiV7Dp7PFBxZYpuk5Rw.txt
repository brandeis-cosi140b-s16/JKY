Why have I waited so long to try this place. K.O. convinced me to come in to this place for a small snack in between meals.  I am glad she did.

The parking lot sucks to get to and is jam packed.

There are separate lines here depending on which meat you want to eat.  Look for the signs at the front of the line.  When we came in the whole inside of this place was packed.  It was very confusing for me in the beginning, but K.O. helped me navigate through the madness.

We stood in the Adobado line and got us 2 tacos and 1 mula to share.  Remember to ask for hot sauce when you get your food.

Adobado Taco - the meat was cooked well and on a spit. When you see meat on a spit you know its going to be cooked well, charred slightly on the outside and moist in the inside.  All the trimmings were delicious and that green sauce was really creamy and helped elevate the flavors.

Adobado Mula - First time trying it and its basically 2 tortillas with meat, cheese, and other things inside.  This was delicious and wish I had found out about this sooner.

After you get your food, you have to find the cashier line and pay. When we were here the horchata tasted really watered down and not good. The orange bang on the other hand was delicious.

Seating may be hard to find, but we found one outside fairly easily.

The place could be a little cleaner and less hectic.  The inside is crammed with ppl and hard to get refills on drinks.

I would definitely come here again but maybe one of their other locations.
