I tried the Stand after driving by there numerous times. I went to this location when it was Maui Dog, and I must say the new owners have improved the decor. The staff at this restaurant are very friendly and accommodating. The inside of the restaurant looked clean too.

I had a burger and fries. I thought the burger was great and priced very reasonably for an upper echelon fast food burger. I am picky about what toppings I like on burgers, so I was quite pleased that my order was correct.

I docked one star from this review because I thought the fries were disappointing. For one person, the serving size is too large and the cost is too high (this is the same problem that Five Guys has). The fries were mediocre tasting as well.
