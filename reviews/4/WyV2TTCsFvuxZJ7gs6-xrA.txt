Obviously this place doesn't need a review. It's affordable enough so everyone can come without risk. For GF and dairy free eaters: they can substitute corn tortillas AND vegan sour cream and vegan cheese that melts like regular cheese. When I order a burrito, I order it naked with a side of corn tortillas and I make my own mini burritos. Expect to wait during rush hours (6-830), the bar is a good place to wait, even if you don't have a seat :)
