Que Mas is one of our favorite Mexican restaurants in Vegas. Friendly, efficient service and delicious food. Love their salsa and chips. My husband usually orders enchilada plate with pot beans instead of refried beans. And I love their steak tacos with avocado. Great food - generous portions. Good service and descent prices.
