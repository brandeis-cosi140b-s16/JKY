I walked here from the Sheraton after dark - don't do this! Once inside - I was in an oasis of great food and margerhitas. The atmosphere is festive with a colorful fish motif like I've experienced in Mexico.

The tortilla chips were fresh made as we're the tortillas that came with my meal. A complimentary ceviche was provided. I had the fish filet with shrimp and octopus in mushroom sauce. The plate was huge with sides of salad, rice, and beans. The food was delicious. I was alone so my review can only consider one visit and one dish - but, I've been trying to minimize calories yet cleaned the plate.

Another great seafood dinner in Phoenix - who'd have thunk it. Mission accomplished.
