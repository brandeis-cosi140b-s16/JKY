Very good Pacific Mexican food! I had the shrimp ceviche, and a fish taco. Both were very good. 

The shrimp ceviche was on a torte/flat taco, but was served with a large amount of the lime/lemon juice used in the ceviche. This was a little unsettling, and added just a little too much acid flavor to the dish. ***

The fish taco was great! Well prepared, and served hot. They had great beans as well, and seemed to serve avocado with every meal. Really delicious stuff. *****
