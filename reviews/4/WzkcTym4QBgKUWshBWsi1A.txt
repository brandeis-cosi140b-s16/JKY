Everytime I go to Vegas, I go here. We were staying at the Cosmopolitan during my most recent trip, but made the trek all the way to Luxor twice just for this excellent Mexican food.
Margaritas- Amazing. Honestly, excellent margaritas. Unique flavors like white peach, apple cider, pomegranate, etc. as well as the traditional margaritas. Excellent drinks. 
Nachos- super good. Their guac is good, beans are good, definitely would order the nachos Everytime I go!
Meals- I got a combo I think, with a tamale. The tamale was my favorite. Made with chicken, not the traditional pork, but it's a nice change. My friend got a taco trio and loved all three. 
Service was good and waitstaff was super friendly. Love everything about this place, definitely will return as much as possible!
