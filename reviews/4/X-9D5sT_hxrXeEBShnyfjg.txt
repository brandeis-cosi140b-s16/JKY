Wow! I never reviewed La Parrilla before? We go there very often, usually for dinner, since they always have coupons going on for the neighborhood....

We usually have one or two of the parrilladas, which are usually always enough to share.

I like their green (avocado like) salsa, and their staff is always so nice and friendly.

Today we were in a hurry (we only had 30 minutes) and we ordered just an appetizer (chorizo quesadilla) to share, it was just the right size snack.

I really love the cheese they use, the quesadilla was delicious, as always is the queso fundido that comes with the parrillada.

The only complaint is that the hubby thinks they don't have diet coke, but Coke Zero... not sure though, but he always thinks the Diet Coke tastes funny : )
