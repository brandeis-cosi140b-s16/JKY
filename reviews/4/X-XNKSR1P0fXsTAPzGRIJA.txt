Panchero's!!! They're franchising now??? I lived on this in Iowa City back in the early 90's when I was in law school. How cool that they (and Jimmy John's!) are now national from such humble beginnings.

Their freshly pressed, hot, toasted, chewy tortilla is their trademark (plus the mixing of the ingredients with a special spoon, but that's a bit gimmicky). Either you love their tortilla or you don't. I love it a lot! But it's not your standard tortilla out of the plastic bag, so to each his own. Other than that, it's the usual Chipotle/Qdoba-type fresh ingredients (which are awesome).

I wish you guys would bring back the grilled chorizo option from 20 (!) years ago in Iowa City  and start cutting the carne asada directly from a rotisserie again (also from back in the day). Another way to distinguish yourself from the other burrito places...

Go Hawks!
