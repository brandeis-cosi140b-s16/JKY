Came in looking for some Mexican City food, and they got it! 

I ordered the Huarache with Al Pastor which was huge AND delicious. The inside was real simple, but i go to a restaurant for the food so i didnt really care. 

I recommend this place if you're tired of wannabe Mexican restaurants that typically offer the same fake americanized version of the real deal!!
