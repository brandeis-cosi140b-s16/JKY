I've driven by many times, but never stopped.  With a restaurant.com certificate in-hand we stopped this time.

It's a very small place.  I would estimate 10 tables/booths.  You order at a counter and they bring it to you when it's done.  The menu is a sign above the counter.  Very "divey".

Our group ordered a variety of things.  As always, at  a "new" place I order a chimi (or, in this case, burro because they didn't have a chimi).  It was very good.  Everyone seemed to like their food.  For the price this is pretty good.  The ambiance sucks, but the food is what you come for.  Not the best Mexican I've had, but definitely the best within about 10 miles of my house.
