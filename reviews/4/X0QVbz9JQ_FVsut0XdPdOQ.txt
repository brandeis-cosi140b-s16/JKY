Pretty darn good! I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was spotless. I was promptly greeted by the cashier behind the counter. They have a picture menu to make the ordering process easier. I had the machaca plate for about $7 it was freshly made and served with a warm tortilla. The beans and rice were okay but were easily elevated with salsa. I'll be back here soon to sample the rest of the menu.
