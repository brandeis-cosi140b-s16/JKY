Elvira's is just down the street from our Grandpa and Grandma's retirement community, and when we drove by, it looked so inviting that we knew we would be planning a trip while visiting. :)

When we got their the parking lot was packed, so we were not surprised by the 15-20 minute wait, and we were able to visit the bar and get a drink while we waited, which was nice.

Due to the busyness of the restaurant, the service once we were seated was a little compromised, but all-in-all, when we asked for something, the waiters and waitresses responded well and filled our request promptly.

The food was good. Nothing wowed us, but it also didn't make us wrinkle our noses or regret our decision to dine here.
