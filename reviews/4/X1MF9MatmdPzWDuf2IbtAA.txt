The street tacos were muy delicioso! Both the red and the green salsa were very flavorful with just the right amount of spice. The one and only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because all of the wine is organic and $18 per glass!! I'm all about GMO free and organic but that's a little excessive. An $8 or $9 glass of house wine should be offered. Highly recommend. Will definitely go back.
