Visited 8/17/12.

I have been here several times so once again I am surprised I have no reviews. 

This is probably the better of the Mexican Restaurants I have come across.  Great selections, endless chips and salsa, nice appetizers.  

This place is always busy!!  Always..  Be prepared for a wait or get there early. 

They also have nice selections for tequila and margaritas.  Although the tequila prices are a little high for me.  

This last visit, I as a little disappointed in the margaritas... I think a little more tequila is appropriate.  If I am paying $9.00 for a Margarita, I had better be able to taste the tequila.
