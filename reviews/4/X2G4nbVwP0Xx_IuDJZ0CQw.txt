I have been here several times; however I have only tried the chicken Nachos.  It seems to me the ingredients they use are very "natural" and fresh.  The chicken taste pretty good and has a little bit of spice to it.  They also have a salsa bar with about 3 salsa options, clilantro, onions etc.  Service has always been pretty good.  They generally ask if I want free chips and salsa which is an added bonus.  Maybe a little over priced for some items, but I think the quality of food is probably a little better then other mexican places that offer the same selections.
