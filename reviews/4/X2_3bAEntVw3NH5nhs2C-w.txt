Im not sure how many times ive gone here! I LOVE IT. I always get the Enchilada plate (one chicken, one sweet potato) I LOVE THE SWEET POTATO ENCHILADA...Delicious. I can never leave the place without getting the coconut flan! Best flan ive ever had! Food comes very quickly. Im in and out within 20 minutes!
