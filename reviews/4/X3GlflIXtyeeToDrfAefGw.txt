Very cool building, architecture and atmosphere.  This place is super close to my office and a great place to go for a quick lunch.  Taco Guild has some of the most interesting Taco combos I have seen anywhere.  My favorite are the Shrimp Tacos.  If you are really hungry, don't miss the street corn.

The tacos are a bit pricey, but it is definitely worth trying.
