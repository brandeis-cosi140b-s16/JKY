This place is similar to Chipotle except they have more variety in protein choices and extras. Aside from your standard chicken, steak, salsas, they have shrimp and fish and from what I can remember as extras they had cilantro and limes! I think for the burrito option, they ask if you'd like the tortilla to be whole wheat or not. It seems they cook the fish to-order so you know you're getting something off the grill which is nice, but might not be a good choice if you want to just grab and go. Zaba's provides a nice alternative in the Plaza if you're not feeling McDonalds or Subway. This place isn't 24 hours like the aforementioned but if it happens to be open while you're here, why not? This is a solid place and their portions are generous enough to make you feel pretty full (granted, I've only had their Zaba bowl).
