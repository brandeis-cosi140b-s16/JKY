Great casual Mexican restaurant. Large dining rooms, and nice comfortable  tables too.

The service was brisk, the food was above average (which means a lot here in Arizona), and the low prices were a bonus. I had the Tostada and Taco and was thoroughly satisfied. The chips and Salsa were good too - though the salsa could have used a little more heat.

I have not tried any other restaurants in Wikenburg yet, but I will definitely try this one again.
