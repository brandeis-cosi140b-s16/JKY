Great food.  Ignore the location, it's obviously not the best but the food is delicious.  If you are worried about location, go to Tia Rosa's up on McKellips which has much better ambiance with the same food.  All of their meat tastes like to is lightly smoked which really adds to the flavor.  This location is also great for lunch if you have business in downtown Mesa.
