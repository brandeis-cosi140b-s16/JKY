Came here for a late family dinner. (8 people @ 9:30pm) they were very accommodating and allowed the two toddlers of the group to dance and enjoy the music. 

The food is pretty average and very authentic. Tacos are priced very decently. I would go back for sure. Little hole in the wall places are the best!
