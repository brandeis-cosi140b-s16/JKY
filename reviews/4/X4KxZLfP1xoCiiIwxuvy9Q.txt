Very big restaurant/ club....

Food was delicious, everyone that went with me loved their meal.

The club on the other hand, hard to get a table unless you get a bottle.  But the music was awesome, although it was very hard to dance with the floor being overly crowded.

Will visit when i'm back in town :)
