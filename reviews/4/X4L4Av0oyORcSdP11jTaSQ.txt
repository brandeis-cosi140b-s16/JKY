Nice atmosphere.  My companion had the pork tacos which he said were quite good.  My fish tacos were a bit rubbery ( both the fish and the corn tortillas) but tasty.  The guac was good and plentiful and the salsas and chips flavorful.  It's local and reasonably priced so we will go back but perhaps I will select a different menu item.
