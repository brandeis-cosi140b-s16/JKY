Good, close to work, and cheap!

I'd recommend if you're in the area for a quick lunch. It's tight quarters inside the restaurant so I find takeout to be the best (work is close so it's easy to eat in the office).

Overall, I'd definitely recommend. I've only ordered lunch which is very reasonably priced and very, very filling!
