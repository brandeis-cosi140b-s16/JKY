The food is hot and good. If I was just rating the food I would give it five stars. But the service was slow and unresponsive. In fact the girl bussing helped us more  than our waitress. They adjusted our meal without complaint as I have food allergies. Portion size is perfect, you leave full but not busting. I would recommend this place for great Mexican food.
