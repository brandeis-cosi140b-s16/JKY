Awesome selection of food, very friendly service !!

I can tell this place is a lot more authentic compared to Chipotle or Robertos. They have fried fish head for crying out loud! Which is actually a popular dish at this place. It's right across from CSN Charleston campus, which is why when my friends and I are tired of Denny's or Tropical Smoothie, we go here instead. No matter what you order you HAVE TO try the different flavored juices they offer on the counter. I've tried Pineapple, Orange, and Watermelon. I stray away from Horchata since I've never really developed a liking for it :( Their watermelon was the BOMB! I kept coming back for refills! The first time I went here I got their enchiladas. The portion and sides of this dish never disappoints! 

I can't believe this place isn't that well-known. But seeing  Latino families come here on a daily basis tells me this place is legit. Being open 'til midnight also helps for those hangovers I guess lol!
