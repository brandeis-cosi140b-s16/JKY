The four reasons why I've never paid full price for anything at Mad Mex before:

2-4 PM: Half priced entrees w/ student ID
4:30-6:30 PM: Half priced wings and $7 BIG AZZ Margaritas
9:00PM -12:00 AM: $7 BIG AZZ Margaritas
After 11:00 PM: Half priced entrees

Anyways, on with the food.  Mad Mex serves up super Americanized Tex-Mex and they don't pretend to be authentic by any means.  They have burritos, tacos, nachos, salads, wings, you name it.  For me, I go solely for their wings.  A large order of 14 wings ($4.50 when half off) is more than sufficient, and pair that with a $7 BIG AZZ margarita and everything is good.  Flavor of choice?  San Francisco.  All their flavors are good and their wings are some of the better wings I've had in Pittsburgh in terms of how well they're cooked.

If I'm not getting wings, what would I get?  Wing-o-rito.  It's a burrito w/ chicken inside that's smothered in wing sauce.  Okay, I really like their wings.

Try their double dipper with black bean dip too!  It's super hearty, slightly spicy, and pairs perfectly with a margarita.

If you go at night, it gets LOUD.  And the place also fills up fast after 11 PM, so you might have to wait if you don't arrive early.
