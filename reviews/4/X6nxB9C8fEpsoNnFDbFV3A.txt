La Gloria - Mexican tacos, quesadillas + burritos in the food court at Caesar's Palace. 

The steak ("bistec") tacos were very good. The order is served as 3 small tacos, made of corn tortillas. These tortillas were quite tasty. 

Their chicken quesadilla is also delicious. The chicken tasted very fresh. 

The nachos and queso (cheese) were amazing! The portion is huge. The cheese dip is smooth and so tasty. 

We ordered our meals as combos (Combo #2) which consisted of the tacos (or quesadilla), a side dish (nachos) and a beer. Each combo cost $19

The service was OK. The cashier forgot my request for "no onions" but I guess it didn't matter as onions weren't in the tacos anyway. 

The food is MUCH better than Taco Bell, so don't assume tacos are tacos. Food was tasty and fresh and portions were good.
