I love this place, we first tried it on Christmas Eve and of coarse we ordered the Brussels sprout nachos. Half off appetizer during happy hour (3-6pm). The nachos were AMAZING! It's got corn, oaxaca cheese, roasted brussels sprouts, pickled onion, chili, pink sauce (roasted garlic beet crema) & fried egg. My boyfriend and I also ordered the steak bowl with creamy pinto beans. It was good! the combination of the house coleslaw adds crunchiness and the grilled onion compliments the steak! I came back to celebrate my birthday with my classmate and we ordered tacos and the brussels sprout nachos. I was not a big fan of their tacos. I got the shrimp taco, braised pineapple pork and the adobo bbq chicken. The only taco I liked was the shrimp taco. The pork and the adobo chicken was alright. I want to try the crispy cod and plantain next time. My classmates enjoyed the brussels sprout nachos, they said they'll come back for more.
