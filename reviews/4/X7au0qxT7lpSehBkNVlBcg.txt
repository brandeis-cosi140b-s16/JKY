Work has taken me downtown a few times over the past couple months and America's Taco Shop has been one of our regular lunch stops.  My favorite is the XL Carne Asada Burrito (probably because it's normally a late lunch and I am starving).  The parking situation sucks being so small and packed even well into the afternoon.  Probably better that we don't arrive during the lunch rush...
