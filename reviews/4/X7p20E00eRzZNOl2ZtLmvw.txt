Another Mexican restaurant that doesn't look like anything spectacular from the outside, but the inside doesn't disappoint. I'm starting to think the trend is that the worse looking the outside facade, the better the food & prices are. This Azteca may not have the best Mexican food, but it's pretty good, especially for the price.

Nothing really stands out to me about any of the lunch plates I've gotten, but I just know I leave very full. The place is a tad bit on the smaller side, with some odd booth arrangements, so expect a wait if you go during the lunch hustle & bustle. It can also be a pain getting in & out of the parking lot but it's well worth it.

Azteca is a lot more popular than you'd think from 1st look, but there's a reason people keep going back & waiting for tables during lunch. You'll leave full without hitting the wallet too hard.
