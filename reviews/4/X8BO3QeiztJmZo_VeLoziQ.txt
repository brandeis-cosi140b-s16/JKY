On my trip to Phoenix, I set out to find something local and unique to the tune of cow head and tongue tacos and a Sonoran hot dog from a taco truck. From what I can tell, La Frontera is one of the only places you can get a Sonoran hot dog during the day. Most of them are parked later in the day, ready for bar goers. The funny thing was is that there were actually two trucks on site, and only one of them served the dogs so I ended up at both. 

Chicago has its celery salt and pickles, and New York has its sauerkraut and mustard, but in Phoenix, they've got Sonoran dogs. Hot dogs are never my go to food but this combination is BOMB. The Sonoran-style hot dog, found also in Tucson and in neighboring Sonora, Mexico, is a hot dog wrapped in mesquite-smoked bacon then cooked on a grill then topped with beans, grilled onions, fresh onions, tomatoes, mayonnaise, cream sauce, mustard and Jalapeno salsa or sauce and served on bread and often with a side fresh-roasted chili. It originated in Hermosillo, the capital of Sonora.

I also ordered a cow head (brain) and cow tongue taco. I'd had cow tongue as a youngster so I wasn't too surprised but the meat of both was mushier than I'd like. I'm also not a huge fan of the corn tortillas but the cilantro and cucumbers were refreshing.

I felt a little out of place here.  Everyone else was Mexican and non-English speaking but we managed.  Despite the language barrier, I got what I wanted and he even knew I didn't know where to get the Mexican coke I ordered so he stepped out of the truck to show me the ice chest along the front.  I thought that was pretty nice.

Cash only! SUPER cheap.
