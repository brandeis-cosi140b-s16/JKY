What I love to get-Green Salsa, Carnitas are good and HUGE portion of meat on the tacos, 5 rolled tacos lunch special with drink $5, Chile Verde Burrito, Carne Asada fries are huge too.

Owner is great guy, very nice and staff is good too. The food is better when he is there though, his attention to that is obvious. 

My staff love Senor Taco's Grande Breakfast Burrito-hold the sour cream- that thing is Ginourmous and they split it. I prefer my chorizo and papas. 

Overall, still not that place I am seeking to replace what I miss from LA, but in my top 5 for AZ.
