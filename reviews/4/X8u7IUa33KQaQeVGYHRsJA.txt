El Tlacoyo truly feels more Mexican than being in Mexico. I know because I've been in Mexico a few times. You do get something different here and it is Hidalgo Regional Cuisine. Some dishes might be cactus soup, head meat tacos, huitacoche cheese crisp (Mexican Truffle or corn smut) Barbacoa (the Hidalgo State Dish) and Mixotes. 

They start you off with two sauces and chips. The green sauce might be an some sort of smooth avocado cream thin sauce that's very spicy and VERY delicious. The red sauce has smoked chills in it and is also very good.

We started with the whats considered to be a delicacy the huitacoche crisp (corn smut or Mexican Truffle). It really was the real deal and was what I tried in Mexico. I liked it much more than last time as it did seem different and not as saucy or cheesy I had it here. It's very earthy and different. 

This time I ordered one of the fish dishes and it was the fish with chili. They gave me a WHOLE FISH. I could tell IT WASN'T A FROZEN FISH as it was VERY FRESH with very SWEET MEAT and was very moist. The fish was very nicely seasoned and was FRESH and DELICIOUS. The fish it's self really was one of the BEST fish dishes I've tasted in Arizona and it was only $11.99. The sides were the usual sides you get at most Mariscos (Seafood) Restaurants, they were rice beans and fries with tortillas.

My husband tried the shrimp diablo. ($11.99) It was spicy smokey and slightly sweet. The shrimp were fresh and prepared well. This dish came with rice beans and tortillas.

Service was good and efficient. The menu is English on one side and Mexican on the other side.

El Tlacoyo is NOT A FANCY PLACE at all being very basic but it is a Special Place as you go for the food.

El Tlacoyo is a little hard to find because it's in a tiny strip mall behind another building but it's worth a try because it's A TRUE GEM.
