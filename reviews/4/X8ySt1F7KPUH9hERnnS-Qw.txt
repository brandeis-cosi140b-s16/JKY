Everything is great at this restaurant.  If you're in the mood for something light, the salads are the way to go.  Their skirt steak salad is delicious.  If you want a heavier fare they have the skirt steak in soft tacos.  They have great dinner entrees as well but pricey.  You can buy coupons from restaurant.com where you can get a $20 voucher for $2.  Completely worth it. But you can only use the restaurant.com vouchers for dinner.

The drinks menu is extensive.  They seem to push Tobin James wines pretty heavily but I don't mind because their wines are great. Happy hour is fun to go to because they have the same delicious foods but at a cheaper price as well as the drinks.  Their sangria is to die for.  The staff is knowledgeable about wines and enjoy making recommendations.  I usually go for lunch but the dinner ambiance was great as well.  A downtown gem.
