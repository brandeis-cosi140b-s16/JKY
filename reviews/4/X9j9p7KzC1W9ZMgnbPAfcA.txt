I've been there twice since I've bookmarked it.

I really like it, even though I don't understand them and they don't understand me. Despite the communication issues (they speak Spanish, I English), the food I order is good and fresh!

I like the ordering process. You go and order your food from the front counter, where they have different people making carne, pork and other types of tacos, sopas and tostadas. You shimmie your way to the different sections to order the type of meat you want. I just point at what looks good and tell them I want everything on it. It usually turns out good for me, except for the fried  cow-guts taco I got. It looked like a tasty type of meat, but was a little fatty and too chewy for me!

I'll definetly go back for more. Perhaps once with a translator so I finally know what I'm ordering!
