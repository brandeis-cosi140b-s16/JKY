Have  been here twice now.  went for lunch and enjoyed the great $3.99 lunch special burrito.  just right amount of food and can't beat the price.  Went back for dinner and service was a little off, took quite a bit to get the food out. Know they were busy and doing a lot of take out orders.    Love the green chile here, and love love love the hotter sauces you can get on request.
