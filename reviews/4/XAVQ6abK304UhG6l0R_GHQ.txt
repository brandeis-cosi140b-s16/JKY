I was really craving Mexican, and after reading some of the other reviews concerning this hole in the wall restaurante I had to give it a try. Located right of the Summerlin Pkwy and Buffalo, this little place has a facade of no thrills but oh what a surprise you get. The menu is small but the food you receive is probably one of the best. The place has only a few tables and a bit of a funky smell, like it used to be a chinese take-out or something, but don't let that distract you. After ordering you notice that the service is extremely quick, like McDonald's quick, (I went on a Monday night around 8pm) and the little salsa bar with their different condiments is concise with pico de gallo, fresh cut wedges of limes, a green chile sauce, and a rich red chili sauce. I ordered the carne asada burrito and the five pack soft tacos with carnitas, carne asada, and lengua. All I decided to take them home to enjoy and what a surprise it was. Each and every one of the tacos were still soft and tender. The meats, no matter if it was the asada, carnitas, or lengua, had a slight roasted smoky flavor with a little kick. It didn't take me long to devour all the tacos. Next it was onto the carne asada burrito. All I can say is wow! Same great taste, smoky, juicy, and downright better than many of the other Mexican burrito joints in town. All I could do was nom, nom, nom! It was my first time trying Tacos El Compita numero dos, but it will not be my last!
