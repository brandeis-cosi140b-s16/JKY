We felt like trying something new this morning so we had a chorizo egg and cheese breakfast burrito and a bacon potato egg and cheese breakfast burrito. They were made with real tortillas, And were Big enough for us to eat half and already get full and at $4.50 a burrito. Awesome prices and awesome food! The woman behind the counter other than the young girl at the register weren't very friendly but I will definitely be coming back and recommending to my friends and family.
