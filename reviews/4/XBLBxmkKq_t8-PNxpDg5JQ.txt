I am giving them 4 stars for making the heaviest batch of nachos I have had in a very long time. It was piled high with tons of meet, cheese, guac, sour cream. I was in nacho heaven. Yes I have been to just about every -icos, bertos, etc, but they were very generous on this particular day and I know it. Thank you for helping with my nacho fix. If I am ever in this part of town again, I just may stop in and say hi.. and grab some more nachos!
