Disclaimer: This review is based solely on their breakfast burritos.

And man are they fabulous!  I typically have them make a beast with eggs, chorizo, bacon, rice, cheese and pico.  It is breakfast nirvana! Next to Los Tacos, I think this place has the best salsa verde in town.  In addition, the staff is super friendly.  Even though the location is out of the way for me, I make the detour whenever possible to enjoy the goodness!
