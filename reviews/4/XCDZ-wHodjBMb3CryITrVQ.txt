Achiote Tacos on this visit and it was very good with grilled pineapple and veggies.  I didn't love the sauce on the side, so I just skipped it and added salsa to it instead.  Probably my favorite chips and salsa at a chain restaurant and I ate my fair share this trip.  Two margaritas and two tacos and I was good to go for New Year's Eve with friends.  Yes, It's a chain, yes it's a pain to go to the mall to visit, but OTB is pretty consistent and we'll be back I'm sure!
