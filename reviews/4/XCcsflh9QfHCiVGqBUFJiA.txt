Went here tonight and I absolutely loved it!! My hubby and I shared the Lobster dip and the seafood enchiladas! We also used the free guacamole deal for checking in on here. We picked a good day to try the enchiladas because they were the special of the day so we saved $5. We can both individually eat a lot of food and munching on chips and salsa, guacamole then the lobster dip then our meal... We were plenty stuffed! We also had our 3 1/2 year old with and their kids menu was attached to a kids magnetic drawing board thing she LOVED it!! Way better than crayons and paper! She got a bean and cheese burrito was was huge btw she a and liked it, so I'm eatng it for lunch tomorrow:) defiantly going back to try more!
