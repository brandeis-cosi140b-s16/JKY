Canonita is located at the Venetian Hotel and Casino, second level in the shopping area...past the food court. (depending on which direction you're coming from.) Try to get a table by the canals so you can see the gondolas with gondoliers serenading guests as they go by the restaurant. Very beautiful ambiance. Service was quick and friendly.

The chips and salsa and guacamole (guac is an additional extra cost) is a must try as a sharable appetizer! Very flavorful and chips tasted fresh and not stale.

I came here for a weekday lunch. Ordered the chicken enchiladas combination plate. It came with 3 enchiladas (choice of green or red sauce) and cilantro lime rice and black beans. I opted for all rice. BIG PORTIONS!!!! If you're not that hungry or got a small appetite, it's best to share dishes with your party. My co-worker got her usual favorite chicken mole entr√©e with beans and rice. 

I think this is a great option from your other many wonderful restaurant choices the Venetian/Palazzo has to offer. I'm glad they have a Mexican restaurant here since there's so many steakhouses and Italian places, it's a good alternative if you're not a fan or craving the more common restaurants. Try to make a reservation here as it does get busy...especially on holidays, weekends or when there's a big convention in town.

I've always wanted to try Canonita and I'm glad I did. The food did not disappoint at all.
