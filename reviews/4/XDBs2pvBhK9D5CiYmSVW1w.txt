We hit up T&T on our first night in Vegas for a "we just flew into Vegas a couple of hours ago and we need some food and drinks now" start to the night. You know what... the place isn't bad at all.

For some reason, every time I walked by this place I assumed it would be pretty much like El Torito and for the most part it is, but the only saving grace of this place is every margarita (mainly the Cadillac) we ordered were very stiff drinks and they were actually quite good. For food, we ended up sharing the appetizer platter which came with chicken tamal, beef flautas, nachos and a few others... its about what you would expect, average. The service was alright... had a flag down the waiter on more than one occasion, but the place was packed and they needed more staff.

Why the 4 stars? Because of the drinks. We each had a few and we were already trailing big time. It was a great start to our first day, err... first hour, and next time we come to Vegas, we will definitely be hitting up the bar here.
