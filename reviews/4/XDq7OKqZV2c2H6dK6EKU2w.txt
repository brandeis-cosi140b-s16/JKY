Only had take-out but the food is quite good. Some traditional Mexican menu options with a twist. Large portions, great taco's, you can choose between flour or corn tortilla. I had flour and I tried a variety and the best was the short rib, the carne asada and the chicken were good though too. Will definitely be back.
