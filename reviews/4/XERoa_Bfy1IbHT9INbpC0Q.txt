First thing you need to realize if you are considering this place is that it is more of a dive bar than an actual restaurant. Do they serve food there? Yes, but most people go there with drinking as their primary objective and food is only secondary. 

That being said, for what it is, they actually have REALLY GOOD FOOD! Their carnitas tacos are the BOMB (shredded chicken are pretty good too), their burgers are near-restaurant quality, and their breakfast burritos (if you happen to be in the area before 12pm) will keep you full for half  the day! I work right next to the place and I eat there at least once a week, and I haven't had a bad meal yet. 

They have great lunch specials where you get a main dish (burrito, tacos, burger, sandwich, etc), a side (rice & beans, fries, chips) and a drink - all for just $5. You can hardly get that a Taco Bell anymore! And a 1/2lb freshly made burger with fries and a drink for $5? Can't even get that at McDonald's. 

Give it a try and you'll be pleasantly surprised, just don't expect fine dining.
