I've been to this restaurant several times and have nothing but positive things to say. The service has always been excellent from the hostess to the waiters and bus boys all the way down to the owner (who has been there to greet us multiple times during our visits). 

The appetizers are very tasty with good fideo, grilled onion and jalapenos, and salsa and beans for the chips. The table side guacamole is also good a good choice. The only detractor is the chips. I thought that they used to make their own tortilla chips but the last few times they were underwhelming and bland. I don't know where they got them but I would much rather have true tortilla chips. 

The meals taste great and the portions are plenty big enough (2 piece combo fills me up and you can add another item still). I've enjoyed the fish tacos and carne asada burrito (red sauce) among other things. The taco salad with grilled vegetables is another highlight for me. On birthdays they will humiliate your friend by throwing a sombrero on and singing their version of happy birthday so that's an entertaining plus ( they get a super sweet churro dessert for being a sport). 

Overall I'm a fan of Juan's Flaming Fajitas and will be back again.
