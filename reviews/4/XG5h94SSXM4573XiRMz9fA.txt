Ok this place is way too cool for sleepy Matthews but welcome none the less. My fist Time was very good ordered a margarita an carne asada tacos. If you like traditional tacos with cilantro and onions this place is great. I eat traditional tacos from this taco trucks around Charlotte and love the traditional simplicity . No cheese no tomatoes just meat, onion,  and cilantro. I say this feels and tastes like a fine dining taco truck. A step up from the street corner packaged in a trendy fun environment.

Next time I will try the fish tacos and save room for desert!
