Awesomesauce ... quite literally!  The test of a good Oaxacan restaurant is how good its mole negro is.  Mixing different kinds of chilies with chocolate and Mexican cinnamon is quite a culinary balancing act, and this place does it really well. The chicken which was blanketed by the rich mole negro oaxaque√±o was juicy and tender, and thank goodness there were tortillas on the side to sop up every bit of the tasty mole. Definitely a place for many repeat visits.
