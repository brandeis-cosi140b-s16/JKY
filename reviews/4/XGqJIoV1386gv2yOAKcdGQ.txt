I went back for lunch today with some friends.  Had the combo fajitas.  It was very good.  My friend was impressed.  I wasn't happy the first time I came, but I think they are working on it and are committed to doing the right thing for the Nifsa's franchise!!  Don't come here for a taco or burrito, they don't do that here.  Service was exceptional.  The shrimp diablo was incredible!!  Give em a shot.
