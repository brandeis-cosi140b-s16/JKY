Hiding next to the Burger Company is a little place called Picante.  We ventured in one day to check it out and have been back three times since.  Obviously we like it because we've been back.  Simple menu with solid choices and good quality food.  For the most bang for your buck go with the three soft tacos and load them up with all the fixings.  They have chicken, fish, steak and ground beef and lots of veggies.  The Guacamole is good but an order of chips and a coke will put you over $10 so a took a star off for being a tad pricey.  They should have a deal where you can get chips and a drink for around $7.99 with your tacos.  One point, they have $2.00 Sam Adams bottles seemingly everyday and also on the weekends they have $1 tacos.  Great little place.
