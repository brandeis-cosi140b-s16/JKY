Great food!  Truck parking! This place is the best restaurant in Gila Bend.  We ordered the beef taco/beef burrito combination.  The meat is pulled beef and very juicy (they give you a lot of napkins and you'll need them).  The salsa is freshly made; green and red (red is the hottest).  The staff is very friendly.  The restaurant is tiny; five tables inside, and more outside.  The food is high-end quality on Styrofoam plates.  The prices are higher than average for fast food, but well worth it.
