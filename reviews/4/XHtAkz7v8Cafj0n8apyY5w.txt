Awesome location, awesome bar, the food and service were great.  Huge fan of the Mad Mex at Penn State, and this is reminding me a lot about it.  There is an amazing garage type door that opens the front to make the restaurant more of an outside area, and I've been told by several people that there may be an even larger outside area they are working on for the roof.  If someone could confirm this, that would be awesome.  

Anyway the food is great, the margaritas rock and I can't wait to go back.
