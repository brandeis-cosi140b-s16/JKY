This is my favorite mexican food place ever!!  I rated a 4 because its only good in the day time. After about 4pm it seems it been sitting too long, otherwose id probably eat there way too much.  The xaviers special burrito is amazing as well as their salsa.  Id def recommend xaviers to anyone looking for good mexican food.  My only suggestions would be to upgrade appliances, remodel, expand and open on sundays!
