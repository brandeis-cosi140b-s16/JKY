I was here at least once every day that I was in Vegas. I still dream about their chicken tacos (with extra pico de gallo) and dollar margaritas. Trust me, they are that good! Word of advice: stay away from the beef tacos; they are less than stellar. I'd go for the strawberry margarita as it masks the tequila. The lime one is pretty good too, but the strawberry is amazing. My friend who had been here before told me that they offered dollar tacos and dollar margaritas from midnight to 6am, but to my recollection, tacos and margaritas were $1 all day long. 

They have this fishbowl drink here that is adorable. It's blue like water and may or may not have candy fish in it. Not sure since I didn't get the chance to try it, but I wish I did! The portions for the nachos are huge as well. One couple that was sitting by us on one particular occasion thought they could finish it on their own, but they barely made a dent in it. What a waste!

The service was terrible the first time that we were there, but the more we went, the more it improved. Maybe they started to recognize us? The bartenders were always nice though! They had no problem talking to drunk girls at 4am. We were rejected at the entrance two nights in a row because the kitchen couldn't handle any more orders. Imagine our disappointment when the manager behind the velvet rope informed us that the kitchen was too busy. 

So, remember: chicken tacos (I recommend at least 2 per person) and strawberry margaritas!
