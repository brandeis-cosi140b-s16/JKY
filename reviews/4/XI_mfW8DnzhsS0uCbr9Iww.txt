I based this review on being compared to a Filiberto's. 

I ordered the carne asada chimichanga.  I don't think Filiberto's has an option for this. 

This crispy deep fried burrito came on a bed of lettuce with the typical dressings you can find at any similar establishment. It came with pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole. I ordered this Togo. 

When I first opened it up you can really smell the freshness of it. I wasn't sure how good this would be since there doesn't seem to be a lot of customers at that time but it really was good. The chimichanga was crispy and the carne asada was really good. I'm going to definitely be back to try just the burrito and instead of deep fried as well just to really compare. I loved the jalape√±o in the pico as well. Compared to Filiberto's this food was definitely an upgrade. 

Why the 4 stars instead of 5? 
A few things:
1.  Cleanliness - I came through the drive thru at night and it really can be a little sketchy even though it's Gilbert. There were random buckets and a table right by where you order. In addition it looks like the cook was handling the cash register as well and I highly doubt he was washing his hands between grabbing everything and cooking. I guess this type of establishment it is expected though. 

2.  I hate establishments who charge $.75 for the use of plastic. Yes it's typically a sign that it's a mom and pop shop but ugghh it's a pet peeve. 

3. The cashier asked what type of salsa I wanted and through yelp I saw that the green salsa was pretty good. Unfortunately they forgot this. Also, this was a chimichanga and they only included a fork and no knife. That's annoying. 

I'll be back! I love supporting mom and pop shops and this place seems to have good enough food to try it out if you're looking for a Filiberto's alternative.
