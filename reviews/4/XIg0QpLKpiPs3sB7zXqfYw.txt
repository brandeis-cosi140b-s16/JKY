Glad I did not read the reviews first.   The food is very good, no one pushed chips and salsa, in fact, Vicki, our waitress was great.   The portions are huge, and food was very flavorful, so I think it is a much better alternative to the fast food offered at other places in the terminal.   Yes, like every restaurant in every airport, it is crowded and the service is hectic, but, we liked it.
