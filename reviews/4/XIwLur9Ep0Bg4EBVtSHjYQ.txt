Pink Taco is definitely all you think about when dining here on a Sunday.  The Hard Rock Hotel's big pool party Rehab is on Sundays, and one could get super distracted by all the beefcakes and silicone filled ladies prancing around in their little tiny suits, some with the camel toe that gets your imagination working, and the name of the restaurant then holding some personal meaning.

I did not actually have the pink taco, I ordered the shrimp tacos, and they were delightful.  The chips were home made, fried in the kitchen,  and the salsa was of three varieties, so i could mix and match to make my taste buds curious.  Pitchers of margaritas flowed into the glasses, and one of them even poured onto the table.  The waitress was so kind that when she saw a certain yelpers clumsiness with her pour, she actually replaced the spilled margarita, without us asking.  Our table for 12 was set us super fast, and I'm pretty sure everyone was satisfied with their meals, as well as with the distractions of the scantily clad diners.  This was the least expensive meal I had in Vegas, but never felt like it was a "cheap" meal.

I forgot to buy my "I love Pink Taco" underwear, but maybe I'll pick up a pair the next time.  I would definitely return here.  Maybe they will open a sister restaurant somewhere in Vegas called the Roast Beef Curtain.... they could specialize in sandwiches, and not pseudo-Mexican food.  Just an idea.
