Great to find cheap food on the strip.  $6- for a burrito that's super filling.

The location is to be desired (under McDonalds (2nd floor) and shared dining area with Panda Express and some pizza place).

There's also always bums hanging around outside, but that didn't take away from not spending $$ on food.
