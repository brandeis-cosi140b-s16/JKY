Chipotle is one of my favourite mexican fast food  joint. Its good that you can have the same tasty food rite on the vegas strip. for a veggie burrito its the same price as you get anywhere and just 25c more for the chicken fajita one ..yummy. Dont expect the same sitting place and like the normal chipotle ..but quality is same so enjoy the burrito in heart of vegas strip :) ...
