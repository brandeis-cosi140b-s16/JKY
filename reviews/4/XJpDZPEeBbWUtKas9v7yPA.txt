"Yay! I'm a fan." does Not do this place service.  Went their with my Sister and we had a Great Time!!!  We both chose the "build your own"... I got 1 chicken 'n 1 beef chimichanga and a beef taco(well, s'pose to be beef, but it was chicken... F Me Dude!  It Was Really Good), and a tostada on the side.  First off; The service was Excellent and they ended up refilling both the chips and my soda 3x's. in quick order... Someone from the staff was by the our table every 5/1- mins. or so and they were super friendly.  The food took about 20 mins. to arrive, However, The chips(Fresh/Hot) and salsa were so yummy we didn't notice.  The price is fair and they could charge more for the quality product they serve... Give it a try... it may be my new goto for Hispanic/Latin cuisine!!!(Also, they Do Not have just "Mexican" food; they serve items both Comlumbian and Puerto Rican as well...
