If you're looking for authentic Mexican tacos, you've hit the jackpot! Yeah they're on the pricier side, but definitely worth it! Waitresses are all nice and very attentive. My boyfriend had the coctel with shrimp and octopus and it had great flavor. Although be forewarned all ye who are afraid of spice because their salsas are equal parts flavor and heat. 

They also have freshly made drinks that are refreshing!
