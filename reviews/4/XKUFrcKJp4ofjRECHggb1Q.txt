I really like the Nacho Daddy concept. They have really unique flavors of nachos, like Thai chicken as an example. The only reason I won't go to 5 stars is portion size. I think a restaurant named "Nacho Daddy" should offer the mac daddy-size nachos. But they don't. I think for those of us who LOVE their nachos, a larger size should be offered.
