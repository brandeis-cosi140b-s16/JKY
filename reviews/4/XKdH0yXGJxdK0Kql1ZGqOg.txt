It was a little on the warm side in the restaurant but it is 117 out in august. The service was fantastic, we had drinks at the bar while we waited to be seated. The bartender was very friendly. I had the fajita chimichanga and my husband had the El Rico with steak. Both items were flavorful and well prepared. The El Rico is spicy so beware.
