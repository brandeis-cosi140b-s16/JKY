So, I dig this place. The burrito meats were freshly cooked, not dried-out, and not overcooked. The queso was a delicious addition, but I'm sad that it was a $1 extra. Sure, the fresh tortilla is great, but I'm far more impressed by "the mixer." Once they put all of the ingredients on the tortilla, they mix it all up with a little spatula so that every bite is uniform. I gotta say, this is genius. I don't like burritos many times, because you get whole bites of one thing or another. This is a brilliant extra. Can you other burrito places do this too?
