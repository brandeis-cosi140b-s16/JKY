I'm not a steak fan, and that's all they serve here, but darn it if I don't love these tacos.  There's rarely a night that I'm not in the mood to have them for dinner.  Here's the rest of my two cents:

-THE BEST salsa I've ever had at a restaurant.  That's just my opinion, but it tastes like homemade... it's fresh and chunky and the perfect amount of cilantro... there's enough kick, but the flavor is just delicious.

-The corn!  What they do to that corn is amazing, it's a flavor combination I've never experienced before and I love it, you have to taste it to understand though, I can't describe it. (the corn itself can be hit-or-miss... sometimes it's a little hard).  

-Every time I go, I feel like I've been transported to the movie "Honey, I Shrunk the Limes".  Is it possible that they get smaller with each visit??  

-And yes, it is pricey.  I didn't notice it at first, because it's so good and I didn't spend that much money, but for what you get? (case in point: LIMES [see above])  Chips and salsa are $1.50, which is fine with me, but they upsold me to guacamole (I'm not a hard sell, or quick at math), and after I paid I realized that ordering the guacamole added $5 to the bill!!!!  Things like that add up...

Great place though, and the atmosphere is cool and relaxing, with a Mexico beachy vibe... I do recommend it highly, but bring your own citrus.
