Great burritos, I don't think I can say anything not said elsewhere in the reviews. The only thing keeping it from a five star is that their hot is clearly "white guy hot". I haven't had anything approaching what I would consider moderate heat. Quality of burrito and the customer service is on point though (despite the somewhat odd pressure for cash while taking space in banking central). 
Overall, my favorite lunch spot when visiting Charlotte
