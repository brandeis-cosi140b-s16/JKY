Its been a while yelp!  Back from my trip in Charlotte and this place deserves my first review.

I was fortunate enough to catch a few of the World Cup 2014 games here.  Great vibe, food, and drinks all around.  I was seated at the bar with a couple of my buddies and the bartender took care of us with quickness and efficiency.  Making sure our food orders came out on time, and that we always had chips and salsa.  I am from the Bay Area, so I have pretty high standard of what Mexican food should taste like, aside from having real Mexican food in Mexico.

Drinks were decently price, not too expensive.  I tried my first "flight of tequila" and with it he made his own special sangria mix as a chaser.  I thought that was pretty cool.  Didn't catch his name, but my friends and I thought he was a cool dude.

Non-locals try the Hop Drop n Roll IPA if they have it.
