The best Mexican food in the Phoenix area. It is a total hole in the wall place. Don't let that scare you off!  Their margaritas are wonderful, rice and beans are awesome, and their chicken enchiladas suizas rock! I alternate between that and their pork "special." 1 star knocked off for slow service.
