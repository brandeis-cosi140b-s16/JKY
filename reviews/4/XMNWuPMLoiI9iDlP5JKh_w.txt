Can Bakersfield East Blvd survive this revolving door of a cursed location? *Insert dramatic music here* 

Finally had a chance to check out the new nino on the block (see what I did there). The Hitman and I ventured here last week for dinner and drinks. It was rocking for a Wednesday evening. 

I love the decor. The cool old school light bulb type fixtures that hang, garage doors opening to the sidewalk, vintage Western movie playing on the tv... great vibe.

We started with guac. Loved the fresh radish garnish on top. I went with tacos... one short rib and one pastor. Both were pretty good, but I would declare the short rib the winner in a face-off.

Drink special alert: PBR's are just $2 every day and come in a boot. Disclaimer: not an actual boot, but a glass shaped like a boot. As hard as it was to pass up a boot, I decided on a margarita(s). Salted rim and mason jar for the win! 

Staff is ridiculously nice. Seriously, it felt like 45 different people checked on us. We chatted with the manager as well. So friendly. 

If you don't live in this hood, here's where it gets tricky. And this has been the problem for every restaurant in this space: parking. They don't have a lot. Be wary about parking in the Harris Teeter. The peeps there are not happy about it. Bakersfield does offer valet across the street at Berrybrook.

Best of luck to Bakersfield. I'm a big fan!
