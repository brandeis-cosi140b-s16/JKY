El Charro's Taco Shop is a great place for breakfast, or conversely, breakfast for dinner. I would recommend the Charro breakfast special ($6.99). It's pretty darn spicy and comes with a side of rice and beans. It's basically Chilaquiles. The huevos rancheros is another great dish. I think it's the #11. It comes with over-easy eggs layered in between corn tortillas topped with a red sauce. Shredded lettuce, pico de gallo, and a side of rice and beans accompany the dish. 

It's a family affair at El Charro's! The husband is the owner and is on the register sometimes, the wife cooks, and a younger girl who I'm assuming to be the daughter cashiers as well. I love family restaurants! Customer service is great and the restaurant is clean.
