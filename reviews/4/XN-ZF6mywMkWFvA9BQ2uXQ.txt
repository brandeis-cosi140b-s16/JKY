Okay I gave this place 4 stars because of the memories (fogged memories at that) it brought back to me.

This place reminds me of taco carts in Tijuana back in my younger days. Both the carts in Tijuana and Martinez Taco Bar serve up small street tacos. Both places seem to have a dry Carne Asada street taco with onion and cilantro. Both places had canned soda. And both places didn't seem to have any cats or dogs running around the neighborhood...hmmmm

The difference is, I was drunk in Tijuana and the food was good. MTB, I was sober and the food was not so good, but it was just....eh?

I'm not sure why it takes a month to change over from Coke to Pepsi, but judging from previous reviews it apparently does.

However I did find the put plenty of meat on my street tacos so I had no complaints. EXCEPT, I think I got three Carne Asada tacos instead of two and one lengua taco. But this seems to be a pattern after reading other reviews.

So here is my recommendation....
Arrive slightly intoxicated (if over 21) and hungry, order some street tacos, cover in one of the salsa choices available and go have a seat outside and drink a beer with it. Then it won't be bad!!

But officially I'd say 2.5 stars!
