Feel like you're missing the Phat Burrito in Elizabeth, and don't feel like driving all the way to South End? Drop into Sabor - you can get a burrito that's much the same, from the ordering process through delivery, shows up on similar metal plates and you can serve yourself from an awesome salsa bar.

Really wanting a hamburger, as if from the old Snoops/Spoons location that was here? Order up a chimichurri burger. It's not quite the same, but it might just hit the spot.

In order to get the best - and perhaps most unique section of the menu - stick to the items such as arepas, empanadas and pupusas. You can find arepas down on the South side of town if you look hard enough, and empanadas at sister location Three Amigos, and pupusas all over Central Avenue, but all in one location? That's hard to find. Here, they are all done well, done fast, and even done in unique varieties, such as the spinach pupusa.

Do be aware that each is served as a single item. So step up to the flat screen menu boards and order yourself as many as are needed to fill your belly, grab a drink from the cooler (or the fountain), find a seat and wait a few short minutes for some fresh, hot treats while listening to the tunes and enjoy!
