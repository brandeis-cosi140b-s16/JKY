Just purchased a Carne Asada Burrito with no pico de gallo (just guacamole and meat) and it's ridiculously good! Tastes fresh and homemade! Comfort food indeed! Usually the burrito comes with two little cups of salsa; I asked for extra and they gave me one more cup. I would understand if it were two of the medium cup sizes but they're not.
