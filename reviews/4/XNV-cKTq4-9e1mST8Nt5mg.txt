With a move I took out here recently I had to stop to a little family owned local joint for some Mexican.  It's nothing incredibly fancy, but I enjoyed it.

The service was very attentive, and they can fill up pretty quick.

It sucks to see some of the bad reviews on here because I got an impression of a hard working staff.  The prices are also incredibly reasonable.

I plan on returning,
