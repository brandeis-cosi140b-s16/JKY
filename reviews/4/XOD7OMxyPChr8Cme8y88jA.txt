Del Taco is my favorite fast food joint, ever.

Service is pretty speedy and the food is dangerously addictive. (If the drive-thru looks ridiculous, I don't mind heading inside to order bc the staff are pretty speedy.)

Out of everything I've tried on the menu, the Macho Burrito is probably my fave. I get it with the beef and beans combo (bc you can choose either seasoned beef, grilled chicken, or a combo of beef and beens). This Macho Burrito is exactly as it sounds... Macho. It has your choice of meat filling, red + green sauces, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, cheddar cheese, and sour cream.

The Deluxe 1/2lb Bean & Cheese Burrito is also a good one. It's packed with beans, cheese, red or green sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream. It's pretty ginormous, so I don't recommend putting it down once you've started on this guy. And I also recommend keeping it partially wrapped while you're eating to avoid a mess.

Another really awesome thing about Del Taco is that they have crinkle cut fries. Yes, crinkle cut fries!!! (Crinkle cut) fries at a taco joint is pretty freakin' awesome. 

BTW - Where can I buy Del Taco's Inferno Sauce?!!! It's dang good for fast food hot sauce and it actually has a kick.
