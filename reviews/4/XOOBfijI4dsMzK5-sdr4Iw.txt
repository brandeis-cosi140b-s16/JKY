Great spot to hit up before or after the game and save some money over those pricey concessions in the process! Friendly staff, very clean restaurant, and the same deliciousness that can be found at all the other Chipotles'. Definitely will make a point to go back for a quick, easy, inexpensive meal again next time I'm downtown!
