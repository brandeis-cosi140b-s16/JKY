Mad Mex delivered a pretty solid experience this evening.  The host told us 35 minute wait but it only really took 15.  Impressive.  

The mixed drink was strong and well made.  There was a good selection of beers on tap and even woodchuck hard cider in a bottle.

We got the grilled fish tacos and the Thai burrito.  Both were tasty and well done.  Portions were really very large.  The appetizer of pick three salsas with chips was a good experience.  The habenero pineapple salsa was appropriately spicy and the black bean dip was great (couldn't stop eating it), the guac was excellent too I was told (I can't stand avocados).  

Friendly and efficient wait staff too.
