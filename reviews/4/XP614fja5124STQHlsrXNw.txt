We were only passing through Phoenix for a festival, but stopped along in Mesa to get some Mexican food, which all of the border states seem to do spectacularly. 

This place was definitely no exception to the rule. There was only one table left when we arrived and was a constant stream of take away orders ordered and served in the time we were there, most of which appeared to be regulars as the waitstaff seemed to remember and converse with most of the customers.

I had the burrito con camaron (shrimp) for $5.99 which was wonderfully priced considering its shrimp:filling ratio, i had fresh, deliciously spiced shrimp right up til the last bite. It was one of those meals where i should have stopped half way but I simply could not. It was delightful, and worth the almost food coma I experienced after.
