I have been in Phoenix for a week and thus have eaten a lot of Mexican food. This place was one of the best. Great tortillas and nice mole. It's one of few options in the area, so it's nice to know that it's actually a solid little restaurant. They have a nice patio, I would eagerly go back to sit on the patio, relax, and eat their amazing tortillas. I wasn't crazy about the beans but they were really the only element I didn't care for.
