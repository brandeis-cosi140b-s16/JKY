Definitely a must try! 

I was very pleased and this place has the spice that most Asians are craving. 

Chicken tacos- had the spice from the kim chee. A little bit much for me, but I know most people like this. Nice fresh flavor too. Although some type of salsa would have been nice. 

Fries- they had some type of red seasoning similar to the taste of Hot Fries chips from the bag. Also pretty spicy. 

Sweet dough- this was my absolute favorite. Nice soft dough sprinkled with sugar. Warm and moist, simplicity at it's finest. 

Great service. Can't ask for more.
