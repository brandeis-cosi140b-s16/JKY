The hubby and I were searching for a restaurant and found Tediberto's on HappyCow. We aren't giant Mexican food fans but thought maybe we would try it anyway.
The place is hard to find. If you don't know what you are looking for, you won't find it (northeast corner of 1st st and Roosevelt. The farthest door from 1st). There's no sign and the only reason we were able to locate it was because we walked around the entire building and on the way back saw people sitting inside. 
Once inside, we were awkwardly stared at by people sitting in a booth until one of them asked us if we were there for dinner and told us to sit anywhere. They apparently serve brunch all day on Sundays as we were given the brunch menu. We ordered No Way Jose Nachos, a quesadilla, and tacos. The wait for our food was pretty significant but the decor or the place is fun to look at and the music wasn't so loud that we couldn't hold a conversation. The food came out one dish at a time and each one was delicious! So delicious in fact that I ordered cupcake a la mode for dessert (and they were very friendly when I asked them to check to make sure there was no coconut in the recipes).
My one complaint is that the waiter seems inexperienced. He ordered us tostadas instead of the quesadilla and in general, sometimes took longer than a more experienced waiter would. However, he was extremely pleasant and responsive whenever we asked for anything or had any questions.
