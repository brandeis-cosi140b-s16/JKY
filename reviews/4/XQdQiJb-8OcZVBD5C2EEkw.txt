I'm generally a fan of Chipotle and recently having started HCG and eating clean, even more so. Just a quick tip - If anyone is looking for a decent place to eat out on HCG and not get off track, Chipotle is your answer!   During the very low calorie protocol even - you can order a side of chicken or steak and a side of pico.  It's typically only $3 too.   Yeah Chipotle!
