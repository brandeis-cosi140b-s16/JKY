I love tacos, and I'm definitely coming back here for more. $2 a taco + no wait to sit down + pick your own drink from the grocery fridge + Mexican television in the background = pleasant afternoon. If you're going for tacos, I'd stick to the carne asada and al pastor. The chicken, even though covered with delicious cojita cheese, wasn't very flavorful. 

Even though there's plenty of room in the restaurant area and it's cool since you walk through the grocery store to get there, the atmosphere lacks a little - so you may not want to plan a romantic date at this Mexican grocery/restaurant. In that case, I'd recommend grabbing some cojita cheese and marinated beef from the deli to make those romantic tacos at home. 

Speaking of the grocery, it has some great items you won't normally find at other places, like Inka kola and tamarind soda. It seems a bit hit or miss though, but fun to look around. Nice selection of spices and candy.
