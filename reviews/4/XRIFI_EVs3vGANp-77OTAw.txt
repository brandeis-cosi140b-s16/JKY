This place is under new management since the last time we had gone in couple years ago. It is so much better than I remember and wish I had started going here sooner rather than the other place down the street on Grand.  The food is a little better priced in my opinion and definitely better variety. I recommend the Mar and Tierra burrito which has shrimp and carne asada; I like spicy foods but I usually end up getting this burrito minus the red sauce it is super spicy. I also recommend the El Panzon burrito, it has chicken, carne asada, retried beans, and shrimp; I also get this minus red sauce. 

The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is due to one of the cashiers that works there during the lunch shift. Every single time I have gone in there durning her shift, the mere sigh of a customer puts her in an instant bad mood. If you don like your job then don't do it! 

Be careful when ordering the numbered items though because some menu items share the same numbers. Be specific!
