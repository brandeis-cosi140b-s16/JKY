Nacho Daddy has come along way. We have been coming in for years and have watched it mature and evolve. The menu is very diverse. We are mostly vegetarian (+fish) and all of the menu items can be altered to meet our needs. They actually have a vegan menu too! The service and wait staff are very friendly. The environment is fun in the bar, family oriented in the main section and the view from the patio is excellent. Our favorite nachos are the Thai Nachos (minus chicken, add shrimp!) favorite margarita is the "skinny" (fresh lime juice, agave nectar and tequila) the "pun" name and all, it is an excellent establishment in Henderson. We highly recommend giving nacho daddy a try. (Our server tonight, Sarah from WA, was superb!) thumbs up for Nacho Daddy!!
