Sandbar is like a slightly more affordable, less dressed-up Devil's North. They literally have sand on the outside patio, so in the warm months you can rock sandals and feel the [artificial] sand between your toes as you sip your beer. Not too shabby.

In general, I have been pretty happy with the crowds at this location, as well. The less dressed up vibe blurs the lines of who has how much money and even the music is more accessible. 

Of the North Scottsdale scene, Sandbar is my standout favorite . . . if I have a ride. I have found myself on more than a couple of occassions stranded at three in the morning in search of a taxi cab on Scottsdale road.
