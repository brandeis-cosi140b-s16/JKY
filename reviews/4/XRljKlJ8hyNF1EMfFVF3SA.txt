Heard about this place on Diners, Driveins & Dives.   They featured the Phoenix [NW Corner 19th & Greenway] location.   First time there.   Mxiican/Asian Fusion, the mix works.     The hardest part is what to order.   They have 14 different items including 4 kinds of fried rice [jerk, chicken, plain and pork fried rice].    Tried Jade Red Chicken; its a hit.    Black beans very good and their Skinkerdoodles are great.    All in All a good first time experience.    I will return.     Recommend your try it; I think you will enjoy the fusion of chinese and mexican.    A good combination.   The price for a drink and the combination $10.
