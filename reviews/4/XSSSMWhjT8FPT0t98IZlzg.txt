Second time to visit and the veggie burrito was pretty tasty!  I like the salsa bar each of the salsas has a very unique flavor.  TVs up kind of loud and doesn't get very good reception so it breaks up quite a bit,  which can be irritating.  Overall for a Taqueria pretty good all-around: nice environment, nice staff, excellent food.  Will definitely be back!
