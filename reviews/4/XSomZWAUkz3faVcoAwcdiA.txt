Happy to stumble upon this place while looking for a munch on our way to a concert at the Marquee Theater. Really, REALLY good carne asada.  We had burritos, and the trio chip platter which includes chips, salsa and guacamole.  The guac and the carne were authentic with just the right amount of kick. You know you're at an authentic Mexican joint when they garnish your meal with a radish chunk. The price was fine, so I'm not sure about all the griping about being pricey.  The quality of meat makes up for being charged 50 cents more.  This place is a gem.  They have a limited menu, but what they do do is spot on delicious. Tasty to the mex, I mean max.
