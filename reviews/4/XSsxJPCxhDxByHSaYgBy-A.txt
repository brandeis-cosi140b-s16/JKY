I've been going to el pollo loco forever and sense I'm in Henderson now its pretty much my default spot. When I don't know what I want its like " well....... The Crazy Chicken it is then". I don't have anything bad to say about this establishment. There food always taste fresh, the service is cool but I rarely use the drive thru ( just a habit I have ) so I wouldn't know about how that experience would be. I mean its grilled chicken at a fast food pace but backyard quality, the burritos are filling and satisfying. My mandatory item I must get are there al carbon tacos, they remind me of the little taco cart tacos back in L.A. The place is clean........ and its grilled chicken soooo....... yeah.
