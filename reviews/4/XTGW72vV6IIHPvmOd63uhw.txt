This was my 1st time here and I am impressed! We went thru the drive thru, ordered 2 grilled chicken burritos and 1 sausage potato and eggs burrito.

My sausage burrito was delish! Not greasy, full of flavor and HUGE!  The chicken burrito tasted yummy but were very soggy, not sure if it was from the chicken or the pico, it was not a burrito we could have eaten in the car.

The service was very good, quick, and our order was correct... What more could you ask for?  Over all I was impressed and will be going back :)
