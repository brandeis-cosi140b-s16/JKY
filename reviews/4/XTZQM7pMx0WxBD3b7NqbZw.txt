I've been going to Pasqual's for the past 15+ years.  First the one on Monroe, then they briefly had one on University Dr. in Middleton, and I have also eaten at the one in Verona, the old one on Atwood, and the one in Hilldale.  Growing up, we went to Pasqual's as a family every Friday for dinner.  I even worked at Pasqual's when I was 14.  Worked there a day, then they realized I was 14 and underage to work there, so I was let go.  My point is, I know Pasqual's really well.

It's delicious Tex-mex.  It's not trying to be Mexican, and it isn't.  The ingredients are fresh, it's not greasy, very quality food at very cheap prices.  Some of my favorites: chicken enchiladas with red sauce.  I have had the green sauce and the mole, and the red is still my favorite.  Get it will blue corn tortilla.  I usually order the "single dinner" and get it with black beans and pinto beans, no rice.  It's a big serving of food, and if I can't stop eating it and finish the whole plate, I'm in major pain.  I also enjoy the Jerk Chicken burrito (a la carte, the burritos are huge).  The taco salad is decent, not super amazing, and the nachos do not hit the spot like nachos should.  Get a basket of chips w/ salsa and guac when you first order.  Your dinner will be ready before you even finish the chips.  The salsas are so good, and you can buy them at Woodman's..  The margs are amazing: not too sweet, not too sour, and very strong.  

Pasqual's is very casual, kinda laid-back, very "Madison."  Every time I'm in town, I always go back!
