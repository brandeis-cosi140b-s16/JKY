The burritos are huge!! For $10 me and a 3.5 year old split one, and we only are 1/2! They tasted really good but I could have used a little less onion in it. It was also weird to have to buy a bottle of water when I'm use to just getting a free glass of water when I go out to eat. If I'm ever in the mood for burritos though we'll definitely be back. Can't beat the size for the price.
