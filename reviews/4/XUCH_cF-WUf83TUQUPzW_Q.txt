We finally had an opportunity to check out La Condesa and it lived up to all the great reviews we had read.  We overordered as we wanted to try several things.

The salsa bar was fun.  It was nice to try a few different flavors.  My daughter who doesn't like spice really enjoyed the peanut salsa.  The tomatillo was exceptional as well.  

I did not think the guacamole was well executed.   There were onions, tomatos, pineapple and cilantro but it was more pico-ish than guacamole-like.  And where was the avocado?  For $3.95 the portion was relatively small.  I would definitely pass on this in the future.    

For main courses, we had the mole chicken quesa and an assortment of tacos.  

The mole was exceptional and wasn't at all bitter.  The quesa itself was flaky, crisp and delicious.   If you are a mole fan, this is a must try.

For tacos, we had the baja shrimp, slow cooked pork and carne asada.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the breading light and didn't overwhelm the flavors.  I loved the pork which was moist, flavorful and satisfying.  The carne asada was very good though pretty typical street taco fare.   

I will definitely dine here again.   The setting matched the food... casual, comfortable but not your typical mexican fare.  It's definitely a step above.
