I just moved to Phoenix and was looking for a good drink special for lunch. If you go to Arriba at 3pm you get the overlapping lunch menu and happy hour special. 99 cent margaritas! I spent $23 and got two big lunches and four delicious margaritas. They have a nice patio with cool murals and a big waterfall. The inside is also nice with a big bar area. I had the green chile burrito and my husband had the Rio Grande enchilada. Both were good and had some spice! It's nice to see a southwestern restaurant that isn't afraid to use a little heat. I'll definitely go back. I just hope I can find someone to drive me because those margaritas are too good to pass up.
