I didn't think I could find a decent restaurant in the area but this was a nice surprise. The service is friendly and pretty quick. I had the guacamole and mojitos, which were both very tasty. Then shared a fajita plate. This is definitely one of those places where you should share a plate, they are ridiculously big.

Ohh ask for "pico de gallo" when you get your chips. It's a small plate with cabbage and salsa, pretty good.
