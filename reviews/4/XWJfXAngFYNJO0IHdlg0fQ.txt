Perfect food for the late night grubs! 3am after a club or a bar..and you just wanna have a good time and need somethin to fill up those alcoholic tummies, this is the joint yo! 

Ok so I haven't gone here late night yet, but i assume it would be perfection. Burritos are awesome and cheap. They melt in your mouth and leak onto your lips and faces. I really like carne asada and adobada burritos. They're both under 5 bucks. Tacos are too cheesy for me but if you're a cheesy type of gal or guy, check it out. 

Typical looking slightly larger mexican restaurant. The service at night was horrible. I stood in front of this mexican chick at the register for at least 10 seconds before she noticed i was standing in front of her. Then she looked at me and was like..'what?' 
GIRL I WILL SLAP YOU! some atrocious service at the time. other days that i have gone it was not that bad, but beware for the beezies who hate their job. 

food is good..forget all the other things i said :).
