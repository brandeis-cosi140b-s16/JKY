As good as the original Libby's El Rey Cafe in Globe, AZ. Libby's daughter, Marisa, is using the same homemade recipes tested since 1947. If you've been through Globe, you should know Libby's. Now, East Valley'ites have a chance to try. The complimentary tortilla chips they bring out are called "butter chips", and you will find out why. But don't fill up on them. Guac was not out of can. Everything is homemade. I had the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada Style. I shouldn't have finished it all. But I did. Go check 'em out!
