Tried this place for the first time because of a commercial I saw about their new stuffed quesadilla and it was awesome! Had the enchilada one, very tasty. The chicken was spectacular, the tortilla was fresh, the cheese was generous and they had some kind of cabbage in it that really brought all the flavors together very nicely! Only problem was the lobby was smokey. I understand that it was because they were in the process of making their awesome fresh grilled chicken, but it made my eyes watery and cough a little. But overall! It was very good!
