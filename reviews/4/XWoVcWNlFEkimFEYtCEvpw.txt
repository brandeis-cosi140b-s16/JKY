Pretty pricey but consistently good food. The breakfasts on Sunday morning are rather nice and they have a clown that offers balloon animals and face painting for the kiddos. Not the same old mexican food that you will get from other area restaurants, Arriba's serves more New Mexican fare than traditional tex-mex.
