This is a great little spot to grab a quick meal for takeout or to dine in. 

You order at the counter and they have a variety of different menu items a la carte or in meals. I ordered the two mini taco plate with al pastor and lengua tacos. This combination also came with rice and beans as well as a drink. I ordered a Mexican corn to share as well. For two combos and a corn the total was under $20. 

The tacos were really good, my favorite of the two I tried was the al pastor. It was flavorful and they were generous with the meat. The rice and beans were fresh and tasty as well. The corn was grilled, a great addition to the meal.

Everything we tried was great and I'll be back sample more of their menu.
