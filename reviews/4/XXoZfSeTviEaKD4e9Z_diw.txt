Great food, great prices When you order food here, make sure you're hungry! The burgers and sandwiches are huge and priced considerably well. For not much more than fast food (about 6 bucks for a burger/fries) you'll get more food than you can eat at once! 

They also have really good horchata rice milk, that they make from scratch. Sometimes it's really sweet and filled with lots of cinnamon, sometimes it's a little watery. The espresso is also decent, some of their recipes are from their own creation (tres leches is really good). Almost all of their specials are recipes from the owner. The burgers, sandwiches and burritos are delicious. 

If you do order burritos though, make sure you order at least two, as these are the only things I've ordered on the menu that are relatively small in portion. Definitely worth checking this place out! It's on the corner of Bethany Home and the 17 (just west of the 17) on the south side of the street. Also...very kid friendly!

MAKE SURE YOU BRING CASH! They don't have a credit/debit reader.
