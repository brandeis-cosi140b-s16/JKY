With the exception of the ambiance, this is my second favorite Mexican restaurant in town.  The first being LIndo Michoacan and the third being Roberto's. :)  Tacos Mexico is truly authentic Mexican food - you'll find no fried tacos here.  It's like going to a street vendor in Mexico.  Of course you will also find some of the dirty people and/or tables in the dining area so I recommend going through the drive thru, lol.  And p.s. they don't accept credit cards so bring cash!
