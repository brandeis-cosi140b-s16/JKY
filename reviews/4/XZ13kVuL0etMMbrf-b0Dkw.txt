Gonna get this off my chest first: I don't understand what the ambiance of tako is trying to achieve. We had a party of six for 9PM on Halloween night, and I was ready to have a fun night with good company... but at the risk of sounding 100 years old, I could barely hear a thing thanks to the music blasting in the background. Is this a club or a restaurant? :/

Rant aside, the food is pretty good here. Our chips and classic guac were tasty as expected, but the chicharrons were meh (my Latina friend was unimpressed). The two tacos we each got were decently sized, and the flavor combinations were delicious. Mine had pork, pineapple, and avocado, and I swapped my second taco for a friend's duck confit taco. I would probably be down to try all the taco choices on the menu, to be honest. 

I do have to say though, it's kind of weird to have a sit-down dinner wait time for tacos that we all essentially inhaled in a couple minutes. If the atmosphere had been conducive to actual conversation vs. yelling across the table, the waiting would have been more enjoyable at least. For that reason I'd dock a star from my rating.
