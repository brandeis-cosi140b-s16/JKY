Yes!

Go here early for lunch.  11:30 at the latest.  If it's just a couple of you, go in and sit at the bar.  The bartenders do an excellent job of serving customers.

The menu is simple and three of us all ordered something different.  I had a combo platter and the other two order taco plates.  One fish the other steak.

You start of with the standard chips and salsa.  The salsa is decent but not outstanding.  Along with this they bring out a bottle of their signature hot sauce and believe me, it's HOT!  Habenero based with mango, it's very hot but also very delicious.

The food is excellent as there was nothing any of us ate that we didn't like.  If I had to choose something to complain about I'd say the rice that is served with each plate is just average.  Their re-fried beans are outstanding! 

I'd like to mention that after trying several bites of several dishes from our group, I decided that the FISH TACOS could be the most mouth pleasing item I've tasted in years.  SERIOUS!  Put just a dab of that signature Diablo hot sauce on them (careful, not too much) and it's pure joy for your taste buds.

This restaurant is terribly busy and LOUD.  It's not the place to go for a relaxing dinner.  In fact, I wouldn't recommend it for dinner at all.  Every time I walked by all weekend long it was jammed packed with dozens of folks on the sidewalk waiting for tables.

It's a lunch spot and they've got numerous TV's at the bar so you can watch your favorite sporting events.
