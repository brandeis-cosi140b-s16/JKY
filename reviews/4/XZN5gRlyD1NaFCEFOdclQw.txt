Me and my wife came here for an early lunch after leaving an appointment. We have been here before and it is always a really good eat. For lunch we both ordered the Carne asada. I ordered one of their house margaritas and as always I was not disappointed. The chips and salsa are really good, I would like for maybe a more spicy salsa as well though. Once our food arrived we both dug right in and devoured the steak because it's so delicious; juicy, tender, and easy to eat. I always love coming here and for a lunch meal it wasn't to bad only spent $30.
