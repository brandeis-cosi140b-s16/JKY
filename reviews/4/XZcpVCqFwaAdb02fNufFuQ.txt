Well, it's another Chipotle like any other, except this one has a small parking lot behind it as well as on street parking which is usually available. My favorite thing about Chipotle is the fact that they keep the menu extremely simple and use high-quality ingredients such as hormone/antibiotic free meats. Try getting the soft tacos with corn tortillas which are available on request; they're much better that way. Also, the bottled chipotle hot sauce is excellent on said tacos.
