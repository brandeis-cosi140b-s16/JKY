Pulling into parking lot, the atmosphere is like growing up in Texas! On Saturday night, the wait was zero at 7:10 pm, but the place was crowded. We were seated w/in 5 minutes. The service was excellent but they forgot one meal at service time. The nachos were a little watery but the salsa was tasty. The pollo con crema was amazing. The pollo fundido was awesome. The beef enchiladas, and burritos tasted exactly alike.
