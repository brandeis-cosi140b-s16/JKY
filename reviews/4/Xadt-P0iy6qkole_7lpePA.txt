I love me some Mexican food! This place is clean and pretty fast. I honestly can appreciate when it takes more than two seconds for my food to be prepared because then you hope that its actually being cooked after you ordered VS microwaved. I got a bangin' torta. Doesn't compare to my favorite spot in Chicago, but def delish.
