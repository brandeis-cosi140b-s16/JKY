Why does everyone say Roberto's is only good when you're drunk? I heartily disagree!

I love the fact that their tacos are fresh corn tortillas wrapped around the meat of your choice, toothpicked shut and dropped into the deep fryer. Afterwards it's topped with lettuce, cotija and cheddar, and served with really, really good beans and rice.

The salsa roja packs a decent punch and a good flavor, I find the tomatillo salsa verde a little underwhelming, but a better match for the shredded chicken.

I also really like the carne asada tacos, with pico and guacamole, or the rolled tacos and guac. The tortas are friggin' huge. The carne asada fries are much-talked about but I think that might be one of those drunk foods.

The breakfast burritos are awesome, especially with bacon and roja.

I would advise staying away from the quesadillas, which are beyond greasy and rubbery. The chile relleno an enchiladas are a bit too cheesy and gooey for my taste, but it's certainly going to be to the liking of others.

I've been to a few Roberto's around the valley and this is the cleanest one I've ever seen. You could eat off the floor.

Of course, being all the way out in the soccer mom suburbs of Southern Highlands, there's nobody on the floor during the prime time drunken shenanigan hours.
