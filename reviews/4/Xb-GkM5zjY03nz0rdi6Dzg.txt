I will give this place 4 stars because there is no other Mexican fast food place in the area. It's just like any other fast food Mexican place, filebertos, losbetos ect. The breakfast burritos and good and so is the carne asada burrito. It's kind of expensive for a Mexican fast food joint, but then again it's in Scottsdale. Staff is friendly! Salsa is a little bland. Convent drive through service. Nothing spectacular but still good stuff! The closest Mexican fast food place is off Indian bend so it nice to have this one located in the neighborhood!
