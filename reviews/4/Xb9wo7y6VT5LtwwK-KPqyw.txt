Great place.  My credit card and bank accounts have more memories of this place than I do, but it's still good.  Go there anytime when the drunk high school idiots are not there (usually late during the week, never on Friday or Saturday).  Disregard previous reviews about cleanliness in this place.  Most chain restaurants that people go to are much dirtier than any concerned reviewer could ever imagine.
