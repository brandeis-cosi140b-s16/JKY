We had a party of 3 adults and one child (9 yrs).  We enjoyed everything.  The service was satisfactory, the food was good and portions were good for the price paid.  We all took some home for another day.  The salsa was very good as was the guacamole..  I had the steak Cortez and was completely happy.

I would be happy to return for another meal.
