When I can't drive 2hrs to Globe, Az. for my favorite mexican food Espo's is my second favorite. I order the taco burritos (enchilada style) and cheese enchiladas (red) every time I go. Their red salsa is the bomb too!

Side note: If you ever want the best mexican food you have ever had in your entire life you must visit Globe Az. You can go to any sit down restaurant there however Guayos On the Trail is the absolute best. The mexican food in Globe is so good it has a whole facebook page dedicated to it.
