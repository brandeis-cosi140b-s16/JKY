We bought one of those discount coupons for this restaurant, so a Friday afternoon lunch seemed the perfect time to try it out.  It's been ages since I've been here.

We arrived a few minutes after 11am (when they open) and along with one other table - we were the only ones in the place. Great service!

We ordered a dish with a lot of melted cheese (their specialty?) and I ordered the veggie fajitas.  Both were good.  

Because of the coupon, we needed to purchase a minimum in food and beverage, so we also ordered two desserts.  The flan was o.k. and the sopapillas were awesome!

Would we recommend?  Absolutely.  

Try to order from the lunch menu - seems like its a good deal for the price.  Drinks are unlimited too.
