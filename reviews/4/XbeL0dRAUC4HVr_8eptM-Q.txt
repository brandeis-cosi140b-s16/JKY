I came into this lil place a few months ago for lunch since it's a few minutes away from my work place. It's a small hole in the wall place, but the food is delicious! The beans were homemade and you can taste it! I recommend this place for typical Mexican food, being Mexican this food reminds me of my moms' cooking and the prices are reasonable.
