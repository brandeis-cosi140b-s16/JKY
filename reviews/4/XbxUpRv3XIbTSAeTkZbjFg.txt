Great food.  We have been a couple times with our toddler and she loves the rice and little chicken tacos.  Service could be better at host station.  One of them tried to push past my little one and I and didn't say excuse me.  Nearly bumped into us.  No manners.  Hipster waitresses were ok.  Pretty much what I expect from them.  Looking cool but not great at pretending they care that we have a good experience.  Still, the food is really good so we will be back again.
