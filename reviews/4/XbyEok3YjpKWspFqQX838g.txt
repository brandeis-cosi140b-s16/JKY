I am big fan of MadMex.
Wonder why everyone loves Chipotle (It must be good! But unfortunately, I'm not a fan!). May be because it's closer to CMU unlike MadMex n I was a student from CMU.

The southwest wings, and the fish tacos are something I can live on everyday!
Never get bored of them.

BUT THEN - some of the waiters were total fake/unpleasant!
(Well, it got camouflaged by the food they got later though! )
