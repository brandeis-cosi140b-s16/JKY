As my friend from high school likes to say, "this is my second favorite place to go eat."

The first, of course, is Someburros.

Oh Rositas, how I miss thee
For in Cleveland, the land is bereft of good Mexican food
(and NO, Chipotle doesn't count)
Eating here brings back good memories of times spent with friends
Ordering chicken mole, enchiladas
HUGE glasses of refreshing horchata!

I revisited Rositas a few days ago
As good as I remember it to be
Green corn tamale and spinach enchilada
Although I've had tasty enchiladas here before,
The flavors for me didn't quite taste right.
Green corn tamale was delicious though.

So, not perfect food, but really close!
