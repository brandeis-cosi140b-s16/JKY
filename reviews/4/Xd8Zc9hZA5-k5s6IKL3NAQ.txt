Hour 21 of a 24 hour trip to Vegas was spent in the bar at Taqueria Canonita, where I had ok tacos with a crazy good margarita.

Now, my opinion of the tacos may be colored by knowing in a mere 4 hours I'd be stepping off the plane in Los Angeles, soon to fill my mouth and belly with all sorts of delightful Mexican goodies (thinking of it now, I'm not sure why we chose a taqueria in Vegas anyway), so let me tell you about this margarita. 

First, it was 5 bucks--now, 5 bucks is a decent happy hour price in D.C., but in Vegas? Insane. This was called a "Blackberry Fresca Margarita." I'm normally a blended margarita girl, but this delight on ice may have changed my mind. It was fresh blackberries with triple sec and silver tequila, a perfectly refreshing blend of sweet and the 1-2 punch of tequila. Most interestingly, but still wholly enjoyable, was that the glass was rimmed with both salt and sugar, which I've never had. 

I genuinely hope this margarita wasn't a special, because everyone who can should try it! I'm planning an attempt at my own as part of a red-white-and-blue drink spread for July 4 this summer. 

I would sit through the "ok" food in a heartbeat for more of these margaritas.
