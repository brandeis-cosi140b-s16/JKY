Finally...a Mexican chain restaurant that I really like! I was weary about trying macayos at first (I can't stand arribas or on the border and thought this would be the same), but I'm so glad I gave it a shot. The food is really good and the drinks are strong, so you feel like you are getting your moneys worth. However it is 2$ for a small side of sour cream and I find that a little insane. The waiters were all really nice and we all enjoyed our food, this is now one of our regular dining places.
