I have actually never been to the store - however, my boyfriend and I frequent the Phoenix Open Market specifically for these tamales.

He's a vegetarian and I'm pescatarian - when it comes to tamales, we are almost always super limited in our options. We had TONS of options and every single one we tried was amazing. We actually didn't use a steamer - we just heated them up in the microwave and they turned out just as good as the ones we purchased hot at the stand!

We've tried:

Cream Cheese and Mushroom
Green Corn Cream Cheese
Bean and Cheese

They were all AMAZING. I really don't love frozen foods/quick meals, but I fell in love with these so much that we'd often make side dishes to go with the tamales as our main entree.

The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because they never seemed to have any vegan options at the stand, and my boyfriend was pretty interested in trying some of those out.
