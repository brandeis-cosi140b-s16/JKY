Not a bad place for being an americanized mexican food joint.  I must admit... the margaritas are THA BOMB.  Be careful with that tequila tho... it'll getcha.

I had the fish tacos, which I actually enjoyed.  The prices weren't too bad, but you drink a ton of alcohol, you will end up with a huge bill, not unlike any other place.
