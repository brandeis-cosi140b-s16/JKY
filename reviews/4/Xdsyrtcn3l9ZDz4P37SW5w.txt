Ate here with kids on Valentine's Day.  Service was excellent, food was fantastic! Kids enjoyed the fried ice cream dessert.  My only tiny complaint was that it was a bit too warm in the restaurant, and there weren't any outdoor seats available.  But it was busy due to the holiday, so no big deal.  We will definitely be back soon!
