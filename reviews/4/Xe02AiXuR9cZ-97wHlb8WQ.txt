Yum! This place never disappoints. The food is always fresh, hot, and delicious. Some items are organic, some meats are not from animals raised on pesticides and other poisons...you get a choices at least. For me it's better to skip the tortilla and avoid the additional approx 200 calories and go with the Burrito Bowl. The taco's are good but not a good value when compared to the rest of the menu items (portion to price ratio).  Oh except for the crazy $1.80 price for a teaspoon sized portion of guacamole (I skip that too). Very good place to eat it's nice and quick.  The staff are friendly!
