There are two Mexican sushi places I want to try and this was one of them. The decor inside the restaurant seems nice and our waitress was punctual. We ordered the Mexican roll, Milena roll and some calamari tempura.

The calamari was ok. The Milena roll and Mexican roll were really good. The Mexican roll has some spice to it. The Milena roll was very filling because first, it was breaded and deep fried. Second, it had avocado, bacon, chicken and shrimp among other vegetables. I loved the sauce. It was a tangy spicy mayo.

The price is above $10 for each roll so be prepared for that. I will try the other place soon and see how that goes as well. But for now, if you are in West Gate area and want some Mexican sushi, head on over there. Or traditional sushi rolls... we didn't order those, but they are also there if you want to order them.
