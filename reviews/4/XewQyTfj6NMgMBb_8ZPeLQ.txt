I was told to come here by a friend and had some pretty high expectations so I was pleasantly pleased but not overwhelmingly impressed. I ordered 3 tacos and the cucumber orange salad (if you order 3 tacos it comes with a side). I ordered 1 shrimp, 1 carne asada, and 1 pork adobada taco. I also ordered a $5 cucumber serrano margarita and 1 $5 spiked almond horchata :).  The margarita was not as refreshing as I imagined it would be, and the portion seemed a little small, but I really loved the horchata, which I spiked with vanilla vodka. The tacos were tasty, but I think I prefer the tacos at la santisima. The cucumber salad didn't taste very orange-y to me and I'm not sure why they are more expensive than the other sides. That said, I much prefer the service here and will be coming back to try more tacos.
