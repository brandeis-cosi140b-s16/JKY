Ok, this is not my favorite taqueria, but it is good. The biggest issue here is that the meat quality seems to vary, sometimes a bit tuff, sometimes a little overdone, but when they get it right, it's very good. My wife loves the place for the roasted jalepenos and onions. They are scrumptious, but my fave items are the salsas, you have to try them.
