I have not ordered one thing here I didn't like. Some of my favorites I order are the pastor tacos, Burritos are big, shrimp cocktail, menudo, and love the fried ice cream. I enjoy the fruit drinks they serve fresh. The staff is friendly and keeps the place clean. The pace is small so it gets full fast and not many seats.  Next time I would like to try the hot dogs here and see if its as good as they look. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is I think it's to pricey for hole in the wall Mexican food. If you are thinking of trying it I believe you will be happy you did.
