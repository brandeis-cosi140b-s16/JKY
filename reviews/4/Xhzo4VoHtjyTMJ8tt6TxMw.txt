I was soooooo pleased with this place! One quick warning to those looking to go there soon: There is a bit of construction going on right now and the cafe kind of smells like sawdust. Now, back to the review!

The food was awesome! I got the breakfast burrito and I also got a chance to try the chilaquilles verdes. Both were great and when topped with the salsas they were phenomenal! Their salsa verde is almost like a jalapeno-mint sauce and really reminded me of spicy mint sauces that one could find in a good Indian restaurant. It was my favorite. The red salsa was also amazing but had a very unique flavor that I can't put my taste buds on...it had a bit of a tang to it. Regardless, it topped off the already amazing flavors with more awesomeness! 

The cafe's style is really pleasant. There is a huge hallway leading right into the hotel and if you go that direction, you'll be able to see the really neat setup for the pool area. It's definitely worth the 30 foot jaunt. 

If you're not picky about renovations, check this place out right now! If you are though, and I know there are plenty of you, wait a little bit and then treat yourself to this place. It was a nice surprise.
