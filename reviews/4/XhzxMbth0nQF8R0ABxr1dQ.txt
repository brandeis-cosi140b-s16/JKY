I went for dinner on a Tuesday night.  I did not order the $1.50 Original Fish Tacos.  They were located on West Sahara Ave/S Ft Apache Rd in Las Vegas.

I had a coupon for free chips and guacamole with the purchase of an entree.  i ordered my favorite Chipotle Shrimp Salad.  i was disappointed that there were no fresno chiles on the salad like they have at other locations.  Maybe the person making the salad forgot to put them on.

I will be back!
