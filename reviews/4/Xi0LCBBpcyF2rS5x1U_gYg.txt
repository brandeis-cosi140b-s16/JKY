Me gusta!!! I love Mexican food and while visiting Madison this past week we actually came here twice in 10 days. The queso dip was delicious as well as our entrees. The price for the food is cheap (we were only here for lunch menu). And they came out in really good time! 

The only complaint I have is the prices for margaritas - $10 and it didn't taste like a drop of tequila was in it :( other than that we will definitely be coming back, without ordering the margaritas.
