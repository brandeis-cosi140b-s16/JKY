Awesome place IF you order correctly, and last night it was mole heaven in my mouth. 5 stars for the experience last night which pulls up all the mediocre trips I have had there - the end game... I'm giving it a solid 4 stars. 

It's literally been a year since I have made a return visit because frankly I always left this place disappointed. Not a fan of their tacos (though I admit the tongue is pretty tasty even though not my personal thing) and I'm a taco fanatic which is a big reason. The other is that the wife and I always split plates and invariably we get one good dish and the other one not so much. Have long been in search of the perfect meal here until....

Ok, so not perfect, but pretty damn good is what I got last night. The key was that both entrees nailed it, and you guessed it - I didn't force the tacos for the one thousandth time. This place has some bangin' good mole sauce so I went with the enchiladas pablanas which were unbelievable; the lady went with the chilaquiles verde and this dish also nailed it with an egg on top cooked to perfection. And did I tell you about the mole (even I can make good tacos... Good mole, well that takes talent)? Granted there were some less than stellar items (the guacamole used some under ripe avocados and the tacos dorados appetizer was a waste of calories) but with two entrees like that and a cold Modelo, who really cares?  Glad I gave this place another try and I guarantee it won't be a year before I'm back again!
