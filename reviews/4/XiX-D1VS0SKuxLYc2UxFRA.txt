Seems like you either like the place or not...me, I like the place.  Good, authentic Mexican cuisine, at an affordable price - humongous portions; one where in a MAN verses FOOD competition, FOOD WINS!  Chips are a bit oily, but thick; salsa is spicy - a bit saucy, not chucky.  (I prefer the chuncky type.)

Definitely an establishment waaaaay off the beaten path, literally on the other side of the railroad tracks - you need to know about the place to enjoy because you will cross the tracks to get to the place.  Locals know of the place.  Visitors discover the place talking to the locals - I visited in mid-March, right during the beginning of Spring training so the place was a mix of locals and visitors alike...

$15 pitchers of STRONG marguaritas - extensive Mexican biers (Texate, Dos XX - amber and lager; Corona, etc.).  Would be better if the biers were on tap.
