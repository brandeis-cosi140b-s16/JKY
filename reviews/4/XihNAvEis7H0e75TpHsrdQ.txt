I don't understand all the negative reviews at all.  I've been to Abuelo's twice now and each time was good.  Most recently, we had a server that was outstanding, both in helping me decide on a dish and overall competence!

Their carnitas are delicious.  Also, THIS PLACE IS LISTED AS TEX MEX. If you don't like Tex Mex, then you shouldn't dine here and then give a bad review.

It was a nice dining experience, good food, nice atmosphere.  Thanks Abuelo's!
