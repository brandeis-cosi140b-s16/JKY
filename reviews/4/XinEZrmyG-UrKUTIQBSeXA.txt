Don taco hooks it up fat and at great prices. Bean and cheese burrito 2.70 yep and big. This is the go location. It's on of the only ones that isn't attracted to a bar so when you go late at night you do have to deal with a line of drunks from the bar. I moved but still come to this location over the closer one.
