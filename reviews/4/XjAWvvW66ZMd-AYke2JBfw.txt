Cheap, delicious, and greasy. If that's not a winning combination for a fast food Mexican joint, I don't know what is. Yes, it's pretty similar to Filiberto's and Los Favoritos and Julioberto's and all the other "berto's" around the valley, but Fiesta Burrito shines a bit brighter than most of those in the taste category. I don't live particularly close to this location, but I can promise that whenever I'm nearby it's going to be a huge temptation. Yum.
