So this my deal with Panchos.  Our food was delicious. Everyone enjoyed the meal. Salsa was quite delicious. But, and it's a big deal, it's just too pricey. Everything was priced like a restaurant in one of the top Strip hotels. $7.50 for a Mexican draft beer. About $20 for a carne asada chimichanga. $23 for a marinated pork dish. Everything tastes great and the service was on point. But $130 for four entrees, two sodas and four beers is just way too expensive for a standalone Mexican restaurant, even in Summerlin. They need to rethink their pricing in my opinion, if they want to be around as long as Lindo Michiocan or Frank & Finas.
