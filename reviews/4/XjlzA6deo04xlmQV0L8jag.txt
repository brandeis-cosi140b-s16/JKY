I arrived very early to pick up my daughters, so I went in for a beer.

I had a Negra Modelo, and after a bit, felt hungry.

Their prices are a bit extreme for just a snack, but the fresh-made guacamole sounded delicious, and was reasonably priced.

They prepare it table-side, and the anticipation of watching it being prepared makes it taste better. (True story)

It had large chunks of avocado, jalapenos, onions, tomatoes, cilantro, lemon juice, and is topped with pomegranate seeds.

One of the most amazing guacamoles I've ever had, and I have had, and made dozens of recipes.

I may have to head to the location outside the airport, and try one of their entrees.

If I spend any significant amount of time in the airport again, I'll certainly hit this spot again!
