When in the area, and craving fast food Mexican, Baja Fresh offers pretty good food, for OK prices.

I like that we can pay more for a large plastic cup, and get discounted refills for life, even though we always forget to bring the cups with us, as our Baja Fresh stops are generally last minute, unplanned stops.

Sadly (for the others) Baja Fresh is better than a lot of the sit down Mexican restaurants we have tried in the same area lately. 

The food quality is very good, nice flavorful, well cooked menu, we will be back, as we're tired of being disappointed by waaaaayyyyy overpriced Mexican food elsewhere.
