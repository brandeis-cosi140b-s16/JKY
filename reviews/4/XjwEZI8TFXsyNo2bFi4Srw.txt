I actually crave this place all the time when I think of quick mexican food. Love the shredded beef enchiladas. Thier refried beans are perfectly seasoned. Lettuce and tomatoes always fresh,. Been here several times and Ill definetly keep coming back. They have a sign out front about original owners being back although I never noticed a difference in the food. Its always good. They have salsa bar thats open thats nice. Have a little bar inside (full bar) with tv for sports.. when I say little I mean it seats about 6 people. lol.. They make the strongest margaritas Ive ever had. YUM! One of my fave places to go.
