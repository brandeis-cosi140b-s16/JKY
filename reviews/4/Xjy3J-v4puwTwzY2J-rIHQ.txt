Oh snap. Original location with little to no change since first opening their doors. You can expect long lines and a very packed placed as the interior seats a very small amount of people. Come here for the awesome 3-way burrito (red chili, bean, green chili) and red sauce. The green chili plate is also really good (and popular). The prices are super cheap- I ordered a 3-way, chips, salsa and a soft drink for $7. I couldn't finish my plate either- so much food.The house red sauce is awesome, and they serve Pepsi products to drink. Don't expect much from the staff in terms of warm-n-fuzzy. They are there to move the masses and get people in and out with a full stomach. You can take orders of their house made tortillas, green chili, and chips home in large quantities.
