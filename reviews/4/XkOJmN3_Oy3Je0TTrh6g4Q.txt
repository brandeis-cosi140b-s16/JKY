These folks are open for breakfast and lunch only.  The menu is modest.  A few varieties of breakfast burritos, plus some "classic" items like tacos and burros.

I've had the chorizo breakfast burrito and the shredded beef tacos.  The former was tasty, but a bit mild.  Chorizo should have a 'kick' to it, but theirs doesn't.  Perhaps it's the other things in it that diluted it.  The tacos were excellent.  Simple, but really good.

I will likely be back, and I will try the chimi.  The result of that may either raise or lower my rating.  This rating really is about 3.5 stars, but YELP doesn't allow that.  I rounded up because Ramon was very friendly and helpful.
