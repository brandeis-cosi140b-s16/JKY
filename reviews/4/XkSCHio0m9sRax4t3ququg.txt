I've been coming to El Encanto for just about 15 years now and every time I get the same thing!! Two words: Pollo Fundido. Do you love cheese?!? Do you want creamy cheesiness in every delicious bite of your Mexican Euphoria? Don't even look at the menu. The other things worth talking about are the Queso Guillermo appetizer. Of course, more cheesy deliciousness accompanied by dried shredded beef,  pico de gallo, and a few sliced limes. 

The salsa is amazing- try not to fill up!! You must save room for a Chocolate chimichanga with Mint Chocolate Chip Ice cream for desert. 

Warning: you will go home with an stomach explosion- but consider yourself warned, and it's 100% worth every bite!
