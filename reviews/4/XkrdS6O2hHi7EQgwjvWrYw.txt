After trying a number of Mexican places this week,  I went back to my tried and true Gran Agave.  Really,  I've never had a bad experience here and I've been here quite a number of times.  Sometimes for a meal and sometimes just for a snack after shopping at the Waterfront; which was the case tonight. 

I had a seat at the small bar towards the back and was cheerfully greeted with a menu. I ordered a Dos Equis and was quickly served my beer with complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were fresh and the salsa was thick and tasty. 

I ordered just two tacos and they arrived  within five minutes. Granted the place only had twelve other people but I've waited longer in other places for tacos when I was the only person there.  The tacos came filled heavy with beef and topped generously with cheese.  I used some of the salsa as a dressing on them to give them an extra kick. 

I feel very fortunate to live only about a five minute drive from the waterfront where I can enjoy a place like this on a whim.  I would drive alot further for Mexican food of this caliber.
