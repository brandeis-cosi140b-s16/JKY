Great food, fast service and nice salsa bar.

Walking in my first impression of the brightly lit place with hard chairs was definitely fast food.  That is what this place is.  I ordered the chicken Tostada for $3.99 and a medium soda, total $6.27.  Noticed a big selection of salsa and my order quickly came.

The tostada seemed expensive but when I started digging in it was packed with chicken.  Well worth it. Their salsa bar was great to add flavors and heat.
I'm a fan and will be back
