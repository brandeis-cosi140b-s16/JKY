I rarely give five stars because there's always room for improvement...

I love Rubio's as a concept. I eat here quite often. The fresh seafood tacos and burritos... This is the way Mexican food should be.

I also love the fresh salsa bar... However I do wish they had more options. It is a bit limited for salsa bar.

I didn't have any issues with the food today... Just that the server did not pay attention to my request when I ordered. I didn't want the fried fish. Only the fresh grill and blackened. But I still ended up with the fried fish in one of my tacos.

I brought it to her attention... And the manager quickly corrected it.
