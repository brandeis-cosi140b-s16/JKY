I have been a Tony's regular for over 30 years.  I have never had a bad meal.  My husband loves the #3, chili relleno, beef taco, rice and beans, I get the #1, tostado, taco, cheese enchilada, rice and beans.  The restaurant is small, but huge compared to what it was when it opened about 40 years ago.  It is a family owned business, sometimes Tony is there, just sitting at a table, he doesn't work there any longer due to age and health.  My daughter in Iowa insists on eating there numerous times when she comes home for a visit.  It is not the fancy, lettuce covered mexican type food that you find at places like Macayo's or Garcia's, just good, traditional mexican food.  The quesadillas are the best as are the chips and salsa!
