Definitely an interesting little place up in North Phoenix, La Oaxaquena hovers between a three and a four, but closer to four.  I stopped in for lunch and was shocked to see that there was not a single soul in there except for me.  What the heck??  

The classic unassuming strip-mall Mexican place, the interior was much bigger than normal and the colors were interesting but I thought they added a nice touch.  The cashier / server girl was really friendly and service was SUPER fast.

On to the food - I went with the lunch special of a taco and tostada for $4.95 (what a steal!).  I was assuming when I requested chicken that both items would have chicken on them - something to keep in mind.  The taco was excellent!  A crunchy shell housed deliciously tender chicken, and fresh lettuce and tomato on top.  The tostada was OK, but I think that has way more to do with the fact that I'm not a huge refried beans fan.  Oh, and the chips and salsa were some of the best complimentary additions I've had.

As Daren C. mentioned, $5.35 total will get you some good food, and you'll leave stuffed and ready to pass out in the afternoon of your job.
