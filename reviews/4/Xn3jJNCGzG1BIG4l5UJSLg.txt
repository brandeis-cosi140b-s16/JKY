What can I say, Great food and great Margarita's...The atmosphere is fun, and lively - the wait staff is excellent (not a bunch of summer kids filling time) but a professional staff. The bar is medium size and elegant looking - and they have 5 nice tall large round table in the bar so you can dine there as well. The main restaurant area is just as elegant as the bar area. We usually sit and eat in the bar areas of most restaurants.  The food is always good and the kitchens fast on getting food out.  If you like Guacamole, this is the place to get it - they make it fresh right at your table.. and the chips are always crisp.  If you are looking for the Typical "chain Mexican food type restaurant", then this is not the place to go.  The food is Mexican, but with style and flair... Different but great.
