Las Margaritas is not the place to go if you're trying to diet and count calories.  However, if you want plentiful, inexpensive, quick, and tasty Mexican food, I totally nominate this place.

I love love LOVE guacamole.  Matter of fact, I feel like I'm kind of a connoisseur of of guacamole, and so I get pretty ecstatic when I find a good batch of it.  I can honestly say that their guacamole ranks pretty highly in my book.  It tastes fresh, not too salty, and can be purchased for quite a reasonable price here (less than $4, I believe, for a pretty generous portion).  Their chips and salsa are wonderful as well.  They have nice, thick tortilla chips, which taste fresh, warm, and homemade.  They bring out two different salsas to go with them; one smooth and one more chunky.  Both are different and equally wonderful.

My partner and I both ordered combos from them.  I had a tamale and chile relleno, both of which were pretty tasty.  I have never had a chile relleno quite like that, which was more like an omelet with cheese, chiles, and meat.  I will warn you, both of them had quite a bit of grease leaking out of them, which suits me just fine but could be a turn-off to people who don't care for really greasy food.  My partner ordered a taco, which he really enjoyed as well.

I really like their rice as well.  I thought it had a mild flavor, not too salty, and no overwhelming tomato taste (which I don't care for in rice).  Their beans were not bad as well, and tasted like typical refried beans.

While I didn't order them, they had some great drink specials and prices on drinks.  Service there was wonderful - our food came out quickly, and our waitress was friendly and attentive.  Parking does not seem like a problem, but it may be a little difficult to get into the parking lot if coming west on Independence.  The decor was bright and typical of many Mexican restaurants.

I am totally excited to hit this place up again.
