Looking for a great Mexican restaurant downtown? Look no further than Verde. 

Verde has something that other restaurants don't, the relaxed atmosphere of casual dining with high end service. There are no pesky waiters to deal with or over crowded tables. 

 This was my first time at Verde and naturally as I walked in I asked the Owner , who was working the counter, what he would recommend. Hands down he mentioned the Green Chile was the most popular. Luckily I had a fellow foodie with me who doesn't miss an opportunity to try as many things as he can on a menu so I got to experience all of it. 

I got the green chili and couldn't have been happier. The meat was tender, the portions were generous and it had just the right amount of heat. In addition to that the homemade tortilla and Mexican cola to wash it down sealed the deal for me. This green chile is a winner! 

My colleague ordered the green chile, red chile and the chili lime rotisserie chicken.  The red chile was ok but a little over spiced I would go with the green over the red any day. The chicken on the other hand was an awesome rotisserie chicken but lacked the spice or flavor I was looking for to give it that Mexican flavor. 

All  in all I would go back to Verde in a second. I know they are working on completing the full experience with adding adult beverages....so you can't drink beer there now but when you can you will drink Dos Equis!....
