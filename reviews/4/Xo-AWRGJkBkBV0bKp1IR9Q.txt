the girls and i decided to have brunch here because we needed to stay close by the hotel to wait for our arriving friend and my sister recommended the spot. 

before entering, we preview the framed menu on the wall to see if there's anything that looks or sounds appetizing.  apparently, there was a lunch special for $12, that included (from what i remembered) the house margarita for $4ish, a choice of entree on the Lunch special selection, salad and chips and salsa. i remember looking at the entrees separately, and thinking the lunch special was a better deal.  

from the lunch special menu, i ordered the carne asada street tacos with mexican rice and a margarita,  which i had  frozen. all were really satisfying. having sides of guacamole, salsa and lemon really helped add a zest of flavor to the tacos. the margarita was extremely refreshing. kinda frothy, but super tasty. sometimes i crave their margaritas, and then start craving margaritas in general. ahh! im craving it now! 

the decor of the restaurant is up to date and chic. really neon bright crazy hues. a very fashionably hip mexican restaurant thats for sure. 

the only complaint i have is the service. we came around 11am, and the restaurant was hardly packed. it took decades to get the waitress to get our orders. then it took another 6 years for them to bring out our food. we spent at least 130-2 hours there. 

im definitely dining here again, when i'm in the area.
