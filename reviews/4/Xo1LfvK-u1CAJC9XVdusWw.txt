So to be very fair to Sloppi Jo's this was the final place I ate after eating at 7 food trucks in 24 hours during the Food Network truck race stop. I was so full but, I have been wanting to try this place for awhile and everything on the menu looked good. I had the tradition sloppi Jo which featured a seasoned pulled pork with an egg on top with tortilla. It was very good but I could not finish. I do wish it had little more spice and if they have a truly traditional ground version in a bun. But, I am very excited to try other things on an empty stomach and they had some deserts on the menu that looked unreal.
