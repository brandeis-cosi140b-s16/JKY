Went here on Sunday night (day before President's Day) and had to sit at the bar because we didn't have reservations, which was no big deal, since the bar set-up is very cool.  The bar was very busy and it seemed as soon as others left there were others that sat down.  The homemade guacamole was very good and the fish tacos were good, not out of this world, but good.  I didn't care for the rice and beans.....not enough flavor.  My friends had the chicken enchiladas and they were delicious.  Will definitely try those next time!  Nice drink menu and a great selection of tequila.  Will be sure to go back.
