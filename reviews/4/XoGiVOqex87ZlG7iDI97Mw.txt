This is one of our favorite Mexican restaurants on the east side. The food is good but more Tex-Mex than authentic Mexican (but still good!).   The portions are big, we always have leftovers.   We've come here several times for lunch and dinner.  My husband gets a burrito pretty much every time we go. Usually I get something with shrimp and all of the dishes have been great!  Arroz con camarones is my fave. Fajitas are yummy and you'll have leftovers for days! Chips and salsa are average and seem to be different each time we go there.  
Service has always been great! And you can't beat the $1 margaritas on Saturdays!
