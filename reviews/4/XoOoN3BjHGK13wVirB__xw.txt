My sister invited me to CLT to come celebrate my nephew's 2nd birthday.  This is apparently his favorite restaurant, so I decided to make the trek from MEM to come see family and friends. 

One thing I would like to note is with all of the construction going on, it is a pain in the ass to enter/exit.  Make sure you get it right the first time, or it may take another 10 minutes to go around the block.

We finally made it, and I assume sis made reservations for us, as we got a long table at the bar for 12 or so people.  A 2 year olds birthday at the bar- that's what I am talking about!

The d√©cor was simple, yet colorful.  The menu was straightforward Mexican.  I ordered some Texas (shrimp chicken steak) fajitas.  Mind you I was pretty hungry.

The food ending up coming out and the one thing I couldn't help but notice was how big all of the plates were.  And heavy.  You could do 10 reps with a plate and call it a workout.  

Two other things I noticed off the bat- where was the cheese, and how am I supposed to make only 3 fajitas with a plate this big?  I tried to venture outside of my normal fajita eating habits (just meat, with lots of cheese).  It was solid!  The grease replaced the cheese I guess you could say.  After I packed 3, I just ate the rest of it off the skillet.  

While I was eating and the staff was checking on us, the waitress kept rubbing on my shoulders and such.  I was about to tell her you can take me out back but I am with my family.  At that moment, I felt like "Gator" in "The Other Guys".  Awkward? Slightly...

I didn't drink anything alcoholic (saved it for after), but they did have a full bar.  The do sell Coke as well (yea!)- so that was a plus.  I can't even remember if I had dessert either.  

This is some solid authentic Mexican here, and it's definitely different than what I am used to having.  Worth a shot!
