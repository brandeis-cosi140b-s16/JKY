It was more a 3.5 but since someone gave them a 1 star they get a 4. 

This place is decent, the carne asada  is good but a little salty but i dont like much salt on anything I eat. 

the Al Pastor was not good, it was not from a rotating spit, it tatsed pre-cooked, definately dont order that. 

It's a nice mom and pop shop, prices are cheap. 1.07 for a taco and 4.99 for a burrito, that is a steal!. 

Overall I would return and try some of the other stuff.
