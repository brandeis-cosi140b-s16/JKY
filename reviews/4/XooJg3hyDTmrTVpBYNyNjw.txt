I was recommended to go here from a friend.  Realizing it was just down the street from me, I headed over.  It's a tiny little joint that is easily missed if you're not looking for it. 

Ordered their creme brulet burger and wow was it yummy.  If I had anything to say, I would say the meat could be a little more seasoned. Still great though!  I'd love to try a different burger next time just to try a variety.  One thing that blew me away was their french fries with BBQ seasoning on it.  Delish!

Good service and pretty quick too.
