If you are in the mood for delicious shrimp tacos or fish tacos or a big burrito filled with lobster, and you are also standing in the middle of the mall food court, then I have wonderful news for you, because look around you big dongus, you're standing right by Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill and it is THE place to go to get the aforementioned food items.

Don't get me wrong, you're still at the mall foodcourt, but this is pretty much the real deal as far as Rubio's goes, and it's gonna be delicious. It takes a little longer than Panda Express or the pizza joint but that's because they're making the food fresh and not just serving you something that's been hanging out under heat lights. As soon as you put the food into your mouth hole you are going to taste the difference, and it is delicious.

Best thing about Rubio's? You can eat it and afterwards you don't feel like dying. Just don't order too much, you big hog, and you'll be energized and ready to go back into the depths of the mall and do more shopping or whatever it was you were up to. That's because fresh seafood is good for you, and Rubio's has it, so get to eating already what are you wasting time for?!
