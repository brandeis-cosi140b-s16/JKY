Mexican Food, as the signage states, is actually another Santa Rosa Taco Shop that serves up some fantastic and inexpensive Mexican grub. I am a huge fan of the other Santa Rosa Taco Shop in Henderson, but this location is closer to my house so it has become my go-to stop for quick tacos, tortas and burritos.

Blink and you may miss it, as it's tucked slightly behind a convenience store, but even if you pass it this is one stop worth making a u-turn for. The employees are friendly, the portions are large and the prices are right. Santa Rosa serves up my favorite breakfast burritos in town.. just as large as the other places in town, for less money, and the cheese is always fully melted. (That's my breakfast burrito pet peeve, unmelted cheese.)

This isn't the classiest joint, the ambiance is a bit lacking... but the food is legit. The sign outside should really be revised to say Best Mexican Food. It's that good.
