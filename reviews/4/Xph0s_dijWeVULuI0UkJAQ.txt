They have a pretty good location and convenient for in and out.  Everyone's familiar with Taco Bell's menu, however, something they've had for awhile is "Happy Hour". They have many freezees, Taco burrito grillers, and drinks for $1 from 2-5, everyday.  The freezes are a good item for a cool summer refreshment.  

Be mindful of the drive-thru at the location. Once, you're in, you're in. You're not able to leave out of the drive-thru because there's not another lane to the right to drive around. 

Also, the location is right next to a new authentic Mexican restaurant, but Taco Bell will still be left standing.
