I came here a few weeks back and simply got too busy to do this review. 

I went with my wife prior to her going to work for a dinner. I've heard this place was one of the best in Phoenix and have been trying to come here for the past 10 years. I'm glad I finally managed it, but upset that it took so long.

I was immediately struck by the decor in the place. It is unique, yet what I would expect. I did like it quite a bit though.

The chips and salsa were very good and I had to get some to go. I've never felt compelled to do that before, so that should say something.

I had the steak Chimichanga dinner with a shredded beef taco on the side. The taco was to die for. It was perfect! The shredded beef was actually better than the steak and if I order it again I will skip the steak.

My wife had the Fundido and ordered it with Chicken. She received steak. She didn't mind because she thought it was so good. We did let the waitress know, but that was all we heard about it. Once she tried my taco, she came to the same conclusion - the steak is good, but the shredded beef is much better!

Overall I can't say this was my favorite place, but it certainly was good and I will return.
