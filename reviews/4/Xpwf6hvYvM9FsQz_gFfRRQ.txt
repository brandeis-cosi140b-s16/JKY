I was really apprehensive to try this place, especially since this restaurant is owed by the same Villa Franchise that owns most of the other restaurants in the food court ( I haven't had much luck with the other Villa restaurants, especially that disappointingly tiny Mo' Burger 20 steps away but that's another review). Anyway, back to Tinta the service here is a little on the slower side but the food is worth the wait. I had the shredded pork tacos and they were the BOMB! I topped the tacos with about half of the topping bar and was in heaven. I will say, I wish they doubled up on the tortillas because corn tortillas split easily. The pork was so moist and tender and the hot salsa lended itself nicely to the mix. My sister had the tacos and the Elote (she blasted through it in all in less than 10 minutes). I can't wait to come back to sample the rest of the menu.
