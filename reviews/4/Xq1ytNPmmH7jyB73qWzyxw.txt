I love this place!  The food is great for the money.  I usually get the Carne Asada chips, but they have a lot of items on their menu which are also equally as good.  Cheap, fast-served Mexican food that tastes good!  Portions are large and very filling!
I guess another great plus, for me anyway, is that a semi truck can fit into the parking lot - I am a local truck driver and this place rocks!  There used to be a grocery store or something next to it, but has been closed down for a long time, the parking lot is great for large vehicles!
