You've got to go at least once for the brunch at this place.  It's $30 for all you can eat, and add $6 for unlimited mimosas!  There are also many different areas to enjoy your meal: inside, outside on a covered patio, or completely outside by the pool (shaded by trees).  I love me any place with some patio seating.

The brunch food comes out as small plates, so you can try a lot of the different dishes and get your money's worth.  I guess the best way to describe it would be like tapas.  I really enjoyed the shrimp and grits.  Like...so much I got three orders of them.  My other favorite was the chorizo and egg tacos.  My one complaint, I felt like some of the dishes had too much egg in them in proportion to other ingredients.  I can only take so much egg!  But the Mexican twist on breakfast favorites was something I'm really glad I tried.

The mimosas come in different flavors like classic orange, pomegranite, and passion fruit.  And they don't skimp on them!  They come in some pretty hefty pour flutes!

You know, in all honesty, I don't know if I'd go again just because it's quite a bit of money to spend on breakfast, but I would definitely say you have to go at least once and expereince this!
