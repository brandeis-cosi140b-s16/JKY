I love this place and we go here often on our lunch break because service is fast, fresh, and friendly. 

A couple of must have items for me:
Chorizo, eggs, potato, and cheese breakfast burrito
Chicken taco salad with the hard shell. The cilantro lime dressing is amazing!
The Ceviche here is one of the best I have had.
