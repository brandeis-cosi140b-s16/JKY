I would have to say that this place is pretty good mexican food as far as Madison goes. I go here because there is no alternative, but their service is good and their food is decent.

I always got their burrito Mexicana which is good, but the downside is their beef is not good.  Their chicken meat is a lot better.  The last time I went I got the Chicken fajita quesadilla and that was much better then their tough dried beef.

This place gets a 3 because of their beef and how quick the food comes out (meaning they are all precooked) otherwise their portions are ridiculously large and their free chips and salsa tastes really good.
