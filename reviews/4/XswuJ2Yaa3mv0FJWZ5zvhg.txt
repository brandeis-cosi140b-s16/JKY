Me and my boyfriend went here for the first time last night for dinner I ate shredded beef tacos and he had seafood enchiladas, both were really good. We are from California and have high standards for our Mexican food this place will defiantly be our go to Mexican food place and it's right down the street which makes it even better. Ps the salsa is good to!
