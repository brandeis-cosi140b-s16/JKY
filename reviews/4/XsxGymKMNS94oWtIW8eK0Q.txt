I go to the one by the stratosphere. It's about $5 for a big burrito. I usually get two meals out of one burrito, which is great. I get the carnitas and my boyfriend gets the carne asada, combined with the self-serve salsas (the verde & orange habanero rock) it's a filling cheap meal. The burritos are stuffed with rice, beans, tons of meat and fresh cilantro and onion. The tacos are cheap and tasty, stuffed with meat and raw onion and cilantro. Cash only, but good frugal eats!
