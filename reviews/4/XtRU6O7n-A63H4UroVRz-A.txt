I had read several good reviews on this restaurant so we went along the other night.  
The San Diego  Bay restaurant  is located in  Guadalupe,  the Yaqui Native American and Hispanic community right next to Tempe. 
There was a steady stream of people, but not overly busy.  Restaurant appearance was  clean  and bright.  Don't expect top high flying ambience, just a typical local family restaurant.  Exactly the relaxed style we like.
The young lady who served us very helpful, friendly and attentive, She recommended  the ceviche tostada for a starter which was  good and also the  Molcajete de Camaron (shrimp Molcajete) -  a shrimp dish cooked in a very hot  lava bowl with a light spicey cheesy sauce which was excellent - highly recommended.  
Cost was $32 plus tip for a starter, 2 entrees and beer.
My wife prefers less spice and went with fish and garlic dish - very nice too. 
Excellent service, great food  - and the  wonderful  Molcajate de Camaron make this a place we'll take our friends to for something different. - highly recommended.
