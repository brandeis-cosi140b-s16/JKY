Similar to chipotle, but more expensive. I like it better than chipotle though. I recommend the burrito. The tortillas are made fresh, and are amazing! I also recommend getting the queso. It is overpriced, but it makes the burrito. I love that they mix all the ingredients together before wrapping the burrito so every bite has a little of everything in it. I have tried the chicken and steak, and moth are good. The steak is a bit spicy, but I enjoy it. I should also mention I'm a wimp with spicy foods.
