My boyfriend and I visited this Roberto's after a failed visit to the Bermuda and Cactus location. I was craving some Carne Asada Fries, while my boyfriend wanted a shredded-pork burrito with no spicy sauces or beans, but with potatoes and lettuce. He's particularly picky when it comes to Mexican food. 
The Bermuda and Cactus location did not allow the substitutions for his burrito so I just ordered my fries. We both had a craving for some Mexican food so I went to this location to get his food. 
Considering the late hour we arrived, the woman who helped me order my boyfriends burrito was very patient and willing to complete an order. I simply told her what my boyfriend wanted in a burrito and she helped make that happen by suggesting a specific burrito that was plain enough to add more toppings. My boyfriend was satisfied with the burrito and I enjoyed my fries. 
I liked how patient and the cook was even though it was like 3am lol.
