I have been to this place on more than one occasion and I must say that it is really likeable.  The outside patio is fantastic!  The food is good and they have a Tequila selection that is possibly the best in Chandler.  Once in a while they have live music and as much as I like it it can get a bit loud at times.  Overall I give El Zocalo a thumbs up!
