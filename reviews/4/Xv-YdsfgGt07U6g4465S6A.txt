After promising me In-N-Out, my cousin surprised me with a walk to Los Favoritos. He's a regular there and called in our order while we strolled to the restaurant.

The staff totally treated my cousin like a pal, joking with him and teaching us a bit of Spanish. 

We had the California carne asada and regular carne asada. The former had cheese in the rolled tortilla and French fries in the the burrito. The latter had just the right amount of guac and meat. 

One of my typical complaints about carne asada is most restaurants make it too salty. Los Favoritos' meat is perfectly seasoned and fresh. 

The burritos aren't huge, but they do the trick. And the tortilla is chewy and delicious. Refills are free, and Los Favoritos carries two types of hot sauce in squeezy bottles -- just the way I like it.
