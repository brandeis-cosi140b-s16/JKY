The Border Grill is inside the Mandalay Bay casino complex and sports a great outside patio with the view of the lazy river.

It is owned by high wattage chefs Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger the two (except too) hot tamales. So a Mexican restaurant with real chefs. A must try.

We started with the tuna crudo and it was a little plain. Although I am merely an amateur, it seemed like it needed an acid of some sort. 

Then I moved on to the short rib enchiladas and chips and salsa. First, the chips were homemade, crispy and went down a little too smooth. The enchiladas were really good but I wish that I had settled for the chicken option. Short rib meat seems like a waste in the enchilada and while good it seemed out of place.

Also, I had a cucumber mojito that was like drinking a cucumber. Absolutely delightful.

We liked this place but we are suckers for Mexican food. If you find yourself around the strip and you like Mexican food then you should go here. It is top shelf Mexican but not weird gourmet Mexican. I'll be back.
