Mexquite is my local go-to spot for a healthy dinner on the go. Whether you are taking your dinner on the run or sliding into their comfy booths and tables, you are taken through the assembly line promptly and served well. The staff is always friendly and and welcoming, too and I have noticed many of the employees have been them for quite some time.

Eating there, I've never left feeling heavy from being full. The options for your entrees are always fresh and spiced perfectly.  My favorite entree to nosh on is the chicken burrito with a whole wheat wrap and I really have not wavered much from there. Every entree includes chips and salsa and while I have had better salsa at other places, I suggest the medium because it has the perfect balance for those that don't like super spicy salsa and it's fresh! 

The one thing I have noticed since I began frequently Mexquite is that their sustainable products have given way to Styrofoam. I'm sure it is a causality of the economy and the cost of doing business but I loved know that my to-go orders were bio-degradable.
