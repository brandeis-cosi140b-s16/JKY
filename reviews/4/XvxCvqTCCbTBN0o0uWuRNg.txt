Food was good, service was friendly but very slow, no prompt refills... had to ask twice for many things... Fresh guacamole, good queso fundido con chorizo. Chips very thick, roasted salsa not spicy but tasty. 

Word of advice: We noticed at the end that they have stuffed churros. If you want churros order them early or mid meal, they were so hot we could not enjoy them : P
