This is a good Mexican restaurant but here are the noteworthy things:

#1: As Todd mentioned, this is very Americanized Mexican I think because lots of things on the menu come out as a burrito. I'm not an expert BUT I think I know the difference between a chimi, burrito, and enchilada. I am not sure Salsa's does.

#2: Very cool - THEY MAKE THEIR OWN TORTILLAS! There's a small woman in the front during dinner hours that shapes the dough, flattens them and bakes them while you're watching her. Really impressive.

#3: The service is always great. Never a long wait, the servers are quick to take your order, deliver drinks and check up on you.

#4: Salsa's Salsa is great. Muy bueno. Fantastico! Etc, etc.... just spicy enough for me, while still being ok for those of you who like Mild :)

Salsa's is always good in my book - I'll never complain when someone suggests going there!
