I work at this mall and this is my favorite place to eat- hands down. The service can be a little slow at times but the workers are always nice & ready to answer any questions I may have. They have a rewards program that can save you some money if you become a loyal customer. Food overall tastes delicious 90% of the time, the other 10% I go too late in the evening. I got my co-workers hooked.
