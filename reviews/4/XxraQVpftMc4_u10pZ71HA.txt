After seeing the prices at the Diablo Cantina $18 for a quesadilla is insane! We ate at Rubio's inside the food court. I thought it was delicious and had different Salsa choices. As far as the Monte Carlo is concerned, I'd recommend any of the places at the food court than any of their other restaurants that anchor the casino.
