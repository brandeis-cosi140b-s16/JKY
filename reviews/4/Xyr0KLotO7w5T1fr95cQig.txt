Very similar to Tacos El Gordo. Nice set up, a lot of tables and there is an upstairs dining as well. Prices are average. The pastor is amazing as well as the vampira style.
I love how they have elotes, especially the Mexican street style. Their salsa bar is amazing so many options to choose from. I will be back!!
