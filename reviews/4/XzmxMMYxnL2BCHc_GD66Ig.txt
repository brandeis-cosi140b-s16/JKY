There really aren't too many options for authentic Mexican food in Buckeye. Filley B's does a decent job but prices keep climbing and sometimes the portions are on the smaller side. I also had an issue with excessive grease on my pollo asado burrito. They sometimes overdo it to get a nice texture on the tortilla. I do however like their various salsas and service is on point
