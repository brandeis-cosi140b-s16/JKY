Not far from the airport, and a great way to start and end your trip to Phoenix. If you live here, better food than the 'upscale' joints in Scottsdale. The seafood is as good as any I've had in many trips to Mexico, and reminds me of a hidden gem an understanding cab driver took me to on a back street near the Sheraton in Puerto Vallerta, and have never been able to find since. You'll know you're here when you spot those casually hung 'Best Mexican Seafood' awards as you enter.

Start of with one of their many varieties of Ceviche, available in three different sized portions. My son liked it so much he had one as an appetizer, and another larger one as his main course.

My brother then had Grilled Octopus - very tasty and tender. I ordered the Fish Grilled in Garlic Sauce. Amazingly fresh, and done (not overdone) just right. Both platters came with  rice. beans, salad, and under the fish - French Fries! Not at all soggy. And the warm tortillas and spicy salsa let you build a few tacos along the way.

We washed everything down with several Mexican beers, at  4 bucks a bottle, the same as they charge for for 'domestic' beer (although domestic here would probably be Mexican). Friendly waitress and patrons, and even though we were the only gringos in the place, we felt right at home.

The three meals, as above, with tax, tip and beers came out to only about $70. You could drive down to the actual San Carlos Bay through Tuscon and Nogales in a couple of hours, but why bother when it's really right here.
