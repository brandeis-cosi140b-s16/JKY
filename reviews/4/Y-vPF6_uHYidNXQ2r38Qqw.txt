In town for a conference.  Wandered over to this mall full of chain restaurants and found Sam's to be a gem.

Food was fresh, large quantities. Great flavors.  I had a vegetable taco.  Not the same old bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions.  This had asparagus, spinach, zuch.  

Waitress provided great service.  Gave us free guacamole. Outdoor seating is lovely, though lots of skanky pigeons and flies.
