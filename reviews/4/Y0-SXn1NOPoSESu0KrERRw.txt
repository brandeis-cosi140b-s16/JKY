We were pleasantly surprised by the size (large) and cleanliness of this relatively new restaurant that serves high quality fast food at more than reasonable prices.  We were given samples of huli huli chicken, kalua pig and pulehu steak by the friendly counter person.   We both agreed the pig was the way to go and shared a burrito adding black beans, sour cream, cilantro,  lettuce, guacamole (extra charge) and cheese along with  tomato with Maui onion sauce.  In addition we ordered a soda and quarter pound box of coconut bark.  This is fast food, but the freshness of all the ingredients sets it apart from the chains.  The coconut bark could prove to be addictive.  

As we prepared to depart, the executive chef thanked us and proceeded to tell us a little (too much?) about his background and future plans which include opening another Braddah's in Centennial Hills.
