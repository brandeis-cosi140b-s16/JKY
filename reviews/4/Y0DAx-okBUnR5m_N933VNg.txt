Frequented this place for lunch when out on this side of town and it's always fast, fresh and easy. This place packs up quickly for lunch - so I would recommend heading here no later than 11:30 a.m. or after 1 p.m. if you need to be back to work at a certain time.  You can always order online and just grab-and-go if you need to!

The parking lot can be the tricky part of eating here, with a little bit of an awkward set-up and several different popular things right next to each other and people competing to get "the best spot." Again, lunch time is the worst time for the craziness.

The line moves really quickly since the employees are efficient but still manage to keep a smile and treat customers in a friendly manner. We'll for sure be back for good food here.
