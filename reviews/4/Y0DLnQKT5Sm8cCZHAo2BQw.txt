Love this place. when you come inside the Decour reminds you of El Salvador . The service is great we sat down and the waitress came right away we took our food to go. The pupusas are nice and hot not to greasy because some pupusas are greasy it comes with the sauce and the cabbage to  put on top. Always come here
