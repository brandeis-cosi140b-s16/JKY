We stopped here to soak up some booze. It certainly did the trick. The chicken taco was yummy as well as the black beans. The black beans had onions and some seasonings. Decently priced and quick service. The only down fall is the lack of seating. There could be more along the wall. We awkwardly ate our tacos on the ledge where you order. Lol it did the trick!
