The food here is pretty good. We are here every week...it has become a sort of ritual for us, and we have never been disappointed. Well, with the food anyway. 
We are aware of the 'game' they play when ordering in the drive through, but it has gotten so much worse recently. Each item of your order is repeated back to you as you order, with MANY pauses in between, as well as repeated in its entirety again at the end. It is so slow that they actually sound rather incompetent. So much time is wasted placing your order, that when you drive around to the pick up window they immediatley hand you the order and ask for payment. This sounds great, but they don't even give you a chance to put your car in park, or gather your money in order to pay. At first we were pleased with how quickly the order is ready, yet now it has become rather annoying. 
Just know that if you see a long like at the drive thru, do not worry. Once you get to the pick up window, everything is ready.
