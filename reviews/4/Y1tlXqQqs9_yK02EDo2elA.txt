Went back to Taberna for dinner and had a much better experience.  It was cold outside so instead of sitting outside on their patio (partially enclosed) we opted to sit in their cozy dining room.  It's well-decorated and well-designed with combination of booths and tables of different southwest styles.  Only thing missing was a nice mariachi band.

We started off with sangria, the 'aztec affection' cocktail, and draught beer - all pretty good.  I was looking forward to the house-made chips and salsas and they were fresh this time.  Before we knew it we had cleared the basked and we had to ask them not to bring back anymore - too dangerous...Also, remembered the standout tuna ceviche and the shrimp/halibut combination one as well.  Had to replace the shrimp with scallops but actually thought we lucked out as it meshed well with the jalepeno/citrus marinade.  The fried puffs that accompanied the ceviches were unique and helped to satisfy the texture of the dish.  We were off to a good start!

We all shared the fish special (salmon served fajita style), fish tacos, and some spicy jumbo or tiger shrimp (camarones) all served with black beans and rice and the handmade tortillas.  Despite being full we ordered the sopapillas with vanilla gelato to finish our meal.  Presentation-wise it was beautifully presented, however, didn't deliver on the taste front.  It didn't look like the dish as shown in the picture posted with the flan and tres leches as the dough was overly fried and there was  no pillow-like fluffiness to it at all.  The vanilla gelato was also bland and had no hint of vanilla, but we liked the hibiscus foam syrup as an accent.

Overall, the service was friendly, the food good, and the atmosphere enjoyable.
