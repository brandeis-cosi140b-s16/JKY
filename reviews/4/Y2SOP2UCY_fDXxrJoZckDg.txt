Ad this place to the bizarre Phoenix list. Don't get me wrong, the food is scorching and stellar, but everything else about this complex of tiny shacks in South Phoenix is a mindscrew. If you don't get there right when they open at 5, prepare to wait. And it might be a loooong wait. When you finally do get called in, there's about 12 different dining rooms you could be sitting in. Sure, they're all eclectic, but some are downright strange. The main dining room, with all kinds of crap hanging from the ceilings, is excellently atmospheric, in a kitschy sort of way. 

As far as the grub, the New Mexican chilies they use are killer. They'll attack your taste buds throughout the meal, but they provide rich, complex flavors that can't be beat. The salsas, both the red (burn-your-ass hot) and the green (semi-burn-your-ass hot) are both as flavorful as any I've had. I get everything covered in the green, and I order a lot of margaritas. They come just as strong as the salsas.
