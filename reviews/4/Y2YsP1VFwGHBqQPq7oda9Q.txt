Pretty good tacos. I started with 2 carne asada tacos. The meat was very salty so I took one back and let them know. Instead of getting defensive they offered me another taco of my choice. They also said the would let the manger know and thanked me for letting them know. Wouldn't be great if all restaurants had this attitude. The Restaurant is very clean and value priced.  Thanks I'll be back!
