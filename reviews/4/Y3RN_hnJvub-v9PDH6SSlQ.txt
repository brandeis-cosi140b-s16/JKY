We've heard about this legendary taco place on East Tropicana and was excited to see that one was being opened here in this location. Having been in the building when Republic was, we knew what to expect in terms of floor plan. When we walked in, everyone (I mean everyone) was uber friendly and much brighter than before. 

At first, it was confusing, they have stations, then one of the beautiful girls came over and gave us a tour and told us how it all worked. The cooks were offering samples so that definitely helped us decide what to have. We finally decided on the chorizo, carne, al pastor taco, and street style corn on the cob. I must say, if that is what they eat in Mexico, I'm moving to Mexico!! The chorizo was so damn delicious, I had to get up and get a second round. The salsa bar was an awesome touch along with the bar, they've got a decent selection of draft and bottled beer. 

Taco y Taco, although sit down style, is a an upgrade from their first location but certainly a wonderful addition to the Silverado Ranch area. The building is perfect, the food is pretty epic for the value, and is a definite hot spot for a late night 'I need a quick buzz kill'. 

Go check it out!! We'll be back!!
