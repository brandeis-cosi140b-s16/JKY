Caf√© Rio has decent food but the menu just seems stale to me.   Maybe I've eaten here too much over the years but I think they need to add something new.  It's not that I've had a bad meal, in fact just the opposite.  The food quality and consistency is very good between locations.  I've tried everything on their menu (and I mean EVERYTHING) and it was all good but they needs something new and exciting to keep me coming back.   Hell, I'll probably go back again anyways and eat the same stuff.
