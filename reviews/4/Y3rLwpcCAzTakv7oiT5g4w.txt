QUICKY QUICKY!

I remember when I first tried chipotle & saw the size of the burrito... I refused to let the size scare me & chowed down 2 to prove everyone it ain't a thing. 

Till this day 10 years later I can still chow down 2 burritos! Its just like eating 2 bowls of rice.. hahaha 

The staff was super nice & freaken QUICK!!  In & out if there in less than 10 minutes. 

My only thing was that the amount of protein they gave was little compared to other locations I been too... most places give you a big whole scoop & a little more... but this place literally was like a quick scoop kinda action... so I ordered double meat... & it looked like the amount I would get everywhere else =\ 

My fajita steak burrito w/ guacamole was like $13 something... I was still hungry after... =[ o well
