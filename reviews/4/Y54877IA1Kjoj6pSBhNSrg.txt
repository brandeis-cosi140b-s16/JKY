Verde isn't bad.  I've been there twice now, and have enjoyed it both times.  The drinks are quite good.  The first time I went, I had a duck special, which turned out to be about half a duck, and kind of on the dry side.  My husband had the steak special, which was divine, so I highly recommend getting that if it ever ends up being offered again.

The empanadas are great.

Our second time, my husband and I were trying hard to keep to our pescatarian diet.  Now, this is where I think Verde stumbles - it's just not very good at doing vegetarian food (at least, not the way I like it).  So, if you are vegetarian, I'd stick with the appetizers, and stay away from the main courses.

It doesn't satisfy my craving for hole in the wall mexican food, but it's a nice addition to the Pittsburgh food scene.
