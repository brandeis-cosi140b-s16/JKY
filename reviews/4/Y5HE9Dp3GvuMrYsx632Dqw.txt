Good food, small hole-in-the wall place but food is authentic and yummy! I had the chicken tacos and the chicken was tender and not greasy. I have also had their menudo which was somewhat plain but I they give you things to put in it. I think they make it that way since people like their medudo different ways. Their pork burritos are great, i always get mine wet as i love the combination of the flavor of the meat and sauce. All together a good restaurant, I love this place :)
