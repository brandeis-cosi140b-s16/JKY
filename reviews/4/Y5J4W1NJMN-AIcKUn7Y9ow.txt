I don't understand all the hate for this place. Like the guy before me said "clearly the refried beans have gone to your head." There are so many more choices here and the food is flavorful. Plus, how can you not love queso sauce? ARE YOU NOT HUMAN???

I'm a little 110 pound girl but I love big portions so the amount of meat and everything else they heap on there is amazing. Plus they seem to always have quality meat. More than once I have stopped by a Chipotle, the barbacoa tasted and had the texture of meat that had been chewed and then someone decided they didn't want to swallow it and put it back in the meat bucket. 

Well I'm not here to rag on Chipotle, but I am here to tell you what a yummy place you're missing out on. I understand everyone has a bad day and maybe one time they had crappy rice or something, but who are you to judge something after one experience? My favorite sushi place has had one bad day, I never judged them on it and you shouldn't either.

I'd recommend this place as a great lunch spot, it's quick and delicious. Don't forget the queso :D
