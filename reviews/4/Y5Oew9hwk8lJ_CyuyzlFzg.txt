This is a great neighborhood spot.  I love their chips, thin and salted perfectly.  The guac and salsa that accompanies it are also very tasty, as are almost every variety of taco on their menu.  They also have fantastic lunch, happy hour, and reverse happy hour specials, so I don't find it at all expensive for what you get.  This is quality over quantity mexican so if you're looking for cheap, heaping mounds covered in orange cheese and free chips and salsa to stuff your face with, you should probably continue down the road to Tee Pee.  I'm glad they are in the hood, they also know how to make a drink, and allow you to mix and match your tacos so you can try different varieties.
