If you don't eat meat skip this place. Head, tongue, pork, and carne asada tacos galore. My cheese quesadillas were really flavorful; probably because they were cooked on the same grill as the meat! Some people's reviews commented about the place itself- who cares? Go for the tacos, 'cause that's all they serve anyway (except for quesadillas). Recommended.
