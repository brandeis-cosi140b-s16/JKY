Very good food! My son and I stopped in for lunch after a round of disc golf and had our famished tummies happily filled. My son ordered a plate of two chipotle fish tacos and I ordered the plate of a shrimp burrito and two rolled fish tacos.

My son's tacos looked great and he said they tasted great. He did wipe a little of the sour cream off and said that it was a bit too much. He wolfed it down, though, and said he'd like to return to try their other menu items.

As for me, the shrimp burrito was HUGE. They did not skimp on the shrimp, either. It was filled with shrimp, rice, sour cream and some other things. It was really tasty. I think the tortilla was freshly made. I ate 3/4 of it and on of the rolled fish tacos, basically a fish taquito, so I had some left over burrito and another rolled fish taco for eating at suppertime.

There is a salsa bar and we tried the Diablo salsa, which was flavorful but not that hot, and the tomatillo salsa. The tomatillo was the best I've ever tried. Most tomatillo salsas are flavorless to me, but this one was flavorful and I enjoyed it on bites of my burrito.

We both had horchata, it is is delicious. Full bodied and creamy, it is one of the best I've tasted.

The store is clean and organized, having both tables and booths.
