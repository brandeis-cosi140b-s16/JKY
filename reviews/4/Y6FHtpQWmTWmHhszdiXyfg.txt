One of our roommates got take out from this place and took it up to the room for us because we were in such a time crunch. Don't know anything about the ambiance of this place, but the food was bomb! We had the crab cakes and the nachos and I lovvvved it! And I normally don't like crab cakes! The nachos had like 7-10 chips, each already having carnitas, guac, salsa, sour cream, etc.. on it, and it was deeelious! I'll definitely come back here and visit the restaurant :)
