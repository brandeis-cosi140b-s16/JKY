I love this place!!! Maybe I'm not as picky as some, but I have a great time at Arriba's!  I love the food, the atmosphere, and they have a great Happy Hour!  

Happy Hour is Monday - Friday, 4-7pm.  They offer 99 cent Margarita's and half-priced appetizers (I can't remember which one is not half off, so you'll have to ask your server.  We order the mini chimis, Chicken quesadilla, and the absolute best cheese dip in the world, the Queso Fundido!!!  Sometimes they even light the cheese on fire for you!  Include this with the chips, salsa, and bean dip and your bill is less than $20.  Cannot beat that!

I'm from southern New Mexico, so Hatch green chili on anything is a must here!  I've been here numerous times and have never had a bad time or bad food.  Wish I would've yelped sooner.
