For what it is - a cheap Mexican restaurant - this place gets 4 stars. I have been going here for the past 4 days for lunch and I sit at the bar. The staff is really friendly. 
their food is great, and that $4.99 menu is fantastic - no skimping on portions here! Their chips are great, but I don't think they serve beans any longer with them.... at least not at the bar for the times I went. The salsa is muy authentico!! 
Super Mex is a hidden gem for a cheap, full-portioned, and tasty meal.
