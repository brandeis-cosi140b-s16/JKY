OMG- the cornbread!!! The cornbread was so good. I literally filled up on cornbread and drinks from happy hour. The food was pretty good as well. Our waiter was such a sweetheart. He was young guy, unfortunately I can't remember his name. Service was spot on and the speed of the food coming out was very fast. I'm deducting one star, just because I've had better food in the area.
