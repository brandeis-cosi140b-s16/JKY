The ONLY fausto's location I will eat at in the Las Vegas valley. I'm rating it 4 stars mainly because the size of the burrito has gone down over the years, unfortunately. I visit this  location on occasion and i have for over 10 years. Tonight was the very first time that I have ever tried their chicken quesadilla, and let me tell you... it was the best quesadilla I've ever had in my entire life. Ask for onions, peppers, and chicken in the quesadilla (there is no extra charge). The only downfall to the quesadilla is the fact that it is $6.50. To me, for a quesadilla, that's a bit pricey. But I promise, it is so worth it. Did I mention that their fries are super good and only $2.50 for a heaping plate? :)
