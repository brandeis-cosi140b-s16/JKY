I stand by my principle in saying Mexican restaurants have the best burger and fries. On a lovely ciabatta bun with pepper jack cheese and not cooked to shoe leather, that is how a burger should be.  Wife had the shrimp tacos and swore they were to die for.  Habanero wings? Hot. Very hot. But very good also.

Now we were in on Cinco de Mayo and it was packed so I'm not gonna ding the service for that, but you could tell they seemed to be a little unprepared for all the people. Live music was good and if your into cougar hunting this seems like a nice spot to try.
