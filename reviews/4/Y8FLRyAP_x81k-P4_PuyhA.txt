I am hardly ever in the mood for Mexican food and can be a big downer when it comes to dashing other peoples hopes about obtaining this style of cuisine. I had worked in a now defunct Mexican stand within a casino for a good portion of my high school years and had many coworkers who made awesome home-style dishes, so I do not jump for joy when I go to chain restaurants. My stomach still yearn for the chili rellenos, sweet tamales, and chicken mole this Godsend of a lady use to make. 

My friend swayed me to go here after our half hour dilemma of pinpointing what we were in the mood for. I will spare you the details because no one will ever be able to follow this train of thought. All you need to know is that Zaba's offers whole wheat tortillas and brown rice. If you are finicky about what you eat and want items that will stay with you longer throughout the day then this is the place for you. For the most part everything else on the menu is pretty standard and comparable to Chipotle, but I am a sucker for more fiber. 

Needless to say, I got the vegetarian burrito with a whole wheat tortilla, brown rice, black beans, corn, hot salsa, cheese, guacamole, and lettuce. The veggies were not the star of the show because they had lost most of their integrity sitting in the pan. Otherwise the burrito was perfect. 

I received a suggestion to get the chicken burrito the next time because it is suppose to be their best. I am also a huge fan of barbacoa, so I will have to at least try this place two more times.
