I went to Mi Patio the other night for the first time with the BF. The place is a cute little restaurant that is pretty unassuming from the outside. The salsa is spicy and fairly tasty. The service was attentive. I had the 'healthy' burro and it was very good...grilled fajita chicken and veggies. It also helped that I stole some guac from the BF's chimi...the guac added exactly what this burro needed. I would go back.
