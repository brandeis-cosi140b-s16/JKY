Very decent and affordable.

If I could give it a 3.5 I would.

I got the "green chile con carne, enchilada style" burrito. Had a decent spice to it, sufficient meat but the cheese was a little sparse.

I got this exact burrito to compare it with my favorite place, Ritos Mexican Take Out. Ritos is still in a league of its own, so back there I go.

Go try it out though, it's worth a shot.
