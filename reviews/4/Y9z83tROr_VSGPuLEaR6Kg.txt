Being in the mood for a breakfast burrito I searched on Yelp for some reviews and found this place. It had a couple mixed reviews but I have to agree with the majority that this place seems pretty good. I can't give an extensive review since I've only had the breakfast burrito so far but I give it a big YUM review. 

It's a good size burrito and I do like the tortilla they used too. The salsa is hot enough to add that kick but not over the top...it leaves that nice hot tingle on your lips after eating. My only suggestion is the eggs were a little too done so they sort of had a burnt flavor, however, perhaps that flavor gave it a little extra something... in any case, I'm sure I'll be trying this place again soon.
