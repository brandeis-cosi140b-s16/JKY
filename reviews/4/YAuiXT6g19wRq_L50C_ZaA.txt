This was my first visit to Zaba's. Without Yelp, I wouldn't have even known this place existed!

I grabbed a shredded beef burrito and it was very good. The whole place seemed very clean and well-organized. The ordering process is basically the same as Chipotle and Cafe Rio, but with more options (like potatoes). Pricing is essentially right in between Chipotle and Cafe Rio.

I'm glad I found this place (thanks to Yelp) and I always enjoy finding "new" locall-owned places to grab a bite. Check 'em out!
