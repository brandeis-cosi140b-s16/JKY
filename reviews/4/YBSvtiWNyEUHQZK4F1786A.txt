New, clean, and fresh.  Located in a strip mall right by the airport.  If you are staying by the airport it is a great spot to grab some Mexican.  I went with the 3 Taco combo.  I like all the options for the different meat choices.  You aren't limited to just beef or chicken.  I went with the pulled pork and ground beef.  It is comparable to a Chipotle with all the options and fresh ingredients.  The frozen margaritas are a nice touch!

One thing I'm huge on is cleanliness.   You could probably eat off the floor at Salsaritas.  They close a bit early during the week (8 oclock).  We were the last people for the night and they let us hang out while they were closing up.  I watched the worker take off each fountain faucet and clean it off.  Excellent!  To many businesses neglect fountain stations and the mildew they can grow.  A+.
