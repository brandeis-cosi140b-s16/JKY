love this bar!  did you know they were building one up at desert ridge??? just drove by today and saw the sign and a building being worked on...AMAZING so fun and a great spot for it.  :)  Food is fun, service is good...great spot to watch games and they usually have some good drink specials so you're not about to break the bank when going there.
