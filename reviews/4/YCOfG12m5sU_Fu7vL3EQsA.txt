I go here every now and then, usually on Tuesdays (taco). Mercedes is usually there, and she is SUPER nice. She remembers you're name, and is very awesome when it comes to customer service. CS is something that people aren't getting these days, and when they do get it...its not consistent like Mercedes'.
