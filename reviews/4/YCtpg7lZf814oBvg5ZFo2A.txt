It's been a while since my last trip to the Saz, but as a freshman at Madison in the fall of '98, it was one of the first places I discovered on State Street. Its simple decor and half-service atmosphere is great for the hungry-but-poor college student looking for a tasty variety of food in a quiet atmosphere.
