Joyride is my new favorite restaurant. 

I am absolutely in love with the food, decor and their TACOS! My absolute favorite is the crispy fish taco. 

We went in on my birthday and ordered an appetizer, tacos and a few sides. The tacos came out but the appetizer didn't come out until we were done eating our meal. I told the waiter how late the appetizer was, and the manager came right over and took care of the whole meal! Not at all what we were expecting but so wonderful and kind on my birthday.

Joyride is absolutely wonderful from the customer service to the great food! I love this place and go back as much as I can.
