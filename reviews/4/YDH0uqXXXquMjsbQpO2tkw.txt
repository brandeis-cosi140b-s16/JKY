As much as I wish I hadn't had walked the sketchy section of Vegas Blvd. inbetween I-515 and Stewart Ave(where the sketchiness felt the worst, and this is coming from someone who has experienced enough sketchy neighborhoods in Chicago), I'll admit I never would've discovered this great hole in the wall taco stand otherwise. I ordered a pork taco, and it really hit the spot. So good, that I wish I had ordered 2 tacos, and got one different one for a 2nd one had I done that. I bet their quesadillas, burritos, and other items are pretty good, as well. They even had huaraches(sp?) on their menu, as well!

Too bad it's on the other side of I-515, and not a little closer to the Fremont St. area. Since this is a cheaper and more interesting alternative, to eating at pricier places closer to Fremont St. like Heart Attack Grill(had no interest in going there). I wouldn't mind coming back here, but next time I'll take the #113 bus to get here first, and take that bus to get back. There are #113 bus stops for northbound and southbound buses on this route immediately north of Bonanza Rd, btw.
