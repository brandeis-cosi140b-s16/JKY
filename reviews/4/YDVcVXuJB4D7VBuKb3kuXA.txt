Ramiros is a very convenient place to go grab some food late because its open 24 hours. For all you people upset about it taking so long to get your food, here's a tip- USE THE DRIVE THROUGH! They prioritize the drive through guests and you will get your food in less than 5 minutes. Also, I only ever eat the breakfast burritos- I agree that some of the meat might be a little strange so stick with the egg and ham burrito. Oh and definitely get lots of the green sauce, its awesome! Hope this helps for the future.
