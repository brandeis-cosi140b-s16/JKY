WELCOME TO MOE'S!!!  This is what you hear whenever you walk into any Moe's location.  It's a pretty cool little Mexican joint that leaves you very full.

Moe's is on par with Salsarita's, Chipotle, and Qdoba.  Its not-quite-fast-food-Mexican that tastes fresh.  Of all these chains, I give Moe's the highest rating for freshly seasoned meats. My fav is the quesadilla-they use fresh cheese, yo!  And unlike other chains, they treat you like a big kid and let you serve yourself unlimited salsas.  

Note: The Kaiser is a little sweet and not so spicy, the tomatillo es muy picante!  

The staff are pretty friendly. I told one of front line staff that they needed some plastic knives and the cook came out with a huge butcher knife and asked if I wanted to borrow his. Mu ha haaa!!!  Service around closing can be haphazard, they pretty much close up shop as you're eating.  Otherwise, this might be a good place to start an evening on the Dilworth bar/restaurant/entertainment circuit.
