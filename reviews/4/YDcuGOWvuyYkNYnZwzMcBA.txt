La Paloma Mexican Grill is a little hole in the wall restaurant perhaps only the staff of St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center and surrounding office workers know about in, what I believe is, the Encanto Park neighborhood.

Don't let La Paloma's exterior or existence in a small strip mall overwhelmed by a medical supply store keep you from checking this great restaurant.

La Paloma is clean, the atmosphere friendly and the meals fresh, traditional and tasty. You order at the counter, then sit down to eat. For a Mexican restaurant, they have the typical dishes: Burritos, tacos, enchiladas, rice and beans.

The surprise here is the small section of the menu devoted to Korean cuisine. The owners are Korean, thus have to have dishes of their native land. My husband had their Beef Bulgogi, which is Korean beef barbecue with fresh vegetables and rice and loved it. 

Craving guacamole, I went for chicken tacos and a side of a guacamole with an interesting spice combination.

The only issue we had is that my meal arrived about 10 minutes before my husband's meal. It could be his dish took longer to prepare and they are used to the lunch crowd, which can have a casual attitude toward meal arrivals, If that makes sense. 

They are open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays and 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturdays. Closed Sundays.

If you find yourself in the area, or are curious about La Paloma, definitely check it out. We'll definitely go back there in the future.
