We visit Los Favs at least 2 times a week, and for the price and the overall good, consistent quality, you really can't beat it.  Some people whine that they've had better and more authentic Mexican food, sure, if you want to fork over an arm and a leg or risk your safety going to some hellhole, have at it Wolfgang Puck.  

This Los Favs is located in a great, safe area, the staff always gets the order right and the food is always made fresh and hot.  Their red hot sauce is the best, I do agree with the other reviewer that the guac could be a bit better, but it's a small price to pay overall.
