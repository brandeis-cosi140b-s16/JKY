People that rate Top Shelf, don't understand it.

If you go here, don't sit on the non bar side unless you have to.  The bar side is where its at...its a Mexican sports bar, if you want authentic Mexican food, don't come here.  Come here to watch the game and snack on chips and salsa.

The best items on the menu are the fajitas and the fajita fundido burrito.  I prefer steak, but chicken is fine.  Add jalepenos for more fun.  The chips are fresh and the salsa is the best I've had in the valley.

If you're drinking, skip the margaritas on the menu and order the Million Dollar Margarita...if you're a heavy drinker, two should give you a buzz, three will make you giggly...if you're a light drinker, be careful with one.

On the way out, grab one of the key lime mints.
