Excellent fast Mexican food from a clean, friendly restaurant. A big plus was being able to eat chips and salsa while waiting for our big take-out order. I had the chile relleno plate and they were better than some I have had at other Mexican restaurants. The salsa, pico, rice, and beans were all tasty and the portions were huge! The tacos and burritos that the other family members got all looked great and my daughter loved her chicken enchilada and beef taco. 

The next time we're in Queen Creek visiting family, I will be stopping at this Filibertos!

BTW, It is kind of hard to find because it is tucked away in the corner of a strip-mall and it's difficult to see their sign. At least they have a road side sign to guide you in.
