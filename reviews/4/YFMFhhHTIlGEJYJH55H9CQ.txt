I'm not really sure what I think of this place. I don't live anywhere near here and try to stay out of Tempe as much as I can. But it's kinda become a ritual to come here before a show at the Marquee.  Mostly because we can hit up happy hour, and get a quick bite and drink many beers before they go up to $10 at the show.  But as big as this place is, it's always dead.  The food isn't anything spectacular but it does the job.  I just like how there seems to always be some kind of drink special and we can get in and get out.
