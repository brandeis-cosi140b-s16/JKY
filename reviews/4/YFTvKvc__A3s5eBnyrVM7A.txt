I just love their fish tacos. 

I was in the neighborhood and needed a fast fix,,,I was happy when I saw Rubios sign. 

Gentleman that was helping me was super nice and polite. He put my order in and it was delivered to my table in a timely manner. 

Place is nicely kept. Very clean, organized, and salsa counter was also very well taken care of. 

Fish taco was the bomb. 

Great fast food to have around when your fish taco cravings kick in.
