I've been to Frederico's twice now (both in Buckeye, AZ). The first time I made a major mistake and ordered three tacos and some chips and beans. This was WAAAAY to much food although the cost was less than $10. The meal was excellent, tasty, hot, and filling. I didn't eat it all but not because it wasn't good ... there was just too much.  

My second time at Frederico's I ordered the #1 (tostado, taco, beans, and rice plate).  Very good food with fast service (to go). Although it is considered "fast food" it was the same as you would find in a good Mexican sit down restaurant.
