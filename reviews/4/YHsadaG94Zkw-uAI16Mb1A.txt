Very good food and great service.  We started with the house made guacamole,  fresh and simple,  good chips. I ordered the Chile Rojas de Pollo, not very much heat but a ton of flavor.  The rice and barracho beans were great accompaniments. My husband had the carnitas, the meat was super tender and flavorful. Service was friendly and our waitress knew it was our first time and made great recommendations.  $2 draft beers for happy hour. This restaurant had so many cute details, in the decor, the way they presented the check, chicklets at the end of the meal, etc. We will surely be back.
