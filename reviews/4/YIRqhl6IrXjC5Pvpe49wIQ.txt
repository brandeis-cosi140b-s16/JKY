Ok, I think we all know that phat burrito is not authentic mexican but neither is taco bell.Lol But their food is pretty good and the people are awsome. The ingredences are very fresh and  the food is tastie. The atmospher is really chill, and you have a choice of eating in or out which both are great. I would tell anyone to go there
