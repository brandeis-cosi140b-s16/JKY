Even though the interior is a little less than stellar, I was very impressed with the service and the food.  I had the chicken enchiladas and they were so tasty I couldn't get enough!  The iced tea was perfectly brewed and I'm a tea snob!  I think I'd like to try a cheese crisp next time and be there when the music is loud and proud!

I went with a great friend who has been going there for years and that probably made it even better but I'm game to go back again!  It's a landmark for a reason.
