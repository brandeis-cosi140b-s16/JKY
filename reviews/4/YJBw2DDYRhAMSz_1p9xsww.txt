This is the low key taco spot! Based on prices, never had high expectations. It's not gourmet by any means. I don't even eat Mexican food. I have a sausage breakfast burrito every time I go, and I think it's pretty good. Decent, quick food for cheap! I go all the time for breakfast, and for under $5 it sure beats McDonalds!!
