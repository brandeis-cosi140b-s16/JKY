Had a craving for a margarita so I decided to stop into El Hefe in Tempe.  

Walked in to find a large bar with plenty of seating.  Also notice a lot of TV's.  This is turning out better than I thought.  Gonna catch some scores and games.

Was greeted with a hello and a beautiful smile by a bar tender named Emily.  WOW!!  Total stunner!!  Asked me what I would like and told here I was craving a margarita.  She worked her magic and had one in front of me in no time.  And it was pretty good too.  After one sip I knew there would be a second.  

Emily asked me if I wanted to see a menu so I said "sure".  After looking at the menu for a few minutes I thought everything sounded pretty good.  Emily helped explain the menu.  When I asked for a suggestion, she said the mahi tacos and enchiladas were winners.  So I took her advice and found she was right on the money.  Enchiladas were really good and mahi mahi has always been one of my favorites.  Thanks for the tip Emily.

So after eating I relaxed and watched the rest of the Cavs game and ordered margarita #2.  Just as good as the first one.  

So great atmosphere, super helpful bar tender in Emily, tasty drinks and good food.  I'll be back.
