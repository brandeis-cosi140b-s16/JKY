We got some pork, beef, green corn and a chicken to go.  Definitely some of the best tamales I've ever had.  If they weren't so small, I would give them 5 stars.  Front counter person could be a little nicer too.   Very limited hours, but pretty close to my house, so I'm happy about that.  We will DEFINITELY be back.
