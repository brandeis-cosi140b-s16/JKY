(The continuing story of a yelp-loving couple seeking great locally owned joints, friendly service and a comfortable atmosphere for playing Magic the Gathering...)

DH and I hit PVBC today for lunch.  I got the Fresno Tacos, he went with the Brulee Burger.  Very fair pricing.  I though the tacos were pretty good - I will say it was my first experience with "street-style" tacos.  Three little guys with nice toppings and good flavors.  Hubby's burger dripped yellow egg with his first bite (I internally screamed "EWWW!!!").  He thought it was great, especially as his first experience with a fried egg on a burger.  The guy running the register/bringing out the food was friendly and the shop was neat with nice little tables and a very clean/girly bathroom.  This one is on the list!  MTG Score: DH 2 / Me 1
