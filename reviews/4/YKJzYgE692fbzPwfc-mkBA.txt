Hubby was starving so we wanted something quick. Planned on Roberto's but decided to try this place after reading some of the reviews. We got Nachos and they were very good.. their chips are perfect and the toppings/sauces were very fresh. The service was also very good. The girl who took our order and gave us our food was SO sweet. Next time we'll get the Chicken Nachos or maybe ask for combo meat. 
4 stars because service and food were both very good, especially for it just being a drive thru.
