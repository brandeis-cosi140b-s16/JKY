Food is pretty darn good - they get points for having fresh made whole wheat tortillas, free quesadillas for kids under six, and a free enchilada style option on the burritos. I prefer the red sauce to the green, the pinto beans to the black beans, and the Barbacoa to Chipotle's lame excuse for Barbacoa. I only wish they were consistent in their prices and service. One day I got a tiny scoop of guacamole for free, the next day it was $1.50. Then they charged me $7.50 for a plain cheese quesadilla when the week before it was a fraction of that price. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that these are just growing pains, but seriously $7.50?!?!
