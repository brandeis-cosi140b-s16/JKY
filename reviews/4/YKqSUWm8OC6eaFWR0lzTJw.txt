The food is always pretty good. They also serve a little  cup of clam soup at the beginning of your meal...reminds me of a manhattan clam chowder.  This place is super popular and they also serve mini bud lights for $1  ( sidenote: I had never seen those minis unless I was with my Mexican friends). It can get a little loud and it appears that they only hire "sexy" waitresses.  It definitely feels like a little place in Baja
