So we thought we'd give it another shot - either we're a glutton for punishment or we are forgiving kind of folks....    Happily, I can report that this meal was wonderful!  We sat in a booth in the bar area.  Jessica was our server and she was the BEST server we've had ever in the years we've been coming to this place.  The food was very fresh, tasty, hot and yummy.  The XX was cold and the service was perfection.  Yay El Encanto Dos for hiring qualified servers who actually want to be there!   Good on ya!
