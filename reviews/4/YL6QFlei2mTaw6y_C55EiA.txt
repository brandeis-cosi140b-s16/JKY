I love this place, I have tried several things on the menu and have never had something I didn't like. 

The seafood is fresh, and there are a lot of options for preparation. If you are unfamiliar with something, dive in and try it!

Plus: 
The servers are always friendly. 
Food arrives fast and hot
I have been there a couple dozen times, and there is always something I haven't tried yet.

Minus: 
The music can be REALLY LOUD. Being a nerd, I started the decibel meter app on my phone - it reached 101 decibels at times! I found this on Yahoo Answers: "100 decibels, equivalent to a chain saw, pneumatic drill, printing plant, jackhammer, speeding express train, some car horns at five meters, farm tractor, riveting machine, some noisy subways [about 20 feet]." So yeah, the other reviewers are not exaggerating when they say it's loud in there. 

The lighting is super bright fluorescent bulb style.
These 2 things combine to make this not the place for a relaxing dinner after a long day at work. It's more of an adventure, so find something you haven't tried yet, shout out your order and enjoy that michelada!
