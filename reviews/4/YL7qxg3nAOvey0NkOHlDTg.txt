Just ate breakfast. Very clean, very friendly staff, delicious food, very inexpensive (crappy Dennys usually costs us thirty dollars or so) and nice quiet atmosphere. Nothing very flashy for breakfast, but that suits my hubby just fine. One awesome thing I must suggest however is the fruit waters. Normally I love my coffee with breakfast but I was intrigued, so of course I had to try. Delish! I got onshore which came out as a little ready of sunshine with an umbrella in it. Didn't miss my coffee at all. Definitely a great morning stop especially if you are sick of the. Restaurants that get high ratings because they are trendy (been to way too many disappointments that way) I think the only down side is there really isn't much decor and from the outside it is not eye catching, but that's about it.
