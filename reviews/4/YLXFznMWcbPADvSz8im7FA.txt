I like this place...I keep coming back to it.  There are many Mexican chains out there in the world, but this place does Mexican food right.  The dishes are a New Mexico kinda twist on things.  The hatch green chiles are very hot if you are not used to it.  Pay attention to the chile ratings on the menu.  The chips come with 3 different kinds of salsa.  For that I will probably say this is the best chip/salsa setup in the valley.  The service sometimes is lousy.
