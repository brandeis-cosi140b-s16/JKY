With the demise of two of my favorite west side Mexican food spots, The Spousal Unit and I have been forced out of our comfort zone and out to the far reaches of East Washington in search of decent stuff. As mentioned before, Mexico Lindo is off in the middle of a parking lot and doesn't look like much but....

I had business with a bike shop out on East Washington so I convinced S.U. to join me and have lunch while waiting for my bike. We were the only ones there for an early lunch but were soon joined by a few other customers, most likely native Spanish speakers from south of the border. 

Fresh hot chips came out served with a kick-ass green salsa and a very nice red one. I wanted to order a mix of tacos but was told the three taco plate had to all be the same since they cooked everything fresh (good sign) so I settled on al pastor. S.U. ordered chicken gorditas (3) that sure looked like sopes to me. Both lunch plates came with rice and beans. Add a pair of Negra Modelos and I'll call it Lunch! An excellent lunch! Their dinner menu is the same as their lunch menu but with larger portions. I would come back to try their mole, since everything that we had was so good and fresh.

It's a long way across town, we'll make it back at least one more time but if I lived on the East side, I would get to know the ladies who run this place.
