You love a good green chile dish, especially Hatch chiles. 
You also have no particular regard for your bumhole, evidenced by your routine attempts to set it ablaze the next day with your pepper infused crap. 
Well have I got good news for you. 
Rita's Mexican Food.

Rita's offers one of the finest green chile dishes I've ever experienced, transcending most Mexican food joints by miles.
On my last visit, I tried bowl of green chile stew. It was hot. 
No, wait, let me rephrase that...

       It was FUCKING HOT.

It was so hot, it sent me into a sneezing session the scientists at Claritin would have marveled at. 
Then I started crying. 
Like a little bitch and, I got all snotted-up too. 
But god, was it ever good. The service...not so much. 

In fact, the service wasn't anything to write home about. Not that you would anyway, even if it was good. Making me wonder why people invoke that stupid cliche anyway?
I doubt seriously I'd ever leave a restaurant, go home, whip out my laptop and write my folks about how wonderful my lunch service was. 
But if I did, this is how it would go:

Dear Mom and Dad.

The place where I ate lunch today had such good service, I thought I had better write to tell you about it. Because that's what people do right? They get good service and write home. Unlike when you get bad service, and simply fail to write about it. This is why I'm writing home.
I got good service and just thought you both should know all about it. But this seems like service hypocrisy in a sense, which is why I'll probably start writing you when I get bad service as well, despite its lack of anything to write home about. 
Anyways, that's it for now. 
Expect more emails. I eat out often. 

Your loving son, 
Diego
