It takes 32 minutes.

(The time needed to get from SW baggage claim to the curbside pick-up to the highway to the very first stop on my every trip to Phoenix - authentic Mexican food at Alberto's....I mean, El Tio....same diff...and good at any location. They'll tell you they're different and that there is some type of territorial feud going on between the two locally-operated chains. But, don't believe the hype....they just like to give you reason to keep jumping back and forth between both their great menus! Go for the burritos, stay for the chips with pseudo-guac and homemade salsas!)
