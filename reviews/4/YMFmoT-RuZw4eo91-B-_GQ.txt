This is my kind of Mexican restaurant.  Yes it's a dive.  Yes you order at the counter and your food arrives on a paper plate.  But, the food is so unbelievable.  They are a sweet Mexican family and their sauces, tortillas, beans, etc. are just delicious.  I have found that the best Mexican food is generally found in a dive and this is no exception.  But if you really like good Mexican food where the beans don't taste like they do at every other Mexican restaurant and you like high quality meat and cheese, give this dump a try.  I went once and now I'm an addict.  FYI, I wouldn't change the decor one bit!
