Spotted this place in the same strip mall as Ace Hardware yesterday.  After a night out on the town a giant burrito was in order.  This place hit the spot.  It's definitely nothing fancy, but is perfect after you've been over served. The staff was very helpful and friendly.  I went with the carne asada burrito.  It was a good size and had good salsa inside.  The carne wasn't the highest quality, but I wasn't expecting that.  This was much better than the various fat food chains around and will be on my list for future recovery.
