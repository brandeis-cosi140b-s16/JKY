Which came first? The Chipotle or the Zaba? Zaba's seems to be exactly like Chipotle except not quite. Zaba's has the same idea, you pick your bowl/burrito/tacos and they fill it with whatever you want. But they've got some weird stuff too, like fish tacos and sweet potatoes?! Their hot sauce isn't, but all in all it's alright food. My favorite thing about Zaba's is that they have the Chipotle tabasco sauce. Now you tell me if that's not confusing.
