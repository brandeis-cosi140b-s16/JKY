Omg their carne asada tacos are to die for. Although, I didn't like the tacos al pastor, the meat didn't taste like pastor meat (I'm Hispanic and a fan of tacos al pastor so I know what I'm talking about), it was dry and no pineapple (an essential ingredient in this type of taco - other places offer it as an optional ingredient but you can see it on the top of the el trompo and its juices contribute to the flavor of the meat. Overall, best place for tacos de carne asada but if you like tacos al pastor, Tacos El Gordo and Tacos El Buen Pastor serve them better.
