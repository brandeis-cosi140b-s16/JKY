Mi Patio Mexican Restaurant is a great place to go for really good south of the border type of food that is really inexpensive.  This place is cheap!! and good :-)

Some really great friends of ours got us hooked on Mi Patio quite some time ago.  They are that kind of place that may not get your "frequent dinning" card but you'll remember them after a couple of months go by and go back. 

Restaurant ~ it's kind of smallish and cozy looking on the outside but they  really have plenty of room on the inside.  The decor is a fun Spanish style with plenty of vibrant colors and textures.  It's not fancy by any means but very fun!

Service ~ is fantastic! We've been several times and have had different servers and they are all very friendly, helpful and eager to serve to you.

Food ~ chips and salsa are excellente!  We have not had a bad meal here, everything is good!  It probably won't be the best you've ever had but they are very good and extremely consistent.  I prefer their chili relleno or their baja chicken burro or their baja spinach and feta cheese chimi!  On my last visit they combined both baja's into one pollo-spinach-cheesy-delicioso-burro!  Tasty factor times 2!  You can't go wrong with just about anything on their menu.  We try something different on every visit ;-)

Beverages ~ Skip the $2.40 soda... and go for the $1.75 margarita's!!  Yeah!! They may not be the best margaritas but where else can you get a pitcher of this tasty beverage for $9?

This is a great place to go with friends, have a good time and go el-cheap-o and not feel bad about it.  We are grateful our friends introduced us to Mi Patio Mexican Restaurant!
