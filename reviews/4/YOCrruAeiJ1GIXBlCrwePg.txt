I love their salads! I prefer the barbacoa and carnitas over the steak and chicken. I'm very picky with my meat, so it's nice that I don't generally have to worry about finding a fatty piece in my salad. The food is always fresh and the service is generally very good. This is a great place to go during an hour lunch since they are very efficient.
