What's authentic?  I had two white people from Wisconsin tell me that Gran Agave was the most authentic Mexican restaurant in the 'Burgh.  Hmm....of course, he just texted me that he majored in Spanish in college.  Okay, then!

I had the chicken w/mole sauce, and the usual fare of burritos, tacos, and empanadas.  The portion sizes are huge.  The food is flavorful, especially the mole sauce.  The service was fine, but I was there for lunch, and there weren't many patrons.  Amazingly, I didn't have a margarita.  I can't remember why not, maybe because I was already drunk.  Or not.

Clearly, my vague description of the food categorizes me as a poor reviewer of what is authentic.  I did eat at a Yucatan restaurant once, beside a cenote.  THAT was good.

I definitely think it's worth trying, and if we're in the Waterfront area for shopping, we'll probably come here for our lunch/dinner.  What are your other choices: Dave & Buster's?  PF Chiangs?  (Ok, I actually like PF Chiang's a lot.)  Or you could walk across the bridge to Red Robin.  Eh.  I like it here, and I'll come back to get my fix.
