Mixteca is my go-to spot for Mexican fast food. It's primarily Sonoran and Baja fare.  All the staples are very good but a few standard orders are the Torta Cubana, Carne Asada/Green Chile/Machaca burritos and shredded beef tacos.  

This place isn't going to blow your mind with anything new but as far as Valley Mexican fast food chains go, this is one of the better options.
