If you are going to eat a burrito that isn't good for you anyway, I would choose Susie's. I love this place. The horchata is great. I like to utilize this place for a quick takeout burrito instead of a say.... burrito express. It is comparable to El Charro's, and it's really cheap. I call ahead and never wait.
