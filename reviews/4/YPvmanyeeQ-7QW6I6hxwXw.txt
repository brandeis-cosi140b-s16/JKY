Best Mexican food I've ever eaten. I'm not exposed to much authentic Mexican, so this really took the cake for me. Chips and salsa were sooo plentiful, not salty, super fresh and so cheap--$2! 

My husband ordered the taco plate ($9) that came with pork, rice, beans, a generous stack of corn tortillas to wrap your own, lettuce, tomatoes, limes, and two big slices of avocado. He was really happy. 

I had the vegetarian burrito ($5.95) with added avocado (85 cents), which had to much cheese for my taste, but I ate it all anyway because it was so dang goooood. I put a big dollop of salsa and hot sauce (in the green bottle at each table) on each wonderful bite. 

We will be coming back here for sure. A couple next to us were each scooping a salsa-looking cold soup out of these giant mugs--I want to try that next time. Not sure what to ask for, but they made it look delicious and refreshing.
