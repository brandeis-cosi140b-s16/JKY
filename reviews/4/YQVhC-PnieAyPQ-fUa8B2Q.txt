We had the veggie burrito which had potato, beans, grilled veggies and maybe cheese. It was very good though. Out whole meal with one burrito and chips and guacamole was about 7.50 which is better than chipotle and you don't need to get chipotlaway (southpark reference). The Guac was good and creamy and had a good flavor. The burrito was big enough to feed us both with the chips. I would definitely go back.
