Yes it is a chain, but in my experience it is predictably good Mexican food.  Had drinks and appetizer's with my woman here this afternoon.  Sat in the bar and saw some football while we ate and drank.

She liked her margarita, and she is not easy to please.   Salsa was good.  Food was a B, but nothing wrong with that.

Clean.  Friendly, prompt service.  Looks like it's thick adobe-like walls would be cooling in the summer heat.  A bit pricey for what we got, but that's Snotsdale for you.
