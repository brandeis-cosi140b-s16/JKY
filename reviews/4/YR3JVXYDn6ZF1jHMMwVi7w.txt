Stopped by yesterday for some carry out to heat up later. Have to say the short ribs were amazing, the chicken was great, and the pork just OK. Topped Christmas style b/c the Hub prefers red sauce to my green - but this time we both switched teams. I found the red to be smooth, smokey, and complex - while the green was grainy and piquant with less kick than advertised - but he loved it. Liked the combo corn/flour tortilla the kid behind the counter recommended. Have to say at 4:30, the product in line pans were looking a little tired. Be nice if they were scraped down and cleaned up. Felt like it was lunch leftovers before the night rush. Which, at the proper temp is NP, it's just a mental/marketing thing...

Hey did anyone notice SOUP? Totally missed it in the 'experience'. Next time.
