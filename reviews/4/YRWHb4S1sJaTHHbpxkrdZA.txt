Really good, i give them 4 stars because the salsas (you have to pay for them) are not good, i still can't believe they charge for them and they are not even good.
The food was good and the margaritas are ok.
My husband got the lobster tostadas, he said they were amazing but the size is  a 1 bite tostadita. We made fun of him all night about his "tostadas".
I will go back but next time i know not to order the salsas and to get my husband tostadas as appetizer and not as the main dish.
