It's a small grocery store & eatery. The tacos always hit the spot. Pozole (pork & hominy soup) on the weekends is a special treat. I like mine with plenty of lime & cilantro. Horchatas are huge & there are refills. The storefront & the interior are small and not necessarily clean looking. But the food is fantastic & Alejandro is super nice. There are a few tables/chairs if you want to eat in. The tv is usually on quite loud. I've come here many times with friends & had many fond memories over shared meals.
