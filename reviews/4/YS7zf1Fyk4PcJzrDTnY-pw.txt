A good Mexican place on the strip that isn't too fancy or expensive.

We always enjoy the chips and salsa. The chips are really good on their own.

Everyone at our table ordered a taco plate and it was just the right amount of food. The tacos al pastor came with 4 mini tacos and rice & beans. I am usually not a fan of the rice & beans, but at Isla they were really good. 

The only complaint was that the hotel let one of those photo companies come into the restaurant and made our group pose for awkward photos for what seemed like an eternity. Then tried to sell us photos when we were done eating. It was awful.
