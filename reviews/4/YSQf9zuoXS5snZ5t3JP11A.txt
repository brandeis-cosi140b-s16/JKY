My coworkers and I have eaten here for over a year now and have never had the problems listed above.   Frankly, I was stunned to read about them.  If you like your food piping hot and portions that leave you feeling more than full  AND you like high quality food then this is the place for you.  FOR RECORD, I do not, nor have I ever worked for Don Ruben's restaurant nor do I even know the owners or workers.   I am however, as soon as I am done writing this going to pick up 3 dozen tamales for Christmas.   BTW, try the Chicken Nachos and then tell me you did not get your moneys worth.  Go ahead, I dare ya.  :-)
