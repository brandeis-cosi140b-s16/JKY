My family and I have been to rio Rico's many times. Every time I'm pleased. I have lived in AZ all my life and I've had a lot of Mexican food. I like it. A lot of Mexican restaurants are pretty much the same to me. The only difference ends up being how crazy and loud the decorations and music are. Rio Rico's is nice and quiet and the service is good and the food is good. They don't knock my socks off but they are reasonably priced and I keep coming back even with all the many options around here.
