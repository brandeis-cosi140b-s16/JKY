Isabel's Amor is the first restaurant I visited in Phoenix while I was on my recent vacation.  Being closer to the border, I was wondering what an improvement on their Mexican food over Utah's would bring.  The selections were definitely different, however, I wouldn't label this "authentic" Mexican - more of a Texmex, or what I refer to as "clean" Mexican.  This is an alright thing, actually.  The food was not greasy at all, the selection of four different kinds of salsa made my tastebuds happy (although still not as delicious as Cantina's in Sandy, UT), and everything was delicious.  
I had the Mexican street corn and, although not what I thought it was, it was delicious!  My friends enjoyed their burritos...I think all of them had lunch burritos.  I'm not a bean girl, so I steered cleared of those (and my friends later that day - zing!).  
Our waiter was great - he picked up on the sarcastic nature of one of our girls early on and matched her pacing, which lead to a lot of laughs from the group.  Well played, sir!  We sat outside and he turned the heaters on for us when our table became shaded from the sun.  he kept our drinks full and area clean.
Thanks, Isabel's for a great experience in Phoenix.
