Diego was great, a crowd pleasure. Pricey (average for Las Vegas) but everyone left happy, full, and buzzed. 

I made reservations for 10 for a work group back in November. There was a convention at the MGM Grand so the restaurant was constantly busy. Even with our big party, the service was so good! The food was excellent. 

Choosing a restaurant for a group that includes (and will be paid for by) your boss and your boss' boss can be a super stressful. From the moment we entered this place I was put at ease. It pleased everyone, even the ridiculously picky people. 

If you are staying at the MGM, I would go here.
