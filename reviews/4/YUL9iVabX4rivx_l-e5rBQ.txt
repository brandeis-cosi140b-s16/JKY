My boy LOVES this place, and I must say it is good. 

On my MmmMMmmm (yum list): 
~margaritas - tasty and strong (for me!)
~guacamole
~chicharrones
~Pork Platter (I think the pork dishes might have been a special of some sort, sooooo tender...mmmmm)
~Pork Stew

Also heard the Adovada Ribs are delicious. 

Extra plus! The decor! It's absolutely colorful and crazy and bright. 

Only negative I can think of is there is one guy that works here who has major attitude -- He really shouldn't be working in a people-oriented establishment if he hates them so. But then the rest of the staff were so very friendly and lovely and helpful. 

Three cheers for Los Dos Molinos! 

Oh, and if you like spicy, you've come to the right place. :)
