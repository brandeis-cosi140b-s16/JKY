Tired of the breakfast sandwich routine, I stopped at this Don Tortaco location on Saturday morning to get a breakfast burrito. It was very filling and exactly what I expected. It was massive and filled with eggs, cheese, sausage and potatoes. Piping hot and very satisfying. 

The menu isn't as extensive as other similar places but they have the typical taco shop goodies. The place is very clean and the salsa bar is well stocked. I love that they have an agua fresca fountain which has HORCHATA. Mexican food + horchata is the way to go. I don't like having to go up to the counter to ask for a refill so this is definitely a plus. They get an extra star for that. Check out their specials board for some great deals.
