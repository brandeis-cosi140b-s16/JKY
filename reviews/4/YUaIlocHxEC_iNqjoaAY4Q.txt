Welcome to Moe's! A place where you get exactly what you expect (and deserve): quick service and tasty food at a reasonable price. As a bonus, there are plenty of add-on toppings to choose from, and when you order to go they load you up with an indigestible quantity of tortilla chips. The salsa bar is another strong point, where you can get as much as you like of eight dips - some regulars and others that rotate (this week I enjoyed the cucumber pineapple salsa).
