We go here often for an after-church lunch. There are several families who go, and some of the kids don't like the food here, but Rubio's is kind enough to let us bring in food from other restaurants. This is a huge point in their favor.

The food is quite good, really. I love the fish tacos, and the chipotle salsa is fabulous! The service is efficient. I love the decor-lots of blues and greens, but it is a chain, so it's not really artsy or surprising.

All in all, a nice place for a good meal!
