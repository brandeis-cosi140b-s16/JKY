I tried this place a few months ago with some coworkers and it was good. It wasn't something that I would crave often, but it was good to say the least. With it  being my first time, I did feel like it was overwhelming with the many options to choose from (plus it was around lunch). I ended up getting the 2 enchiladas with cornbread and chicken. I thought the cornbread was going to be weird, but it was good and different. I will try to go back soon to explore more options.
