Ive seriously been thinking about  Tee Pee's nachos since eating here Saturday night.  We ordered the chile rellanos and did not touch it because we were too busy cleaning the plate of nachos!  The margaritas were alright, but the service was phenomenal, everyone was super friendly.  Did I mention how great the nachos were?
