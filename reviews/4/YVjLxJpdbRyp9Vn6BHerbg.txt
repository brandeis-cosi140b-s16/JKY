I decided to swing by here one Sunday morning to get a breakfast burrito to split with my husband. I went through the drive-thru since I was still in my pajamas. The lady that helped me was chipper but not annoyingly so. 
I ordered a potato, egg and cheese burrito with pico de gallo on the side. Plus a large horchata. The burrito was perfect, I hate when the cheese isn't melted all of the way and this cheese was. 

Total damage was $6. Not bad at all, I will definitely be back.
