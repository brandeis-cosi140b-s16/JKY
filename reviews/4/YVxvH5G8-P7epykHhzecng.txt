I went to Ninfa's a few weeks ago with two other couples. The staff was fun and friendly and our waitress was great. The Margaritas were very tasty. Not too strong and they won't give you heart burn w/ cheap sour mix.  The food was very good. It's compettitively priced but overall a nice experience.
