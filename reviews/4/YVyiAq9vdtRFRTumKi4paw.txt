I had the caminero chicken burrito, my 3 year old had a bean and cheese and my husband and 16 year old step-son had the caminero shredded beef; ALL were amazing! Tasty beans, tender, flavorful meat and fresh ingredients. Even though we're in Arizona, these burritos took me right back home to California-style burritos. If you're in the mood for Mexican and need something delicious and fast, this is he place to go! Better than Filibertos and Federicos.
