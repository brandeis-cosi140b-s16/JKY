I'm stopped by here twice for lunch in the past two days. I got really delicious food for a good price. Both the chorizo breakfast burrito and machaca with eggs was really good. You can get the machaca burrito with fried eggs, potatoes or plain. I got the egg and it was delicious! 

Definitely divey, but good food for a good price.
