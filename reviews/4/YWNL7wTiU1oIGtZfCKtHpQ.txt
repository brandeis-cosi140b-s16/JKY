When I walked in I was greeted promply and asked how I heard about the restaurant. I told her my car was a few doors down getting some maintenance done and I just happened to walk by. The owner told me this place just opened a week ago (04/08/11) The place is well decorated and has a huge TV hanging on one wall, the music is traditional mexican which complements the bright colors and Mexican decor. This is a great place for lunch, late breakfast or dinner, reasonably priced, good food and service with a smile.
