This is a great place to eat! Amazing rice I have to start with I feel over the years I have become a rice snob, thinking Mexican restaurants did not put enough thought into my favorite side dish. They have great red rice!! And the atmosphere is truly a mom and pop simple super casual environment, what do you want in Maricopa Az lol
I have to say the food is really really good, I have eaten here many time and have never been dissapointed, from the pork chile verde to the           Las conchas! Delicious!!
