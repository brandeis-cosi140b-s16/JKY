I wasn't really expecting much. Being from SoCal I consider myself a bit of a taco shop snob/aficionado. Most of the time the beans taste canned, the meat is terrible, tortillas are chewy, and aftershocks from bad food occur.

It was a pleasant surprise that a decent taco shop is now in the neighborhood. I had my standard bean and cheese burrito (extra cheese) and a chicken taco. My wife had the same except her burrito was wet and she got a beef taco. The bean burritos were excellent. Beans tasted great, cheese was good, and the tortillas weren't terribly chewy (just a little). My chicken taco was okay. The meat was great quality but didn't have much flavor, I definitely would not order it again. The sauce on my wife's burrito had great flavor. Her beef taco was really good and the meat was tender and tasted great.

Overall this was a good dining experience. The prices were right and I would definitely eat here again. They have daily specials so keep an eye out for those.
