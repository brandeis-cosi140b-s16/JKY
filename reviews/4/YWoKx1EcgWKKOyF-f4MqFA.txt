This is classic Americanized Mexican food... super cheesy, mostly fried, and fully delicious. They start you with chips and 2 salsas - green and red, which are both mild and kind of sweet. Now, if you ask for it, you can get a tasty 'hot' salsa, which I liked much better than either of the original salsas. I had a cheese crisp and beef taquitos. The cheese crisp was more crispy and more cheesy than most.... it was a fabulous thing. The taquitos were fairly average, but also covered in melty cheese... overall, nothing special, but tasty. The husband enjoyed his bean and cheese burrito. The bill was under 20$... can't complain about that!
