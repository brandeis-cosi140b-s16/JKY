Not so much for the atmosphere, but definitely for the service and food.

Our waiter was awesome -- he walked us through the menu, suggesting his favorite meats, and letting us know which dishes were award-winning (hint: the quesadillas!!).

I went with the mushroom quesadillas, my dining buddies went with a pork quesadilla and what I believe was the green mole pork.  Everything was fresh, delicious, and piping hot!  

Amazing horchata, and "orange water."  And when my dad ran out to get cash -- this joint it CASH ONLY -- they waited to bring out his entree.
