Sand between my toes...tents with TVs...I don't care if it's by heavy traffic near the 101, this place knows how to deliver in the atmosphere department.

At night, Sandbar is a dance club. Not my type of scene, but despite the narrow space, this place gets packed. Yes, there will be some cute airheads. Pop your collar and walk right in!

During the day is when this place really shines. The $2 beers from 3-7 every day, along with the $5 appetizers is just great. Between slamming some Dos Equis, my friends and I enjoyed some miniature chimis and some tasty calamari. Their appetizers come out so fast, I almost had to question if they were made in advance. They were far too hot for that!

There are some entrees on the menu, but I'm sure they're on part with Chili's or a similar restaurant chain. Nothing about the food is fancy, but it won't be gross, either. This is as close to the beach as you're gonna get in this Phoenix.
