I like this place! The staff is nice, the facility is clean and the food is authentic. It is not just gloopy 'mexican' food on the plate, there is presentation and some good composition dishes, not just taco, burrito, enchilada combinations. The restrooms are spotless and the bartender is knowledgeable. The only reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have not eaten enough dishes (i'm hooked on the chimichangas) to give the 5th star. Now they serve aguas frescas & have daily drink specials. Would recommend you to try them out!
