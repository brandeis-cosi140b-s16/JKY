Don't be frightened by the outside, or the dining room. This place has authentic Mexican food, the chicken tacos are great! The hot sauce is even better! I haven't had food like this since I was in Mexico. The staff is super friendly, and eager to serve! We will be back! 

If they clean up the place a bit I would  have given 5 stars.
