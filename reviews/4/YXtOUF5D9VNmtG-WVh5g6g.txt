I love El Pollo Loco! The people who work there are so nice. I'm so picky with my the way I order my bowl and they get it right every time.  The inside is kept tidy and clean.     
The tostada salad bowl is amazing.  It comes with rice, beans, lettuce, cheese, pico de gayo, sour cream, and chicken.  If you don't want something on your bowl, you can ask for it to be on the side, or not on at all.  They make a creamy cilantro dressing which tastes really good with the salad.  Along the side, next to the drink fountain, there is a salsa bar.  I usually get the rojo salsa and the spicy avocado salsa.  I love an extra kick in my food.  Another item I like to order is the churro.  Totally reminds me of growing up in S. Cali. every theme park I had gone to, I had to have a churro. 

I like to come here once in a while to quench my craving for the tostada bowl.  I guess you can say estoy loca por El Pollo Loco :)
