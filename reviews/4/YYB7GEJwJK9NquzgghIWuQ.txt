I was contacted by San Felipe's marketing and management team after my poor experience, and I gave them two more tries to make sure it was not a fluke. Had a great time both times, saw the poor bartender again, just managed to avoid him, my waitress (sarah the first night, I can't remember the second one, was a cool dude at the bar) was awesome. Saw some live music, enjoyed some drinks, very fun. As long as I can avoid that one guy, I will keep coming back!
