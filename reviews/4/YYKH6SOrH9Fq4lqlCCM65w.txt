We have been fans of the mulitas for years. Small corn tortillas filled quesadiila style, with queso, your choice of meat and an avocado slice, griddled. The salsa bar has great pico de gallo and pickled jalapenos and carrots.
Just tried the chile verde burrito last week and it is awesome and huge. Great green chile flavor and loved it.
