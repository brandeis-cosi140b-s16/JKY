The Yelpers were right. This place is good. I got the chicken chimichanga and it was very good. The salsa is the kind you get in Mexico, not the pico de gallo we eat in the US. The prices rarely go over $7 for a large plate of food. Really nothing to complain about. Definitely recommend it. Although it's not a real nice sit-down restaurant. Probably the kind of place you order and leave, or you eat in like 15 minutes and go.
