I'm a big fan of Mexican food , but all i tried is Americanised- Mexican food , couple of my Mexican friends took me to this place and I liked the food .. This is closest real Mexican food I ever had and I appreciate this restaurant .. I had a fountain drink - Jamaica and Sopes - it was good I enjoyed my lunch !!
