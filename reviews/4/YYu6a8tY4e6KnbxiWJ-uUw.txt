Mmm Roberto's Carne Asada Nachos..... mmm rolls taquitos with fresh guacamole!!!! I've been to many Roberto's but since my store is in the diagonal shopping center I decided to give this one a try. My bf, friends and I went there late at night, around 11:30pm and it had a decent crowd. The food is a bit salty, but the meat is very well seasoned! I love the carrots & jalape√±os they have sliced, it has the perfect amount of spiciness. The carne asad nachos & fries are perfect for a group of friends who want a full filling snack ;)

The only reason why I give this place a 4 was because the bathrooms were kinda dirty~
