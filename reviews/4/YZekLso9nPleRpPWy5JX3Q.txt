Tasty tasty tasty! Good margarita for only $3.50 on Saturdays! Chorizo and cheese dip to start was amazing with a ton of chorizo. Kid's quesadilla was nice and served with a heap of rice. Choripollo for husband was huge and delicious (much bigger and with more chorizo than Emiliano's). My Pollo con crema was good and a great big portion. It was a little bland but I think that was due to not knowing anything about the dish and assuming that it would be spicier. All in all, a great place.
