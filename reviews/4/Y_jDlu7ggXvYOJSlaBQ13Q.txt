So how good could a Mexican restaurant be if it's open 24/7 and shares a wall with a giant strip club? In the case of this place, amazing. We had dinner here our first night in Vegas and it was great. The waiter was attentive and enthusiastic about the menu. When I asked about the sweetness of the tamarind agua fresca, he brought be a taster. The highlight of the meal was the grasshoppers cooked in garlic and lime. Highly recommend!
