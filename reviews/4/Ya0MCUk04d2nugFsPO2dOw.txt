For anyone who is a fan of Mexican food- you must try Los Dos Molinos.

I LOVE spicy food, and it's hard for me to find a place that has salsa that is spicy enough for my taste buds...

that is until I found this amazing place.

Their salsa is not for the faint of heart- so beware- also no free refills on the salsa, but it's worth paying extra for, in my opinion.

The margaritas are yummy- they don't douse it in sweet and sour mix and lime juice.

Service is not great but not horrible either. I just go for the food- which is what restaurants should be about anyways.
