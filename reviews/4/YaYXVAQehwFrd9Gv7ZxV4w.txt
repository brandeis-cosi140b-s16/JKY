I really enjoy Caramba's! It is kind of a cross between fast food and a real sit down type of restaurant.  Their beef chimi is my favorite, and it actually comes with sour cream and guacamole. Their tacos are also worth giving a try too. 

I have been to 3 different Caramba's locations in the valley and this is probably the nicest one I have been to. I also really like the one in central Glendale, because it is the original. The food is honestly about the same no matter which one you go to, but each one is set up a little different.

The cool thing about this location is they have a larger, nicer, and more up to date bar area. Plus the food here is way better then other similar restaurants  in the area.
