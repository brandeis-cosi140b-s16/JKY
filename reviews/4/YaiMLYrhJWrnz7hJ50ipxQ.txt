I heard great things about Moe's from my friends on the East Coast, so I decided to try it for lunch. 

It's pushed all the way at the edge of Downtown Summerlin. The location is large. It's a little dark and the trays were very sticky, but it was about what you would expect. 

I got a chicken burrito with lettuce, rice, and jalapeños. I enjoyed the option of having fresh jalapeños, and it added just the right amount of heat. They serve tortilla chips with it, which is a nice touch. 

The salsa bar was a great option. I wish they had a spicier tomatillo, but I found that I actually enjoyed my burrito more without the salsa -- surprising for me.

Overall, I would definitely come back. It's about on the level of Chipotle for me.
