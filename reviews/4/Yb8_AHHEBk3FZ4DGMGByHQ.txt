Yummy food. If you want the real thing, eat here. The food is awesome and the salsa bar is fantastic. Don't be shocked when you pull in to the parking lot. It looks awfully scary given the building and surrounding neighborhood. The service is good but this is not a high-end establishment. It is a taco shop in the ghetto. HOWEVER... it is one of my favorite go-to spots when I'm in Phoenix. They have a fantastic selection of meats even though I always go with a bean/cheese burrito. You can eat indoor or outside and of course always have the option to watch Mexican soap operas while you dine. LOL. The best way to gauge a restaurant is to look at the line out the door. La Salsita's always has a steady stream of people coming through. That should tell you something.
