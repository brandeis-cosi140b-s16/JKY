I've always wandered into this location right as the lunch rush picks up. However, I never had a problem finding a table. Sure, the line can get pretty long, but you are watching your tortilla and basically your whole meal, be assembled right in front of you. Their employees have been fast and friendly. They should offer a class during non business hours to learn how to make tortillas. Their chicken is juicy (I always order a chicken quesadilla), their beans and rice fresh and flavorful. Thumbs up to their Horchata too, my all time favorite.

Tip: To save time, you can order and pay ahead, as they have a separate to go/call in line available. 

Their kids free cheese quesadilla is the perfect size for littler guys. Ole!
