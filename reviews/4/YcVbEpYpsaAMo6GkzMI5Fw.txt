I'm surprised this place isn't more popular. It's a bit more expensive than campus-favorite Dos Reales, but it is worth it. I personally love the tacos. The meat is delicious and wonderfully spicy and the tortillas are homemade. I highly recommend the chorizo. 

Dine-in is marred by the presence of a TV set to annoying Univision shows, so consider take-out.
