this filiberto's is clean, newer, and serves up some quality mexican food. i like the breakfast burritos, especially the steak and egg, at any time of day (or night). hot sauce isn't watered down. the rice is super good. staffers are pretty friendly here too. solid location that doesn't smell. 4 stars.
