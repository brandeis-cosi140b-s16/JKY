Nice neighborhood sports bar.  Good drink specials.  The food is nothing to write home about, but not bad, either.  It pairs up with an OTB section connected to it.  Not a huge place, so it can get crowded with the after-work, before dinner crowd...

The bartenders are very nice.  Plenty of tv's to watch the day's action.  My only issue is that the clientelle can get pretty loud and obnoxious, so I would not bring children...
