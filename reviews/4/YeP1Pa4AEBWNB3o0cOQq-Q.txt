Mexican food chains tend towards "all the same with a different name."  That's where Ninfa's stands out.  Definitely not the same old!

We had marinated flank steak fajitas in Houston a few years ago and loved them.  So you know what we tried here.  Damn good - maybe not quite as good as our Texas experience, because this steak had a line of gristle running through.  But we'll do it again.

All the other reviewers are right - nice place, well-trained emplyees, clean, great food.  So why not 5 stars?  I don't know....I'll just have to try it again.
