Great place! went there this morning for a chorizo and egg burrito and they knocked it out of the park. The burrito came out hot and the cheese was perfectly melted. It wasn't this fake cheese that you get at all these other places that is so greasy. This was quality. The taste was perfect. I also tried a street taco(carne asada) was very tasty and meat was seasoned just right and moist. I spoke to Noah and his daughter who handles the orders and counter service, she was very polite and knowledgeable of the menu. Good friendly service and prices very fair. If you haven't done so, you need to try this place out for yourself.
