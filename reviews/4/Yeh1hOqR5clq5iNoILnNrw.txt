The crowd is a on the older side...they have pretty good drink specials during the week....a 3 dollar blue moon is hard to find these days lol....the service is good and fast. Although one server got a little mad that people actually blog about service haha. 

I also learned if you tip the bartender good they might "forget" to charge for a drink or 2 ; )
