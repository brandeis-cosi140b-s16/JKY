I have always loved Tortas and had been wanting to try out this place. First of all,  the service was exceptional and I felt like I was actually in Mexico. The food came super fast and it was delicious! The potato chips, however were not homemade as I've had in other Torta restaurants. That is the only reason I didn't give them five stars. Overall, I enjoyed my lunch. I ate the Mexican Torta (mini) perfect portion size and adequately priced. I will be back for more!
