I went here this past Sunday afternoon after reading a bunch of reviews on Yelp.

The place wasn't terribly crowded when my girlfriend and I arrived, and we had the option of sitting either at the bar or at one of the small tables (we sat at a table).  The two guys who seemed to be running the place were both very nice and friendly.  

I ordered the chicken enchiladas and eggs and my girlfriend ordered the turkey rellenos and eggs.  I absolutely loved my dish and thought it was a great value for the price ($12).  I was less enthusiastic about the rellenos, but that is because I'm just not a fan of rellenos generally.  I would generally describe our meals as "brunch with a kick," which is exactly what we were looking for.  

The only reason that I might be reluctant to come here again is that I am new to the area and I just like to try different places for the sake of trying different places.  Also, it's about a 20 minute drive from Tempe;  as someone previously living in  DC, i am more used to walking to the places i want to eat.  But if i lived nearby i would probably go every week.
