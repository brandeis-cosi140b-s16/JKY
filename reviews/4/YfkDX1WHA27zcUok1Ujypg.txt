This place does not have the best food in town. What it does have is food that always feels homemade like it just came out of a moms kitchen. The yellow mole has big chunks of potatoes and carrots, the chorizo is good and the dark mole is great to sop up with warm flour tortillas. The service has always been sweet, the place never crowded. I will keep going back.
