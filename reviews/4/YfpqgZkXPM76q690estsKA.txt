This little down home place was recommended by the manager from the White House thrift store. We were down in Avondale and happened to drive through old Avondale that has a few places worth stopping for. The food was very good, I ordered the beef chimichanga with guacamole and sour cream and it came with rice and beans. They have lunch specials and all the dishes are reasonable. Not fancy, but the food was delicious and our server was warm and helpful. So if in the area check it out.
