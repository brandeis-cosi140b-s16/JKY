Supposedly this place is a big deal. Luckily, on a random weekday, there was no wait. The hostess is dressed in a ... errrrr ... festive fashion (I'm glad my hostessing days are over. And never required a uniform.)
The menu is extensive. Seriously, any place that has more than five dishes with lengua is a winner in my book. The wait staff was alert and prompt. The food was delicious and of large enough portions so that I had enough for a second meal (did I mention I love leftovers?). 
The best part, though, was the margaritas. Absolutely delicious and come in two sizes. I got the regular size which already looked huge, but then I had two so maybe I could've pulled off the large size. Though I was admittedly quite drunk after my two margaritas; tequila tends to sneak up on me like that. 
Their happy birthday is quite festive and involves what appeared to be a mariachi band; I would enjoy bringing someone who is embarrassed by public announcements of their birthday to this place.
