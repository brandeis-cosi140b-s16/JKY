If you get excited by standing in line to get a number and then standing or sitting around again for your number to be called by a guy on the other side of a barred counter in places like the MVD you will absolutely fall in love with the place.  The rest of you will have to go for the food.  Which fortunately is quite good.  I had a red chile and bean burrito, enchilada style and it was very good.  Nice big chunks of tender beef, a little bit of heat, one of the best red chile meals I have had.  Only open from 11 to 6 Tuesday trough Friday with another sign that says to call for hours this place stays packed.  There are several tables to eat inside but most folks were take out and many took several bags of food with them which may be why things seem to move so slow.  Bring cash.
