My son and I split the Chicken Fajitas. Instead of all the ingredients coming separately on an iron platter, they came all mixed together in an iron skillet. The grilled chicken strips were in a stew of cooked red peppers and onions with pico de gallo, shredded cheddar and sour cream on top. Nothing wrong with this, unless you are my son and don't want your grilled chicken mixed in with these things. Despite the mismatched expectations, it was a good dish. The fajitas came with delicious black beans and a bright-tasting corn and rice mix. 

We also had the Mexican Chopped salad. My wife and I both thought it was delicious, but there was more salad dressing than necessary. My daughter thought it was too spicy.
