Good Stuff... thick handmade corn tortillas, tasty salsa, $2 Coronas, friendly service.
things started out pretty good.. and quickly got better
I ordered a Molcajete. chicken, carne asada, chorizo, nopal (cactus) grilled then served in a hot stone bowl with salsa, guacamole, beans, and tortillas
A lot of food, a lot of flavor... 
I can't wait to try the Mole. it looked fantastic heading to another table
Worth a look
