I was in the area for a meeting and had time for a quick lunch. Found it on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I was greeted and seated quickly. Chips and salsa were pretty good - had a chicken chimichanga, which was good. Prices were reasonable. The service was mediocre - the server was working really hard, but it seemed like he may have been responsible for a few too many tables. It took a bit of time to get refills and the check, but it wasn't a huge deal. I am from New Mexico, so Mexican food in Arizona is always a bit different, but this is definitely a solid choice for some decent food. I would return if in the area again.
