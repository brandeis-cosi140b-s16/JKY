A great, newly remodeled lunch place for us state employees!  I was surprised to see such a nice looking restaurant in this area....maybe because I eat at my desk, maybe because the area is shady.  The menu has your regular mexican items, which means refried beans to yours truly.  That's okay, because I got a bean and cheese burrito and was happy to see it not smothered in melted cheese and a ton of sauce.  Although I'm sure you can get it that way if you'd like.  The chips and 2 salsa's were delicious, service was fast for a busy lunch crowd.  

The inside looks really modern, without the cheap and cheesy looking mexican decor.  They have lots of space, and it's very clean.  Will definitely be back - hopefully for happy hour to try the margaritas!
