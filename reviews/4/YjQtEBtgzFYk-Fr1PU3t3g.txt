Great find - thanks Yelp! The food was delicious and the guy who took my order was really nice. The Carne Asada burrito combo was my menu item of choice for dinner. The burrito was excellent, but the rice and beans were only ok. I did like that there was a guy out front grilling so you know the meat is fresh. Since I was by myself as a female I didn't feel comfortable staying there to eat alone so I took it to go. It probably would've been fine, but there wasn't much else around it that was open.
