I'm a regular. Love their green corn tamales and their taco basket is good. I go to the cantina to meet up with friends and enjoy happy hour. Always relaxed and can watch the game and talk with friends. Prompt service and good drinks. The "lake" nearby provides a good atmosphere. I love Mexican food but wouldn't say this is the greatest Mexican you'll ever have but pretty decent. I come from New Mexico, so I'm hard to please.
