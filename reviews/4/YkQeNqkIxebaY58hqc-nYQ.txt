I have dined here a few times and each time I do, I hope it survives (as many restaurants don't...even good ones). The decor is colorful, bright, and vibrant. The staff is friendly, and the food is good. For me it's more authentic and much more flavorful than many of the chain restaurants in the Phoenix area.
