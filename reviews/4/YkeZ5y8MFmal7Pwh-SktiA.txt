Pretty nice little hole in the wall Mexican joint. Conveniently situated next to Home Depot its out of the way and real easy to miss. But if you come to HD for a ladder or paint or whatever, and happen to be hungry then this little place is for you.

Do not expect anything fancy or special but i do not think you will be disappointed. Give it s shot, it will not cost you much either.
