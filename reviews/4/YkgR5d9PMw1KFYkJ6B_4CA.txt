The prices here are decent, my boyfriend ordered 2 carne asada tacos, chips and salsa. I had the al pastor fries. I love how they use nacho cheese on the fries. I didn't give then 5 stars because the al pastor meat was super dry and a bit hard. Overall the food was great and our order was under $20!!
