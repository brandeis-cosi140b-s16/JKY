We come to Michoacan frequently.  The service is always solid - every server is always very polite.  Their menu is extensive - they have a pretty wide range of items.  My husband loves their seafood soup.  I usually stick with my Mexican food standby of enchiladas.  Am giving them a 4 because Their enchilada sauce (red sauce) could use some more spunk.  It's not super flavorful.  We love the cups of Fideo soup they give with each meal.  It's such a simple soup, but we think it's nutritious.  The chips, salsa & bean dip is good.  We also like how the place is decorated.
