I like this place. We just ate there last night. Yum! I got a burrito enchilada stye (totally key if you want it in red sauce with tons of extra cheese :)) I got a bean and cheese burrito. They don't use lard in their beans for any of you vegetarians out there (vegetable oil they claim) and they were good. My hubby got the guacamole burrito with chicken and really enjoyed it. This place is definitely worthy or a return visit. The staff was nice and service was prompt. Plus, we had dinner for the two of us for $19 prior to tip -- which isn't bad for getting waited on :)
