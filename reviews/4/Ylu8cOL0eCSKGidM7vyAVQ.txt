Carne asda burrito, the staple of my Roberto's eating, they really do make a good one, just as long as the meat is cooked fresh. They do have a nasty habit of cooking the meat in batches, then leaving it in a pot to stay arm, this results in dried out meat, so just keep an eye on it.

The one thing these guys do badly is the carne asda fries, the premise is great junk food, fries, carne asda meat, all the toppings, but they never seam to be able to cook the fries, they are always almost raw, which results in me having to have them made again....
