Barrio Urbano has fantastic food! Hands down, the best. I always get a different dish every time I go and I have yet to be disappointed. If you go, definitely request Doug as your server. He is very friendly, helpful and got us our food very quickly. I have been very pleased with my experience at this restaurant so far and would recommend it to anyone that is looking for an excellent, authentic Mexican food cuisine. The ambience of the Yard is awesome and provides for a fun and exciting atmosphere. After dinner at Barrio make your way into the Yard for a night of games. Definitely the place to be on a Saturday night.
