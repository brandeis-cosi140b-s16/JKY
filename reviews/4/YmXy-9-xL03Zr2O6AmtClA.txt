For a little strip mall, fast food restaraunt, Enchiladas is the real deal. Initially skeptical, we traded our usual trip to Giants Burgers to try Enchiladas. Authentic Mexican food. Not a culinary adventure by any means but well worth a stop to get an authentic home style type dish. The Menudo is well done. Tamales are actually pretty decent. Tacos are good. The chilaquilles are awesome! Mom and pop shop. Nothing fancy but clean eatery.
