So excited for another Mexican food place to open in my hood. Coke products, check. Awesome salsa/hot sauce, check. Tasty bean & cheese burritos & quesadillas, check. Hubby is loving the variety of their menu, which includes lengua tacos & meatball soup (as you can probably tell, he's a little more adventurous with his food than I am), and he loved both. The prices are a little high IMHO, but otherwise 2 thumbs up.
