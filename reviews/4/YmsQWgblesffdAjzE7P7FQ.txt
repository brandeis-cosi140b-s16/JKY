Came here for the first time last weekend.... our server was very friendly and accommodating.  We had a small dog with us, which they allowed on the patio.  I ordered a regular margarita on the rocks, some bean dip, and the carne asada burrito.  The salsa they put on the table with the chips was outstanding.  (I assume they make it in house).  My margarita was meh, ok.  I am not a fan of super sweet and it was on the sweet side.  I am assuming they use a mix there, and not fresh lime juice :( I didn't care for the bean dip.. the carne asada burrito was delicious, just needed more meat in my opinion.  The ratio of tortilla to meat was up there.  We also ordered sopapillas for dessert at the end of the meal.  I was NOT a fan.  The cinnamon and sugar were half assed sprinkled on there and not coated completely.  Tasted like a bland donut... save for the honey packets they served us.  Honey PACKETS?? lol.  Overall it was meh.  I gave it 4 stars though cause our server was really nice :)
