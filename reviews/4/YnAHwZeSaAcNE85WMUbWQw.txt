This location gets pretty packed at lunchtime during the week.  But that goes the same for every Chipotle I've ever been to. The staff here has a good system down, it might just be me but I prefer efficiency over someone chatting me up.  The line can be wrapped to the door and I know I will still be through the line in no time.  Plenty of seating (indoor and outdoor) to accommodate all those people as well.

The only gripe I have is the parking, it can be pretty cutthroat at times.  I've given up before and just parked at PetSmart before.  After discovering a calorie counter online I've ditched the tortilla on my burrito and just said no to sour cream.  Saved me about 500 calories!
