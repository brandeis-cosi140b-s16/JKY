I guess I have never reviewed CFMF. 

We have been long time fans of all the locations. You know you can get a good Breakfast lunch or dinner here. 

Today we had 2 kids meals, I am trying to eat less for dinner. 

One was bean and cheese burrito and one was chicken taco. Both were excellent. Child 2 said it was better then Filberto's, Roberto's etc. WOW She is a bean connoisseur. 

The taco meal was good, It came with Rice and beans as a side. Perfect amount of food with out stuffing yourself. 

Best part it was less then $10 for 2 meals. Holla
