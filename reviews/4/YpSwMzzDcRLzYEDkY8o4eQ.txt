Seriously the best upscale Mexican/American food I've ever had. I grew up in San Diego and I was interested to see how this would match up to authentic cuisine and it rocked my socks. The chef lived in Oaxaca for several years and what he brought back was pure bliss. Favorite dishes are the chilaquiles verdes and carne asada quesadilla. Oh and the place is stunning. Great job Sabor!
