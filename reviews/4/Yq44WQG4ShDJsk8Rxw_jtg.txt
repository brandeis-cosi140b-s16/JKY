I will re try them .. Orig to Arizona as I can get. Salsa and different styles of salsa. There burritos very similar to AZ had one with chicken, cilantro, rice, beans if your craving carbs this is for shure the place.I will be triing some more of there traditional flair next time its defiantly worth a revisit.
