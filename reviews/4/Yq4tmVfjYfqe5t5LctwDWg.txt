I lucked out today.  There actually were outdoor tables free and only a couple of guys in front of me in line.  So, this is my first experience at Reyna's taco stand outside their grocery in the Strip District.  

I had 2 pork soft tacos with everything on them for $5.00.  That's a cheap meal and tasted exquisite!  What made then extra scrumptuous was the cilantro.  Oh, I love cilantro on my tacos!
