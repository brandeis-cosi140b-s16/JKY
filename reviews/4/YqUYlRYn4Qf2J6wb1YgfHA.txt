Qdoba is pretty simple, form a line, tell the dude what you want, he makes it and you eat it. Its like Subway for burritos. Awesome!

I usually like to go to Chipotle, but this Qdoba pulls me away. 
1. They move through he line with a quickness I have never seen before.
2. The staff is really friendly and they always at least act semi happy to are in their store. 
3. It's clean and has a nice patio i can chilax on while on a break from work.
4. They meat quality if better then other burrito places
5. They have more options. 
    two different kinds of veggies
    cheese sauce, high five!
    gumbo
    and a combo option so if you cant make up your mind between a quesadilla or 
          tacos, you can have both, or gumbo and a salad

Qdoba = winning!
