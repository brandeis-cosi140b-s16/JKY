I feel like a rookie for not knowing that Vida Cantina & "Vida Vida" are two separate restaurants. Thankfully someone showed me the error of my ways because Vida Vida is a great place for a quick and cheap Mexican lunch!

Per my server's recommendations I tried a Fried Chicken Taco & a Philly Cheesesteak Taco. He wasn't wrong, they were both pretty darn good. I think The Fried Chicken was probably the better of the two though ... the jalapeno bacon set it off! If you're feeling extra hungry, go for three. Ordered with a side (pretty small) of rice for only $.50 made it a complete meal. 

$6.50 for two pretty good size tacos and a side of rice is a great lunch value in my book, especially in Uptown and especially in Epicenter. I'll definitely be back here again!
