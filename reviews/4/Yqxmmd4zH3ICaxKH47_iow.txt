I always get the carne asada plate and its really good. Food is pretty much identical to Robertos, maybe slightly smaller portions. I usually choose this over Robertos because of their fast drive thru. No complaints here, decent Mexican food! 

I can't believe someone said they would choose Taco Bell over this place... I mean c'mon, really? haha No thanks!
