Stumbled upon this place while in ceasers looking through yelp. Bacchanal's 2+ hr line just didn't work out for us since we were trying to catch a show. 

So very pleasantly surprised with our choice.

They start you off with fresh homemade chips and 3 types of salsa, all very good but my favorite is probably the green 1; also got talked into the guacamole which was a really good choice( no this item came toward the end of the meal which was a little annoying). We got the Baja shrimp ceviche(a little bit sweeter than regular shrimp) and I have to say that's probably the best ceviche I've ever had anywhere including Mexico, the short rib enchiladas which are to die for, & a perfect desert with the sweet corn tamales for those that don't like their sweets too sweet. 

Got a few other items in our party but those are the ones I remember the most, only weird part is that appetizers don't seem to come when appetizers should, along with entrees and other stuff. Everything's a little bit all over the place.

Definitely a must try, so glad to have found out they have one back home in LA. All their flavors to all their dishes are like a party/club in your mouth!!!  can't wait to come again!
