This is my go to spot for lunch appointments and even dinner with my wife. It has a great local feel. Friendly staff, clean, and great tasting food. I can't get enough of the green tomatillo salsa. I recommend the salmon and shrimp tacos. The service isn't the best because all of the servers are young local kids with probably their first server job so they are learning. But that's part of what makes it a cool local place.
