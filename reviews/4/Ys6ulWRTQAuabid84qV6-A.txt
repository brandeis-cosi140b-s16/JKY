first visit here and my first success at having my autistic daughter eat a taco. she has a fear of lettuce and Backyard taco doesn't use lettuce but cabbage instead. we had chicken soft street tacos, carne asada tacos, and both in quesadellia form. The pico/salsa bar was tiny but delicious and the fresh lemonade was the best I've ever had. A bit expensive for my single mom budget (17.50 for 2, no desert) but hey it was Cinco de Mayo and we wanted to celebrate with some wicked good food. Not disappointed!  It was busy for dinner, but easy parking, quick order and production, and very clean.
