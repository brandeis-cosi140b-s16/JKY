My wife loves this place regardless of where we are, but I just don't have that same love for Chipotle as she does. LOL - Well, there was one down the street from where we were staying last week, so we stopped by for lunch. Their staff is very enthusiastic as they greet you with a huge hello, how are ya as soon as you enter the business. They menu is, of course, the same as all the others, but the black beans just tasted better than usual, for some reason. I just got the bowl with barbacoa to keep it safe because I've been known as a bit of a "Tortilla Snob"...haha, but this plate was very, very good. I was absolutely impressed with the taste of this dish and will definitely go back the next time we're in town visiting our daughter!
