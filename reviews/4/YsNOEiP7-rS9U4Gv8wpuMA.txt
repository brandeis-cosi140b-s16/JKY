First time here, came later at night (around 7) and we sat outside cause the weather is amazing. Awesome setting! Super nice people BUT we waited about 30 minutes for someone to take out order and then 20 minutes for the ticket and we only got a taco each.... We just say there waiting for almost an hour. Overall the tacos were delicious and we will definitely come back:):)
