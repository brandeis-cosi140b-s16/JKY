Went for lunch with 2 co-workers...food was excellent once again.  Lunch portions are sized really well.  I had the fish tacos lunch portion and was very satisfied with the amount of food.  

Our server, Adrian, was very knowledgable and made some excellent suggestions on meal choices that proved to be on point.  Food came out well prepared and in a timely manner.  

I would recommend anyone go there for lunch ASAP!
