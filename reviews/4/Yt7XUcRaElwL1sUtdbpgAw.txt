We go to lunch at Baja Loco every week. The staff always greets you and says bye as you leave and has remembered us since our just our first few visits. 

The daily specials are all pretty good. Two of our favorite items are the Chile Burro and the Grilled Shrimp Tacos. The Tri-tip beef is also good. And, you have to love the unlimited chips and salsa bar. 

The atmosphere is comfortable and casual and I just wish we didn't have to go back to work because the drinks are so affordable. PBR, baby!
