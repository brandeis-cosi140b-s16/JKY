After spending a fun day at the nearby Phoenix Zoo, I Yelped to find  a good nearby place to eat and up popped the Sonora Mesquite Grill.
At first we thought, 'oh, this is a little too small', but decided to pull some tables together and go for it.
We are glad we did.
The lady who apparently is the owner?? took our orders and served our food and may have even cooked it up in the back. I'm not sure.
The 3 salsas were so fresh and tasty...they just blew us away. Lots of cilantro and lime. Yum.
Two of us ordered the Veggie Burrito and it came piping hot and was delicious.
My partner had the same thing only in the bowl style. Our other friend ordered a taco and enjoyed it very much.
When the lady who served us found out we were from Tucson, we told her we'd found out about her restaurant from YELP. She asked to see the reviews on my Droid and was thrilled to see so many people enjoy eating here.
Yes, it's small. And yes, you will wait a tad longer than other places to get your food but it is worth it.
