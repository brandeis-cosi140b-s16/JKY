the first time i went here was back in january when queen creek was having that week of crazy weather. went there for dinner with my boyfriend and his mom and the place was kinda crowded but we got seated really fast. the mariachi guy was walking around which was very interesting. for some reason it must have been an off night because our food was ok, and the credit card machine was down so all credit/debit transactions had to be ran through by hand.

however...i was just there last sunday again with my boyfriend, his mom, and some more of his family and it wasn't that packed yet we prob waited like 45 mins, which i guess isn't too bad, but we were all very hungry. our waitress only came to check on us a few times. the food server guy and the chip guy came to check on us more than she did. but....the food this time was much better!! except for the fact that my boyfriends brother was getting pissed off because he wanted steak and they didnt have steak, then he wanted chicken enchiladas and they were out of the shredded chicken so he wasnt too happy. but the rest of us were! and my boyfriend and i got margaritas and they were good too! definitely will be back for sure!
