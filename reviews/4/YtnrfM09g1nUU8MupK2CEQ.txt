ok, i will admit, i was HUGELY skeptical of this place. it had everything going against it...a pilot concept for a chain? no. 'upscale' (read: yuppie) mexican food in a neighborhood that already has a lot of traditional mexican food? no. brand new strip mall that the neighbors i talk to all didnt want? no.

but we finally caved last night and, uh, its very good. beautiful space, great service and selection, everything we had was DELICIOUS. even the salsa spread (regular red, slightly smoked, pureed jalapeno and habanero) they bring you to start is unique and fantastic. my wife and i tried nearly all of the taco selections, all worth it. its not 'real' mexican food in the purist-lingo, but it is damn good.

only complaints: a bit on the pricey side for the quantity you get, the fresh tortillas can apparently be a bit hit or miss as a few were slightly under done and too chewy. everything else was great
