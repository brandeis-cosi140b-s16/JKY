I must say that I am quite surprised by the lack of superior ratings given to Macayo's on this site.

I live literally right next to Macayo's and had never been there in my three years as a Tempe resident. When I heard through a friend that Macayo's was more than some college bar that is known for more than bar foods, I had to give it a shot.

The service was VERY friendly and efficient. Both my girlfriend's meal and mine was delivered in a very timely fashion. Not only that, but I was more than happy with the quality of the meal. The only reason I didn't feel that I could give this a full 5/5 was because the portion's weren't up to my standards. If I pay $12.95 for a burrito, I fully expect that I will be full. Given that the burrito I ordered was fit with two sides and extra meat, I was surprised when a Lean Pocket-sized entree came before me. However, it was delicious and I can't really complain too much.

I particularly liked the decor in the restaurant. Although the main part is quite difficult to access due to the gargantuan bar in the front, it's a very comfortable, friendly environment.

I'm definitely coming here again soon.
