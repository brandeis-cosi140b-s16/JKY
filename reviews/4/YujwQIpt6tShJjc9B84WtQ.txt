We came here on a whim and it was surprisingly tasty! My husband had some kind of shrimp tacos with bacon (it was good, I don't think you can go wrong with shrimp and bacon) and I had the beer-battered fish tacos with avocado and corn and some kind of tasty sauce. I thoroughly enjoyed everything except maybe the rice, but the chips and variety of salsa were really good! After checking the nutritional info, I feel slightly scandalized, but not so scandalized that I won't go back, haha.
