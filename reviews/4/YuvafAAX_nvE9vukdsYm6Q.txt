Best friend and I went to Salazar Brothers for lunch today; it is one of our fav lunch time places. I haven't been in awhile and am glad we chose this place today. I ordered the #20 which was a carne asada burrito with beans and rice, now I'm not a huge fan on refried beans, but today the beans were great! The burrito was packed with meat, guacamole & Pico de Gallo, very flavorful and yummy! Best friend ordered 2 asada tacos & cheese quesadilla with jalapenos. If you're a fan of really hot sauce that scorches your tongue then they might leave you lacking in the heat, but their red hot sauce is favorable and not tomato saucy like some places it's just missing the heat.    Great food for lunch at a reasonable price!
