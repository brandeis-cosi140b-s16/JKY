Nice atmosphere a little loud when talking with others. Ordered fajitas enough for two! I was only given 3 tortillas. Portion size was great for the price. Also ordered a beerrita and really wasn't that great instead of a half bottle it gave me a full bottle and less margarita.Waitress was nice and came by often to check on her tables. All and all nice place at a historical train depot
