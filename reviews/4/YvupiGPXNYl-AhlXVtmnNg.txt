Cheap. Delicious. Tacos. Need I say more? Yes? Ok....you need to get the carne asada first. A delicious marinated steak taco covered with guacamole, salsa, and onions for 2 bucks filled with all the yummy grilled flavor you want from a steak. Or get the lingua taco. The most tender meat you'll get in a taco form. Don't tell your friends what it is (beef tongue) and they won't know the difference! Or get the tripe taco. They must char the meat before they put it on the tortilla because the tender meat had crispy bits of yummy on it. That's my favorite part. I got those three tacos and a water for less than 9 bucks...a huge deal considering I'm eating on the strip!
