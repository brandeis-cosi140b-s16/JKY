What to say about this place? Great food, great service and the location is great if you like to hike North Mountain a lot :-)

I'm no expert with Tortas but this place has some amazing ones which will fill you up with lunch and dinner! Being a long time fan of Travel Channel's "Man vs Food" I've been meaning to try this place for some time now. Glad I did. Sure you will too.
