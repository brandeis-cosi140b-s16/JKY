I agree with the first reviewer that the appearance of this place may turn some people away, but that is all the better for you because you will get a table faster.  If you go on the weekends prepare to wait 20-40 minutes, but it is indeed worth it.

The food is very good and the service is hit or miss but what impressed me most is the wide selection of Vegetarian dishes.  I am not vegetarian but some of my friends are and sometimes I just feel like eating something lighter.  They have a great selection of grilled veggie filled burritos.  You can also get sides of grilled veggies like asparagus, zucchini and carrots.  Be sure to try the grilled carrots.

The parking sucks,  the servers are sometimes not nice and the place sort of looks like something in a bad dream featuring Antonio Banderas and a mariachi band,  but the food will keep you coming back.
