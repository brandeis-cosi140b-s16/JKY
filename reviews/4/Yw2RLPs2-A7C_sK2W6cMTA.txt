A lot of goodness in this little building!

The Stand has become one of my favorite spots for burgers and fries.  Yes, they do make other things, but I have yet to venture any further down the menu board.  Yet.

The building is small, but the space is used efficiently with both indoor and outside seating.  The staff is friendly and enthusiastic - they seem to genuinely like working there, and keep things running quickly.

I am hooked on The Standard (with cheese, of course) - a juicy, cheesy creation of beauty pillowed within a fresh egg bun.  I choose to have mine without onions or tomato, keeping the fresh crisp lettuce and crunchy pickles.  Just the right amount of sauce rounds out this treat of a burger.  

What is a burger without fries?  The Standard's fresh-cut fries are fantastic.  Not at all greasy, the portion is more than enough to share.  Well, unless you are me, and greedily hoard them all for myself.  Get your own.
