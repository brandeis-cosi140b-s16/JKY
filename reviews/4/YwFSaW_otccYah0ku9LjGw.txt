Hadn't been here in a long time, so tried it again last night.  We were pleasantly surprised that the food was still as good as we had remembered.  While there was a short wait for a table and the hostess was somewhat unaccommodating, the service was otherwise fine.  We like their salsa and chips, and everything we ordered was well prepared and appetizing.  Will definitely return now that we have tried it again.
