The Mission is a great all around restaurant with great decor and really great food. Of course the Guacamole is incredible and everything else was tasty, though the portions are on the smaller side, it's worth the experience to go there.. The  real stand out for me was our waiter, JAMAR!! What a great worker and kind spirit. He really made our 2 hour dinning experience worth the restaurant. If you eat at the Mission ask to be seated at Jamar's section, he knows the menu well and gave us great recommendations and if I owned a restaurant I would love to have him on board helping the ship. Yummy food, even better service! Go Jamar!
