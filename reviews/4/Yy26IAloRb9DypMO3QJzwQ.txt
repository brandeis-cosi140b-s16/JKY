I do understand other reviewers that they don't have much of a menu, I have to say that their Supreme Quesadilla is good!   I also recommend their chicken rolled tacos, they are flour, crispy and come with guacamole, for the price you pay , come on people... this is no steak house!  So on average I would say MUCH BETTER than Filiberto's across the way!.
