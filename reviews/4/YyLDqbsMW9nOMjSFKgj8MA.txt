I hate that I loved this place!
After an afternoon of hiding from the heat in the Arrowhead mall, Ashley M. and I attempted several other chains in Arrowhead/83rd ave area that all had long lines outside before we came across Ajo Al's.  We walked in to the huge restaurant and were seated right away.  I loved the high ceilings and silly stereotypical Mexican decor.  Sombrero anyone?  We were then given the essential salsa and fresh tortilla chips (another reason I have a love/hate relationship with this place...) which just seemed to scream my name once they hit the table.

I ordered the Salad Carbon-Marinated grilled chicken grilled up and then layered over fresh salad greens and veggies with an avocado slice. Topped with fresh onions and shredded cheese and served with Jalapeno-ranch dressing on the side.  As a salad connoisseur, I was expecting far less than the deliciousness which appeared before me.  The chicken was absolutely delicious and went great with the whole salad!  I was very pleased!

1 star removed for being a chain, and for not removing the calories from the tortilla chips.
