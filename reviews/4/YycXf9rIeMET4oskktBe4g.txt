I love love love Arriba. Their happy hour is the best. They're margaritas are magnificent. On the rocks, extra salt, please!

I'm also slightly obsessed with the White Sands Chimichanga. Delish!

Service however is slightly disappointing. The servers are either not there or too in your face. There needs to be a balance, people!
