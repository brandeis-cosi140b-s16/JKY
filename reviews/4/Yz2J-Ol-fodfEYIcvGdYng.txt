To conclude our day date on Sunday, after we left Fox Cigar Bar we went to Cantina Laredo for an early dinner.  I had eaten at the Scottsdale location twice last year for lunch and enjoyed it then, so I thought I would take the husband to the Gilbert location and see what happy hour and dinner was like.  

We were greeted right away by a manager type and he seated us and said our server, I believe her name was Jackie, would be right with us, and she was.  She showed us the HH menu and we opted for the $5 marg.  They also have $3 HH margs, but we're no pansies and wanted the bigger one.  We also ordered some chicken taquitos that are on the HH menu.  We got 6 for $3.49.  I thought that was a great deal.   They were flavorful with a nice crunch and the chicken was very tender.  In fact, I'm going to daydream about those for a minute.

Then we decided to share the Asada Y Camarones which is, to quote the menu:  grilled steak topped with bacon-wrapped shrimp filled with oaxaca cheese and jalapeno.  For $23.99 it was a great price and portion to share.  We each felt like we had a full dinner.  The steak was tender with a little pink inside, just like we like it, and those bacon-wrapped shrimp were heavenly.  They had a smoky flavor already and then the bacon on top of that....well, bacon makes everything better.  Our dinner came with some rice and sauteed squash.  Both nice and light.  

How could I forget the chips and salsa?  I love that they bring you two salsas and one is more fire-roasted tasting and a little spicier.  Like them both a lot.  I ended up putting the smoky, spicier one on those taquitos and was in my own little heaven.     
Jackie was very attentive and overall we had a great experience and look forward to going back.
