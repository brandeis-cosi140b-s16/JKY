I always come here for breakfast and order either the omelette or an egg & cheese burro. 
It's not a fancy place, but the service is warm, the portions are huge and it's not going to mess up your budget.
It's very inexpensive. $5 for a home style  omellette breakfast combo or the $3 egg & cheese burro. Both comes with complimentary chips and hot sauce.
Definitely a nice clean, friendly Mexican joint, where the food is more important than the decor.
