I LOVE Chipotle's food and it's consistent at many locations, so when I stopped for lunch, they didn't disappoint. 

I got a sofritas bowl (braised tofu and mildly spicy sauce) with pico de gallo and guacamole. It was prepared quickly and I didn't have to wait very long in line (despite the fact that it was out the door). 

I'm taking one star off for the noticeable difference in portion size compared to other locations. I got a laughable portion of black beans and not much rice. 

Friendly service across the board and it was very clean.

This location has margaritas! I MUST go back. :D
