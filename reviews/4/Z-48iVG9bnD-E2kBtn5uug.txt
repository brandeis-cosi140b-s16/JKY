No freezers, no can openers, or microwaves- this is probably my favorite fast casual Mexican restaurant. I've had the tacos (fish tacos are good), the fajitas (the chicken fajitas are very good), and a few of the burritos, but my favorite menu item is the Diablo Shrimp Burrito- shrimp, black beans, rice, jack cheese and spicy sauce. I got my husband hooked on it, except he has the sauce on the side.

I was curious about the langostino lobster burrito so I got it this past weekend. It was not good; too much rice, I mean, overstuffed with rice. I don't like too much rice in my burrito.

I'm giving high marks for the following: good service, fresh food, free drink refills, clean restaurant, and your choice of salsa (sad about discontinuing the mango salsa but the pineapple salsa is a nice alternative- a bit spicy but I like the kick). I almost forgot to mention that it's reasonable. Also available is covered outdoor seating. They do large orders- Party Packs. Do some shopping while you're in the area- Target, Buffalo Exchange, Albertson's, TJ Maxx, and Toys R Us.
