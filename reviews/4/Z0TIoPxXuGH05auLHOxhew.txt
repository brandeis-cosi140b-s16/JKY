I was a little unsure of this place and the chinese/mexican fusion combo made me ask why???.  When I visted their website and saw that it is a Chef Jose Andreas establishment I figured it must be amazing so I said what the hell and made a reservation. I am a mexican food lover so I stuck with things on the Miexican portion of the menu, a few different tacos(barbacoa and carnitas) both of which were amazing, the beef just melts in your mouth it is so tender. I also ordered some queso fundido and some papas fritas to share with the table.  One of the people in my party went the Chinese route and ordered the 20 vegetable fried rice, I tried a few bites and it was amazing, and could be a meal in itself. I will go back and next time I will order the fried rice for myself. 

Prices were actually low in my opinion, not cheap but I would have paid more for the quality of food.  Rreat value for the quality of food and location inside of the Cosmopolitan. All in all I would recommend China Poblano to anyone visiting Vegas.
