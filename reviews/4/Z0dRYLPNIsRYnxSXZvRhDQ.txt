Great place to eat a family lunch on the weekends. Food was very tasty and a wide enough menu for some very different tastes. Cast and very friendly service. Table was clean and the servers don't hover as you eat manufacturing a tip. A little weird that the bathroom is shared with other building tenants and in a back common hallway but not so weird that we won't be back. Great price, i have a family of four, with two hungry boys and the meals were less than $30 for all of us. Great food for a very good price.
