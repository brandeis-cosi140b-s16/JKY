If you're Mexican and looking for a junk food fix this is the place to go! I love their chamoyadas but they always leave my mouth feeling like it is on fire. The sopes and tacos are good too (but not authentic). Minus one star because the women were yelling at each other with vulgar language and their are usually children here.
