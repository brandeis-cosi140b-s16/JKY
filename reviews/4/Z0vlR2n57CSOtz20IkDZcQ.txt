If you like FRESH seafood and also enjoy spending very little such as $25 for TWO DINNERS this might be a place for you! 

Small converted older Phoenix Ranch style house converted into a cheerful Seafood Restaurant that had live music when we were there, located among a row of row of other Mexican Restaurants. (that were rougher looking)

We had the spicy marinated fish and the diablo shrimp.

The Marinated Fish had essence of vegetable threw it and was cooked to perfection being very light moist but not falling apart also skinless , lacking fish taste meaning being sweet and fresh instead . The fish was topped with a spicy red sauce that was a perfect spice heat and topped with fancy cut lightly cooked celery for texture . This dish came with salad garnish , beans , rice , tortillas and the fish was elevated up on the plate by the use of fries .

The diablo shrimp come with a similar set up but are topped with onions and the spice heat is more of a challenging 10 out of 10 instead of the expected heat of 7ish . (this dish had good flavor but is not for everyone)

at the time of this review this is a cash only establishment but a sign is posted that they will except credit cards soon .

We were Five Stars satisfied with meals and service , we'd return .
