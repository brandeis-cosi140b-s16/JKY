Food is decent. My only complaint are the chips. You receive a small basket of chips and a very small ceramic container of salsa. I would guess there is about 1/4 cup of salsa at best. Every time you ask for more, they charge $1. If you feel like you need to have portion control, how about putting endless chips and salsa on the menu like other restaurants do (Chili's, The Islands Burger Restaurant... etc).
