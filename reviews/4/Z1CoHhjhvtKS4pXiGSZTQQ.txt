Love it! The shrimp burritos are the best I've ever had. Also, the chicken tortilla soup is to die for. Pentiful baskets of thin/crispy chips and good but, not to hot, salsa are on your table immediately. (you can ask for hotter if you need to)

Outdoor tables-however are in a parking lot area.

Heard the atmosphere is better at the other Salsa's location on Carmel Road but, haven't made it there yet.
