Two words: Chambord Margarita

I used to not even like margarita's, Z Tejas changed my outlook on tequila.  

The food is great too.  My usual favorites are the shrimp & guac tostada bites to start then move on to the artichoke chicken stack for dinner, and cornbread of course.  I've also tried the smoked chicken enchiladas and loved em.  Sunday morning brunch I have to have my egg hash...and a margarita :)
