For those unfamiliar with tortas, they are the quintessential Mexican sandwich. Tortas Paquime is a place to get these wonderful sandwiches. It is also a bakery and a place to get Mexican refreshments and ice cream. 

The restaurant is clean, and appears to be well maintained. The service is quick and efficient any employees appear to know what they're doing. 

I ordered the torta paquime, the restaurant is named after it so... It was pretty good, but I think I'll try something different next time.  It appeared to be some type of pork that was cooked beforehand and serve in kind of like a cold salad . It was roughly diced and put between 2 soft pieces of bread with tomato avocado and possibly mayonnaise. Not exactly something I would normally order but good nonetheless. I also ordered a vegetarian tostada, to try something more familiar, and it was excellent. I also had the soup of the day, which was like tortilla soup without the tortillas--very good. I would return just for the soup alone.. I wouldn't want my lack of knowledge regarding tortas to cloud my review. I will be back to try more items.
