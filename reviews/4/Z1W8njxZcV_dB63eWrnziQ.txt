This place is the real deal when it comes to yummy Mexican food!  The server is always friendly, if a little bit shy.  And, the Mexican MTV on the TV just adds to the overall ambience.  The real star here is the food.  The guacamole is excellent, and all versions of the enchiladas I've tried are as well.  Breakfast is wonderful here, especially if you've had a night of it and need something to help you break through the fuzz.  This is not a fancy place, but it is great for a casual get-together with friends who enjoy good, fresh Mexican food.
