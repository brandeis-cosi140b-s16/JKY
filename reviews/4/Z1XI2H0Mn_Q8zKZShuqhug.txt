Now here's Gilbert's best kept secret. I have driven by this building for years. It looks like a ran down building that you think is closed. But, tonight my wife and I decided we would give it a try. 

We were very surprised when we walked in. It's bright, clean, and edges on pretty. It was 180 degrees from the "run down building" we were expecting. The hostess, who was well dressed (I thought I was under dressed for a few minutes!) gave us a friendly greeting and thanked us for coming in. All the staff was just as friendly. 

The salsa was very yummy. 

The Guac, though was good, seemed a little over priced - I probably would stick with the yummy salsa next time. 

My wife had a simple combo with an enchilada and a taco. Very yummy. I had the Ultimate Burrito; it was okay in that it had an okay taste. The ingredients looked great (Chicken, grilled onions, carrot slices, green sauce), but, it didn't necessarily wow me (don't get me wrong - it was still tasty). All the food was well presented, hot (temp wise) and had a good taste. My recommendation - go for one of there more unique dishes. I think we would have been very wow'ed if we had done that. But, we were tired from a long work day and didn't have our brain's completely in gear. 

All in all; we are sure glad we finally stopped. We will be back.
