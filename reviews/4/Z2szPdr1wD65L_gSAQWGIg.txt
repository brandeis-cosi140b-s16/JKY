Filibertos is my default if I do not have cash for Rodibertos on Union Hills or just need a burrito ASAP. 

I like most of the things I eat here. Carne Asada, Green Chili, Chicken Asada, beans, rice, all except the beef tacos. They are always over cooked or not enough filling. 

Everything else about this place is good. Clean, Quick, Nice. 

Just check your order before leaving the drive through.
