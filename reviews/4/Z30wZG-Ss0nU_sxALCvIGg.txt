I had the shrimp burrito this evening and it was top notch. My first time here, so I ordered a few items just to see. Their salsa was fresh and the portion sizes were generous. I also ordered the 2 soft taco combination with carnitas and carne asada. Both soft tacos were excellent. The staff was friendly and I was more than happy with my food. I will definitely be returning for more now that I'm hooked on the shrimp burrito!
