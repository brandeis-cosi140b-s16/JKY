If this review was based solely on their food then they would get 5 stars easily. Their tacos are the only items I have had here and I must say they are delish! The meat is very succulent, the tortilla is just right, and the sauces are not too in your face if you know what I mean. The cooks work very hard and prepare your food right in front of you which is a huge plus, so tip them if you can afford it. The problem is the area, it's extremely hot, it feels like you're on the surface of planet mercury and the air conditioning in the joint is inadequate. I saw the poor cooks sweating balls, the owner should provide additional air conditioning units for them. Other than all that this place is really good, if you happen to be in the Las Vegas area please give this place a try.
