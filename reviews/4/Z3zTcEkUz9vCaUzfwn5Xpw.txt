Yes, the ambiance is pretty drab and the menu is what you'd likely get at any other Mexican-American dive but it does have a somewhat unique charm and the food is pretty solid.  The family that runs it has a great track record and the consistent crowds are a good testament to its place within the Phoenix culinary community.
