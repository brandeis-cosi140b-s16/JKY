America's has always had a consistent and delicious bean&cheese burrito.  Its not the size of something you would find at Bertos, but its waaay better quality. They only have one other vegetarian entree - a veggie quesadilla.  I do wish they had more veg options and all of their specials seemed to be geared towards their meat eaters.

I think their refried beans and tortillas are heavenly!  The flan is homemade any yummy, too!

It drives me bonkers that they are so dang stingy with their salsa! They make me feel like they are doing me a super-exclusive favor if I ask for extra.
