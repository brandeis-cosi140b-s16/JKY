Came to lunch with my sister! After reading so many good reviews, decided to give it try! Amazing service by Jose E. And Antonio H. Amazing food! It you have a big appetite this is a must! Big portions! I had the #35 Wet Burrito (Lengua or Tongue) and My sister had the #1 Chicken Breast with a Cactus Salad!
