Slow service, but excellent food.  I came with a group of friends on a Sunday and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of Mundo.  The menu had plenty of options for meat lovers and vegetarians alike and the quality of the food was really good.  What knocked down my review was the slow service and the long, long amount of time that we had to wait for our food and drinks.  But overall, we enjoyed ourselves and the experience.  If you were looking for a quality restaurant off the Strip and beaten path, Mundo is for you.
