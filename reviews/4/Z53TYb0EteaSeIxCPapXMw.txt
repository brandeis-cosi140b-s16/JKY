Tex Tubb's has an Austin vibe, with Willie Nelson for President posters and George Jones 8-tracks as decor.  The food is rather good, if not spectacular.  I'm a fan of the mushroom tacos (traditional style on corn tortillas) and two-dollar Shiners during happy hour from 4pm - 6pm.  It's a cozy place to go for a change of scene, and pretty dead-on for Austin-style Tex-Mex.
