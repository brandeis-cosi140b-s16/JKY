It may look teeny tiny and kind of grungy from the outside, but Que Mas Mexican Cafe drastically improves once you're seated inside the restaurant. I came here on a weekday for a lunch date with my husband. After promptly being seated, we were presented with warm chips and a generous helping of salsa. 

While looking at the menus, we realized that the pricing was different between our two menus. Looks like Que Mas is in need of a menu overhaul! You gotta be consistent with pricing, guys. 

I'll just get to the food...

SIZZLING ENCHILADAS ($14.95): These enchiladas were super sizzling! The sauce on top of the enchiladas was not my favorite. It reminded me of Velveeta sauce. The cheese inside the enchilada though, was tasty. The enchiladas were accompanied by refried beans, rice, and a spoonful of sour cream and guacamole. Overall I enjoyed my entree, although I wouldn't order it again.   

HORCHATA ($2.50): According to my husband, this was the best horchata he's ever had. But what does he know? He's a Wedo lol. In all seriousness, Que Mas was indeed serving up some pretty awesome horchata. It wasn't milky thick and was heavy on the sweet side. And yes, you get refills on the horchata. Yay! 

CHURROS ($4.50?): Horrendous. These were the worst churros I've ever had. They tasted stale and as if they'd been fried in leftover grease used for other entrees. The sugar/cinnamon wasn't even sticking to the churros. Do NOT order the flippin churros. 

SERVICE: Great, from beginning to end. The servers were friendly, attentive and checked up on us often. 
PRO TIP: There's a restaurant.com certificate for $25 for $50, although I would only recommend it for parties of 4+. We had a really hard time getting to that threshold.  

Aside from the churros, everything was great! Return visit? You know it!

Random fact: They just started serving Hofbrauhaus Hefe Weizen ($5). Being attached to a bar has its perks!
