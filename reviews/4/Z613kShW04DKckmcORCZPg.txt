I am a fan because of the Bufflo Fried Oyster appetizers.  My Fiance and I were beyond happy with them.  The texture was perfect and the fresh blue cheese that was sprinkled over it made it delicious.

Of course the margaritas are a bargain, specially with the extra shot for $1 dollar.  

My fiance had the steak and shrimp fajitas, he thought they were so so, I liked eating up .all his extra onions!

I had the shrimp tacos, which I thought was well executed.   The spices and tenderness were spot on.
