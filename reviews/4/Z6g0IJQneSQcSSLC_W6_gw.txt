I have a thing for chain restaurants, and I LOVE Mad Mex!

I live in Bloomfield so I frequent the Shadyside location. 

This is a great spot for happy hour!  I think the wings are half off--but I don't eat wings so I'm not sure.

They have a pretty impressive beer selection and their maragritas are good too.

I highly recommend the fish tacos.  SO, so, so good.  Get the grilled kind, not the fried.  I seriously have to have them at least once a month.  Maybe more.

This place gets crowded on a weekend but you can wait in the bar and honestly, if a large restaurant is dead on a friday or saturday night would you really want to eat there?  They always say the wait is "20-40 minutes" but its always closer to 20.

The service is generally pretty good.  I've been eating at Mad Mex for about 10 years and there was only one time I had an issue with the service and it was years ago.  They've won me back over!

The food is consistent, the service is good, the menu is diverse enough to please everyone, and the vibe of the restaurant is cool.

The only thing I don't like/recommend:  do not get that pineapple salsa.  It is sooo freaking spicy!  You won't be happy!
