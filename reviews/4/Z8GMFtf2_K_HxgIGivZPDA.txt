Cafe Rumba/Bajio/Chipotle/ etc

They are all about the same type of place. Menu on the wall, lunch counter style ordering, throw everything in a burrito. 

I have to say it was good. I had the small burrito with shredded beef, chipolte bbq sauce, beans, cheese and sour cream. Served with chips and salsa and little cinnamon frys and  a drink. 

The burrito was big enough without being too big, had good flavor and the tortilla was fresh tasting. The chips were salty and the salsa was glorified tomato sauce. LOL I guess I could have asked for a hotter one. 

The place was clean and the staff was nice. I have a BOGO coupon from the entertainment book. I will be sure to use it.
