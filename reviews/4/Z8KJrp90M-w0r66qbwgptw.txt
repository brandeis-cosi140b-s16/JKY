First off, I haven't done any reviews in quite some time, so forgive me for being a slacker.  But I went to El Norteno today after a long time (about 2 years) and was thrilled to see it still cranking out the best red chile I've tasted anywhere.  Yes, Matt K, I read your review and you panned it pretty good.  Tortillas not as good as Taco Bell.  Ok Matt, you could NOT have tried the red chile burrito.  This assertively spiced, hearty concoction absolutely tantalizes the taste buds.  It is a bit hot but not painfully so... but the flavor washes over you like waves on the Huatulco beaches.  Grab a side of creamy, smooth refried beans and some of their red salsa (redolent with the smoky flavor of Mexican cumin) and you will be hooked.  As far as the "atmosphere" goes, I'm not a big fan of the outdoor dining this time of year (August) so I get it to go.  But I've eaten there in November and it's fine.  

Mexican food lovers, Carolina's lovers, TRY THIS PLACE.  You like hole in the wall Mexican, this roadside gem delivers big flavors at little prices.  Matt K can have his Taco Bell.  I'll take El Norteno.
