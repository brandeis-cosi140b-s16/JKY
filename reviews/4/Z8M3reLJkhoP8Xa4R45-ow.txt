A little dive-y and the service can be slow, but the food is delicious. The first time I came here, it was about closing time, but they managed to whip me up a huge (special order, since I don't eat rice) burrito. I was drunk, no longer hungry, and very happy. 

On my second trip, I headed over for lunch and enjoyed their enchiladas while my husband got the fajitas. Yum and yum. 

Third trip was with my British mother-in-law. The Brits aren't terribly familiar with margaritas, so she had never had one outside the bucket style mix. This one knocked her socks off. I tried a ginormous Dominican sandwich and she had... something delicious, I don't really remember. Extra chips & guac all around. 

Now, I want to go back. My husband has beef bourguignon braising right now and all I want to do is run off with my Mexican lover, Three Amigos. I dream of refried beans.
