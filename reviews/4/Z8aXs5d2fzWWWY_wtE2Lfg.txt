Had a great experience tonight even though it was rocky at first with a switch in server. Food took a while but they got busy pretty quick! It was delicious and good as always. Kristen took care of us after our first waiter did not come back and she did a great job! Attentive and great people skills. Thank you. We always continue to come back.
