Stopped in for the first time tonight... Iv passed this place many times and they always seem really busy. Nice clean little restaurant.. Staff was friendly.. We ordered the Super Nachos ... Definitely a good choice... Lots of meat just like my husband likes. We also ordered 2 soft tacos and 2 hard... Unfortunately when we got home we noticed we did not receive the 2 hard shell tacos.. But the soft shell were good. Had to grab a few Chiro's before we left.. The Oreo was a nice treat at the end of our dinner ...good prices... Everything we received was delicious and fresh... We will return again
