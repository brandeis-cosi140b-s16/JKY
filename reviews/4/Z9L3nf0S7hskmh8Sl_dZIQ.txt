Big place, good food, and not expensive. They have a special menu that has 10 items for $4.99 and you better believe it that they're good! I had the Verde Burrito, soooooo good. It was the right fatty kinda pork that iI expect from a mexican restaurant, it wasn't dry like chevy's or any of the other main stream mexican food places. 

Our waitress was nice always refilling our drinks. The parking lot is huge, so no worries there, and the best part.... open 24 hours :D So this is totally going to be the late night, out of the office, really really hungry but don't want to spend a days perdiem on one meal kinda place.

Come by and enjoy their super burrito and their signature margarita!
