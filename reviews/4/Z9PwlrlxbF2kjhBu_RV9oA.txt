I was always skeptical of this place, but was pleasantly surprised today.  We checked it out for lunch and ate at the bar, so we could watch college football.  The atmosphere is nothing special, but the service and food were great!  Our server was very friendly and extremely efficient.  The food was actually very good.  I enjoyed enchiladas with beans and rice and was very pleased with my choice.
