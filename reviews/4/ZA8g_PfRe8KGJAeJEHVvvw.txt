I went there yesterday and enjoyed the yummy special they had going on, tacos for $2 and deals on margaritas. It's a great spot if you're walking around and have a pet because they allow animals on their patio. The drinks were yummy and it was fun to people watch. The only concern was the server forgot about us towards the end and we had to ask the hostess twice to find her.
