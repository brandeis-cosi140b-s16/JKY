Finally!!  A decent Mexican restaurant!  We have been searching for a place that had flavor and spiciness.  We have found it.  

Before you order a big plate of food, there is a Salsa Bar that has 8 different salsas!  They range from a few milds up to the hot hot salsa (which is for my husband!) On the salsa bar is also bean dip.  We were so delighted with this!  

Since it was our first time here, we only started with an appetizer not knowing if we would still be hungry for a meal.  We ordered the Beach Party Platter which included quesadillas, steak nachos, wings, chicken taquitos and chili con queso.   This was absolutely filling and delicious! After all of this food, we couldn't possibly order a meal.  

Bonus~ Their strawberry margaritas are big and only $6! Sweet and Strong! 

i only wish they were open for lunch.  Their hours are 5-11.  I would have given 5 stars.  Maybe I should petition for lunch!  I would definitely recommend going to the Sunset Station Cabo Restaurant.  Even if it's just for the salsa bar, you wont be disappointed!
