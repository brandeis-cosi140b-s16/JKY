Just found this place a couple months ago and it is becoming a regular for us.  Great food, area of town and service.  I can only say that the taco salad is delicious because that's all I get.  The food my family orders looks as good as mine.  Sometimes there is a little bit of a wait which only testifies to the great meal they serve.  Tonight though, no wait at all.  Just an all around nice restaurant with great food at a reasonable price.
