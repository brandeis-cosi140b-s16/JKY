Great authentic Mexican food at a very affordable price.  This place is almost always packed and you can call in orders and eat in or take-out.  

My personal favorite dish is the #13 combo, a chimichanga with carnitas.  The California burrito and enchilada combo are also very good.

Take the negative review with a grain of salt.  I eaten her dozens of times and it's always delicious.

Despite what some of reviews say, this place is NOT Filibertos or associated with that chain in any way.

My only gripe is that they serve almost everything on styrofoam.
