Ok, I know, its a chain, but I gotta give kudos to these guys for at least putting out a better product than Taco Bell. Yes, I said it, Del Taco has the edge in the fast food taco chain competition. Go ahead, shake your head at me. But once I start spewing out good points, you'll be shaking your head in agreement once im done.

First off, every DT I know has its drive thru open 24 hours. I dont know how many times these guys have rescued me from a horrible ordeal with the munchies late at night and into the early hours.

As for the food items. Come on. For every new failed product that TB has put out, DT has always had the same quality ingredients and that includes new products as well. Did I mention the shrimp and fish tacos? Carne Asada? Shredded Beef? Carnitas? Hello? Tap, tap, tap. Is this mic on?

I like how if you want the biggest size all you have say is macho! You know, the biggest you can get. Macho Nachos, Macho Burritos, Macho Drinks, Macho Fries, etc. What does TB do? They call their stuff XL, XXL, and XXXL. I have tried a bunch of their so called XXXL stuff. They hardly put any steak or chicken in their items and if im not mistaken, it doesnt even taste like real meat.

Specials? Well DT has 3 tacos for 1.09 on tuesday nights and I think 3 chicken tacos for 2 bucks on thursdays. TB? They got some kind of happy hour thing with some of their stuff for only a dollar. That is probably the only thing that I might mention TB as worthy.

Service? The chances of me getting lousy service at TB are much higher than at DT. This is based off of all trips between both guys.

Heck, even the desserts are way better at DT and im not even gonna go there.

So there you go. Coming from southern California and now living in Las Vegas, Del Taco is the shiz when it comes to the battle of the fast food taco chain war.
