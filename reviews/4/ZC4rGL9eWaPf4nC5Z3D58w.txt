Oh man this place was packed on Monday night at 10 pm.  Tried the buche al pastor spicy pork lengua and qusadilla and were all good.  Tacos were $2 and quesadilla were  $4.  All in all the bill was $80 for 25 tacos n 3 quesadillas with drinks n dessert.  Avoid this place during rush hr unless u have plenty of time to wait for a table and lines.  Call ahead for togo?
