Sylvia's is a delicious family-style Mexican restaurant. My friends and I love to go here and hang out while enjoying their huge portions. I'm a big fan of the refried bean chimichanga. Their flour tortilla chips are REALLY good (and unlimited)! They not-so-recently became a full-wait staff restaurant, too. It's nice to be able to sit down and enjoy yourself without having to jump up for a chip and drink refill every 10 minutes. The restaurant itself is clean and has a nice, authentic flair to it. It has a large outside seating area for when the weather is nice. All around a great place to enjoy some laidback Mexican food with family and friends.
