We have gone here three times now and we all adore this place...which is a huge thing because my 10-year old is very picky about what he eats, but he loves the chicken and we all like the atomosphere.

My husband loves spicy food and is a particular fan of the pork. I love the chicken and adore the side dishes of rice and beans, which are seasoned in a unique way and accompanied with the most delicious (and fattening) hand made tortillas!

We recommend ths place and hope to try more items on the menu.  It was fun the first time we were there because we were able to see our torillas being made right in front of us! :-)

The only thing missing is the ability to make changes...which another diner identified as very frustrating.  It's very hard to get them to accomodate your individual needs.  For the price and the fact that there isn't tableside service, I think it's okay to sub out more beans for no rice.  Don't you?
