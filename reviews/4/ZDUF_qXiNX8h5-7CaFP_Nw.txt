This is a solid fast food burrito bar. The make fresh tortillas to order that is by far the best part about this place. The queso is also very delish! My husband got the steak and I got the chicken and both were very good. If you want spicy I would recommend adding jalape√±os because without it there isn't much spice. I also like how they mix the ingredients up before wrapping up your burrito. It's always annoying to get a big bite of meat or rice with nothing else. 

I do wish they had wheat tortillas or brown rice to help make it a little more healthy. But hey, it is a burrito, right?
