As a life long Phoenix resident/Mexican food fan, this is my favorite place of all time.  It's a tiny, family owned hole in the wall for sure, but I have never had anything here that wasn't above average.  When I take out of town visitors here, they ask to go back on subsequent visits, without fail.
