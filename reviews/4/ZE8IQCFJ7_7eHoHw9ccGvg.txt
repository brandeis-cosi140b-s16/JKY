Check this place out!
Saw the reviews on yelp and decided to check it out. The high rating is well deserved! This is not your standard Mexican cuisine. The flavors are more unique and the presentation is top notch. The dining room is beautiful and they have a full bar. 
We were greeted promptly when we came in. Our server, Jorge, was excellent. Very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly.
My wife and I shared a watermelon salad with toasted pumpkin seeds. My wife had the roasted poblano chicken and I had the tacos de arrechero. Like I said the presentation was top notch. And the food was excellent. My one critique would be it could have been spicier. But the meat was flavorful and moist. 
There's no reason why this place shouldn't be packed all the time.  Give it a try.
