First, let me tell you what this place is NOT.  It's not cheap, although not terribly pricey by Vegas standards. If you want a cheap fast meal, I would recommend grabbing a couple slices at the Pizzaria upstairs.  It's not really Fusion, since most of the dishes are clearly either Mexican or Chinese, with only a couple that successfully fuse the two.  It's also not a fine dining experience you would expect at some of Jose Andres' other restaurants. 

However, we did enjoy excellent service and very tasty and often creative food. The server was very knowledgable about the menu and seemed enthusiastic about the food. Service was very attentive and the manager even stopped by to make sure everything was good. 

They have two nice open kitchens where you can see homemade dim sum made next to handmade tortillas. We mostly tried the Chinese dishes, since we have plenty of good Mexican in LA. The lamb potstickers are juicy, delicious, and beautifully presented.  The 20 vegetable fried rice is probably the best fried rice I have ever had. We also tried the chilaquilles, which were delicious and filling. The tacos seemed pricey at $5 a piece, but we didn't try any. The mango sticky rice was very light and refreshing, but don't expect any actual sticky rice.  Try the "tea for two" for an interesting cocktail. Overall, it was a very good dining experience although not necessarily the best value.
