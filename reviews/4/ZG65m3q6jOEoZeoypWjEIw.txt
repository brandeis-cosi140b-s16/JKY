carlsbad tavern  is a combination Mexican market and hole in the wall take out place which also happens to have 3 small, 2-person tables at the back. During our visit the owner's adorable 4 year old daughter was holding court at one of the tables.

We ordered some nachos and a couple of pollo burritos. The nachos were only half good- the top half. The owner/cook didn't drain one of the nacho components properly so there was a bunch of water at the bottom of the platter, rendering the bottom tortilla chips to mush.

The chicken in the  burrito was under spiced but with the addition of the salsa verde and their zippier chipotle salsa it made the spice level just fine. I also didn't understand the addition of the lettuce in the burrito. If I am not mistaken, isn't an authentic Mexican burrito just the meat and beans and/ or rice? Maybe that is an east coast rendition that I 'm not familiar with.

Overall, a decent place to pick up cheap, fresh food.
