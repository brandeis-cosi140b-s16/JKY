My wife is the one who suggested it and I do not get very excited for new places. When I saw the menu I didn't think there would be anything I would like. I actually had three of their tacos which were pretty awesome. My favorite one was the "weird c word" (can't remember the name) which I highly recommend if you like spicy food. My PBR came in a boot which was pretty awesome. It was a cool atmosphere and the interior was pretty killer. I will definitely go back soon!
