Of course it is difficult to match the "old" Tia Rosa with it location, the food, the ambiance. That being said, the new incarnation on Greenfield is a great compromise.  It has a simplified menu, no waitstaff, and is appropriately small for the area. I assume they are fiscally sound and will not be pushed out (like the "old" Tia Rosa) because of a greedy landlord.  

Now, about the food here.  I had a salmon enchilada and the wife a chicken mole enchilada. Total bill for a party of 2, $17 bucks for a delicious dinner.  Their salsa are really good too. The place was jammed on a Tuesday night and everybody seemed to be happy to be here. The premises were clean. Parking was easy. 

Yes, you have to step up to a counter and take a number.  But, the great food makes up for the inconvenience.  If I want a fancy restaurant I will dress up a little and pay 3 times as much. 

I have earmarked Tia Rosa as a go-to place for a not-so-fancy dinner. 

Four stars is deserved!
