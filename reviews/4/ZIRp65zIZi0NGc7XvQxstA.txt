Didn't even know the World Market had a restaurant open to the public but was pleasantly surprised.  Prices aren't bad for lunch and they have a fairly large selection.  I had the sea bass fish tacos and those were very tasty.  

Hopefully they succeed.  It isn't too evident where they are so I hope they are doing more advertising.
