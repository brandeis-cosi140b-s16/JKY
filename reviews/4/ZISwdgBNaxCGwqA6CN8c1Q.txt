This is the 2 or 3rd rime I ate here.  I liked it with all the crazy tagging, then they half way removed everything. The food is delicious (better than Roberto's), the tables were clean, and they gave me what I wanted- when I wanted it. So my only suggestion to improve is to finish what you started or allow the crazy kids to have fun. 

On this visit it was nice to see that they finally put in all of the tv's. I wish there was sound though.
