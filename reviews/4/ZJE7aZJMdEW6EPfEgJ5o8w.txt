Oddly enough, I was craving a Sonoran Hot Dog last night so I decided to give this place a try. Just as the Yelpers before me stated; to order a dog you go inside and pay then give your ticket to the hot dog cart guy in front, super easy process! The Sonoran Dog was all and more than I could've imagine. I had mine with everything! All of the toppings and condiments seemed to harmoniously work together. If you plan on eating this in the car I recommend getting a fork because the bun can easily tear since it's steamed. It was so good that next time I'll probably get two. For those of you who are worried about this being dive, give it a try I promise you'll like it. Both the cart and the actual restaurant were very clean. Heck the inside even had the menus on flat screen TV's.
