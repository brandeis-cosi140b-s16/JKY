I went with three others and we all shared 2 salads, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. This was a great way to taste about half of their relatively simple menu. I especially liked the Gypsy salad, the shrimp and chorizo, and the achiote salmon. They've done a great job with the build out of the space with a great use of reclaimed wood and some nice AZ design details. Kelly Fletcher came out and checked on us, which was an extra treat. I will be back and I recommend.
