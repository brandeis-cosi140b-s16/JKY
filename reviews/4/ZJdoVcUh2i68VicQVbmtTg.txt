Dude! There is a Los Betos right across the street from the Whiskey! When you're done oogling the girls on Wednesday night, go there and pick up a burrito. They're under $4 and you're so effed up that you will be thinking it is the best damn unicorn burrito you have ever tasted!

But I actually recommend the bacon, egg, and cheese. They messed mine up last night and added chorizo and it was the BOMB! The horchata is also sweeeeeet!!!

P.S. - Don't expect fast service. Do expect a line.
