The carne asada here is always a lot better than what I've had at other taquerias.  I've had the restraint not to order the carne asada fries for quite a while, but they are made perfectly here.  I'm not a decadent dessert kind of guy, so things like carne asada fries are my definition of a guilty indulgence.  If you've never had it, it's basically a pile of crispy french fries covered with nacho toppings.

Not everything else on the menu is quite as good as the carne asada, but I don't think I've ever ordered anything that I disliked.
