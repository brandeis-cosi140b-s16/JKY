I went with my gf and another couple for some late night drinks and salsa dancing (w. a DJ). It was a good time but the dance floor was kind of small. And the music was deafening but besides that we had a good time. Beer was $6 for a budlight which is kind of pricey for the venue. Would go again for dancing. I haven't experienced the live music yet.
