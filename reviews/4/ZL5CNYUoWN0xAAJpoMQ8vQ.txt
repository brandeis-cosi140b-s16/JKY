parking outside is a little annoying, we usually end up driving through the lot 3 or 4 times before finding a parking spot. 
we've only had to wait to be seated once, and it wasn't too bad of a wait; about 15 minutes.
the food is always delicious! the food is the only reason we keep going back because the people inside aren't the best, they usually don't come to offer drinks. they come straight to take the order and we have to order our drink with our food or you won't get a drink at all. then you have to wait to get your drinks until we get our food.
usually the waitress comes back a total of 3 times? take order. drop off order. leave check. 
bottom line -- awesome food.

the mexicana torta with chips instead of a salad is where it's at :) yum.
