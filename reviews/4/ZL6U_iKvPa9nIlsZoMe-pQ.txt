I would give this place 5 stars because I love the chorizo breakfast so much but the service here is not always 5 stars.  If I had one complaint that is what it would be since it is very hit or miss.  I have come to expect bad service and I somehow always come out very pleased (sorry if that sounds bad), but I love the chorizo at this place.  It may be the best I have ever had and it is consistently perfect.  I also love the atmosphere and location.  A perfect morning for me would start at sitting along the windows in front in a booth while eating chips, salsa, chorizo, & coffee? ha ha, yes I drink coffee with my chips and salsa at this place.  I cant help it, I am a fan of Matador and I am sticking to it.  The bar seems cool and I have never been here for dinner but I am sure it is gets busy since it is a very large place.  Also the hot sauce is very good here, it has a nice garlic flavor and spicy just like I love it.  I usually mix it with the regular salsa so my family can share.
