Not only do I love the food here, I'm impressed at Johnny's ability to compete with the big chains.  It's not uncommon for there to be a line out the door at this place during lunch time.  Varied meat choices, great toppings, local produce, and a great bang for the buck are just a few reasons to come here.  
The grande burrito is massive, and a good deal for the price.  The regular sized is nothing to take lightly though.  Although Johnny doesn't provide as many toppings as Moe's, the quality and taste of the meat is comparable, if not better.  It's definitely better than Salsarita's and Qdoba in every way.  

I do wish there was more of an effort to offer some more natural, organic, and whole grain options in the meat, toppings, and tortillas.  Chipotle and Moe's offer this, so if Johnny wants to make sure the new Moe's in the epicentre doesn't steal his business, he may need to adjust his ingredient options a little.

But overall, I love this place and have it on a 1-2 times a month rotation.  I like supporting the small business owner, especially one that can offer a legitimate product that can compete.
