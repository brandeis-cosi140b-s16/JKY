After a few trips here for their soft opening a few months ago, I finally got back for a full meal. Very good IMO! Went here with another couple and started with the tableside guac, which like everyone says, is huge and awesome! Server was a little weird, but fun, and was quick with the drink orders and recommendations. 

Ordered the carne asada tacos and they were good! My only complaint was that the plate had so much going on that I couldn't get through it all and truly dissect the meal. Not a problem though as I didn't have much room left after the trough of guac :). Can't wait to go back!
