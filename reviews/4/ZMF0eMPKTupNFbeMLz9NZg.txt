Ok, this is basically street food.  It isn't fancy. It isn't expensive.  It isn't gourmet.  It is authentic Mexican food...and it is amazing.  Their burritos are just phenomenal...and gigantic!  For 3.50 you can get a 3lb burrito.  It  is excellent.  Learn just enough Spanish to order...and have fun!
