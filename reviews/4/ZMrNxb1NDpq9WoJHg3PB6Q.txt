Ever since I saw this restaurant on the past Yelp Events, I was curious about his place. We came during happy hour and got one of their house margaritas and it was fabulous.  For 5.00 bucks it was well worth  it.  We also tried their pork street tacos and again tasted so yummy.  2 tacos for 4.25 during happy hour.  Having the fried tostada chip was a nice touch and the salsa's were delicious.   I wish I lived closer so take full advantage of their happy hour.  The atmosphere is very inviting and the open bar patio is great when the weather is nice.
