I went here with friends on a Friday night whim.  The wine and food were great and the atmosphere was even better. It is nice to have such a unique place for Phoenix   The ambiance was inviting and cozy.  I would definitely  recommend this place for a romantic evening.  (Be sure to take the elevator down stairs at some point.)
