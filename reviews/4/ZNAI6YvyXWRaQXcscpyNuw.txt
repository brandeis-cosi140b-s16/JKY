My experience here two days ago is most definitely biased because I arrived here after cycling for almost 5 hours in 30mph headwind.  My husband and I decided to do a little bike tour (101 miles on Saturday and 80 miles on Sunday) and it turned out that Sunday was super windy, making what should have been a mellow, easy ride into some sort of sick cycling joke.  Anyway, I think I almost cried tears of joy when we pulled into this Del Taco.  The lady behind the counter was really nice and very interested in our trip, our burritos/fries/veggie bowl/cookies/Cokes (we were really hungry!) were all hot and salted well enough to satisfy our bodies' craving for electrolytes.  Ok, so Del Taco isn't fine dining, but when you're tired, hungry, and demoralized from fighting through stupid wind on your bicycle, comfort fast food does the trick.  (The restroom was clean too, yay!)
