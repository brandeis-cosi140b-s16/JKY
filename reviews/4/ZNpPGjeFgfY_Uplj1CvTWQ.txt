This place just opened up in the old Qdoba on Central Ave. Looks like the menu is still a little limited since they just opened less than a week ago, but what they have so far is great. They have some good variety in flavors with their tacos ranging from the more standard adobo chicken and steak, to teriyaki chicken, and spicy Korean BBQ steak, they even have some vegetarian options. They also have salads and quesadillas, I didn't try either so I can't vouch for them. Talking with the staff, who are super friendly by the way, it sounds like they are working on expanding their options as they go. I hope so, it'll keep me coming back to see what is new.
