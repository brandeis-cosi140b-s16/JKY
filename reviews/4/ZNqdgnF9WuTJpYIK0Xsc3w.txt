I literally stuffed myself like it was my last meal on earth. I think it was because I was massively hungry, but when you have good Mexican food in front of you, it's hard not to shove it in your face. And that I did my friends...

Starting with the ritual of gorging myself with chips and salsa. The chips were freshly baked (not sure if they were house made, but it wasn't tostitos time up in herre) and the salsa had a kick. We also ordered up a side of gauc to compliment said gorging. While I enjoy chunky salsa and gauc more, I thought the salsa was way better. Skip the gauc, it was okay, but nothing special. 

For the main meal I ordered the Shrimp Fajita Salad. It was brought out in what looked like a massively over sized taco shell with all the fixings. Plump shrimp, grilled peppers and onions and enough gauc and sour cream to drown yourself in. I was game. So I ate almost the entire thing, minus the shell, because at that point I was all taco'd out. It was really delicious. If you make somehow make Mexican without flavor, you're doing something wrong. They are doing a-okay here. Side note, I doubt this was by any means a "healthy" salad.

I was a bit surprised to see most of the taco's are chicken and beef only, with no substitution. But there are many many choices in the combo section, so I think every palate will be satisfied. Or just come hungry and eat everything on the menu. That's what I felt like I did. Then I was rolled out of the place...
