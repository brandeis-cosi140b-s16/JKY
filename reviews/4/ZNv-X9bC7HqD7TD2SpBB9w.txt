Here we go again with ridiculously priced guacamole, but it was so good I forgot about the price.  And the jalapeno shooters?  Genius.  I only wish we had ordered a "double barrel" and not a "six shooter."

We only had appetizers on my one visit to Spotted Donkey, but it was enough that I wouldn't mind the drive up to Carefree a second time with the obligatory stay at The Boulders...just in case we shouldn't drive home.
