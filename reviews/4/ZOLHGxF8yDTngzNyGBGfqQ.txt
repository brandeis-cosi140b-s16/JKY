We went for lunch and it was busy, so we sat at the bar. The hostess was friendly and the servers were attentive and efficient. We ordered the burger and tostadas. They were great. The portion ls could've been a little bigger (the fries were skimpy), but we were full. Definitely recommend visiting here if you're looking for a nice meal.
