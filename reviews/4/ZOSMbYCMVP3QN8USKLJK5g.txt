How can you not love a place that serves food with the only option being whether you order the full goat or the half goat?  (Okay, vegetarians and vegans won't be big fans).  So the birrieria only serves goat and lots of it.  Meat, meat, meat.  Goat, goat, goat.

I knew about the goat, goat and only goat menu heading in.  That's what made the idea of the restaurant fun, but no one told me about how delicious the goat is.  I assume they are slow roasting or stewing the meat, because it was so tender and so juicy.  It comes with fresh cilantro and diced onions.  I certainly felt I had overdosed on meat afterwards, but loved every bite.
