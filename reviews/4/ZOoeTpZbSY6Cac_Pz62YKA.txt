Today was the first time I  have eaten here.  The first thing I wonder is why it has two names, Mamacitas and Mamitas...maybe it's a Mexican and Cuban way of saying "little mama"? Anyway, I ordered the Cuban sandwich and asked for platanos verdes instead of the fries. They accommodated my request without extra charge. The Cuban sandwich was delicious!  The plantanos came with a sauteed onion mixture that had lemon juice and garlic, just like my Cuban mother in-law used to make. Everything was very tasty and filling. I want to go back again to try the Cuban tamale and other dishes. BTW, the atmosphere is charming!
